      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the publicity campaign undertaken in recent years by Córas Tráchtála Teoranta for the sale of Irish bloodstock in America was financed by public funds or by the various bloodstock interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only expenditure directly incurred by Córas Tráchtála Teoranta in publicising Irish bloodstock in America in recent years was, firstly, the cost of circulating to 3,000 racing and bloodstock interests the publication <i>Irish Racing and Breeding</i>&mdash;which was supplied free of charge by the Irish Racing Board&mdash;and, secondly, of bringing to Ireland a leading American racing correspondent to report in American papers on our bloodstock industry.  These matters are referred to at greater length in pages 37 and 38 of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta's Annual Report for 1957-58, which has been presented to the House.  The costs involved were small and were met out of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other valuable publicity in the form of many favourable articles on Irish bloodstock in the American Press and racing journals and films, radio comments and television features on the achievements of Irish horses resulted from the general publicity relations <Col N="276" /> activities of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta and was obtained free of charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the British National Coal Board have announced that they have won an order to ship coal to this country throughout this year, and that such imports will react to the disadvantage of Irish coal producers and mineworkers; whether the order has been placed by any State-sponsored body under the aegis of his Department; and what action he proposes to take to protect Irish coal producers and mineworkers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report mentioned in the question but I have no information to what it refers.  Imports of coal during 1958 to the end of October totalled 1,073,000 tons of which 712,000 tons came from Britain.  There is no official control over the importation of coal from any source and it is not proposed to introduce such control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it in the national interest that Irish coalmines, which are producing efficiently and at costings that compare more than favourably with many mines in Britain, should have possibly to close down due to the fact that the National Coal Board is making available coal at a very cheap rate, in other words subsidised British coal, which will force Irish miners to go to work in Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is suggesting a tax upon imported coal.  The Government do not propose that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that.  Does the Minister consider it fair and equitable to give protection to certain small industries which are based on imported raw materials while the producers of a raw material available in this country and of immense benefit, should be now put in the position that they will have to <Col N="277" /> close down, due to competition from a dumped British product?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The bulk of the coal we import would be industrial coal and household coal.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Fintown rural area has been considered for selection by the board on a number of occasions but has not so far been selected as the returns for the area did not compare favourably with those for other areas awaiting development in County Donegal.  The area will be reconsidered by the board in due course and the decision of the board will depend on how the returns then compare with those for other areas awaiting development in County Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>While the position is not precisely as stated in the question, I understand that the county council, by resolution passed in 1954, requested that each member of the council should be supplied with a list of people who were about to be prosecuted by the council for failure to pay their hospital bills.  By virtue of Section 27 of the County Management Act, 1940, this information, by reason of the resolution, must be supplied.</P>

      <P>On sub-section (1) of Section 2 we are proposing to deal with the proposal that Dáil Éireann shall be composed of members who represent constituencies and one member only shall be returned for each constituency.  Various representatives on the Government Benches have asked us to discuss this matter in a realistic way, so that the people will understand what it is all about and will be able to make a clear decision.  Before we get to a clear understanding of what this section, this sub-section means, I should like to clear away some of the irrelevancies which have been thrown on top of this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we turn to the speech of the Minister for Social Welfare on the 16th December last, we find that he ended up his discussion near column 2254, Volume 171.  I want to mention the kind of material, unrelated to this country and to our experiences, which has been thrown on top of this discussion. We have been referred to a book called <i>The Free State</i> by D.W. Brogan, Professor of Political Science in the University of Cambridge; to <i>Modern Democracies</i> by James Bryce, a Belfastman of great learning and political experience; to <i>Between Democracy and Anarchy;</i> to <i>The New Democratic Constitutions of Europe</i> by Miss Headlam-Morley; to <i>Modern Political Constitutions</i> by C.F. Strong; to <i>Representative Government in Ireland</i> by Professor McCracken; to <i>The Government of Switzerland</i> by Dr. William Rappard; and to <i>Germany: From <Col N="287" /> Defeat to Defeat</i> by Karl Spiecker; to <i>Hitler and Beyond</i> by Erich Koch-Weser; to the <i>Spirit of Laws</i> by Montesquieu; and to <i>The Federalist</i> by Hamilton.</P>
    <P>All this has been piled down, with elaborate quotations, on top of our discussion and with the exception of one book&mdash;an important reference in which has been conveniently ignored&mdash;it has no bearing on our experiences here.  Saint Thomas Aquinas has also been mentioned here.  In yesterday's <i>Irish Press</i> an article in Irish by Mairtin Ó Direain on reading, memory and thought reminds us that Saint Thomas Aquinas says that we ought not be &ldquo;leabharlanna beo nó foclóirí siúil&rdquo;&mdash;that is, that we should not be libraries, even though they be living ones, nor dictionaries, even though they may be able to walk.  When we are asked to discuss the realities of the proposal before us we have enough appreciation in our own marrows from our own experiences and in the great, calm clarity of our own minds of what constitutional actions and constitutional set-ups are possible within a very plausible looking Constitution and the effect they are able to have on the ordinary people and on the lives and interests of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>Here we are talking about a Constitution that has set up parliamentary institutions to serve us as a nation. We set them up in difficulties and against odds and we have placed as the two foundation stones on which these institutions are raised, that every adult citizen of 21 years of age and upwards is qualified to be a member of Dáil Éireann, that every adult over 21 years of age is entitled to a vote and that people are entitled to one vote and only one vote.  That is, that every citizen who is entitled to vote will have equality of franchise.  It is on these foundations that the institutions are raised and it is because these are being tampered with that we have had occasion to enter into discussion here.  It is because that situation is confused and because an attempt is being made to misrepresent it that we have had to have so much talk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> I should like to clear away some of the talk.  In order to do so, I want to get back to some of the realities of the present situation.  When Deputy Costello was speaking he drew attention to the book <i>The Indivisible Island</i> and read out the first sentence of chapter 15, headed &ldquo;Gerrymandering.&rdquo; He read the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the greatest wrongs that can be done to a minority in a democratic State is to deprive it of its political rights, particularly of its electoral rights: for these are so often a shield for the rest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the Minister for External Affairs was speaking he appeared to charge Deputy Costello with endeavouring to mislead the House with regard to his quotation and insisted that Deputy Costello dealt only with gerrymandering of constituencies.  The book that he spoke of was referred to in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 2nd June, 1957, shortly after its appearance.  Referring to it, it said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;His fully documented account of how the Six-County minority is deprived of its rights, of how, for the benefit of the Stormont junta, democracy has been extinguished, must be read by every Irishman. And, having been read, it must be broadcast to the outer world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will just scamp these references because what I want is that in the discussion on this matter, we will discuss what arises from the experiences that are beaten into the marrow of our bones since every Party, creed and class were asked, in November, 1913, to come and define the rights and interests of the people of Ireland.  I vamp from pages 261 and 262 of that book.</P>
    <P>The story begun by that quotation which Deputy Costello gave continues to say in the end that no sooner had the Six-County Government settled into office than it set about depriving the Nationalist voters of as much of their electoral strength as could be shorn from them.  The method of election was changed, with the result that when the Bill making these changes was going through the Belfast Parliament in March and April, 1929, many <Col N="289" /> M.P.s gave other examples of how unjust it was to the minority.  William McMullan (Labour) said that P.R. was abolished to deprive Labour of seats in Belfast T. Henderson (Independent Unionist) said the Government had called for an Opposition and &ldquo;when they got it they gerrymandered and abolished P.R. to drive them out.&rdquo;  S. Kyle, Leader of the Labour Party and J. Beattie (Labour) instanced the unfairness of the Bill to working class candidates, who would no longer have even the meagre representation they had secured under P.R.; P. McAllister (Nationalist) predicted that the eventual effect of the Bill must be to bring the Nationalist representation which should be at least 17 down to nine.  George Henderson, the only Liberal in the House, pleaded with the Government not to pass the Bill and J.W. Gyle (Independent Unionist) protested against the Bill, which, he said, destroyed the only real safeguard for minorities.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that the constituencies had been all arranged so that one Party was made secure by the Bill and could not be disturbed.  That happened not only immediately after the Bill was passed but it has happened ever since because to-day it is a normal thing for nearly half the parliamentary seats to be filled without a contest.  In the first election under P.R., every seat had been fought for.  In the first election under this gerrymandering Act, there were 21 unopposed returns, or over 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>At the end of the chapter, the first sentence of which Deputy Costello read out, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The purpose of the measure indicated by Mr. T. Henderson (Independent Unionist) &lsquo;to drive out the Opposition&rsquo; was completely filled.  In 1953 one Socialist Reoublican and two Independent Labour M.P.s were returned for Nationalist constituencies.  Eight Labour Party candidates stood. They were all defeated, and to-day in the most highly industrialised area in Ireland there is not one <Col N="290" /> official Labour representative and outside the Nationalist areas not one Labour representative of any kind survived the polls.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why is it that when we are asked here to discuss an important constitutional measure affecting the very foundations upon which representation is based and institutions built, affecting the lives and labours and well-being of our people, the two Ministers who are so closely associated with the Northern Counties, the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Social Welfare, should ignore the implications of a book that examines the whole situation and which was published or assisted in publication by the pence collected in every corner of Ireland?</P>
    <P>Why, if we go through all the countries in the world that have been mentioned here and if the contents of all the books which have been brought to our notice here are considered, is it that the crystallised experience of our people in the North of Ireland where P.R. has been wiped out should be ignored?  And why, for simply reading the opening sentence in a chapter, the end of which I have read out here, should Deputy Costello be criticised and more or less charged by the Minister for External Affairs with misrepresenting the content of that book?</P>
    <P>Why is it that the Minister for Social Welfare should travel all the libraries of Europe to pick up bits and scraps of things dealing with experiences of other countries&mdash;which, I am sure, he cannot understand&mdash;to throw them out, or shovel them in, here like mud from the torn fields of Europe to distort a discussion here, paying no attention to what, under the Taoiseach's management, we are being told to read and promulgate?  I ask that first for the purpose of clearing away some of the muck and mud that has been poured on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands also went to the books and he tells us at column 1647 that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sir Herbert Morrison speaking in the British Parliament in 1924 ... said this: &lsquo;P.R. is a philosophy which is not unnatural to small new Parties struggling to get a footing on <Col N="291" /> the electoral field, and not having much staying power or programme to fight.  It is also perfectly natural to decaying political Parties, who are doomed to extinction in the course of time, and who can only retain their position by elevating the power of the minority and subjecting the power of the majority.  It is perfectly natural to them but it is not natural to strong men and women who want their country to be governed wisely and firmly, and I hope, therefore, that the House&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is the House of Commons</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;&mdash;will not accept that type of Government.?&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are asked to go back to Mr. Herbert Morrison in the British Parliament in 1924.  I would not expect the Minister for Lands to be sufficiently up to date to know what was in <i>The Economist</i> last Saturday, but I would expect him to know something of what happened in Britain between 1924 and to-day.  Again, for the purpose of clearing away some of the muck under which we are smothered in our discussion here and getting down to realities, I quote <i>The Economist</i> of last Saturday in which there is an article, &ldquo;Set the People Free&rdquo;, which begins with a rather appreciative comment on the fact that in a coming by-election in Great Britain, an Independent will be in the field with a programme, and they suggest the kind of programme they would like an Independent in Great Britain to-day to put before the electorate over the heads of all Parties.</P>
    <P>After considering the things the prospective candidate had in his programme, it winds up by suggesting the other things that ought to go in.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In a rather different category are two reforms, previously advocated by The Economist which would fortify the civic freedom of voter and worker.  These are (a) the electoral system of the &lsquo;alternative vote&rsquo;, which would give the voter a better chance though admittedly not as <Col N="292" /> good a chance as under full P.R. to see that his vote counts in keeping out the candidates he most dislikes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second reform deals with a Companies Act for trade union special legal exemptions, and it winds up by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let the list lengthen.  Britons are not as free as they think.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I say, I would not expect the Minister for Lands to be right up to the half-minute before 12 when he was speaking on whatever day it was, but I would expect him to understand something of what had happened in between, when speaking of &ldquo;strong men and women who want their country to be governed wisely and firmly&rdquo;.  I ask him did he ever hear of Sir Winston Churchill?  Did he ever realise that Sir Winston Churchill was able to say in the House of Commons&mdash;admittedly, seven years after Mr. Morrison had spoken&mdash; that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Parliament is all we have, and the House of Commons is the main part of it....  Surely care of this central instrument ought to be a sacred trust?  Surely the building up of practical, trustworthy, living organs of government ought to be one of our chief cares?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was discussing the advisability of introducing P.R.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having to choose, as we shall have to choose, if we are to redress the constitutional injustice, between the alternative vote, the second ballot and P.R. in the cities, I have no doubt whatever that the last is incomparably the fairest, the most scientific and, on the whole, the best in the public interest....  Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Bristol, what effective expression have they now of their collective intellectual force?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, he indicated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the P.R. system, those cities would regain their collective personality and their members, of every hue, Liberal, Conservative, or <Col N="293" /> Socialist would speak for the opinions of very large numbers of people forming an integral society.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He returned to that point again, in an article in the <i>Daily Mail:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why should Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield, Leeds, Bradford, Glasgow and Edinburgh not bring a collective weight to bear?  Instead of this, they are all carved up into meaningless blocks of houses, none of which embodies the authority, the dignity, or the weight of these great communities.  The House of Commons would be far richer and our national life more securely founded if these cities with traditions and character of their own returned men who had the right to speak as Conservatives, Liberals or Socialists for the whole city.  Men would become stronger in relation to political machinery.  Both, therefore, on the grounds of securing truer representation of the people and of strengthening the House of Commons, I am in favour of electoral reform&mdash;first, the application of P.R., in the first instance, to the great cities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on, in 1950, speaking in the House of Commons on the 7th March, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have certainly reached a parliamentary deadlock or stalemate differing in its character from any in living experience.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In answer to what the Minister for External Affairs suggested, with regard to the way in which County Louth could be dealt with under the new single member constituency, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nor can we, to whatever Party we belong, overlook the constitutional injustice done to 2,600,000 voters who, voting upon a strong tradition, have been able to return only nine Members of Parliament.  I do not think this is a matter which we can brush aside or allow to lie unheeded....  It is not true that the Liberal Party here or, what is of far more importance, the Liberal Party in the country, can, by simply throwing its weight on to one side or the <Col N="294" /> other, determine the issue.  Any step that was taken as a mere bargain or deal might not only be difficult to implement, but might well produce unfavourable reactions for those concerned.  The nation might deeply reseat the feeling that its fortunes had been bartered about without regard to principle by a handful of politicians no matter what Party they come from, and that its vital interests were but a piece in a jigsaw puzzle.  In such a situation, candour, sincerity, simplicity, firm adherence to well-known and publicly asserted principles, combined with a dominating regard for national rather than Party interests, will be found to be the surest guides.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister for Lands bring us back to one quotation in 1924 by a British politician in the House of Commons, to show what a disaster P.R. would be?  I think it was Deputy Bartley, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who tried to lay the foundations of fear here, by pointing out that if Great Britain had P.R. at the time the Tories were campaigning against Home Rule in Ireland, Ireland might have got Home Rule and British patriotism might have been endangered and insulted.  Does anybody know, or has anybody given any thought to, what it has cost Britain and Britain's people and Britain's interests, that Ireland was not treated fairly, not even by a P.R. Government in Great Britain at that time?</P>
    <P>An announcement was made the other day that Volumes 1, 2 and 3 of the Dáil Debates from January, 1919, had been published.  I would ask those who will now turn with interest to the opening sessions of Dáil Éireann in January, 1919&mdash;and in April, 1919, when Mr. de Valera had returned from Lincoln and the full Parliament was there&mdash;to read what was said there. Deputies will find there a speech in Irish by Cathal Brugha, in which he praised what the workers of this country had done and praised the organised Labour organisations in this country&mdash;for what?  For not making difficulties, for those who were taking the advance move in protecting national interests at that time, by contesting <Col N="295" /> the election of December, 1918, on the straight vote.  The straight vote was in operation there, but Cathal Brugha realised that if the Labour Party had put up candidates, as they were entitled to do, in December, 1918, there would not have been the substantial success which there was of the Sinn Féin Party.  Cathal Brugha, speaking of that with gratitude, told those who represented Labour in the country that they would not be forgotten. They are being forgotten now by a proposal to introduce legislation here which would prevent the organised workers through the country, if they wish, putting into Parliament representatives directly representing them and preventing them from appearing here&mdash;or otherwise they would &ldquo;distort the majority vote of the people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach smiles.  The Taoiseach himself can read his own speech, following Cathal Brugha's speech on that occasion.  He said that he never promised anything to Labour but that he did realise what organised Labour meant and that the work of an Irish Government would be carried out in close co-operation with Labour and after consulting in the most effective way the interests and the wishes and the experience of organised Labour. While the Minister for Industry and Commerce pats political Labour on the back and says: &ldquo;Yours is the day of the future,&rdquo; what kind of hypocrisy is mixed up in that?</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach, and I ask those who remember the circumstances in which the Dáil Éireann of January, 1919, was established&mdash;the hope, the courage and the determination that filled men's minds, supported as they were in mobilising for that movement, by support moving from every party, creed and class in the country&mdash;what did they mean by the principles expressed in statements they made at that particular time.  What did they mean by the principles they expounded in their subsequent discussions?</P>
    <P>That, as I have shown&mdash;quoting from the other book, the paragraph which has been ignored here&mdash;made <Col N="296" /> the present Taoiseach, as President then of the Republic, declare&mdash;I think it was in May, 1921&mdash;that he was making a declaration that Sinn Féin stood by their traditions and they stood for the proportional and fair representation of every section of the people in an Irish Parliament that would be established.</P>
    <P>Let us get back in our discussions here to our own experiences and let us ask, in regard to the wiping out of the multi-member constituency, have Irish counties not as much character, necessary diversity of tradition and capacity and ample and generous power of linking together all the various sections of the people as any other city, such as Belfast, Leeds, or Manchester? What is the intention of taking our counties, with their particular characteristics, traditions and the qualities they can give to public life and public thought in every aspect, and dividing them up now when our people in every walk of life have been in the habit of associating men of every Party, creed and class in every kind of activity, thought and discussion dealing with every aspect of our life?</P>
    <P>Why is it that, under this section, Cork and Dublin and Waterford and Limerick are to be divided up into little squares on a draught board to be occupied by pawns, instead of letting the community as a whole or fairly large sections of it&mdash;even though there are three member constituencies&mdash;reflect the full of their strength, of their different powers and different experiences here in Parliament in two massed groups?  It was nicely put by whoever said it&mdash;two masses in an Irish Parliament, ranged against one another in opposition and based, on the one hand, upon what the Fianna Fáil Party think they are, with all their traditions and experiences, and, on the other, the kind of thing that will be brought into being by some representatives of a Fine Gael caucus, a Labour caucus, a Sinn Féin caucus and a Clann na Poblachta caucus going into a back room somewhere in the country and saying: &ldquo;We will let you put up your man in such and such a square or section of <Col N="297" /> this county or city, if you will let us put up our man here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I say, there will be, on the one hand, the kind of Party Fianna Fáil think they are and, on the other hand, this kind of thing&mdash;I would not call it a synthetic Party and I do not know how you could describe it&mdash; brought together behind the backs of the people and certainly with none of the public display of &ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo; that the Minister for External Affairs feels his political opponents should have.</P>
    <P>Is that what the Taoiseach is planning for an Irish Parliament and are those the foundations upon which an Irish Parliament is built?  Let us come back to our own experience and thought here and let us leave the libraries of Europe alone for a while. But if we are to dip into their libraries, let us dip into them honestly.  I make these remarks not for the purpose of prolonging the debate but for the purpose of saying that we have here experience as ripe, as stimulating and as informing as any country in the world.  I particularly want to say that this great unity and capacity of our people to work together was enacted, stabilised and fructified in the face of a violent attack on their liberties and rights from outside.  I would ask those who, from the inside, would try and disturb, destroy and weaken the foundations of what must always be the liberties of our people, to think.  And when they think in terms of Parliament guiding the people and taking over from the people, as Parliament must necessarily do to-day, work the people themselves cannot do in areas and arenas of a particular kind, do they think that the efficient kind of Parliament they want is two massed Parties, ranged against one another in opposition in this House, waiting to dig the ground from under each other's feet, so that there shall be the kind of change from side to side characterised very effectively by Sir Winston Churchill when he saw what was coming in Great Britain?</P>

      <P>When Deputy Mulcahy dug into the libraries of Britain to find out <Col N="298" /> what Sir Winston Churchill said on various occasions since 1924, he should have had a look at the parliamentary division lists.

      <P>There is no necessity for the Deputy to become emotional about this or to try to raise the debate to a pitch of excitement.  This is a very serious business.  We have to decide as best we can what we will propose to the Irish people in regard to the system of election.  Deputy Mulcahy thinks it is wrong to have two massed Parties, one on either side of the House, ranged against each other. What does he want?  One Party?  We will not go into the history of one Party suggestions here, but surely to goodness, if there is to be a reasonable debate on public affairs in Parliament, it is a good thing that there should be an Opposition to the Government in power for the day in order that the weaknesses of Government proposals may be shown up to the people and that the Opposition may point out to the people what the Government might do.  What is wrong with that system? The alternative is the one-Party system in which there is no Opposition.  Is that what Deputy Mulcahy wants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this matter of P.R. and single-seat <Col N="299" /> constituencies, there have been quite a number of Irishmen who considered this issue and who came to the conclusion that P.R. was not quite the fraud and the cod that Deputy Dillon said it was.  Rather, they concluded it was a system of election that would lead to weaknesses of Government. Deputy Costello himself came to that conclusion.  He had no hesitancy at one time in saying that he had reached that conclusion.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We always understood that the real defect under any system of P.R., and particularly the system of the single transferable vote, was that it led, in circumstances where there are no big economic issues before the country, to a large number of small Parties ...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I remember quite a lot of things.  I remember during the course of Deputy Costello's speech on the Second Reading listening to an extract he gave from a book published by Mr. Gallagher &mdash;<i>The Indivisible Island.</i>  What I objected to then was the fact that Deputy Costello was giving the impression that what Mr. Gallagher said was that P.R. was responsible&mdash;I had better give the exact quotation so that we shall not have any more about it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello quoted part of what Mr. Gallagher wrote:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One of the greatest wrongs that can be done to a minority in a democratic State is to deprive it of its political rights, particularly of its electoral rights, for this is so often a-shield for the rest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is an excellent statement of a principle, but Deputy Costello tried to leave the House under the impression that Mr. Gallagher wrote that statement of principle in relation to the abolition of P.R.  I asked the Deputy to go on and finish what Mr. Gallagher said.  He would see that&mdash; and I quoted this later&mdash;Mr. Gallagher went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The denial in the case of the North is achieved&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is, the denial of the political rights of a minority&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;by the arrangement of the electoral boundaries&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;and not by the abolition of P.R. The Bill to which Deputy Mulcahy referred to-day, and all the quotations <Col N="301" /> in relation to it, was a Bill to arrange constituencies.  Constituencies were, as we know, gerrymandered in the North. There is no doubt in the world about that.</P>

      <P>We know that in the North there are large sections of one type of voter living in a part of one constituency.  They have been there for the past 30 years.  They have never changed.  It is easy, therefore, to gerrymander in the North under the straight vote system.  Here, it would be very difficult, because, as Deputy Costello himself pointed out in the Second Reading debate, we do not have that sort of segregation of population.  No one can say from day to day who will win in North Kerry, South Kerry, Mid-Kerry, North Westmeath, Mid-Westmeath or South Westmeath.</P>

Politically, our population is mixed and I defy anyone, no matter how intimately he knows County Louth&mdash;I know it pretty intimately over the past 30 or 40 years&mdash;to gerrymander County Louth in such a way that Fianna Fáil, with their 12,000 first preference votes, would be sure of even one seat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Remembering that Fianna Fáil was in a minority in County Louth in the last general election, it will be impossible for them to win, unless the Opposition go on with their present play-acting. Politically, our people are mixed in <Col N="302" /> their affiliations.  Even if, under the single-member system, a Party got a majority in North Louth, Mid-Louth or South Louth at one general election, there is no guarantee that they will win at the next general election; there is no guarantee that some percentage of that majority will not swing the other way.</P>
      <P>I wish to goodness the members of the Opposition would have a little more courage in facing the future and a little more belief in their own policies.  Up to now, they have always pretended, when fighting a general election, that they were fighting in order to become the Government. That was the story they told the people.  Now, they are throwing their hats at ever becoming a Government. Why have they not got the courage to go out and try to get a majority?  If they are not prepared to do that, they should fade out.  If they do not do it, the people will make certain that they vote them out.  Deputy Mulcahy suggested that I had proposed a system whereby opposition groups would go into a back room before the election and frame electoral pacts so that they would not oppose each other in the constituencies if they intended to form a Coalition afterwards.</P>

    <P>I do not know where the Labour Party stand on this matter.  Deputy Corish has reminded me of certain questions that I put to Deputy Norton on the last occasion that we debated <Col N="306" /> this matter in the Dáil and which he refused to answer directly.  Perhaps Deputy Corish would now answer me. If the situation after the next general election is that there is no single Party here with a majority, that a Party must combine with other Parties to form a Government, will the Labour Party joint the Coalition?  Is it prepared to join a Coalition?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you answer that question in respect of your own Party first?  Let the Labour Party look after itself.  Tell us what Fianna Fáil would do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put one further question.  If Deputy Corish answers that question by asking another, I want to ask, does he approve of calling it sinful if Fianna Fáil would refuse to form a Coalition under those circumstances and is that giving an indication to the country that they would regard it as sinful if Labour did not join a Coalition and, if they would not regard it as sinful, why did Deputy Norton refer to this non-participation in a Coalition as sinful and scandalous, so often in the debate on this question on the 8th January?</P>
      <P>It would be much better for the Labour Party to make up their minds that, if they are going to coalesce after the next general election, they should give the people an opportunity of judging that matter and should not leave the people under the impression that they are not going to coalesce if, in fact, they have in their mind, as Deputy Norton clearly indicated that he has in his mind, that they will form another Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On several occasions the labour organisation has come out and instructed the Labour Party not to form a Coalition.  The National Labour Party, the night before they joined the Coalition in 1948, were instructed by the men who elected them not to form it.  In recent weeks the Labour Party have been instructed by their organisation not to form a Coalition.  Yet Deputy Norton came into the Dáil the other day and said it would be sinful to refuse to form a Coalition.  I think <Col N="307" /> the people are entitled to know what is the view of the elected leadership of the Labour Party in that regard.  We all know what the Labour Party electors, the people who put them in, think about it.  Deputy Norton disclosed that his view is completely contrary to the views of the people who were responsible for his organisation.</P>

      <P>It is the first time in my life I have heard Fianna Fáil admit that Fine Gael were right because all the Taoiseach, the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Health and the others who spoke on the opposite side, were saying was: &ldquo;Did Fine Gael not say this was right in 1937?  Did Deputy Costello not say it was right?&rdquo; Of course, Fianna Fáil at that time said it was wrong but they agree that what Deputy Costello said, under very different circumstances I suppose, in 1937, is the right thing now.</P>
      <P>It is very seldom that Sir Winston Churchill is brought into a debate in this House&mdash;very seldom indeed because we all know that he is not in it at all with our Taoiseach.  Having listened to the Minister for External Affairs I am surprised that the President-elect&mdash;the Taoiseach&mdash;should be the man to do this.  As far as I am concerned, no matter what Churchill or anybody else said, I believe that first preference, so far as a quotation is concerned, should go to the Taoiseach of our country.  This is what he said when speaking on the Constitution in 1937:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The system we have we know; the people know it.  On the whole it has worked out pretty well.  I think that we have a good deal to be thankful for in this country:&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;we have to be very grateful that we have had the system of P.R. here.  It gives a certain amount of stability, and on the system of the single transferable vote you have fair representation of Parties.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> Further on, it states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think we get, probably in this country more than in any other country, better balanced results from the system we have.  If you take the countries where P.R. exists, you get better balanced results than you get in the other countries.  I think we get the benefits of P.R. in reasonably balanced legislation here better than in any other country that I have read about or know anything about.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the statement of the Taoiseach in 1937.  That was the time he was pawing the ground when going around the country asking the people to vote for the Constitution.  Enshrined in that Constitution as its guiding light was P.R. by means of which every section of the people would have true representation, according to the will of the people.  I remember many times, going back many years, when Fianna Fáil had not a majority in the Dáil.  They now come along and because they have an overall majority, decide to abolish P.R. They want to drive small Parties out of this House.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is the man who in 1937 said minorities should get representation.  He now comes along, the President-elect, at the end of his, days, with this Bill.  It is not a Fianna Fáil Bill at all; it is a de Valera Bill.  He brings it in here saying that the Labour Party are not entitled to representation; the Clann na Poblachta Party are not entitled to representation; the Clann na Talmhan Party or the farmers are not entitled to representation and, above all, Independents should not be allowed.</P>

      <P>That is the view. He says he wants to drive them all out.  He wants one Opposition and one only&mdash;Fine Gael.  That is the only Opposition he wants because, from 1927 to 1943, he was quite successful with that Opposition, but in 1943 small Parties came into the House, since when he has never rested quietly. At last he found this one and only idea of abolishing P.R.  He gets Deputy Aiken to give an idea of the class of gerrymandering that went on in the North and probably try to tie it on to the constituencies here in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Again, Deputy Aiken talked about back room&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister at all.  He had the black hat&mdash;the tall hat &mdash;on at a British Royal funeral.  He talked about the back room and what happened in the General Election of 1948.  The vast majority of the people of this country decided in the 1948 General Election that Fianna Fáil were no longer to be the Government of this country.  A majority of over 500,000 of our people voted that Fianna Fáil would no longer be the majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me recall to the minds of Deputies that there was no co-operation between Labour, Clann na Poblachta, Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan.  The vote of the people showed that is what the people wanted. An inter-Party Government was formed with Deputy Costello as Taoiseach, although it was far from being his wish to be such.  The small Parties, such as the Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta and Clann na Talmhan had to carry out the decision of the people because that was their decision.  The people opposite never had any respect for the decision of the majority of the people.  The Taoiseach may laugh.  That was the decision in 1948.  He was not in a position to act against the decision of the majority as he did in previous times.  That was the people's decision.  If the Labour Party &mdash;I need not speak for them&mdash;the Clann na Poblachta Party and the Clann na Talmhan Party went in to form an <Col N="310" /> inter-Party Government, it was because they had a majority of over 500,000 of the Irish people.  The people decided that should be done and they compelled them to do so, and there was no back room business about it.  The people knew our worth and the worth of that Government when we went before them again in 1951.  The same Irish people again gave a majority to the people who co-operated and went before them and said they still stood for an inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>Again, at the General Election in 1954 the people knew what they were doing when they gave the same group, with Deputy Costello again as Taoiseach, a majority of II or 12 in this House.  In that year, times went rather against the Government and when we had another general election Fianna Fáil happened to get a majority, and good luck to them.  I, and every elected member on this side, accepted fully that they had got that majority.  Now, because one person at the end of his days has made up his mind we have this Bill, which is a copy of what Lord Brookeborough is doing in the North of Ireland, and which he was condemned by the Taoiseach for doing.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are now in trouble.  They believe they have not got a majority in the country and they are going to the country with this Bill and are worried that it may be turned down.  The Taoiseach knows very well that he has men on his own side who will waltz, into the Lobby and vote for this, but when they go to the country and are not under the Whip and when they know it is their own swan song, I know how they will vote and when the votes are counted, the Taoiseach will realise that he has not the whip in the country that he has over the people elected under the organisation of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>That was an emergency and to-day is another.  The timing is now important so that this Bill will be right for bringing before the people on the day of the election of the President.  Some of the right-hand men over there, even though they are not admitting it, are getting tired of the Chief and they decided that this would be a good time to put his name before the people, on the very same day as the vote on the Constitution: &ldquo;Vote for Dev. for the Presidency and &lsquo;yes&rsquo; for the Constitution amendment.&rdquo; They see a great chance to get rid of him; they are tired of him and want to get finished with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I want to warn the House that there is a terrible danger in what is about to happen.  We have at the moment, elected to this House as Deputies, men who do not come here, who do not recognise this House.  That is a bad thing in any country.  Is there not a danger that these groups, and probably other groups as well, on finding out that this is a manoeuvre to make certain that they cannot elect anybody to this House will be driven underground and forced to try other methods of defending their interests when they are not allowed to send their <Col N="312" /> representatives here to defend them? Is that not a serious danger?</P>
    <P>There is one thing that can be said for Deputy Costello as Taoiseach.  He was one man who welcomed people of every description and he is probably the one man who should not, if he had thought of times gone by.  He welcomed them all in and we had peace and quietness during his regime and the régime of the inter-Party Government which we have not to-day.  I do not think there is any other country in the world at the moment where people are behind barbed wire, without being given a trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people in internment camps who will not be let out who are members of the Dáil. The Minister for External Affairs said Fine Gael wanted a one-Party Government, but I think it is Fianna Fáil that want a one-Party Government. They are the people who want one-Party government.  They want themselves and themselves alone, and, as I told the House at the start of my remarks, what they want is a Fine Gael Opposition and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a time&mdash;probably I was one myself&mdash;when people thought there was never any good in Fine Gael, but since I came into the House in 1943, I found out that Fine Gael were a Party who did their best according to their lights.  I agree with them in many ways and in many ways I do not agree.  There is one thing I will say about them: they are 1,000 per cent. ahead of the Government <Col N="313" /> Party of the present day. They would not attempt to do the things the Fianna Fáil Party are attempting to do or the things the Taoiseach as Fianna Fáil is trying to do now.  The Taoiseach wants to bring us back again to the atmosphere of 1922 and 1943.  Did we not then hear from every platform in the country about who executed this one, who shot that one, who murdered some other one?  It was nothing but raking the bones of the dead in their graves, but from 1943, when other Parties came into Government, there was an economic programme carried out, and cases were made by representatives of small Parties, which more or less did away with that game which was no credit to Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael for the number of years they carried it on.  I will give Fine Gael the credit that they do not want those days back again.  Fianna Fáil want that mud-slinging to go on again.  It is &ldquo;Wrap the green flag round me boys.&rdquo;&ldquo;Abolish everybody but yourself.&rdquo; To quote ex-Deputy Cogan, who said that the Taoiseach was doing Herod again with the wiping-out of all small Parties, that is what Earnon De Valera is trying to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I should be flattered by all the quotations of arguments and alleged arguments that emanated from me in the course of various discussions at different times.  The one thing about which I do flatter myself is that I do not suffer from illusions.  When the Taoiseach hands me out bouquets as to the power of my advocacy and quotes arguments from Dáil Debates, followed by the Minister for External Affairs re-quoting them again and again, I know perfectly well they are doing that not for the purpose of flattering my ego but for their own purpose at this time.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether or not consistency in a politician is regarded as an outstanding virtue.  Sometimes it is a good thing for a politician to have the courage to change his views with changing circumstances.  I think that, on this matter of P.R., I can claim to have held and still to hold a perfectly consistent view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> In his winding-up speech on the Second Reading of this Bill the Taoiseach referred to some advertisement issued by the then Cumann na nGaedheal Party during the progress of a general election campaign and he quoted arguments with reference to Coalitions.  He was good enough to say that I was responsible for some of those arguments.  I regret to say I was not.  They were excellent arguments. I was not responsible for them. I was in Geneva during the course of that general election after the murder of Kevin O'Higgins and I was doing my job there while my colleagues here were winning that general election.</P>
    <P>All the arguments, powerful as they were, detailed as they appear to have been, were in no way directed to asking the electorate to abolish P.R. or any electoral system founded upon the principles of P.R. nor was any hint whatever given that if Mr. Cosgrave's Government succeeded in getting another mandate from the people they proposed to abolish P.R.  I would ask Deputies to recollect this fact.  At that time in 1927 after Mr. Cosgrave's Government had got a sufficient majority to carry on for a period of five years he could have abolished P.R. and the principles of P.R. in accordance with the provisions of the then Constitution by ordinary legislation in this House&mdash;and he did not do it.</P>

      <P>They had sufficient to do it I can assure the Minister for External Affairs that if they had wanted to do it they could have done it.  They had a sufficient mandate, if they had wanted to do it.  They carried certain other proposals, which were far more radical than the changing of the system of P.R., during the course of that five year period.  They did not do it and they never gave any indication of an intention to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We debated in this House in 1936 the provisions in the Draft Constitution of that time dealing with P.R.  On that occasion I made the speech that <Col N="315" /> has been so frequently quoted, to my great joy, during the course of the present arguments.  Doubtless it will be quoted again.  I do not withdraw a single line or word of the arguments I put then.  I was not advocating then nor did I at any time prior or subsequent thereto advocate the abolition of the principles of P.R.  I never did it and I do not do so now.</P>
    <P>I was pointing out to the then President of the Executive Council who is now the Taoiseach that it would be far better, dealing with what was regarded as the fundamental law of the country, to leave the matter flexible so that the system that was in operation at that time could be examined and, if defects were found, to have the defects removed and thus procure a better system.  I argued that the Legislature would then be in a position easily to adopt that system instead of the then existing system. The words I proposed to put in the Bill, as part of the fundamental law, were to the effect that there should be elections based on the principles of P.R.</P>
    <P>In the course of that discussion, in the course of my efforts to persuade the Taoiseach not to do what he is about to do now&mdash;to put the provisions inflexibly in the Constitution &mdash;I pointed out that he could carry on the system and that if it proved faulty he could adopt another system of P.R.  I did not and I do not advocate the abolition of the principles of P.R. from our electoral system.  That is the fundamental difference of my argument but neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for External Affairs pointed out that fact.</P>
    <P>I have stated that I do not regard the principle of the single transferable vote as an immutable political dogma; I believe there are defects in it. What I was advocating then and what I have advocated since is that the system should be examined to see what the defects are and to take them away.  I never advocated it should be taken away merely because I was defeated twice, as I was, but that is the basis that the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Everything I said there is absolutely true.  There is no doubt but that the principles of P.R. which were enshrined in the present Constitution, and which were put there in the most obstinate fashion, in spite of arguments to the contrary, by the then Taoiseach who is also the present Taoiseach, as the fundamental law of the Constitution, do tend to a multiplicity of Parties.  It is a fact. As Deputy Mulcahy has said, we are spending our time and our energies on trying to find out the experience of other people or to read out phrases from political thinkers dealing with different conditions in order to justify the change which is now about to be made when we should look at our own conditions and our own experience.</P>

      <P>I mean all sections like Farmers, Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, and give them their due proportion.  I do not, when I am speaking about minorities, confine my remarks at all to religious minorities.  I am thinking about the Farmers' Party, the Labour Party, about even such sections of the people as arose into a coherent Party under the name of Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan, the Farmers' Party we had here from time to time during the history of this Dáil from 1922 until recent years.  They all came and put their case before the people and represented a considerable section of the people with certain coherent outlooks and certain vocational interests.  If a group of that kind is so coherent and has such substantial support from sections of the people, then they are entitled to representation here.  If the workers of the country want representation they are entitled to get it even though they do not perhaps get the full amount of the representation ordinary people would expect in a Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is the object of the present proposals to murder the Labour Party, as they think it is, or whether it is to eliminate the Fine Gael Party or perhaps a combination of both, but certainly I do know that the conduct of the Minister for External Affairs on a serious matter of this kind in putting this ridiculous question to Deputy Norton and Deputy Corish: &ldquo;What will you do if as a result of the next general election there is not one Party with a sufficient majority in the Dáil?&rdquo; is not indicative of a serious approach to a matter of this kind.</P>

      <P>So far as the multiplicity of Parties is concerned our experience&mdash;and that is what we have to go on&mdash;would show that the people have sufficient intelligence, have developed sufficient political instinct <Col N="318" /> and are sufficiently educated politically to know how to deal with a multiplicity of Parties if they exist.  I pointed out in the course of the discussion on the Second Reading of this Bill that when the Irish electorate wished to give a Party an overall majority from 1922 until the last general election they did it.  They knew how to go about it and they knew the people to whom they were to give it.  When they wanted to give a mandate for a Coalition Government, as the Fianna Fáil Party like to call it, or an inter-Party Government, they knew how to go about it.  I make a present to the Taoiseach of the 1948 position if he wishes it, but in 1954 we campaigned this country on the basis that there was going to be an inter-Party Government and the Taoiseach admitted as a result of that general election we had a mandate to form it.  Afterwards when the country wanted to change that, they changed it and made their wishes very clear.  When the people wanted to eliminate members of a political Party they did so.  Going back, say, to the National Party, when the present Taoiseach offered to form a Coalition in 1927 with the National Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister for External Affairs kindly keep quiet for a short time?  I am not suggesting, and neither is anybody behind me suggesting, anything false.  We know the history of that particular disreputable performance in 1927 after the murder of Kevin O'Higgins.  At all events, at that time they were quite prepared to support a Coalition.  They were quite prepared to do it subsequently in 1951 and if what formed the Government in 1951 is not a Coalition, in the sense in which that word is used by Fianna Fáil, I do not know what is.  However, the electorate were sufficiently intelligent and had sufficient political education to know precisely what to do from 1922 onwards. When there was a Farmers' Party they did not like and when there was a Clann na Poblachta Party they did not like or any other Party, they voted intelligently to deal with that situation. We did not and many other people did not agree with them but they made their wishes absolutely clear.  We could ask the Minister for External Affairs the question he asked Deputy Corish this afternoon: What would he do if there was not a sufficient majority here embodied in one Party to form a Government?</P>

      <P>The Minister has already spoken twice on this section in the debate.  He has spent a considerable amount of time producing my arguments.  I am not going away from one line of what I said.  Taken in their proper context I stand over these arguments and I am not in any way trying to change anything I had to say in these matters.  The Taoiseach, the Minister and the people behind them have far more changes to make and far more political acrobatics to indulge in in this context, than I have.</P>

      <P>I said&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...under the system of P.R. we have a large number of Parties returned to this House.</P>
      <P>Under the system of the single transferable vote we are bound to have a large number of Parties returned.  Besides the main Parties, we might have a Farmers' Party, a Labour Party, a Country Party, a Town Party and an Independent Party.  Whole groups of people might be returned under P.R.  We always understood that the real defect under any system of P.R. and particularly the system of the single transferable vote, was that it led, in circumstances where there are no big economic issues before the country, to a large number of small Parties being returned, making for instability in Government. That is inherent in the system of P.R. and the single transferable vote.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put that case and I withdraw nothing from that but, what I do say is this: that in the circumstances of this country though such might have occurred under P.R. it has not occurred, and our people have sufficient intelligence, political capacity and political education to know how to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also putting those arguments against what the Taoiseach insisted on putting inflexibly into the fundamental law of the Constitution, and said that he ought to leave it much more flexible.  He said: &ldquo;I will not have <Col N="322" /> that.  I am insisting on putting the system of P.R. into the fundamental law,&rdquo; but he now says: &ldquo;I am wrong.&rdquo; The phrase used by the Taoiseach in favour of P.R., at that time, has been quoted and requoted, and I suppose everybody knows it off by heart.  The country knows it.  He said it was the best system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>He insisted at that time that it should go into the Constitution, into the fundamental law of the country, in spite of my arguments and though the Minister for External Affairs has said that this is a serious debate, I got a certain amount of amusement from the Taoiseach's political acrobatics in this context.  He stated, and I have quoted him, that he was upholding P.R. at that time but he now says: &ldquo;I changed my mind because I have been beaten twice.&rdquo; He says that he is entitled to change his mind but I am not.  The Taoiseach can perform these political acrobatics; he can turn right around and say: &ldquo;Because I was defeated twice I was wrong then but I must be right this time.  I am changing this system because of that and putting this new system into the Constitution and trying to get the people to do it,&rdquo; perhaps more inflexibly than the present system was put into the Constitution in 1936.</P>
      <P>I spoke about humility.  I do not think the Taoiseach has any such sense of political humility.  Perhaps none of us has for that matter but, in any event, the Taoiseach might possibly think that as he was wrong in 1936, he is wrong again this time, because he is doing now the exact opposite to what he did in 1936.</P>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs says that this is a serious debate.  I agree that this is a serious debate, but I think it would be far better for the country if he, instead of indulging &mdash;in the most respectful way I could describe it&mdash;in the kind of low-down political tactics of putting the Labour Party into what he thinks is a difficult position, but which I think is not difficult at all, had addressed himself to the vital question in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> I think that we are here facing a revolutionary proposal which may well be productive of very serious injurious results to the political system and to the people of this country, results which we cannot foresee now.  I object to this Bill on a number of reasons.  Again and again I have stated, and it cannot be over-emphasised, that what we are doing is taking a jump into the unknown.  The Taoiseach is endeavouring, because of his particular experience in the last year or two, to try to mould the future, by reason of that, because of that, and in accordance with that very limited experience.</P>
    <P>We have had the spectacle of this country undergoing political development. Since 1922 there has been remarkable political development in this country, as I have said again and again, in spite of political utterances to the contrary, and we are not yet at the end of that political growth. We are, in fact, I believe only in the beginning of a new type of political growth.  There may be young Deputies here in this House who will see that. Others of us will not.  There are many of us passing off the political scene now or who will pass off, comparatively speaking, in a short space of time.  We do not know what the condition of this country will be later on; yet we are trying here to mould the future on inadequate material because of the particular experience of a head of a particular Party.  I think that is wrong.  I think it is highly dangerous.</P>
    <P>We have spoken, and I suppose we shall hear again and again, about this question of multiplicity of Parties. I would ask the Taoiseach to pause and consider: will everything work out as he thinks it will work out?  I am not referring to the question of whether he is going to annihilate the Labour Party or eliminate the Fine Gael Party.  I want him to think whether it will work out in a different way altogether, if there will be a sufficiently dynamic political force in this country that will be prevented from getting into this House because of the change in the voting system?  Such a <Col N="324" /> force could get representation for their group in this Dáil under P.R. representation which they will not be able to get under this proposal.  What the Taoiseach is trying to do here is to create artificially something which cannot be done.  The Taoiseach and his colleagues are trying to say that we must create two Parties, one a Government Party and the other an Opposition Party, and they will go in and out of office like a see-saw.  He is trying to say that there will be violent changes and the Opposition will not have to wait very long until they go over to the Government Benches.</P>
    <P>In Britain, the big political Parties like the Conservatives and Labour do not like P.R.  They stay in office for four or five years and then they go in and out with the progression and changing of a small section of political public opinion.  They do not want P.R. Under their system it does not matter which is the existing Government; whichever Party is in the Opposition will have a chance of getting their turn and, therefore, they do not want it.</P>
    <P>That British system is being adopted by the present Government and I put it to the Government, and to the people of this country, that that system is the apotheosis of Party domination. One of the greatest defects of that system is that people here will not have the chance of adopting or suggesting from a panel of candidates, even from the same political Party, the candidate they want.  There will be domination of the Party because the Party will not nominate A, B and C as under P.R., but will possibly nominate D. Under the P.R. system the Fianna Fáil Party usually put up two or three candidates but, under the new system, the electorate will not have a chance of saying: &ldquo;We will vote for A or B.&rdquo; They will have the right only to vote for D, like it or lump it.  I think that is a very bad system.</P>
    <P>Curiously enough it is one of the main debating points in this country, among some of the younger generation who think they are not getting their proper chance of making their <Col N="325" /> views and policies heard in the councils of the country.  One of the arguments that have been frequently advanced by the younger people, the younger generation who affect, or really feel, disillusionment at what has taken place or has not taken place in the years since the State was established in 1922, is that the Party hierarchy will not let them take their place in the Party so that they will not have a chance of putting forward their views and putting themselves up for election.  They feel that under the British system the Party, or the hierarchy of the Party, can control everything and, as I say, it is the ultimate apotheosis of Party domination.</P>
    <P>But let us assume for the moment that you will get the system that the Taoiseach and his Ministers wish.  If it be adopted by the people, which I hope it will not, then you will have the two Parties playing ball with each other.  The people of this country are entirely different from the people of Great Britain.  They have not behind them the centuries of tradition which the British have in political affairs. They are not going to stay quiet and docile under the Party system.  They are going to be restive; they will make their wishes very clear and find a way of getting over the very system that the Taoiseach wants to make permanent.</P>
    <P>Have Deputies heard of such a thing on the Continent as the Popular Front?  Is that not the sort of thing that may well happen if certain sections of the community&mdash;say the Labour Party, or Sinn Féin, or some other Party of a radical kind that may break from Fianna Fáil when the Taoiseach has disappeared from the political scene&mdash;cannot get political representation in this House because under the single non-transferable vote the great Parties will prevent them? They can combine together and in one constituency say: &ldquo;You go for that&rdquo;, and in another constituency say: &ldquo;You go for that&rdquo;.  By that Popular Front they will break down any system on this direct vote of which the Taoiseach is so very fond, and that, as I say, may be productive of revolutionary <Col N="326" /> results, injurious results which we cannot now see.</P>
    <P>I do most earnestly recommend those members of the Dáil who are open to conviction, and I shall recommend it to the people on every opportunity that presents itself, to consider what they are doing.  I recommend them not to take this leap in the dark which the present Government want them to take, to consider that the present system has produced not the results that everybody believed but some useful results.  To quote the Taoiseach's words in 1936&mdash;&ldquo;It has worked reasonably well and we know it&rdquo;.  Find out what the defects are&mdash; and there are defects&mdash;and change it if you like but at least examine it before you take this leap in the dark and before you try to mould the future when you do not know the conditions of the future.</P>
    <P>May I repeat that we are in a period of political change?  We have had political growth since 1922 of a different character.  We are now going into a position where those who were not born in 1936, when we were debating P.R., will be voting in this referendum and where people who are now only 17 years of age will be voting in the next general election. How do we know what they will do? Do you think this country is going to remain permanently Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour?  There will be very radical changes in the political outlook of this country&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;very radical changes. Why on the very threshold of these changes should we come forward with a revolutionary proposal of this kind?  There is nothing that makes for stability of Government and the institutions of Government&mdash;and what is far more required, respect for the institutions of Government&mdash;than the building up of a soundly-based political tradition and the parliamentary tradition.  I believe that the only way to secure that tradition, the only way to secure real respect for political institutions, is to let these institutions <Col N="327" /> have their natural growth and not interfere with them by artificial means, productive of results that we know not.  That is what is being tried in these proposals&mdash;to try by artificial means to create two new sets of political Parties.  You will not do it effectively.  It will result in injurious results.  Artificial means may produce passing results for a short time but they will not produce beneficial results; they certainly will not be permanent and they will not inure to the benefit of the country, or do what is most urgently required&mdash;to create a sound tradition and respect for institutions of Government and the members of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting after a number of years, to be back again facing the Leader of the Opposition on this topic.  It is particularly interesting to endeavour to see how much we have in common in our outlook and on what points we differ. The Leader of the Opposition in opposing the introduction into the Constitution of the system of P.R. as it is with the transferable vote, pointed out that he was against the system of the transferable vote because it led to a multiplicity of Parties.  Well, we agree on that I hope.  I did not say anything about that.  I did not deny that, and I have not at any time said anything contrary to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>But Deputy Costello did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not here.  The Leader of the Opposition has been talking to me and, for the moment, give me the satisfaction of talking to him.  In regard to the principle involved, I say that we agree, as far as the Leader of the Opposition and myself are concerned.  I cannot say if our views will be shared by other Members on either side of the House.  We do agree, I take it, that the present system leads to a multiplicity of Parties.  At that time Deputy Costello desired that this should not be put into the Constitution.  I believed that that was a wrong way to approach this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Leader of the Opposition <Col N="328" /> will agree that on the method of election depends the method by which this House is formed and that it is this House which is the centre of the political institutions of this State, so that the method of election is of tremendous importance.  In view of the remarks he made about the Constituency Commission, he surely cannot deny that political Parties will be inclined to make rules to favour themselves, if it is a matter to be settled here in this House alone.</P>
    <P>I think he will agree&mdash;whether he will or not I do not know; he did not agree before&mdash;that, if there is any matter to be fixed in the Constitution, the method of election should be fixed. Otherwise Parties will manoeuvre in various ways to try to make the rules favour themselves.  So that it is desirable, above all things, if anything is to be fixed in the Constitution and not left to be settled by the Legislature from year to year, or election to election, that a method should be fixed by which those who come into the House are chosen by the people. That was the issue between us at the time.  He wanted the method flexible, and I said it was flexible to this extent, that the Constitution itself can be changed, by the people, but not by those who are elected to Parliament, to the Dáil here, who, in their different Parties, would have natural tendencies to try to work the rules in favour of themselves.  That was the difference between us at the time.</P>
    <P>There was a further matter.  I had to put the Constitution to the country. I was anxious that that Constitution should be enacted by the people, particularly anxious because I felt it had all the difference between a free Constitution and a Constitution that had in certain fundamental ways been imposed on us.  I was anxious that the people should enact their own fundamental law, and I did not want, as far as possible, to have any new issues created, except the single issue I was anxious about, and that was having a Constitution which was prepared by the representatives of the people here, approved here in the Dáil and submitted to the people as their own fundamental law, which I <Col N="329" /> felt would afterwards be entitled to be respected by all the citizens.</P>
    <P>I was anxious, therefore, not to change anything that we could put up with.  As regards P.R., as far as I am concerned, the history of it in my mind has been this.  I was President of the Sinn Féin Organisation back in 1919.  I think it was at the Ard-Fheis at that time, or about that time in any case, that I had to express a view on the matter, and I spoke in favour of P.R. because, as I said then, it seemed just or equitable.  At the time, I knew perfectly well that the majority of our people were in favour of our policy.  I knew that no matter what purposes the British Parliament, or the British Ministers who introduced it in their Parliament, had in mind&mdash; they made clear what they were thinking of: they had hoped it would break or weaken Sinn Féin&mdash;the position in the country was so strong that they could not do that and I was anxious at that time that there should be no suggestion that we were in any way inclined to penalise minorities. It was not our idea.  I supported it, therefore, and urged the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis&mdash;I think it was&mdash;and I urged our people throughout the country to go ahead with it.</P>
    <P>The fact was I felt we should not bother about it at that time but I will admit I felt, as most theorists in looking at this would feel, that it does give Parties representation.  But it does lead to multiplicity of Parties.  That was the beginning of my view back in 1919.</P>
    <P>Time went on and we came to 1937. Looking at it from the 1937 point of view, it had not up to then worked badly, at any rate from certain points of view.  I was able to say that it had served us fairly well, and in supporting the introduction of it into-the Constitution&mdash;that was against the Opposition at the time&mdash;I said: &ldquo;We will put it in.&rdquo; The Constitution had not been in operation for very long&mdash; until 1938 or so&mdash;when I think you will find&mdash;I know they have been found for me&mdash;that there were quite a number of times when I spoke, from 1938 onwards to 1943 in various places, and I pointed out&mdash;I think as far back <Col N="330" /> as 1938&mdash;that if P.R. did lead here to the multiplicity of Parties which it had led to in other places it would be bad for the country and that I would propose that it should be abolished if it led to those results.  The first time that these results became, apparent to the people, and apparent in their full nakedness to me, was in 1948&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because you had Parties going before the people then and getting votes on the pretence that they were going to remain independent, that they would not coalesce.  Then when the election was over, without any consultation with the people, they formed a Government of all types of Parties, and I was as certain at the time as I am of my existence that public opinion, if it were expressed at the time that body that formed the Government was constituted, if they were to go to the country within six weeks of the time that Government was formed, public opinion would have swept them out of office.</P>
      <P>It was pretended that because votes were given for a whole variety of Parties, these votes would necessarily be against us.  There was much against each of the sections and the Parties, certainly much more of the votes that were given were not in favour of Fine Gael.  They certainly were not in favour of the Labour Party.  They were not in favour of any of these sections, and why were they supposed to be voting against us when we got the vast majority of the votes compared with any one of these Parties?  We got more votes at that time than all the other organised Parties put together; yet each one of these sections pretended that votes which were cast were votes for Fine Gael, for Labour, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan, and so on.  That was absurd&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They were votes for the different individual sections that got the votes that were given for <Col N="331" /> them.  There was no vote given at that time for a coalition.  Immediately afterwards, the people were astounded at the happenings in the various bodies that coalesced at that time.</P>
      <P>A Deputy stated that the 1927 advertisement was not against P.R., that is, the Cumann na nGaedheal advertisement. It was against coalitions.  I am not against P.R. of any kind, but I am against coalitions that result from it.  I think it leads to a multiplicity of small Parties, which leads, inevitably, to coalitions.  Deputy Corish spoke a few minutes ago, and I think Deputy Costello repeated it when he asked: &ldquo;What would you do if you are not able to have a single Party returned in a majority?  You will have to have coalitions.&rdquo; Of course, you will.  But what you want to consider is: is it desirable that you should have a succession of these, that you should have no chance of anything else, practically, but these?  That is the issue.</P>
      <P>In regard to the representation of Parties, what is the whole idea of representative democracy?  What does it really mean?  It means that we have here people who represent the community.  Who is going to tell me, if you divide Ireland or the.  Twenty-Six Counties into 100 or 120 areas, or whatever number of divisions with single member constituencies you may have, that you will not have as good representation of the people as you will have by any system?  Each area will be able to choose by majority the person they think is best suited, and surely if any group in this House has any policy in relation to national interests, it ought to hope some time to get an opportunity to implement that policy.  If Parties have any faith in their policies, they ought to hope for majorities in their favour in the various constituencies.</P>

      <P>Is the Labour Party telling me that, if Ireland is divided up into 100 sections.  Labour will not be able to get representation in any one of those?  If so, it means that Labour and Labour interests are otherwise represented in other Parties. as they have been in the past.</P>
      <P>If we were beginning here and did not have any experience behind us, if we were simply starting to build up a representative democracy, what would we naturally set out to do?  We would divide the country up into areas so that the people in those areas would have a fair idea of what their interests were.  There would be a number of candidates put up, and the voters would choose from among them the person who would best represent the interests of the community.  The person who is representing a particular constituency does not when he is elected and comes into this House, represent merely those who have voted for him; he should represent the interests of the whole community as best he can, within the larger community of the nation as a whole.</P>
      <P>If we were beginning again, if we had not the present Parties formed, we would not think in the narrow sense of Parties as such.  It is quite right and natural that groups in the community, if they have common interests and common aims, should try to unite so as to get as many as possible to support them.  There is nothing in the proposed system to prevent that.  That occurs in every community, wherever this system has been worked.  It occurs in America.  Some people are talking about this as if it were something tried in Britain alone.  That is not true.  It has been tried and worked very largely in the areas which have parliamentary institutions like ours. Our type, in the way in which the Ministers are responsible to the Dáil, and so on, is nearer to that of Britain, Canada, New Zealand and so on, than to those in other countries.  There has been a long test of this principle in those countries; and it has not stopped the representation of any groups where there is a sufficiently strong number to support them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this country is divided up into areas of a reasonable size, that is much <Col N="333" /> more convenient for the voters.  The people know their own particular interests better.  They have a better chance of choosing their representative, and, when that person is elected and comes in here to the National Parliament, he naturally thinks of the community of the constituency as a whole.  He has to think of them and their general interests, because when he goes back for re-election, if he wishes to be re-elected, he knows very well that he must represent those people in such a way that he will once more get the largest number of votes that may be going to any candidate in the area.</P>
    <P>This whole matter has been the subject of considerable political thought.  I am not one of those who care to deal with what is done in other countries, because I have had too much of it, or at least I have lived sufficiently long to know that there are vast differences between conditions in various countries.  There have been political people, however, interested in political matters, who have given a great deal of thought to this point and take the view that, looking over the working of these systems, this straightforward system works best.</P>
    <P>We have been told that we should look at the Six Counties.  The position there is very different from ours.  I suppose that here, after a while, people get to know the political opinions of their neighbours in a particular area and can say: &ldquo;This man will vote Labour; that man is likely to vote for Fine Gael; this one for Fianna Fáil,&rdquo; and so on.  That is true; but they do not know for certain, and there are changes over from one side to the other.  There are people who voted for us at one time but who may vote for Labour now; and people who voted Labour at one time may vote for us now; and the same thing may happen in the case of Fine Gael.  Individuals throughout the country may change. We do not know in advance what would happen, because of the secret ballot.  In the Six Counties, however, the unfortunate position is that the political opinions follow very largely on religious lines, and whether you are a Catholic or a Protestant is pretty <Col N="334" /> easily known.  Therefore, it is not at all difficult for anybody sitting down and looking at the particular area to go through the inhabitants of that area, if they want to gerrymander.  It is easy to gerrymander in the North, and gerrymandering has been done there because it is easy.  It is not easy to do it down here.  It would be very difficult.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be done in perhaps a few places.  I do not know on what basis it could be done.  I do not know anything about it.  I know the principle on which it would work and, if I had a certain section and if I knew that a certain <i>bloc</i> here would undoubtedly vote one way and another <i>bloc</i> there would vote the other way, I could arrange it, but that is not the way it is with us.  There are no such areas where there are <i>blocs</i> like that whose votes continue the same from one period to another.  Therefore, gerrymandering down here is not possible in the same way.</P>
      <P>However, it would be suggested that it would be possible, and for that reason we propose to have the Constituency Commission.  I do not want to talk about the commission at this stage, but we will have to deal with it at some stage.  The point is that this straightforward method works in this way, that the people of the particular constituency will be thinking of the best person to represent them.  They know fairly well that, if a number of candidates were put up who were not likely to get a fairly good vote, there would be no use in sending them up. They know also the danger there would be of a division of votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general tendency of this straightforward system is to try to bring about unity, to the extent of getting the voters in an area to say: &ldquo;We have made up our minds; and instead of writing down 1, 2, 3 and so on, we want this man or woman to represent this constituency&rdquo;.  The whole effect of that is to change the attitude of the voter, so that it may be: &ldquo;We have to think of our constituency; we have to think of the country; we have <Col N="335" /> to think of the policy&rdquo;.  All these are before the people at election time. The worst about Coalitions formed after an election is that each Party goes out to the people and proclaims a certain policy which they know they can never have a chance of putting through.</P>

      <P>They know perfectly well they can make the most extraordinary proposals, knowing they never can get a complete majority in the House.  It is possible for them to make the most extravagant proposals and get a lot of people to think that in voting for them they are voting for a policy which contains these proposals.</P>
      <P>In other words, the present system leads to defeating what ought to be the fundamental aim in an election&mdash;the right of the people to decide upon policy&mdash;as the policy is not made before the election, but is the result of whatever bargainings those Parties have to make when the election is over. Neither I nor those who support this Bill wish to mould the future.  We cannot mould it.  It is being moulded as it is in the Constitution.  We believe that the form of the mould will be there, and it can be changed, if at any time it is found to be unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble is that when this system of a multiplicity of Parties and Coalitions has got in and has reached a certain stage, it is impossible for the people, practically short of a revolution, to change it.  As I have said several times, one of the reasons we are proposing that it should be changed now is we have a majority single Party enabled to put it through the Dáil and, I hope, through the Seanad, thus giving the people an opportunity of deciding for themselves. Ultimately, the people will have to decide this, but if the situation in 1948 had continued and if you had further multiplication of Parties, it would have been impossible to get a majority of the House in favour of letting the people decide.  Now the people will be given an opportunity of deciding&mdash;I <Col N="336" /> will be frank about it&mdash;because we have a single Party majority here.  If we had a compound majority, formed of a group of Parties, it could not be done.  Each particular Party would be so interested in keeping it the other way, it could not be done.</P>
    <P>There is this question as to whether we regard Parties as fundamental or whether we regard representation of the community as fundamental. Parties will arise, but we should not have a system that encourages the multiplication of artificial Parties. There will be Parties here arising out of the immediate circumstances.  If I were a young man in the Labour Party to-day, I certainly would not go into despair in the way in which some members of that Party seem to be.  If I were a member of the Fine Gael Party and had faith in my views, I certainly would not be afraid of the proposal.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is made that this is intended to keep Fianna Fáil in office for a considerable time.  I do not know how that can be contended.</P>

      <P>I do not know how it can be contended.  The people will have to determine that.  At each election the people will have an opportunity of deciding between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and any other Parties going forward.  There is no question of denying anybody.  In fact, there may be quite a number of Independents, for all I know.  Under this system, from one point of view, an Independent has a better chance.  If there is a good man in a community, looked upon by the community as representing the community, that man has a good chance of being elected against any Party.  Running a campaign in a small constituency does not require anything like the support required in large, three- or five-member constituencies.  There is no basis for the suggestion that this will block out individuals from being elected or prevent a Party from being formed.  If a Party has a national programme, a <Col N="337" /> social programme, or whatever it may be, that will commend itself to the people, there is nothing in this suggestion to prevent them going forward.</P>
      <P>Let us look at where the system we propose is working and see what is happening.  I do say that it does not tend so much to create these Parties. What generally happens is that you have various sections of the community represented to varying extents in the major Parties, because it does tend to discourage the creation of a number of small Parties, which, in most cases, are purely artificial.  They do not represent any fundamental differences in the community.  What happens is that somebody comes along and thinks, if he is able to get in on an election, that when he forms a Party, he will be assured of a seat in the Government.  That is the temptation, allurement or urging for the formation of purely artificial Parties that have no fundamental point of difference.  If there is a Party with a fundamental point of difference and it feels that this is such that it is worthy of being maintained, of course it will get into power ultimately, if it has the support of the people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton says this does not express the views of the majority. Even P.R. may not express the views of the majority.  If you go over these things, you will find defects in any particular system.  The majority in Parliament will not always correspond to the views of a majority of the community.  Although you have these artificial Parties, there are quite a number of other people not belonging to these Parties whose views it is desirable should, somehow or other, find expression.  There is freedom of expression in a democracy.  Within the ordinary law you have absolute freedom, provided you do not abuse it and make a licence of it in such a way that you make democracy itself impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to some of the arguments, one would think this was a proposal to prevent the formation of Parties, prevent individuals going up for election and prevent the free expression of the people's will.  It is nothing of the kind. My own belief is that this system leads <Col N="338" /> to more fundamental stability than the other system.  It has been said that the other system has worked well up to the present.  One of my arguments was that we found it worked all right up to 1937.  Looking back&mdash;I think Deputy Costello expressed himself in the same terms&mdash;we remember that the period over which we look has been in a way rather an exceptional period in our political history.  The Sinn Féin body was divided.  We had a fundamental difference between the two sides.  That persisted over a long number of years.  With slight variations, that division continued as the dominating issue over all that period. As Deputy Costello mentioned in the debate on the Constitution, if you have not some dominant issue like that, this tendency to split up into small groups of artificial Parties is likely to come into existence.</P>
    <P>I think these differences have gradually worked themselves out. There are three or four things which we have in common.  We agree in accepting the fundamental institutions here and that we will do everything in our power to bring about the unity of our country.  I hope we agree also in desiring to bring about the restoration of the language.  To a large extent, the differences have been now wiped out.  Consequently, not having some big issue to divide the people, and to divide them so that they would be in two groups, the tendency will be to split up into these minor, artificial, small Parties.  That is a danger to our political future.</P>
    <P>We are as politically minded as any people in the world.  We have, I think, in this country a certain genius for politics, and our people, in the main, have shown that genius in those Parties to which they are affiliated. It is rather important that these fundamental abilities which we have should move in the right direction instead of in a direction which might not ultimately be in the best interests of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the single-member constituency will not give the variety that P.R. throws up.  There is no reason why public opinion as a whole should not be amply reflected <Col N="339" /> in the two or three major Parties. There is no reason why the public interest should not be amply reflected likewise in two or three major Parties. Parties are, after all, composed of individuals, and not all individuals in a Party think alike.  Every member of a Party represents, first of all, his own view and then the views of those who think like him.  It is quite wrong, therefore, to argue that one will not have proper representation under the single-seat system because under that system there will be no room for representation of what might be described as artificial Parties.  I believe there will be proper representation for all, and consequently I believe that the single-member constituency will be far better from the point of view of variety of representation than the system we have at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If Lord Brookeborough permits himself the intellectual treat of reading the Taoiseach's speech, he will surely find great consolation in doing so because the Taoiseach has now arrived at the conclusion that the Six-County Government were perfectly right when they abolished P.R., notwithstanding the fact that he denounced their action in doing so at the time.</P>
      <P>The more one listens to the speeches of the Taoiseach, the Minister for External Affairs, and other Government spokesmen, the more one is convinced that the British are really a remarkable people, because we are now being offered by the Fianna Fáil Government here in Ireland the opportunity of following the example of the British in their method of parliamentary election.  We are told that it is only where you have the British method of election, the single non-transferable vote, that you have stability.  You have stability in the Six Counties, we are told you have stability in New Zealand; you have stability in Canada; you have stability in Britain, according to the Government spokesmen; and, therefore, our people are now being asked to forget all this nonsense about breaking the connection with Britain, to forget all about the separation talk, and follow the British system of election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> In Western Europe to-day, with the exception of France, Portugal and Spain, there is no single non-transferable vote operative.  In half a dozen of the smaller European countries&mdash; Sweden, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Switzerland, Norway&mdash;there is the single transferable vote and the multiple constituency.  In every single one of these, the respective Governments have been able to give the people a better standard of living, an incomparably higher standard of living than that which obtains here.  But, instead of looking at the Swedish example, the Swiss example, or the Dutch example, this Government can find, for comparison purposes here, only the example of fragments of the British Commonwealth; and we are asked now to follow the British in their method of election, whether that method is operative in Canada, the Six Counties or in Britain itself.  That is the advice now being offered to us by the very man who, in 1937, thought that P.R. had given us a stability, a balance in parliamentary government and a balance in legislation superior to that which obtained in any other country of which he knew.</P>
    <P>How can one trust the recommendations of a man, or of a Government of which he is a member, when he tells one one thing one year and, without any substantial change in the domestic situation, recommends a completely different thing for completely different reasons subsequently?  That is what the Taoiseach has done now.  It is quite clear that the wheel has turned full circle so far as the Taoiseach and his outlook on the British method of parliamentary election is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us that P.R. produces a multiplicity of Parties. Is not the logical thing to do, faced with a contention of that kind, to ask the Taoiseach to produce evidence from his own country, which he knows well, that P.R. has produced a multiplicity of Parties?  We have, in fact, a record of what constitutes a Party.  In 1923, there were four Parties: Sinn Féin, or Fianna Fáil, whichever you like to call it; Cumann na nGaedheal; Labour; and the Farmers' Party.  Three of those Parties were represented here.  One was not represented at that time.  If <Col N="341" /> one says to-day that a political Party must constitute as low a figure as four members, then, applying that test to today's conditions, you have in fact only three Parties in this House.  I agree there are other Parties, but their numerical strength is less than four. Between 1923, therefore, and 1959, there has not been much variation.  We had four Parties in 1923 and, by a test of a minimum of four members, we have three Parties in 1959.  Yet, the Taoiseach says that P.R. is producing a multiplicity of Parties.  In fact, more Parties were born and died under the P.R. system here than grew to maturity.</P>
    <P>At one time we had a Party known as the People's Party.  We had a Party known as the National League. We had a Farmers' Party, so described. We had a Centre Party.  All these were born, came into being, and died.  The three Parties which were here in 1923&mdash;the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, the Sinn Féin or Fianna Fáil Party, and the Labour Party have maintained their major characteristics over the past 27 years. The Taoiseach's argument, therefore, that P.R. produces a multiplicity of Parties is not well founded.  Yet, that is the Taoiseach's main argument for getting rid of P.R.  He says he wants to get rid of P.R. because it leads to the creation and maintenance of a large number of small Parties.  But P.R. has not done that here and, if the cause for the abolition of P.R. rests on that argument, then that is not an argument at all for its abolition.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says it is better to have one Deputy representing one constituency so that he can represent all the people in that constituency.  It is an utter absurdity to imagine that a Deputy can represent all the people in a constituency.  It just cannot be done.  There are only two Division Lobbies here&mdash;for or against a proposal. A Deputy can go into only one of them.  If he goes into one Lobby, he is representing a point of view which is indicated by whether he votes in favour of a proposal or against it but, in so far as there are people in his constituency who are in <Col N="342" /> favour of that proposal, if he votes against it, then he is not representing all the people in his constituency.  He could represent all the people in his constituency only if he were allowed to go into as many Division Lobbies as there were varieties of opinion in his constituency.  Therefore, all this kindergarten talk about representing all the people in a constituency is not based on reality at all because it just cannot be done.  If that is an argument in favour of the abolition of P.R., then it is the most absurd argument I have ever heard.</P>
    <P>Now, let us come to the third case which has been made by the Taoiseach in favour of the single non-transferable vote.  The Taoiseach suggests that any Party in the country which got a majority could get seats in the House.  That is not so, of course. You do not need to get a majority under the British system of election which the Taoiseach is recommending to the House.  Will any member of the Government deny that, if P.R. is abolished and the single non-transferable vote is introduced, with single-member constituencies, it will be possible for a candidate who gets 30 per cent. of the votes, while all the other candidates get 70 per cent. of the votes, to be elected and that all those who aggregate 70 per cent. will fail to secure any representation in the House?</P>
    <P>The method of voting which Fianna Fáil now recommend to the electorate means that if a candidate can manage to secure 30 per cent. of the votes in a general election he can gain the seat, notwithstanding the fact that votes secured by all the other candidates in the same constituency aggregate 70 per cent.  This is recommended to us as a democratic method of election which now attracts the Taoiseach. It attracts him, of course, because he hopes that Fianna Fáil for some years to come will be able to get the 30 per cent. that all the others will fail to get more than 30 per cent. as a single Party and that, therefore, Fianna Fáil can hold on to parliamentary control and to government even though they have not secured the majority of votes in a constituency or <Col N="343" /> in the country.  By what process of reasoning does the Taoiseach imagine that he can induce people to believe that it is a more democratic method to allow a person to take a seat in this House while getting a minority of the votes cast than to compel him to secure a majority of the votes cast?</P>
    <P>Under P.R., a person who votes is assured that his vote will have full significance in the election of a Deputy.  If a person votes No. 1 for a candidate and that candidate is elected with the quota, well and good, that person's vote has been fully effective. If the candidate is not elected, the No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 votes can be made effective in the course of subsequent counts.  Under the system of the single non-transferable vote a person may vote for any one of four candidates but in a system of election where 30 per cent. will elect a candidate for a constituency, all those people who make up the other 70 per cent. of the votes cast might as well have stayed at home that day because their 70 per cent. votes are cast in circumstances in which a 30 per cent. vote wins the seat and their votes are completely ineffective. That cannot be said of P.R. A vote under P.R. is effective until the last Deputy is elected for the particular constituency but under the other system it could be possible that one-third of the votes or, perhaps, no more than one-third of the votes cast on polling day would be effective and the other 66 per cent. would be ineffective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Three arguments have been given to us for the abolition of P.R. The first is that such abolition makes for stability and we are invited to look at the Six Counties where conditions are ideal and most suitable so far as the Taoiseach is concerned, and to look at New Zealand, Canada, and Britain.  We are not invited to look at six of the finest democracies comparable in size and with somewhat similar economies which are available for observation in Europe.  European examples do not count in this matter; <Col N="345" /> the Taoiseach is saturated with the British example.  We are invited to believe that it is only in parts of the British Commonwealth that there is stability, the inference being that there is no stability in these six excellent democracies to which we send delegations from time to time during the year inviting them, because of their vibrant economies, to come over here and establish industries.  We are told that it is better to have the single non-transferable vote because it is the most democratic method.  I have shown that there are examples of other countries which demonstrate that the single non-transferable vote makes for a minority Parliament and a minority Government.</P>
      <P>We have been told that this Bill is in the interests of the nation when, in fact, it has been conceded and recommended to the House to serve not the interests of the nation but the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Whilst Fianna Fáil have a majority in this House at the moment, they hope to be able to steam-roll this Bill through the House and to steamroll it through the country and then their tenure of office would be extended because it could not be extended by a continuation of the P.R. system.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach talked about the P.R. system perpetuating the existence of Parties for whose existence there are only artificial reasons.  What the Taoiseach wants to do, and what the other Ministers have indicated they want to do, is to create a two-Party system under which, if you are not in the Government Party, then no matter what your opinions are, you have got to get into the Opposition Party.  In other words, if you apply it to present day circumstances, what the Taoiseach suggests is that the next election should be conducted on the basis that Fianna Fáil would stand as one Party and that there would be another Party opposed to the Fianna Fáil Party in which there would be Fine Gael, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democratic Party and the Sinn Féin Party. They are all to constitute the Opposition to the Fianna Fáil Party at the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could absurdity go any lower than <Col N="346" /> to imagine you can create a situation of that kind in this country?  Can anybody imagine that you can get five or six Parties&mdash;let us forget about the numbers for the moment and think of the fact that they have a separate existence&mdash;to amalgamate with their different points of view, in one Party?  Of course, you cannot.  To attempt to create a single Party by these artificial methods would produce in this country a situation which, I think, is far more dangerous than any imaginary situation which the Taoiseach is apparently attempting to deal with to-day.  So far as I can discover what the Fianna Fáil attitude is, they want to maintain a Fianna Fáil Government; they want a single Opposition and everybody who is not in the Government Party must get into the Opposition Party.</P>
    <P>That will not happen in this country.  I believe that the need for it will not arise in this country.  I am satisfied that this Bill is a Bill to get control into the hands of the Government Party caucus.  I believe that, when the facts in all their nakedness are brought before the people on the occasion of the referendum, the people will not be willing to give into the hands of the Fianna Fáil Party a power which they have been unwilling to give to any other Party during the past 40 years.</P>
    <P>There is no demand by the people for the abolition of P.R.  There is no demand by any Party, except the Government Party, for the abolition of P.R. The Government Party want to abolish P.R. for the sole purpose of perpetuating their retention of office, even though they may be able to do that only by securing a minority of the votes.  To recommend this Bill to us as a democratic safeguard, as a method of giving the people wider exercise of democratic rights, is a humbug and a fraudulent pretence.  I believe that, once that has been explained to the people, the Government will get in the referendum the hiding these proposals really deserve.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach was speaking this evening on this section of the Schedule, I think it will be agreed, as Deputy Norton pointed out, that any arguments he <Col N="347" /> put up were pure theorising.  There was nothing practical with regard to his arguments.  In fact, the entire speech brought out exactly what the Leader of the Opposition stated when he defined this measure now being proposed by the Government as an invitation to the people of this country to take a leap in the dark.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear from every speech made by Fianna Fáil spokesmen that they are simply guessing as to what may happen or may not happen, if this legislation is enacted by the House and subsequently adopted by the people at a referendum.  The Minister for External Affairs went to some Fianna Fáil gathering over the week-end and, once again, came out with what appears to be one of the main Fianna Fáil arguments against P.R. and in favour of this measure proposed by the Government, namely, that the system of P.R. was imposed on us by the British.  I wonder does a man of the intelligence of the Minister for Health accept that as an attitude.</P>

      <P>I do not set myself up as a judge.  When I think of the experience of the Minister that Deputy Norton has had over a great number of years, in my innocence, I am prepared to accept the Minister for Health as a man of intelligence&mdash; as one who has won his place on the Fianna Fáil Front Bench and in the council chambers of the Fianna Fáil Party by his intelligence and ability. I am asking him, as the Minister in charge of the House at the moment, does he seriously put forward, as a sound argument in favour of this proposal, that P.R. was imposed on us by the British?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood the position to be that <Col N="348" /> Fianna Fáil were proud of the fact that the people of this country, even though by a minority for it, adopted the Constitution of 1937 which had enshrined in it the provision that our electoral system should be the present one&mdash;the system of P.R. coupled with the single transferable vote.  If that Constitution, with that provision in it, was adopted by the people of this country freely and openly when they voted on the Constitution of 1937, would Fianna Fáil, for goodness' sake. give up this talk about P.R. being imposed on us by the British.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but apparently the Fianna Fáil reasoning seems to be that if they can get it across to the country that P.R. was imposed on us by the British, the people will immediately run away from it.  They do not seem to realise that what they are asking the people to do is to adopt in its place the British system of election, the system used in England, in Northern Ireland, and in most, if not all, of the countries of the British Empire.  While the Minister for External Affairs went to some Fianna Fáil gathering over the week-end to solemnly propound the weighty argument against P.R. that it was imposed on us by the British, nevertheless, a couple of days earlier he said in the House, at columns 253 and 254 of the Official Report of 8th January:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not know whether Deputy O'Higgins thinks he is going to make every Deputy who supports this amendment of the Constitution run away and hide his head simply because the Deputy elects to describe it as the English system.  The British people have many good things.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs is prepared to concede, while he is talking in this House, that there is nothing necessarily to be afraid of, or to run away from, or to be ashamed of, in following British example in one way or another, but, by implication in the sentence I have read out, he accepts that the proposals put before us by the <Col N="349" /> Government are inviting us to adopt here the English electoral system instead of the system which has been the Irish electoral system for the past 36 years.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about that in any event.  Fianna Fáil, while they use invalidly as an argument, that P.R. was imposed on us by the British, are, in fact, asking us to accept and adopt the British system in its place. When the Minister for External Affairs spoke here this afternoon, he referred to the importance of the people knowing how the Parties stood prior to an election.  I have asked Fianna Fáil spokesmen in the past, and I ask them again, if they are so concerned with the importance of the people knowing how political Parties stand on a particular issue before an election, why is it that no member of the Fianna Fáil Party in the last general election sought support from the electorate, on a proposal to abolish our electoral system and replace the Irish P.R. system with the English direct vote system? Why did not the Minister for Health, the Minister for External Affairs or any other Fianna Fáil Minister go before the people in the last general election, and tell them they were hatching out this plot to do away with the electoral system, to abolish P.R., if they got a majority in this House?</P>
    <P>If I understood the Taoiseach correctly when he was speaking here this afternoon, he gave as one of the reasons why this system was written into the Constitution, that he wanted to get the Constitution through&mdash;he wanted to get it passed&mdash;and if he had opted not to put P.R. into the Constitution, there were people who might have voted against the Constitution who otherwise would have supported it, if that system were enshrined in it.</P>
    <P>Were not the same tactics, or very much the same tactics, adopted by Fianna Fáil on the occasion of the last general election?  Is not the whole implication of what they have done, that they felt and in fact knew, that if they told the people they were hatching out a plot to abolish P.R., they would not have got an overall majority in this House?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> The majority they got was got, not because of any increased volume of support for the Fianna Fáil Party; it was a majority obtained to a great extent by default&mdash;the default of supporters of the other political Parties who remained away from the polls. If Fianna Fáil had disclosed their plan at that general election, is there anyone sitting on those benches who will be courageous enough to make the claim that they would, in those circumstances, have obtained an overall majority?</P>
    <P>When we hear the Minister for External Affairs and other Fianna Fáil spokesmen using the argument now that they are making this proposition at this stage, because they have an overall majority and because if it is not done now, another opportunity may never arise, is that not because Fianna Fáil realise that having disclosed the plot they have hatched out, they cannot risk going before the people again under our present electoral system, because they know exactly what reception they could expect from the people, because of their manoeuvring with regard to the system of election. We have heard the Minister for Health challenge Deputy Norton&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health challenged Deputy Norton with regard to this question of the direct vote system leading possibly to a minority Government.  I do not think there can be any serious doubt about that.  I ask the Minister for Health to agree with the proposition which Deputy Mulcahy made to the Taoiseach on the last occasion on which this Bill was being discussed in the House.  It is quite clear&mdash;it is not open to doubt&mdash;that under the English <Col N="351" /> system which Fianna Fáil proposes should now be adopted in this country, it is possible that a candidate getting only 30 per cent of the votes in a constituency could become the Deputy for that constituency.  If there are a number of candidates in a single-seat constituency without the transferable vote, under the English system the candidate who secures the highest number of votes on the first count gets the seat. If one candidate obtains 5,000 votes, another 4,000 votes, another 3,000 votes and another 2,000 votes, the candidate receiving the 5,000 votes gets the seat, although he is in a substantial minority of the total votes cast in that constituency.</P>
      <P>That is not the position under P.R. If we take, as an example, the by-elections held under the present voting system, at least the victorious candidate in the by-election, even if he starts off without heading the poll, can claim that he genuinely represents the majority opinion in that constituency, that by the time the first preference votes and the other preferences are sifted, he has secured the widest area of consent and support.  That is the essential difference between the Irish system and the English system, that under the English system, it is possible for a person to be elected to represent a constituency and be the only representative, although he is in a substantial minority in the constituency.  That cannot happen under our present electoral system.  Any Party or any candidate obtaining a majority of the votes in any constituency here will obtain the seat, or a majority of the seats in this House.  It is possible under the English system which the Government propose should be adopted here that a Government may be elected with a very substantial majority in this House, although they obtained only a minority of votes in the general election which brought them into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to use this opportunity to record any further on the records of this House statements made by the Taoiseach and others in years gone by.  The Taoiseach made quite clear to-day that his animosity to the Irish electoral system is because of the <Col N="352" /> inter-Party Governments which put Fianna Fáil out of office in 1948 and 1954.  Deputy Norton pointed out that, by and large over the years since the Irish State was established, there have been only two or three major Parties in this House.  The electoral system which we have been using has not justified the charges, the fears or the apprehensions of a multiplicity of Parties which Fianna Fáil allege against us.  But, even if it did do that, surely the Irish people are entitled to make up their own minds as to who will come into this House to represent them?</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Second Reading of this debate the Minister for Health wandered all over the globe to give Deputies a lecture on electoral systems in Europe and elsewhere.  It is time the Minister for Health and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party came to a realisation of the fact that we are discussing the Irish electoral system in an Irish context.  It is time they realised that we are Irishmen. It is time they realised that we are not Italians, Germans or Afrikanders or anything else.  It is time they realised we are entitled to make up our own minds as to who will represent us.  If the people of this country want an inter-Party Government they are entitled to have it.  No Fianna Fáil Government is entitled to say to the people of Ireland: &ldquo;You may have only a Fianna Fáil Government or a Government composed of any other single Party.&rdquo; If the people want an inter-Party Government they are quite entitled to vote for one and there is no doubt but that, in the general election of 1954, the people voted for just that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach complained that, when the general elections preceding the formation of inter-Party Governments were held, the people were voting for Fine Gael or Labour, as the case might be.  He complained that it was not fair that the people who voted for Labour should then find that they had supported the formation of a Government in which Fine Gael cooperated. There is nothing truer than that, in the years 1948 and 1954, the majority of the votes passed were cast against Fianna Fáil.  Whatever the people who voted for Labour and Fine <Col N="353" /> Gael and Clann na Talmhan wanted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At the last general election, Fianna Fáil secured an overall majority.  They did that without any great increase, without any worthwhile increase, in the number of votes cast for them as against the previous general election.  The principal point I wanted to make was that, no matter what Deputy Loughman or the Taoiseach or any other Fianna Fáil spokesman may say with regard to 1948, it was quite clear in 1954 that when the people voted Fianna Fáil out of office they were voting an inter-Party Government into office.  If the people want an inter-party Government in office they are entitled to get it.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are adopting the attitude that, so far as they are concerned and so far as they can bring it about, the people will not be given an opportunity of choosing anything except a one-Party Government in future.  I think that is a fair interpretation and in no way exaggerates the views and arguments of the Fianna Fáil Party in this matter.  They want to ensure, in so far as they can do so, that the people will not in the future get a choice of having anything except a one-Party Government in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being so, that being the whole tenor of the Fianna Fáil Party's arguments in favour of their proposal to introduce the English election system here, I fail to understand the Taoiseach's rather wishy-washy arguments this afternoon that Fianna Fáil are not trying to put Independents out of public life, that they are not trying to put Labour out, that they are not trying to put Fine Gael out.  He says to the Labour Party that if they have courage and faith in their Party there is no reason why they should not have confidence in the future under what he calls the &ldquo;straightforward system&rdquo;. He says the same thing to Fine Gael. Then he turns around and says that so <Col N="355" /> far as the Independents are concerned, there is no reason why they should not be represented under the new system.</P>
    <P>I understood the whole Fianna Fáil argument in favour of the new system to be that it would do away with the multiplicity of Parties, that it would do away with Independents.  I understood that the proposed change was to create a position whereby if you had one large Fianna Fáil Party in the House you might have another Party to oppose them on a very much smaller scale.  What exactly do Fianna Fáil want?  We know they do not want Coalitions&mdash;at any rate, Coalitions that will put Fianna Fáil out of office.  Is that not all that has happened in the years between 1937 and 1948?  Are there any other grounds, even in Fianna Fáil minds, for criticising the present Irish electoral system except the grounds that, on two occasions&mdash;in 1948 and again in 1954 &mdash;Fianna Fáil were put out of office and that Fianna Fáil, with a minority of votes, were not able to retain office despite the will of the Irish people?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil may hope that, if this legislation goes through and if on a minority vote&mdash;that is all that is necessary to carry this referendum in the country&mdash;they are able to secure that this referendum will be passed, they, in future, will continue to hold office whether or not they have the majority of the people behind them.  I join with Deputy Norton and the other speakers in hoping that the people will see to it that this proposal, even if it is passed by this House and by the Seanad, will not be allowed to pass unchallenged at the referendum.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Costello spoke on this clause, he was at great pains to show how devoted he was to the principle of P.R. and to explain that, when he made his now famous examination of the faults of that system, it was not because he was opposed to P.R. but that merely he loved it in spite of its faults.  It would be well for us, at least for the consistency of the speakers who are opposing this clause, to recall what their leader did say in 1937 with reference to this.</P>

      <P>I intend to quote at some length the speech of Deputy John A. Costello on the Constitution as reported at column 1345, Volume 67, of the Official Debates of 1st June, 1937. It begins as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As regards the abuses the President fears from the grouping of Parties, or from the intrigues that might go on, as a result of a large number of Parties being returned by P.R., I think that, to a certain extent, is inherent in any system of P.R.</P>
      <P>Let us see what, according to Deputy Costello, is inherent in the system of P.R.:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...fears from the grouping of Parties, or from the intrigues that might go on, as a result of a large number of Parties being returned by P.R.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello not merely expressed these fears but said these intrigues, these groupings of small Parties, were inseparable from the system of P.R. He then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have been fortunate or misfortunate, if you like, in this country in having two big political Parties with big issues dividing them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello did not think, as Deputy O'Higgins seems to think now, that this country suffered because in the main its political life has been dominated by two big political Parties. On the contrary, he seemed to think we were fortunate in having just the two big political Parties shaping the main political issues before the electorate. Then he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It may be&mdash;and the probability is&mdash;that in the course of time the issues that divide these Parties will be completely swept aside.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue that did divide us as to what the constitutional future of this country was to be was the aftermath of the civil war: whether we were to be a component State within the British Parliament <Col N="357" /> or whether we were to become an independent political entity.  We have become that independent political entity and everybody has accepted our Constitution.  There is no division between those who sit and support the present Government and those who sit and support the present leader of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>We are at one in this, that both of us have done what is the right thing by the country. Deputy Costello went on to say what was going to happen when the big issues had been swept aside:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Then we will have inevitably under the system of P.R. we have, a large number of Parties returned to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the system of the single transferable vote we are bound to have a large number of Parties returned.  Besides the main Parties, we might have a Farmers' Party, a Labour Party, a Country Party, a Town Party, and an Independent Party.  Whole groups of people <Col N="358" /> might be returned under P.R.  We always understood that the real defect under any system of P.R., and particularly the system of the single transferable vote, was that it led, in circumstances where there are no big economic issues before the country, to a large number of small Parties being returned&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With what consequences?  Here is the consequence which Deputy Costello foresaw in 1937.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;making for instability in government.  That is inherent in the system of P.R. and the single transferable vote.  If I might say so with respect, the President is deluding himself about this single transferable vote going to prevent, at a future time of emergency, a large number of small Parties arising.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is Deputy Costello's verdict on the system which he is defending to-day and he was speaking then on behalf of the official Opposition, of the Fine Gael opposition.</P>

We do know that its sole representative in the country is, if I may say so, a sort of sidekick of Deputy MacEoin.  We have the National Progressive Democratic Party or is it the Democratic National Progressive Party?  Every one of these has arisen under the system of P.R.  It is quite true that the people have found them out in time, as they found out Clann na Poblachta, and Clann na Talmhan, and as they would have found out, in due course, those who were members of the one time National Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I was pointing out that, in 1937, Deputy Costello seemed to be rather opposed to small Parties. To-day, of course, he professed his devotion to them.  I am not surprised because Fine Gael has been fed by small Parties which have broken away from other Parties and eventually, because no other Party would have them, drifted into Fine Gael.  Fine Gael has an insatiable maw for political adventurers and is always prepared to assimilate them and to try to grow fat on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1937, it is true that Deputy Costello professed some sort of devotion to the principle of P.R.  He pointed out, in fact, that he was in favour of it to some extent, but he did not point out what particular form of P.R. he favoured.  He accepted some sort of principle of P.R. but he condemned the one that exists here, every root and branch of it.  But, even in accepting this principle of P.R., in that vague and shadowy fashion which I mentioned, he was diametrically opposed to the policy which had been enunciated <Col N="360" /> in the official organ of his own Party, only two years before.  I heard Deputy M.J. O'Higgins alleging this evening that one of the Fianna Fáil arguments was that P.R. had been imposed on this country by Great Britain. I do not care whether it was imposed or was not.  It has no merit, whatever its origin was, but, in any event, according to Deputy O'Higgins's Party, its origin was one of its demerits.  I quote from <i>United Ireland</i> of 7th February, 1935, which stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This country has a scheme of P.R. forced on the people by the Proportional Representation Society of England, which succeeded in inducing the British Government, which drafted the Home Rule Act of 1920, to try its nostrum on the dog.  It has not yet produced a multi-party system mainly because of the acute division on the Treaty issue and which has prevented politics from developing along normal lines, the lines which were beginning to appear for instance before Fianna Fáil entered the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>To-day, Deputy Costello in his speech said it does not matter what has been the experience elsewhere.  That position of absolute indifference to the lesson to be learned by the experience of other people was not the one which Deputy Costello adopted on the Second Reading of this debate.  He then asked what about Switzerland and what about Sweden.  I believe those two questions were posed also by Deputy Sweetman.  I spoke on the Second Reading and I quoted what a Swiss authority had to say about the effects <Col N="362" /> of P.R. as they had manifested themselves in Switzerland. I have since made a little more research into the position there and here is what I have culled from another authority, a Mr. Hughes. In a book published by the Clarendon Press entitled <i>The Federal Constitution of Switzerland</i>, published as recently as 1954, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;P.R. arouses little enthusiasm in the Swiss people to-day, and one has the impression that it is only the theoretical difficulty of justifying the majority system that keeps them to the list system.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The quotation continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Its effects cannot be clearly disentangled from the other influences which have transformed Swiss public life since 1914. We may notice:</P>
      <P>1.  That the connection between the national councillor&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is the Deputy&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and the voter has become extremely tenuous.  It is thought bad form for a candidate even to canvass for himself before an election (though sometimes an anonymous group of friends' feel impelled to canvass through the post on his behalf), and there are no speeches and no opportunities to heckle the candidate, for he need never set eyes on the voters.  And after election he is not worried by constituents, for he represents his Party rather than anyone in particular.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The statement continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the larger Cantons the contact between voter and National Councillor is exhausted by the act of dropping a printed Party-list into the ballot box.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the same thing is the position of the legislature.  The system secures that the strength of Parties shall vary hardly at all from one election to another, that no Party shall ever be in a majority, and that, therefore, there is no Party &lsquo;record&rsquo;.  Even if responsibility for a piece of legislation can occasionally be attributed, responsibility for policy can never be.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what we experienced during the last two Coalitions, that responsibility for policy could never be pinned down. The statement goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Federal Assembly has only a weak hold on the imagination of the people, and the effect of this is to shift the centre of gravity of the Constitution to a point on the civil-service side of the Federal Council. This reflects a universal tendency to-day, but P.R. on the list system seems to have accelerated it.&rdquo;</P>

They also asked me what was the position in relation to Sweden.  Well, that is easily answered.  In 1954 a Royal Commission was set up in Sweden to consider the question of the reform of the Swedish Constitution and one of the matters referred to the commission has been the advisability of retaining the system of P.R.</P>
      <P>In opening the commission, the Federal Councillor&mdash;that is the member of the Cabinet who was responsible for setting up the commission&mdash; addressed the commissioners, and I am going to quote from what he said. Having referred to the importance of Parliament in the life of the Swedish people he went on to say this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But it is clear that the will of the people in the vast majority of matters cannot be expressed otherwise than through chosen representatives of the people.  The participation of the people in the life of the State must always be mainly through the Parliament.  In order that the individual shall not feel outside the decisions taken it is therefore important that close contact be maintained between the elector and the elected.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the general criticisms of the <Col N="365" /> system of P.R. is that it makes it very difficult, much more difficult, to maintain that contact between the elector and the elected.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The P.R. method, in the form it has had hitherto in our country, is not free from criticism from the points of view which have now developed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The mistrust of the political democracy which can arise on this account should admittedly be counteracted by the fact that the voter, however, as a rule has a general confidence in the Party he supports. It would be even better, however, if the individual could build on a personal confidence in the representative he desires to be elected, to a greater extent than is now the case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And the case he is referring to is where the representative is elected according to the P.R. system.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As the question of method of election is now going to be reviewed it is important, in view of the above, that attempts be made to strengthen the personal factor in the choice of parliamentary representatives.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the results which we believe will flow from the establishment of single-member constituencies is that very strengthening of the personal <Col N="366" /> factor in the choice of a representative. The statement goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The need for a close contact between the elector and the elected would undoubtedly be best fulfilled if a system of majority elections in one-man constituencies were adopted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a verdict on the system of P.R. delivered by a member of the present Swedish Government&mdash;&ldquo;the need for a close contact between the elector and the elected would undoubtedly be best fulfilled if the system of majority elections in one-member constituencies were adopted.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that were born and died, according to Deputy Norton, let us go on to examine other propositions which appear.  Deputy Norton was very eloquent about a hypothetical case, where he alleged that under the system of the non-transferable vote and the single-member constituency, it was possible for 30 per cent. of the total votes cast&mdash;that is, 30 per cent. of the poll&mdash;to get the seat as against Parties which had secured 70 per cent. of the total poll.  I cannot see why that would happen, at least in any rational society.  It is quite true that if you had one reasonable candidate and if he was opposed by five lunatics, then, probably in those circumstances, he would get the seat.  But surely it would be lunacy for five Parties to set up their separate candidates against, say, the strongest Party in any single constituency.  People who had any political sense, any sense of reality, would say: &ldquo;We have no chance of winning in this constituency, but there is one candidate who is less hostile to us than, say, the candidate of what might be the predominant Party.  We will fall in behind him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we will get the seat if we can only get 70 per cent. of the electorate to vote for that candidate.&rdquo; Of course that is not what the Opposition want to do, because, if they did that, they would have to accept responsibility for the policy of the candidate they are supporting. One thing which the Labour Party, and those other Parties which are tied to acceptance of the principle of Coalition, do not want is to have <Col N="371" /> themselves bound by any policy&mdash;at least not before the election, and they are never bound afterwards.  That is why both Coalitions burst up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When I challenged Deputy Norton to quote to me a single instance where a candidate, having secured only 30 per cent. of the poll, had been elected against others who had secured 70 per cent., he was not able to give me an instance. When I pressed him, he referred to what had happened, he said, in South Africa in the general election before the last; and he said that there the Government candidates had secured something of the order of only 500,000 votes&mdash;510,000 votes, I think he said, had secured a majority of the seats, though those candidates who were opposed to them had secured 610,000 votes.  That is to say, the Government candidates secured five-elevenths of the total poll cast over the whole State and their opponents secured six-elevenths of the poll, again spread over the whole State.  Of course, everybody knows&mdash; and Deputy Norton knew it as well as everybody else&mdash;that even that statement of his is a misrepresentation of the position.  If a five-elevenths of the electorate could secure a majority in Parliament, it was merely because of the fact that when the distribution of seats was being made it was so arranged that the rural constituencies required fewer votes than the urban constituencies, to return a candidate. It was, in fact, giving effect to one of the principles which is embodied, I think, in one of the amendments put down by the Opposition&mdash;a clear recognition of the fact that a constituency covering a wide area, a constituency sparsely populated, a constituency where the economy is mainly agricultural, has greater need of representation in Parliament than a densely populated, industrialised area.</P>

We are taking steps&mdash;we will come to that matter later&mdash;to ensure that, as far as is humanly possible, the constituency boundaries will be fairly and equitably drawn, having regard to the principles, in so far as they can be made effective, which have been embodied in an amendment which is down in the name of, I think.

      <P>I am coming back to sub-section (1) of Section 2.  The only case which Deputy Norton could quote, the only evidence he could give as a support for the absurd case he made here to-day, as to what might happen if we decide to abolish P.R. and base representation in this Dáil upon constituencies returning only a single member each, was a case that occurred in South Africa.  He did not quote any other one nor did he consider the extraordinary anomalies which can arise under the system of P.R.</P>
      <P>P.R. was used in Great Britain and I think it is still used there, as a method of electing representatives for the university constituencies.  I am not sure whether those university constituencies exist at present or not, but I know they did some few years ago. What transpired there?  A candidate &mdash; I think his name was Professor Pickthorn&mdash;who had lost his deposit, was actually elected a member of Parliament, under the system of P.R. Could we have a greater anomaly than that?  Take what happened here in the Republic only a couple of general elections ago.</P>

      <P>We have listened to the Minister for Health.  I think the Minister is an able member of the House and I am certain Deputies will agree that the Minister, in speaking on this sub-section, has endeavoured to make the very best of a very bad case.  In his remarks he has gone to the greatest trouble to quote extracts from views expressed in other countries concerning the system of P.R. of which Deputies know little or nothing.  I would appeal to members of the Government in the discussion here&mdash;and I value this Committee discussion irrespective of what the Minister for Health might think about it, because from this discussion the people outside who will have to decide, will be made aware of the issues involved&mdash;to remember that the Irish people cannot be fooled by referring to other countries <Col N="379" /> and the problems facing other countries.  Let us consider this country and the system we know here.  Let us have regard to the manner in which P.R. has served here.  If we confine our discussion along these lines, this debate will be of assistance to the people when they come ultimately to decide this issue.</P>
      <P>There is one matter which is of some importance.  It is a matter to which I referred in an earlier contribution here, but so far I have not heard any member of the Government give a satisfactory explanation of it.  Article 16 of the Constitution, which was approved by the people in 1937, provides in sub-paragraph (5) that the members of Oireachtas Éireann shall be elected on the system of P.R. by means of the single transferable vote. It is because that short sub-section is written into our Constitution that P.R. cannot be touched by ordinary legislation here in this Dáil; and the important thing to remember is that that sub-paragraph appears in Article 16 of the Constitution because it was put there by the Taoiseach and because the Minister for Health and every other member of this Government who was a member of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1937 asked the people to vote for P.R. then.</P>
      <P>P.R. is written into our Constitution because 21 years ago the Fianna Fáil Party campaigned this country asking the people to vote for a Constitution containing P.R.  That is one of the most significant features of this whole issue.  Those who put P.R. into the Constitution 21 years ago are to-day the people who are criticising the system.  It is understandable that any public man or any politician may change his mind.  It is quite understandable that the Taoiseach&mdash;and this is the Taoiseach's decision and no one else's&mdash;21 years later may say: &ldquo;I was wrong in 1937 and I have changed my mind on this issue.&rdquo; While that is understandable, the fact that a public man, the Leader of the Government, should have come to a view diametrically opposed to the view he advanced on a previous occasion, makes his judgment suspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Taoiseach was <Col N="380" /> able to say in 1937 that P.R. had served the country well, that it had brought stability in every country in which it was tried, and the fact that he put it into the Constitution 21 years ago and now says that it is a bad system, suggests that his judgment on this question is not a sound one.  There is no other way out of the dilemma, so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned; either the Taoiseach was wrong in 1937 or he is wrong now.  He cannot have been right on both occasions.  Either he is making a mistake now or he made a mistake 21 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is pertinent for us to challenge the value of his opinion, therefore, on a matter so important as this.  I go further; I assert that up to a few months ago no one on either side of this House, no member of any political Party in this State, had any views critical of P.R.  I have little doubt that up to last August, if one had asked 10, 11 or 12 Deputies to set out the most pressing and important political questions affecting our people, each of them would have written reams on many subjects, but not one of them would have thought that our electoral system was subject to any particular criticism.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt that this whole issue has been raised entirely and exclusively by the Taoiseach.  It occurred to him in August.  He proposed the discussion of the subject throughout the country and, of course, once he had a view on the matter, the members of his Government agreed with him.  I have little doubt that if any member of the Government did not agree, he would very quickly have ceased to be a member of the Government. It comes to this, and I hope that those who will eventually have to decide the issue will regard this as significant, that the man whose idea this whole proposal is is the Taoiseach; he has held two views on it, views which can in no way be reconciled or brought into agreement.  He is now proposing this drastic change in our electoral laws at a time when it is suggested that he himself proposes to leave active politics and seek the office of President.</P>
    <P>What does he propose to do in this <Col N="381" /> Bill?  If his present view is correct, if P.R., in fact, has proven unsatisfactory, would not the wise thing have been to suggest to the people that Article 16, sub-section 5º of the Constitution be amended by its deletion?  In a matter as important as this is, all that is necessary is to remove P.R. from the Constitution. If that were done, this Dáil, by ordinary legislation, could decide to try out the single member constituency, the non-transferable vote, if that were desired, and see how it goes.  The people would know that if the proposed system, the English system, did not prove satisfactory, if, from experience, it was found not to be as satisfactory as P.R. has been over the last 37 years, then it would be possible to change back to P.R. as we know it now or in some other form.  That would appear to me to be as far as a man, whose judgment has been as unsound as the Taoiseach's has been on this matter, should go, merely to take it out of the Constitution, leave the power in the Dáil to decide one way at present and, if a majority of the people later come to another conclusion, the Dáil should have power to change back.</P>
    <P>The significant thing is that in this proposal, sub-section (1) of this section, we are being asked to pass legislation entitling the people in a referendum to insert in the Constitution as part of the fundamental law of the State a system which has been untried here, to take P.R. out and put in its place the English system of election.  That is asking far too much.  It is asking the people, as it has been described, to take a plunge into the unknown, to take a leap in the dark, to jettison something that they have known for the last 37 years because it is now being criticised and to put in its place, into the Constitution itself, a system that we do not know, a system that is criticised even in England where it has operated for some 100 years or so, and is criticised elsewhere.  We are asked to adopt that system on the advice of a man whose judgment on this Question has proven to be unsound. That is asking the people to take a very extreme step indeed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> In this proposal to remove P.R. and to have, instead, the single member constituency, the suggestion has been made, notably by the Minister for Health, that a single member representing a small constituency is likely to be a better representative and to have better relationship with his constituency. That is a plausible argument. That argument may be true in some respect in relation to certain people and certain constituencies but it is not a sound argument.  It will depend entirely on the personality of the member and on the type of constituency.</P>
    <P>Certainly, experience has shown in the British House of Commons that in relation to certain constituencies where one or other of the Parties have a historical maiority, the member generally has little or no association with or interest in the constituency he represents.  He does not need to have it.  In certain historical Conservative and Labour constituencies, the representation is in the gift of the Party and often in defiance of local Party opinion.  Quite frequently, the member concerned has very little association with, and certainly is in no way compelled to identify himself with or to take any real interest in, the constituency he represents.</P>
    <P>I know that that can happen in multi-member constituencies also.  It all depends on the outlook of the member of Parliament concerned and on the manner in which he intends to represent the people and carry out their trust in Parliament.  We know well that there are members of this House who represent constituencies, who were sent here under P.R., who give far more than could be expected of them in the service they give to their constituents.  They are Deputies who have accented public representation and regard it as an honour and as something in respect of which they are prepared to do a great deal in the interest of the people they represent. There are also in this House other Deputies who have little or no regard for the obligations of representation.  I do not believe that Deputies of that kind will be cured or altered in any way, no matter what the electoral system may be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> The greatest argument against the single member constituency is the one referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, namely, that once you have single member constituencies, once you adopt the system that they have in England, the system which they criticise in England, the system which has not given satisfaction to statesmen in England, you take from the constituents the very wide power of selection which they now have.  In any well-functioning democracy it is right that the majority of the people should take an active interest in politics and it is right that the majority of the people should have strong political views.  If we ever encourage any state of affairs here, when the contrary can be said, then our parliamentary democracy itself will begin to wilt and fade away.</P>
    <P>I think it can be said of this country that the majority of the people hold strong political views oneway or the other.  There is a margin, perhaps a large margin, which does not have very strong views.  There are a number of people who change their views from time to time but they are not in the majority.  If we have single member constituencies, it is the electors living in those constituencies who hold, say, strong Fianna Fáil views, who will be put in the position that, no matter how much they may dislike the candidate put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party and no matter how much they may dislike that candidate as being unsuitable from their point of view, they will be faced with Hobson's choice.  They must either vote for the man they dislike or put in a candidate representing the political views to which they are opposed.</P>
    <P>That is Hobson's choice for the electors and, of course, that is common experience in Britain at the moment.  That is why there is a growing body of opinion in England critical of their present system.  They find in England it is not right that the Party bosses should be in a position to put forward a candidate in a Labour or Tory constituency and pretty well direct the people to vote for that candidate or they would not have <Col N="384" /> a representative of the political views in which they believe.</P>
    <P>It would, I think, be tragic if in this country, which is different from England, we proceeded to make the mistake they have already made in Great Britain&mdash;alter the position of each person on the Irish register of voters and change the Irish voter from being not only a voter but an elector also.  Under P.R., when the voter goes to vote, he exercises his choice in relation to the political Party he is going to support. He then has a choice of candidates among the candidates standing for that Party.  He is a voter and he is also an elector.  It would be quite a tragic mistake if we altered his position.</P>
    <P>We all know that, from time to time in each Party for one reason or another, the Party bosses may try to get rid of a Deputy in their Party.  It happened, we understand, in relation to the Fianna Fáil Party in a constituency not far from this House in recent elections but the particular person who, we understand, Fianna Fáil were anxious to see out of the Dáil happened to be a Deputy who had given good service to his constituents.  He was standing as a Fianna Fáil candidate and the people had a choice as between the man that headquarters wanted to get elected and the man headquarters did not want to get elected.  Of course, by reason of the fact that each person who went into vote had the double choice &mdash;the Party he was going to support and the candidate standing for that Party to whom he had given his first preference&mdash;that particular Deputy is still happily amongst us.</P>
    <P>If the first proposal to have single member constituencies were adopted as part of our electoral law, very rapidly we would have the growth of directions at elections.  The Party bosses on both sides would have the power to dictate the type of candidate to represent each constituency and the position of the voters would be very bad indeed.</P>
    <P>It is no harm for Deputies to remember that outside this House in different parts of the country there are poor people who for one reason or another are accustomed to approach <Col N="385" /> public representatives to seek their advice or assistance in relation to a variety of matters.  At the moment in each constituency they have achoice of representative to go to.  Even those who have strong political views opposed to the existing Government have some consolation in the fact that they have their own Deputy representing them to fight their corner or their grievance if they have one.  That has meant that, irrespective of what Government may be in office, people throughout the country still look to the Dáil and the Dáil Deputies.</P>
    <P>It would be a very great shame indeed if, under this proposal, the minority political view found itself unrepresented in the Dáil.  If in a single member constituency, where there might be 40 per cent. of the people strongly Fine Gael and 45 per cent. Fianna Fáil, the Fianna Fáil candidate is elected and becomes the Dáil Deputy for that constituency that means that for five years at least&mdash; five years in the ordinary way under the law&mdash;40 per cent. of the electors will not have their political views ventilated in the Dáil.  A great number of poor people will be deprived of the facility they now have to approach and seek the advice of a Deputy representing their own political views.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter on this proposal.  The Minister for Health made some reference to the problem that might arise from sparsely populated rural constituencies.  I did not precisely understand the point he was endeavouring to make, but it is significant that under this proposed amendment of the Constitution, for single member constituencies, there is a provison with regard to the requisite population number, that each constituency shall be fixed for between 20,000 and 30,000 of the population. That applies universally throughout the country and it means that the new single member constituency will, if this proposal is accepted, be a very large constituency indeed in the South-West and West of Ireland, because where there is a sparse population, or where emigration has taken its toll, in order <Col N="386" /> to have the requisite population as provided in the Constitution, the area will be very large indeed.</P>
    <P>One can imagine what kind of intimate representation can be involved where there is only one Deputy representing a very large tract of country.  If one takes, for example, the Dingle Peninsula, where the population has dropped dramatically in recent years, the Dingle Peninsula, perhaps with the town of Tralee, will be a single member constituency with one Deputy representing it, where at the moment four Deputies are available to the people living there.  This one Deputy will have a large tract of country to represent in the Dáil and it is suggested by those in favour of this system that a more intimate relationship will be created between that Deputy and the constituency he represents.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it can be done, once you have, as you must have, the same population requisite throughout the country.  I believe that the multi-member constituencies have suited our requirements satisfactorily for the past 37 years.  We have few centres of population.  Generally, outside Dublin City, Cork and perhaps Limerick, our population is scattered, because we have an agricultural economy.  Therefore, the distribution of population does not happily lend itself to single member constituencies.</P>
    <P>In England it is different.  The system in England grew out of circumstances and it suits England.  In England, there are definite centres of population scattered throughout the country because of the industrial economy they have there.  We are different and a multi-member constituency system has worked well in this country for the past 37 years.  It has enabled two, three, four or five Deputies adequately to represent each area of the country&mdash;areas which have to be large because of the population requisite&mdash;and a harmonious relationship has grown up between the constituencies and the Deputies representing these multi-member areas.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say on this sub-section. We will deal with the proposal in relation to the type of vote later, but I do suggest, Sir, that this discussion <Col N="387" /> would be better if Deputies would have regard primarily to the circumstances in this country and to the manner, as we know it, in which the multi-member constituencies have worked for the past 37 years.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I believe that the views expressed by statesmen or politicians in other countries, in relation to their own experiences in their own countries, have little or no significance here, and I do not think that such views will in any way help the people properly to decide this important issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health seemed to be aggrieved because there was any opposition at all to this Bill, or even any debate on it.  He seemed to think it should be rushed through the House without any debate and that the Opposition as well as the Government should receive it with open arms.</P>
      <P>The principal reason that there is a debate, and a pretty hotly contested debate on this Bill, is that there has been no public demand for the Bill. There was no demand inside this House for it, and no demand came from any local authority or public body or any responsible body of citizens, to have the Constitution amended by the abolition of the P.R. system and a reversion to single member constituencies.  That is the reason for this debate.</P>
      <P>I do not see why the Government should say that the people want to see what this Bill is like and get a chance to vote on it.  The people have not asked for it.  It is a free gift of the Taoiseach's to the people, at a cost out of their own pockets, of £100,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one fact.  The second, and it cannot be disputed, is that the reason for this Bill is that it is nothing more or less than a cast-steel attempt to prevent any Party from forming a Government but Fianna Fáil.  The Taoiseach, on Second Reading, said he had been asked by many people when he was going to put a stop to an alternative Government <Col N="388" /> being formed.  Apparently it is the view of some Fianna Fáil supporters that it is a national calamity for any Government to be in power except a Fianna Fáil Government and they had asked him when he was going to stop that and, therefore, the reason for the Bill is to ensure that Fianna Fáil will remain in power for all time, if possible.</P>
      <P>In that, he has a very good precedent. He has the precedent established by the Stormont Parliament in 1929.  They wanted to wipe out minorities and to ensure that only the Unionists would ever be the Government in the Six Counties and they have succeeded.  Since 1929, almost 50 per cent. of the members in the Six Counties are returned unopposed election after election.  Nobody will oppose them.  In the last election, I think the actual figure of the members returned unopposed was 47 per cent.</P>
      <P>That is the system we are now being asked to agree to in this House, without debate and without criticism, and because we are debating the Bill, it is called obstruction&mdash;obstruction against giving something to the people which they never asked for and which they knew nothing about. which even the Fianna Fáil Ministers knew nothing about until the Taoiseach announced it at a Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis in the Mansion House, a proposal by Fianna Fáil which sprang from one or two cranks or probably well-paid individuals at the expense of the people.  They could not bear the thought of Fianna Fáil being out of power because they probably thought an alternative Government to Fianna Fáil might take their ill-gotten gains or money from them.  That is my construction of what the Taoiseach has told us. That is the reason for the Bill.  That is why there will be criticism of it here and why there will be or should be the same criticism of it outside so that the people will know exactly that they are being asked to finish their own political freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill passes the two Houses of the Oireachtas, receives the President's signature and becomes law it will go to the people and it will then cost <Col N="389" /> them about £100,000.  The Taoiseach spoke in this House on the 1st June, 1937, on P.R. As reported at column 1343 of Volumes 67-68 of the Official Report, he is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The system we have we know; the people know it.  On the whole it has worked out pretty well.  I think that we have a good deal to be thankful for in this country: we have to be very grateful that we have had the system of P.R. here. It gives a certain amount of stability, and on the system of the single transferable vote you have fair representation of Parties.  I understood when I was in opposition that this whole principle of P.R. was being threatened, and I was rather anxious here that we would ensure in the Constitution a reasonable basis for P.R.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At that time he thought P.R. was being threatened.  He admits he was anxious at that time lest the threats should have effect and that anything would happen P.R.  It is a pity he had not the same view on it then as he now has.  His change of mind, or his forgetfulness or his wrong estimation of the situation then will now cost us £100,000&mdash;money, incidentally, which would help to give a lot of much-needed employment throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health told us of the advantages that will follow from this Bill if it becomes law.  I hold that what will happen is that in constituencies where a Deputy supporting the Government gets the seat&mdash;if this Bill becomes law and if the people decide to abolish P.R.&mdash;there will be much worse representation and much less attention by the Deputy to the needs of the people.  If this Bill becomes law, and if the people pass the referendum, the people in each constituency will have only one Deputy whether he be a Government Deputy or an Opposition Deputy. They will not have the advantages they enjoy now.  If a Government Deputy happens to be a Minister or is too busy or if the people do not, for one reason or another, seem to place sufficient confidence in him, or if they <Col N="390" /> feel he has enough to do already besides adding to his burdens, then, under the present system, they have other Deputies for their constituency whom they can approach.  In some constituencies there are four Deputies and the people always have at least two other Deputies to go to.  Under the proposed electoral system, the people will have only one Deputy.  If he is a Government Deputy he will not give the same attention to his people as they have been getting up to this and as they deserve.</P>
    <P>I hold that the proposed system will also show too clearly where the Opposition strength lies.  Consider the position of a constituency which elects an Opposition candidate.  If a Government is unscrupulous enough, that will provide an opportunity of practically beggaring the people of that constituency in order to teach them a lesson so that they will vote for the Government candidate at the next following election.  This proposed system seems to have devilish designs. It is designed not for the good of the people, as far as I can see.  They have not asked for the change.  The proposal has been introduced purely for political purposes.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading, the Taoiseach told us why he introduced this measure.  It is for no reason other than to prevent, as far as is possible, any Government except a Fianna Fáil Government from holding office in this country.  Incidentally, it aims at wiping out the representation which farmers and labour people have.  I asked the Taoiseach on the Second Reading what was wrong with farmers having their representatives here to voice their grievances and opinions.  I also asked him what was wrong with ordinary labourers or white-collar workers sending labour representatives here.</P>
    <P>When this Bill first came before the House the Taoiseach had a good deal of talk about the enormous damage a multiplicity of Parties was causing; he coined that term himself. I hold that the people have been very well served by the Parties. The working people and the farmers would never have got many of the <Col N="391" /> advantages they did get were it not that they had their Parties here to wring them from an unwilling Government. I repeat the question now that I put to the Taoiseach then: What is wrong with any vocational group in this country having their own representation?  The Taoiseach tangled the question in the same way as a kitten would tangle a ball of yarn but it emerged that Parties get together to form an alternative Government. What is wrong with that?</P>
    <P>If they get a majority of votes, would the Parties not be lacking in their duty to the people if they did not form an alternative Government? Take 1948, for example, when the Parties comprising the inter-Party Government had a clear majority of close on 200,000 votes over Fianna Fáil.  Were they expected not to form an alternative Government although they were told by the people's votes to do so?  That is the question that is posed to us.  An attempt is being made from the Government side of the House to create the subconscious impression on the people that it is wrong to attempt to form any Government in this country but a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I do not give much heed to the Minister for Health.  I want to show, however, an example of the insincerity of his arguments.  He spoke about a candidate who headed the poll but who failed to be elected.  I understand that such happened once or perhaps twice&mdash;I hazard a guess that it did not happen oftener&mdash;in the long number of years that this country has had its freedom.  There is a much worse system and it was very awkward for the man concerned. Where there is a large number of candidates, a man could head the poll and still not get a very creditable return of No. 1 votes.  However, that is not as serious as what happened in England, at the second-last general election there, where a candidate who got less than one-third of the total votes of the constituency got the seat.  I reckon that that is a much greater evil and danger than the fact that, in a period of 30 years, <Col N="392" /> one candidate here headed the poll but lost the seat.</P>
    <P>I was listening attentively to the Minister for Health until he made an astounding and fictitious statement. He quoted a purely fictitious case that did not or could not happen of a man who lost his deposit but got the seat.  When challenged by Deputy O'Higgins to say where or how that could happen he saw he had made a fool of himself and got out of the misstatement he made and immediately sheered off.</P>

When the people or when any responsible body in Ireland asks for an amendment of the Constitution, I will be the very first to help it through this House but I will not have a Bill shoved down my throat in silence by the Fianna Fáil Party, a Bill which was never asked for and was purely a whim of the Taoiseach in order to prevent any Party except Fianna Fáil from ever getting power in Ireland, in very close imitation of the system in Stormont since 1929 which has worked so well.  The Taoiseach possibly has views of his own about leaving this House in the near future.  I wish him the best of luck wherever he goes but I do say he certainly will not put this legislation across the people of this country without their being told that their political rights are being taken away from them by their own hand and at his advice.</P>

      <P>The principal complaint made here is that small Parties will not be represented any more in this House.  I am a farmer.  I have seen Farmers' Parties coming in here ever since I came to this House in 1927.  When I came in here first I occupied one of those benches over there.  After that election Mr. Cosgrave looked for support from the Leader of the Farmers' Party who had eight representatives in this House to look after farmers' interests&mdash;and I emphasise &ldquo;to look after the farmers' interests&rdquo;.  As an indication of appreciation of their support, the leader of that Party was made a Parliamentary Secretary.  We had the spectacle of those eight farmers walking around that Lobby voting against an increase of £1,000,000 in the agricultural grant for the relief of rates to farmers. Twelve months afterwards, the same eight farmers again trotted around the Lobby and voted to prevent the tenants of this country getting justice and to put £3,000,000 into the landlords' pockets.  That leader went back to the county he came from and for his good work here, he was kicked out in 1932; he has since drawn over £6,000 of the taxpayers' money by way of pension.</P>
      <P>The next body of farmers who were sent in here were called a Centre Party, under Deputies MacDermot and James Dillon.  In six months Deputy Dillon and Deputy MacDermot were sitting over there and the only man who was not for sale was sitting down there where Deputy Corish is sitting now.  He remained sitting there for three years and had to speak here as the sole representative of the farmers, namely, the late Deputy William Kent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another group of farmers came in here claiming to represent the agricultural <Col N="395" /> community and to look after their interests and we had the same spectacle.  I saw a Deputy from Deputy O'Sullivan's constituency, the secretary of the Shorthorn Dairy Breeders' Society, walking around that Lobby voting against an increase in the price of milk for the farmers.  I suggest the only thing farmers have gained out of this direct representation in the House for the 32 years I have been here is £1,600 a year pension to four men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the total amount of good that farmers have gained by direct representation in this House for 32 years.  Those are facts.  We wonder why we hear it said that the institutions of this State are getting into disrepute and that they are respected no longer.  How can they be respected?</P>
      <P>The vote being taken here, and by the people of the country, is a vote between decent, straight representation, and representation by purchase.  Representation by purchase was, undoubtedly, the purpose of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, as they were before they changed their name to Fine Gael.  That is the choice, and the only choice, that the people have, and nobody can deny it.  If that thing continues, one can easily visualise the situation arising again which was described by a member of this House after the general election in 1951.  He drew the picture of three gentlemen knocking at the door of a house at 11 o'clock at night and saying: &ldquo;You can decide to-morrow who is going to be Taoiseach&mdash;how much do you want?  We are prepared to make you Minister for Health if you come along our way.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the choice and then we wonder why the ordinary person in the country has no respect for political institutions.  How can they have respect for them knowing that condition of affairs?  How can they have respect for them under the system of purchase and barter, when you see the laugh on a gentleman's face as he is trotting <Col N="396" /> along the Lobby and voting against the direct interest of the people who elected him?  We have had seven or eight farmers marching along that Lobby voting against the granting of an increase in the price of milk.  What induced them to do so?  Fancy an appreciative Government marching these eight men around that Lobby voting against a £1,000,000 increase in the agricultural grant for farmers who, at that time, were put to the pins of their collars to know whether to stay here or emigrate.</P>

I honestly believe that the Deputy who works for his constituency will be re-elected, no matter to what Party he belongs.  If I might make an appeal to Deputies on all sides, it would be to let this through and let the people judge.  I do not know what the anxiety is to keep the people from judging.  The people ought to know their own minds, and they know what has happened to them under P.R.  The people might be very anxious for a change but, at any rate, it is not we who are judging the matter here.</P>
      <P>All we are endeavouring to do is to give the people an opportunity of judging it.  Why is there this anxiety to prevent them getting that opportunity? What is the reason for that? Have the Fine Gael Party so little faith in their policy that they will, like Deputy Blowick, say: &ldquo;We cannot win a seat in the country if this goes through; we have not in any single constituency in this country a man, or a policy, to put a man at the head of the poll.&rdquo; Who believes that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I guarantee that I will see changes here.  There are enough labourers in this country to elect a pretty considerable Labour Party, if the Labour Party had a policy to attract them, but evidently they have not.  The ordinary worker has no faith in the Labour Party and he votes for Fianna Fáil.  There are enough farmers in the country to elect 30 or 40 farmers here but, after the experience they have had, I do not blame them for what they are after doing this time.  You cannot blame them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have that condition of affairs and I, for one, welcome the change and I welcome it for the sake of public <Col N="399" /> institutions in this country.  I do not want to see public institutions dragged in the mud.  I do not want to see the question of who is to be Taoiseach decided by a midnight visit to a Deputy's house.  Each time we had a Coalition Government there came a breaking point and the only breaking point in the Coalitions was when they had no more money, when money ran out, credit ran out and everyone was howling for their money.  Then the boys ran and you had no more Coalitions.  That is the only judgment that I have on this Bill, the judgment as to whether we are to have a Government elected freely by the people or whether we are to have a Government elected by purchase price or something worse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry said that the Coalition disbanded because they had no money.  As far as I can see, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and members of the Government, the Fianna Fáil Government have too much money. We are told they have £250,000,000 to spend over the next five years and still we do not see any sign of their attempting to spend any of that money.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of this Schedule could be considered the important part of the Bill.  As far as I can gather, people are asking themselves why this change now?  Why is it necessary, in less than two years after the election of a Government, that they should be asked to decide whether or not the system of election should be changed? An election is not due until February or March of 1961 and they are asking themselves why the urgency?  That is not for me to answer.  It is a question that ought to be answered by the Taoiseach, or a member of the Front Bench of the Government. What are we to expect after this referendum, whether the issue is approved or disapproved?  As well as that, the majority of the people are asking why should the time of the Parliament be taken up with a measure like this, when there are many more important measures to be discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> I think it was Deputy Donnellan who said that it is the first time in the history of this House that the Dáil was specially convened in what was regarded as the adjournment period for the consideration of a measure.  The only other occasion was when the Fianna Fáil Government convened the House in order to get the Dáil to approve the accession of Edward VIII to the throne of England.  In any case, I would say this measure is to be compared with an issue such as was presented to the Dáil in 1936 or 1937.  It would suit the Government much better if they got ahead with the already announced and much vaunted five-year plan. That is what the people are concerned with and if they could see the five-year plan in operation they believe that it would be time enough to decide whether or not they should have the straight vote or P.R.</P>
    <P>The only conclusion they can come to is that because we have such a situation in the country, an economic situation as far as employment is concerned especially, and so far as the cost of living is concerned, for the Taoiseach to propose to abolish P.R. is merely a diversionary move in order to divert the minds of the people away from things that really matter.  In my opinion the minds of the people are not being diverted and, as a previous Deputy said, the Government is coming into disrepute because it wants to talk about P.R. and the straight vote instead of things that really matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is unreasonable to say that the Fianna Fáil Party is being, and has been, led by the nose by the Taoiseach on this issue.  I never heard the Minister for External Affairs talk about the evils of P.R. in my short life, 13 years, in this House.  I have never seen him reported in any of the newspapers as being for or against P.R.  I have never heard the Minister for Health, or any member of the Front Bench, or the back benches, talking about the evils of that system, apart from the Taoiseach who spoke once or twice about it at an election about 20 years ago down in Clare.  Why <Col N="401" /> this sudden rush, this sudden urge to do away with P.R. and replace it with a system which we are told operates so successfully in Canada, New Zealand and other countries?</P>
    <P>We are told that the abolition of P.R. and the adoption of the straight vote will provide for stable Government. If it is the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party to ask the people to provide for stable Government by adopting the straight vote system, should they not also be asked to adopt the straight vote for the Presidency? If P.R. does not give us stable Government, surely P.R. for a Presidential election would not give us a stable President?  If P.R. is not good enough for the election of members to the Dáil, is it unreasonable to ask is it good enough for the election of members to local authorities?  If the Fianna Fáil proposal for the straight vote is carried my belief is that it will be introduced as well for the election of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have become, I will not say tired, but somewhat amused by the arguments put forward by the Minister for Health.  I must say I am not concerned, and I do not think anybody in the country is concerned, with his quotations from this, that, or the other writer about the P.R. system of election in Sweden, Switzerland or any other country.  The Minister for Health quotes a gentleman named, I think, Christopher Hughes, on the P.R. system in Switzerland.  He quotes him as pointing out the great number of faults P.R. has in Switzerland, and he would have us believe that Mr. Christopher Hughes is the last word on P.R. I should like to know would the Minister for Health be prepared to quote the same gentleman or any of the others who were quoted, on the question of Irish neutrality during the last war, on the Free Trade Area or on any other major topic of this kind? Why pick out Mr. Christopher Hughes, a university professor from England, who has not the slightest idea of the Irish way of life, the Irish political way of life or the general conditions in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any of us need refer further to the statement of the Minister for External Affairs as to whether P.R. is a British imposition. The fact remains that a very strong defence of the system is that the Taoiseach and his Government inserted it in the Constitution of 1937.  I should like to know who was right as regards their opinion of P.R. in 1937?  As quoted by Deputy Norton in this House last Thursday, the Taoiseach in June, 1937, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The system we have we know; the people know it.  On the whole it has worked out pretty well.  I think we have a good deal to be thankful for in the country; we have to be very grateful that we have had the system of P.R. here.  It gives a certain amount of stability, and on the system of the single transferable vote you have fair representation of Parties.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would be helped very much in this discussion if the Taoiseach came into the House to-night, to-morrow or the next day and said: &ldquo;What I said in June, 1937, I do not believe now.&rdquo; I think we would have a greater appreciation of the Taoiseach if he came in and said that, instead of going around in circles as he has been in this discussion over the last few days or weeks, <Col N="403" /> trying to tell us that if he did say it, he did not mean it.  It would be better if he came in and said: &ldquo;That was my opinion in 1937.  I have changed my opinion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He has spoken in even stronger terms.  He said he would never say that minorities should be denied representation and that if the object of those who advised the abolition of P.R. was to wipe out minorities, they would get no support from him.  What does he mean by &ldquo;minorities&rdquo;?  Does he mean political minorities?  Does lie mean religious minorities?  Or, should I say, what does he mean in that case?</P>
    <P>He said very clearly here that he wants to see a Parliament where there will be two or three Parties.  I think some other members of the Front Bench said they wanted to see only two Parties.  I think the Tánaiste said he wanted to see a Fianna Fáil side of the House and another side and he did not say whether that should be Fine Gael, Tory, Conservative or Socialist. but the Taoiseach has stated his views and has said that if the object of those who wanted to abolish P.R. is to wipe out minorities, they would get no support from him.  If he comes in now and says: &ldquo;That was my view in 1937, but I have changed my mind now,&rdquo; it would shorten this debate, but it would take a great deal of explaining by him as to why he changed his mind on such a very important question.</P>
    <P>These are questions which still remain for the Taoiseach to answer. He announced on the First Reading of the Bill that he hated Coalitions and he is very strongly backed up in that attitude by the Minister for External Affairs.  Coalitions are anathema to the Minister for External Affairs.  He dislikes the idea of any sort of coalition; he dislikes especially coalitions in Government, but may I pose him a simple question: what does he think of coalitions in local authorities?  He may say that is a different question, that local authorities deal with local matters; but they deal with matters with which people are vitally concerned, and in those local authorities Fianna Fáil have no hesitation in coalescing with other Parties, <Col N="404" /> even with Fine Gael.  Does the Minister for External Affairs see anything objectionable in that?</P>
    <P>Local authorities deal with such things as wages which are vital to the working man; they deal with house-building, health services and various types of money allowances, and while it may be different to Government to some extent, fundamentally and basically, it is no different, so far as the ordinary people are concerned.  My experience in my local authority in any case is that Fianna Fáil have no hesitation in joining up with any Party when it comes to a question of wages, or increasing home assistance or advancing building or making more money available for allowances.  We know then that Fianna Fáil are never concerned about the objection of the Minister for External Affairs and the Taoiseach and have no hesitation in coalescing with any Party or group of Parties.</P>
    <P>I must confess that some of the arguments the Minister for External Affairs used to-day and on last Thursday were either over or under my head.  He posed certain questions to the Labour Party and, in particular, to Deputy Norton.  He asked specifically: in the event of no Party having a majority after a general election, what would the Labour Party do?  I asked the Minister for External Affairs, and I did not think it was unreasonable, what he would do in the same circumstances. But he did not answer.  He wanted to suggest that the Labour Party, before a situation like that arose, should say during a general election, for instance, that &ldquo;if no Party gets an over-all majority, we will coalesce with Fine Gael or Clann na Poblachta or Clann na Talmhan.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Suppose a situation arises where we have a Parliament of 120 seats in which Fianna Fáil get 40, Fine Gael 40 and the Labour Party 40.  What would Fianna Fáil do?  What would the Minister for External Affairs do? I know what the Labour Party would do.  They would have regard to the general good of the country and consider whether or not they could form a Government, but Fianna Fáil would say: &ldquo;We have no responsibility for the formation of a Government.  We <Col N="405" /> are an independent Party; we have always been an independent Party.  To hell with the country.  No matter who forms the Government, and no matter what difficulties there are for the country, we will not be part of any Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is absolute cowardice. People who talk about coalitions must remember, and should remember, the situation in 1948.  No Party had an over-all majority.  Fianna Fáil sat back and said: &ldquo;We will not coalesce.  We will not join with any other Party or Parties to form a Government.&rdquo; So far as the Labour Party were concerned, the situation was that we were not prepared to support or coalesce with Fianna Fáil because of certain actions of theirs, particularly of the Minister for External Affairs when Minister for Finance; we would not and could not coalesce with Fianna Fáil.  Therefore, without any prejudice in our minds, political or economic, we said we would join with other Parties on a 12-point programme to form a Government to do our best for the Irish people.  And that we did and, I think, did successfully.  We had the same situation in 1954 and we acted in the very same way.</P>

      <P>May I pose the same question to the Minister?  In a Parliament of 120, three Parties get 40 seats each.  What do Fianna Fáil do? Do they say: &ldquo;Have another election?&rdquo; If that occurs and the result is 50 Fianna Fáil, 35 Fine Gael and 35 Labour, with still no over-all <Col N="406" /> majority, what would Fianna Fáil do?  Wait until they get an over-all majority?  There is another election and they get 59 seats, Fine Gael 31 and Labour 30, with still no over-all majority for any Party.  What would the Minister for External Affairs do?  Sit on the sideline, or sit sulking in his political tent as he did from 1922 to 1927?</P>

      <P>With the Great White Chief in the saddle?  In any case, the Minister for External Affairs could not understand how Deputy Norton, Deputy Everett, Deputy Keyes, Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy MacEoin, Deputy Tom O'Higgins and Deputy Sweetman could sit around a Cabinet table and agree. Does he suggest for a moment that certain of his colleagues are in agreement, not to say full agreement, with one another?  Does anyone believe that the Minister for Lands, and the Minister for Agriculture, have or could have the same ideas about agriculture?  Does anyone believe that Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare, and Dr. Ryan as Minister for Finance, could agree on agriculture, as we know from their statements in the past?  Or could anyone believe that the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Industry and Commerce are in agreement on policies regarding finance?  Or that the Minister for External Affairs is in agreement with anybody on anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry talked about the result of P.R., with particular reference to the period of the Coalition Government.  Could Deputy Corry tell us about the results of P.R. from 1933 to 1937, from 1938 to 1943, from 1944 to 1948, from 1951 to 1954 and from 1957 to date?  During all those times Fianna Fáil had an over-all majority; P.R. was no disability to them then; but what spectacular advances were made during those years?  True, they can point to things like abolishing oaths, abolishing Senates and bringing back Senates; <Col N="407" /> but can anyone say that the country is substantially better off than it was when Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932?  I am not making claims for any other Government from 1922 onwards; but when one talks about Stability, one must remember that, during most of those years when Fianna Fáil were in office, they had over-all majorities.  It did not help them and there is no evidence in the wide earthly world to suggest that the straight vote is going to give any Party an over-all majority at any election.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health could not understand Deputy Norton's suggestion that 30 per cent. of the votes could get a seat in any constituency as against 70 per cent. for the Opposition.  He asked Deputy Norton to quote an example; and the second last election in South Africa was quoted, where the Government Party with approximately 500,000 votes got 93 seats, while the Opposition Parties, with 610,000 votes, got something like 43 seats.  The Minister said that did not signify anything; but as far as my calculations go, it seems to me that the Government Party members got one seat for 27 per cent. of the electorate and the Opposition got one seat for 73 per cent. of the electorate. That suggests to me that in any constituency it could happen, and probably did happen, that 27 per cent. of the Government votes got a seat as against 73 per cent. of the Opposition votes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry suggested that we should give up this discussion and let the issue be put to the people.  As I said on the Second Reading, our duty here in opposition is to try to keep the people informed.  We are entitled to discuss the merits and demerits of this Bill and to try to put the issue fairly before the people.  We have been doing that.  We are giving our views in defence of the system of P.R. and we have invited Government Deputies to do likewise.  They have not done so. With the exception of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Booth, very few have given their views.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> It has been suggested by the Taoiseach that this should be regarded as a non-political issue.  If that is so, I suggest that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party are not only entitled to talk on this issue, but have a responsibility to do so.  If they are in favour of this proposal, they should say so and should say why&mdash;for the benefit of their constituents.  That is what we in opposition are doing and will continue to do as long as this discussion continues on Committee Stage; and, please God, on the Fourth and Fifth Stages as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a great deal of talk on this Bill so far and on this very important section in Committee.  I do not want to go over all the arguments which have been put forward from this side of this House, or try to answer all the arguments which have been put up from time to time by various Ministers and Deputies on the Government side.  However, there are some points I should like to bring out.  I should like to make clear my complete abhorrence of this Bill. This section we are discussing is really the essence of the whole Bill, namely, doing away with P.R.</P>
      <P>A few moments ago, we had Deputy Corry speaking and we heard a lot about eight farmers who apparently once voted, many years ago, against an increase in the price of milk. In the eyes of Deputy Corry&mdash;I hope not in the eyes of all his Party&mdash;that was supposed to be a very wrong thing for them to have done.  I think it may have been a very good thing to have done. At any rate, it was a very honest thing for them to have done.  They were farmers and, apparently, in the overriding interest of the whole community, they forgot, or deliberately laid aside the sectional interests and voted for the good of the majority of the people, as they believed it to be. Incidentally, as a representative of a town constituency, I find that an increase in the price of milk reflects harshly on the townspeople who have to buy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There we have an instance of the viewpoint which should be taken by a Party.  If those eight farmers were in the Fianna Fáil Party, would Fianna <Col N="409" /> Fáil crush their efforts, crush their viewpoint and make them vote in the way the Party wanted?  I am not saying that necessarily would happen, but I do say it would be much more likely to happen if those eight Deputies were members of a farmer's Party, as they were, and were free to vote in either Lobby, but who actually were courageous enough to vote against what appeared to be their narrow sectional interest.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about strong Governments.  In point of fact, the strongest Governments all over the world on many occasions have been a bitter disappointment to the people who voted them in and to their country as a whole.  There was a very strong Government in England before the war of 1939.  They watched the rise of Hitler, and certainly nobody could say that before the eleventh hour there was anything in the nature of adequate rearmament. That strong Government did not do what one expects a strong Government to do.  There have been many occasions in our country, too. The strongest Governments have not shown themselves by any means the most active in beneficial legislation or, still less, the most jealously protective towards many sections of the community. In fact, what emerges is that one of the greatest assets any Parliament can have is a strong Opposition. Study the history of strong Governments and you will find&mdash;not always, because you are dealing with the imponderable; you are dealing with human affairs and it is very difficult to lay down absolute law on it because nothing is ever quite black and white &mdash;what emerges is that strong Governments do not necessarily do what the people would expect them to do, and in point of fact often turn out to be weak.</P>
    <P>Under this proposed section the country will be asked to vote on this proposal and will be directed with the full force of the Government Party which as well as being the Government Party is the strongest numerical Party in the country.  Nobody can slide out of the issue, as various Members have attempted to do, by saving this is not the referendum.  It is not the referendum but it is the clearing <Col N="410" /> of the decks before the referendum. The Government Party are already using all their efforts to change the position.  Inevitably, as a result of this system of the straight vote, the country will get a weaker Opposition.  Again, you cannot lay down rules.  Nobody can say that any Party, even in the next election, will get an overwhelming majority; but certainly that is the reason why this Bill has been brought in.</P>
    <P>This evening, the Taoiseach himself said he was going over his attitude to P.R.  In the course of his speech, he referred to how he had changed and said it was the election of 1948 which made him change.  The election of 1948 was the first time the Fianna Fáil Party had been beaten since they came into power, and they were beaten by a Coalition.  He said it was the Coalition that changed his mind.  Well now, the Taoiseach is entitled to his point of view, but surely that is a very imperious attitude of mind to take? That is the reason this is being done. It is to get rid of various minority representations in this House that we have this Bill before us now.</P>
    <P>I believe that minorities have a right to representation.  I further believe that in this country of ours all sections have something to bring into Parliament. They have a point of view and have a right to put it forward.  Since the establishment of this State they have enjoyed that as freely as the air they breathe around them. Now that is to be changed.  It is to be impossible for certain small political minorities to get representation in this House. At times, I will frankly say myself, small minorities represented in Parliament can be a nuisance to the other people, but I believe it is their right to put forward their views here and that it is up to us so to measure and so to do our work in Parliament and learn to get on with each other that out of these views, which at times may be irritating, we may form an Ireland and a viewpoint representative of the views of the whole country.  That is our political obligation.  It is a problem which confronts us.  If we surmount that problem, we will make out of our Ireland a country the like of which we have never seen before.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> I am always moved when I think of something I read once in connection with Roman history.  This writer said, and I assume it is a fact, that during the great days of the Roman Republic it was the proud boast of the Roman Senate that during 300 years they never broke up a meeting without arriving at a measure of agreement. They settled their differences, and they conquered the world.  I do not want Ireland to conquer the world, but I do want Ireland to conquer her differences, to settle her differences in friendly argument in this House, and if at times the proceedings get perhaps rather boisterous, I do not think that matters.  It is the democratic way of life, and we must learn to use this difficult, subtle, but very precious instrument of parliamentary democracy.  It is a direct challenge to the political genius of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I believe they have political genius developed to a very, very high degree and, if their leaders would put that aspect of the matter clearly before the people, I believe they would rise to the occasion and make this Chamber one of the finest in the world.  I do not think this is a bad Chamber. Deputy Corry spoke about contempt for some of our Institutions. I have been sixteen years in Dáil Éireann.  I have no contempt for it.  Indeed, I have a pride in it.  Taking the rough with the smooth, the good with the bad, the Irish people may be, and should be, thankful for the parliamentary representation they have.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach touched lightly on the question of the North.  The abolition of P.R. can be no stretch of the imagination be deemed to be a help towards the solution of Partition. The fact that the North did away with P.R. in 1929, or whatever year it was, is no excuse for the South trying to do away with it in 1959. Some day when Partition will have gone&mdash;it may not be in my lifetime, but some day it will have gone&mdash;the bringing together of our people will be made all the easier, I believe, if we have a system here which readily accepts minorities, a system which will <Col N="412" /> have become so accustomed to the handling of minorities that, out of that handling, there will have developed a very fine instrument of parliamentary democracy.  Such a system will make the united Ireland to which we all look forward that much easier.</P>
    <P>I could go on and mention other things in connection with P.R. I could get a bit bitter about it, but I do not think that would do any good. Of course, I should only be bitter generally.  I should not be bitter against individuals.  I could be bitter at this effort want only to throw aside one of the most civilised instruments of election known to man and to go back to a system which inevitably leads to the disfranchisement of a large proportion of the electorate.  We have a duty in this Chamber to form a Government and to run the country. But we have an even higher duty, the duty of allowing the people to express their viewpoints as accurately as possible.  That is what P.R. does.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense to say, as one of the Ministers said, that there is a better choice in a single member constituency. There is one candidate representing each Party.  How is that candidate chosen?  The choice may be a good one or the choice may not be a particularly wise one at all.  One candidate will stand forward for Fianna Fáil.  One candidate will stand forward for Fine Gael, contesting a single member constituency with a straight vote.  A voter may say: &ldquo;I like that Fianna Fáil man. I should like to vote for him, but he is very interested in some particular aspect of currency reform with which, of course, I do not agree at all.&rdquo; That voter will vote against that candidate, even though he likes him, because he feels strongly against currency reform. Where there are three candidates, four candidates or five candidates, the issue is simpler from the point of view of the voter.  He can vote in the order of his preference. He can express his preference.  The voter has a real choice in deciding who will represent him.  He has no choice in a single member constituency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> We have heard a good deal about gerrymandering.  The Taoiseach appeared to be surprised by the reference to it.  Mark you, it is not unknown in this part of the world.  We have, I think, 22 three-member constituencies. The establishment of three-member constituencies was, in itself, a hole and corner method to defeat the true working of P.R.  In point of fact that particular device boomeranged.  Nothing is absolute of course where human preferences are concerned.  But three-member constituencies undermined some of the finer shades of P.R.  Indeed, they not only undermined it but the very principle of them destroyed the proper effect of P.R.  We are also well aware of constituencies having been altered and changed for reasons other than that of population.  Oh, we know a good deal about gerrymandering here.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why thinking people are against this.  There are some who think, perhaps, there might be some good in the alteration, but I feel very strongly that we are taking a very retrograde step.  We have trained our people in the sense and in the way that political Parties try to train their electorate.  We have tried to instruct the Irish people during the whole of this State's existence in the workings of P.R.  The people now understand it. There is sometimes a multiplicity of Parties, but, as I say, I believe that that is a challenge to our political sagacity and skill and, above all, P.R. is the sensible, civilised and, above all, the just way of electing people to a Parliament and I am very sorry that an Irish Government is attempting to advise the people to change this really superb method of election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question before the House at the moment is the proposed change from the multi-seat constituency to the single-seat constituency and from the transferable vote to the non-transferable vote under that arrangement.  It is rather a pity that the contributions to the debate this evening have not been more closely related to that aspect of the Bill rather than rambling over the whole scope of the measure.  It would be safe for me to say that there are quite a number <Col N="414" /> of Deputies, not only on these benches but on the benches opposite, who believe that the single-seat constituency system is the better of the two.  In fact, on the Second Reading of this Bill, a number of Deputies who formerly formed part of the Coalition Government here put forward an amendment to the proposals then set out in the Bill suggesting, as an alternative, the single-seat constituency and the transferable vote as the solution. That justifies me in expressing the view that there are Deputies on the Opposition Benches who believe in the wisdom of the single-seat constituency arrangement.</P>
      <P>I have always felt very strongly on that point.  My views on the matter were reinforced beyond doubt in the past couple of years since I had the experience of being a Deputy.  Every Deputy is in a position to know that the present method of multi-seat constituencies is unsatisfactory, from the point of view of serving the constituency. In a constituency represented by three, four, or five Deputies, there would have to be some local workable arrangement between the members of a Party or, alternatively, between the members of all Parties, which, of course, would be impossible, in order to serve the entire area adequately.  I say without fear of contradiction that proper service cannot be given to the constituency as a whole.</P>
      <P>The first difficulty is that, no matter what part of the constituency the Deputy belongs to, he is called to render service in various parts of the area.  That would be bad enough in remote areas, but the other Deputies representing the constituency are also asked to co-operate and to render service, very often when it is unnecessary to do so.  The Deputy&mdash;and this goes for every Deputy in that particular constituency&mdash;is unable to deal with any degree of success, satisfaction or efficiency, with the general problems appertaining to his own area.  That is due to the fact that the entire area demands his attention and he is endeavouring to the best of his ability to give satisfaction to the entire territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, under the new arrangement, it is envisaged that a Deputy should represent a <i>bloc</i> of the population of from <Col N="415" /> 20,000 to 30,000, I hope that in the city constituencies as far as possible the ceiling will be lifted to the 30,000 mark, because a Deputy is quite capable of serving 30,000 in a city constituency and it might happen that because of geographical and other conditions, he would find it difficult to serve 20,000 in a rural area.</P>
    <P>On the question of service, it is only common sense that a Deputy would be in a better position to represent a defined area adjacent to his place of residence than to serve an extensive area, part of which he might see only once a year in the course of his travels through the constituency.</P>
    <P>I have a very particular reason for suggesting that the question of the single-seat constituency might be divided into two parts, first of all, to deal with it from the point of view of being a unit of the electoral system and, secondly, to deal with it as to the method of election that might be employed to return a successful candidate for the single-seat constituency. Many speakers have suggested that a candidate of a particular Party might be returned for a single-seat constituency with as little as 25 per cent. of the total vote.  That is so and it should be obvious to anybody why it is so.  It can only happen when there are a number of candidates&mdash;two, three, four or five&mdash;and it is obvious that even under the multi-seat system, a large number of candidates influences to a considerable extent the total number of first preference votes that all candidates receive.</P>
    <P>Experience teaches that the more candidates there are in a constituency under the multi seat arrangement, the lower the first preference votes, generally speaking.  Under the single-seat system, if the people want to have a definite choice, if there happens to be a large number of candidates, they have only one vote and that vote must be cast in the first instance for the candidate of their choice.  I think that is very logical.  After all, in the matter of selecting candidates for the Parliament of the country, I am very doubtful if it is possible to make a case that there should be more than one choice.  This <Col N="416" /> is a case of hitting the nail on the head and bringing the elector to a realisation that, unless he does that, he is dealing with a very dangerous situation.</P>
    <P>The difference between the policies of the candidates, during general election time especially is well known to the voter.  The Party opposite, when it suits their book, are inclined to suggest that the average voter is a person who scarcely understands what he is doing.  In the next breath, we are told how very intelligent the voters of this country are.  I subscribe to the latter view.  I think that our people, as a whole, compared with other people, have a very thorough grasp of the political science necessary for the ordinary man in the street. It is entirely wrong that any attempt should be made to say otherwise.</P>
    <P>At election time, the people have a number of candidates before them. Under the new arrangement which is proposed under this Bill, they will have one candidate for a particular Party or Parties as the case may be who propose contesting the constituency. It might mean that many parties would come forward and select candidates to contest that election.  I was rather surprised at the attempts made here to suggest that the system of the single non-transferable vote tended to deprive minorities of representation.</P>
    <P>Is it not quite obvious that if any school of thought, with any reasonable backing in a constituency, puts forward a candidate, that candidate has the ordinary facilities to prosecute his election campaign as successfully as the candidate of any other Party?  Is it not quite obvious also that if the policy that candidate follows and is adopted for happens to have a reasonably sizable proportion of the support of the electorate, he stands a good chance of election?</P>
    <P>Let us examine his chances of election under the single non-transferable vote as against the present transferable vote system.  If we go closely into it, we find that any minority Party which has behind it a sizable proportion of the electorate has as good a chance of electing its <Col N="417" /> candidate as the Party would have under the single transferable vote.  An attempt was made here in one instance to suggest that the change to the single seat constituency is something new&mdash;something never heard of up to some weeks ago.  We all know that on many occasions various sections of the community&mdash;there are newspaper reports of chambers of commerce meetings and other similar organisations who might have thought fit to speak on this subject&mdash;were not&mdash;I submit that happened before 1948&mdash;at all satisfied with the system of P.R. as it operated in this country.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are public representatives know from our own experience that the more workable arrangement is the one now suggested under Part 2 of this Bill.  One of the speakers here this evening made the point that there was a great danger, under the single seat constituency arrangement, that an unsuitable candidate would be selected for a particular Party and that whether the supporters of that Party wished it or not, they were obliged to vote for that candidate.  I agree there is a possibility that that would happen, but I suggest it can happen only with a Party that has no system of local organisation. The Deputy on the other side of the House is inclined to scoff at that remark.</P>

      <P>The candidates of this Party&mdash;I can only answer for my own Party and when the Deputy on the other side of the House speaks later, I am sure he can answer for his Party&mdash;are selected, I suggest, in the only democratic way possible.  If the people want a particular candidate, they have an opportunity provided for <Col N="418" /> them in the form of a convention prior to either a general election or a by-election, of coming forward and, if necessary, by their votes at that assembly selecting the candidate who is the popular choice.  What other system can there be?</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy O'Higgins who made the statement this evening that the new system could help in some indirect, if not, direct way, the Party bosses to select a candidate of their own choice.  I suggest that the very opposite is the case.  Under the old system, if a Party boss decided that a particular candidate of local choice was not the suitable type of candidate for the Party and attempted to impose a candidate by direct selection, I suggest he could succeed in getting that latter type candidate more easily than he could under the new system.  If that happened and the other candidate who was the local choice, decided to go forward and contest the issue as an Independent, the usual experience was that he lost out because the Party organisation was not behind him.  His votes, as a rule, transferred fairly well to the other candidate who, we are told, is selected by the Party bosses and that candidate usually got elected.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, the very opposite will happen.  If a Party boss, as we are told, decides to nominate a candidate and that candidate goes forward particularly in opposition to the candidate put up by the local choice, the result is more likely to be that neither candidate will be elected and an opposition candidate will succeed. I think that bears out my point that there is certainly less danger of a Party imposing its will in a matter of selecting a candidate on the local organisation under the single-seat arrangement than there is under the other system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Higgins who made the point here that in Article 16, sub-section (5), of the Constitution of 1937, the principle of P.R. was enshrined and that if the Government found from experience that the existing system was not working satisfactorily, it would be preferable if Article 16 of the Constitution were completely removed.  The Deputy stopped there, or at least I could not follow his <Col N="419" /> line of argument from then onwards. I accept that Deputy O'Higgins, by virtue of his legal and parliamentary experience, should be more competent to deal with a matter of this kind than I, but still, ordinary common sense tells me it would not be possible to remove, delete or abrogate an Article of the Constitution without at least putting it before the people.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went to great pains, in my opinion, to suggest that rather than putting this issue before the people, the Dáil as a body should decide on it.  That would be a very retrograde step and certainly a very dangerous step.  Any amendment, or any radical change in the Constitution has, fortunately for the people, to be decided by them.  All the Government are attempting to do is to make that change effective here in Parliament, in so far as they can, so that they will be in a position to offer it to the people as a whole for their views.</P>
    <P>It was Deputy Blowick, I think, who referred to the cost of this referendum.  He mentioned a sum of £100,000.  I do not know where he got the figure.  It may be right or it may be somewhat exaggerated, and I am inclined to think it is, but for the sake of argument I will accept that figure.  I submit, Sir, that allowing that the figure is correct an expenditure even to that extent&mdash;much as we might require it for many other purposes at the moment&mdash;is certainly justified when a vital matter such as a change in the electoral system is involved.</P>
    <P>It was also Deputy Blowick, I think, who said that this change came about merely by a sudden decision of the Taoiseach.  I am rather surprised that a Deputy of Deputy Blowick's experience in this House, should make an irresponsible statement of that kind.  The Taoiseach has been indicted on a number of occasions by newspapers holding views opposed to his&mdash;and more particularly, prior to general elections&mdash;for his dislike of P.R. and for the apparent tendency he has shown to <Col N="420" /> change it.  For some reason, which is very hard to understand, that indictment was not generally repeated prior to the 1954 election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>There were many other somewhat similar indictments, I suppose, at that time and perhaps the Press felt there were other more important hares to be raised than the question of P.R.  The Taoiseach has expressed his views on the system of P.R. on many occasions.  He has been quoted here as expressing very definite views on the system when the Constitution was being debated in the House in 1937.  He has been quoted as expressing very opposite views in 1948. These quotations are on record and the people who are charging the Taoiseach with inconsistency and rather undependable judgment should at least give him credit for having given on a number of occasions the reasons for his change of viewpoint.</P>
      <P>Whether these changes of viewpoint on the part of the Taoiseach should or should not be accepted by the Opposition&mdash;I suppose it would be too much to expect them to accept them&mdash; the Taoiseach has, in my opinion, given very concrete reasons why a review of our electoral system should take place at the present moment. He was very wise to get that system enshrined in the Constitution when it was going through the House 21 years ago.  We had at the time the Opposition expressing grave dissatisfaction with that arrangement and suggesting it should be something more flexible.  I believe it is very important that our electoral system should not be flexible.  It is the instrument of the people, the only means they have available every few years to decide what Party, or what personnel for that matter, is to govern the country and look after their affairs. For that reason alone, apart from any other, it is only right that the people should have the authority and the machinery to change that system whenever they think it desirable to do so.</P>

      <P>Demands have been put forward for the consideration of the Government, I might go further and say the question has been dealt with at conventions of the Parties in opposition many years ago, and again in recent times.  Those Parties seem to be very well advised, in their own opinion anyhow, as to what the views of members of our Parliamentary Party are on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of my colleagues on this side of the House said on the Second Reading of this Bill that they would be happy if this were left to a free vote of the House.  They had no doubt as to the way they would vote. I made that statement myself.  It would be a very embarrassing situation if this free vote, demanded from <Col N="422" /> the other side, were given, because I am quite sure there are Deputies on that side who would vote for a change in the electoral system.  I am prepared to give them credit to this extent: they may not all vote in favour of a change from the transferable vote to the non-transferable vote, but I am pretty sure, if the issue were taken in two stages, quite a number would vote for the change from the multi-seat constituency to the single seat constituency.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second issue, I am also sure a number of Deputies on that side have very definite views as to the advisability&mdash;and I should go further and say the necessity&mdash;for a change from the system of P.R. to the straight vote system.</P>
    <P>We are told that only a very limited number of Deputies from this side of the House spoke on the Second Reading.  That challenge was thrown at the Party in the early stages of the discussion, but when the debate continued for two or three days, there was no repetition of the challenge because by that time a sizable proportion of our Party had spoken very effectively on this measure.  I suggest it is the duty of all members to give their views on this matter.  It is a very vital issue and one that has to be put to the people in a straightforward and intelligent manner.  We owe that to the people.  Whether we are in Government or in Opposition, it is our duty to put forward the pros and cons of the issue so that the people will get an opportunity of deciding on the vital part they have to play.</P>
    <P>I indicated at the outset that this Deputy was in favour of a single-seat constituency arrangement rather than the multiple seat one.  I gave a number of reasons why, generally speaking, the single seat arrangement was the better one.  I propose, with the permission of the Chair, to go back to that point again.  I think the single seat arrangement in particular ensures a closer personal relationship between the Deputy elected for the constituency and the constituency as a whole.  Even with the multiple seat constituency as we have it at the moment, I think every Deputy is prepared to accept that, once he is elected, he is representative of all <Col N="423" /> the people, electors and non-electors of the constituency.  If that can be accepted under the multiple seat constituency, why is it not possible to accept it under the single seat arrangement?</P>
    <P>There are a number of constituencies in the country at the moment where a particular Party might not happen to have a Deputy sitting in the present Dáil.  What happens in a constituency of that type?  The constituents are obliged to approach the Deputies of other Parties in connection with problems about which they would normally approach their own representative, if he were elected.  I am quite sure their experience in such circumstances is always satisfactory and that, in the long-run, it will make very little difference in so far as winning-over or disturbing the political allegiance of constituents.  We all know that in the next election, if they happen to have their own Party choice going forward, their allegiance will naturally go to that candidate and that they feel in no way indebted&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;to the Deputies of any other Party for any services which they rendered to them during the period their own Party had no representation.</P>
    <P>It is an impossibility for all Parties to get representation under any type of arrangement.  Some Deputy said, and I think it is very true, that the only way we could give all people and all minorities representation would be to allow every citizen to assemble here, to take part in the deliberations of the House and, generally speaking, to be allowed to act as Deputies act.  It would be a physical impossibility to have every Party, minor Parties or major Parties or whatever they may be, represented here as they would wish to be.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk here to the effect that we are depriving minorities of rights to which they are entitled.  The present system of P.R. has been in operation for up to 40 years.  Let us examine the number of minority Parties that have, in actual practice, come into this House and contributed to it during the lifetime of a particular Dáil.  Is it not a fact that most of the representative <Col N="424" /> minority Parties have found it a wiser course to throw in their lot with one of the major political Parties and have tried to get their viewpoint represented through that arrangement?</P>
    <P>Some speakers attempted to make the point that one of the reasons&mdash;and we have had, indeed, hundreds of reasons&mdash;why this measure was brought forward was that the Sinn Féin Party might be excluded from this House.  It is soon enough to make that argument when the Sinn Féin Party themselves protest on those lines. They are not taking their seats in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had quotations from Sweden, from the snow and the frost, and we had quotations from sunny South Africa.

      <P>I am quoting from a pamphlet entitled &ldquo;The Irish Free State General Election, 1933&rdquo; by John H. Humphreys, and it is worth while reading on the back of this a quotation from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 24th January, 1933, under the heading &ldquo;Simple and Easy&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The English Press correspondents sympathise with us in having to work so complicated a system as P.R.  It is wasted sympathy, for the system is simple to understand and easy to carry out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I deplore the fact that I am speaking on this subject to-night&mdash;and I said the same thing when I spoke before&mdash; because we should be doing the nation's business in relation to unemployment and emigration.  The Taoiseach said this evening that one of the things he wanted to do away with was small minority Parties promising anything in order to obtain office.  Did he forget his famous outburst in Belmullet before the last election or the statement by the Tánaiste about the £225,000,000 and the 100,000 jobs?  I would welcome legislation in relation to the £225,000,000 and the 100,000 jobs, but instead of that we are dealing with this section of a Bill to abolish P.R.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no word to the people about this in the last election.  The Fianna Fáil Party were too busy telling the people they would not remove the subsidies.  They were too busy saying: &ldquo;Housewives, vote for Fianna Fáil and put your husbands to work.&rdquo; This whole thing is a piece of Fianna Fáil villainy.  They want to make sure that their hierarchy will be kept there.  They want to make sure that this cesspool will be maintained.  I am quoting now from a boy who was reared in a Fianna Fáil home, in the Fianna Fáil hierarchy, and who wrote those words in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> after he had been released from the Curragh.  You all know who he is. That was the voice of the youth of Ireland protesting against this measure.  In the Machiavellian workings of this Party, it is anticipated that perhaps the Leader of the Party, <Col N="427" /> the mascot or the vote catcher, may not always be there or that he may be ready to flit to the Park, and that it would be well to have the system changed in order to cement the Party in office.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs said this evening that nobody could gerrymander the constituencies here, because they would not know how. What Fianna Fáil did in relation to the three-seat constituencies must have been an accident.  It must have been an accident that Youghal was cut off from Cork giving an advantage to Fianna Fáil Deputies.  It must have been an accident that constituencies were cut off here in Dublin and in west Cork.  That was not gerrymandering at all.</P>
    <P>Lord Brookeborough, I believe, is at present enjoying the sun somewhere and it must be some consolation to him to know that the former Republican Party in Ireland are now standing over this system of election for the people of Northern Ireland in that they are going to do the same thing.  It is said great minds think alike but in this connection they are not great minds, in my opinion, and in the opinion of many other people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs said we should go to the people, that the people are entitled to know what is happening.  We are entitled to tell the people and the only hope and the only chance we have of telling them is from these benches because we have not got three tied papers to rewrite the speeches made in Dáil Éireann and send them out with photographs of strong men looking at the people. Strong men! It would remind you of Jimmy O'Dea's pantomime.</P>

We are accused on this side of the <Col N="428" /> House of not being consistent.  The most inconsistent man in politics in the whole world is the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He is the greatest political acrobat of all time as is evident from his performance in relation to P.R.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I am raising to-night the matter of foreign trawlers encroaching within the three mile limit of the south-eastern coasts of Wexford and Waterford.  There are two or three other Deputies who wish to speak and, in the short time at my disposal, I want to draw to the Minister's attention the seriousness of the situation existing on the southern coasts of Wexford and Waterford.  It is a situation in which the livelihood of approximately 500 fishermen and, of course, their families is involved.  I do not know what the Minister has done in respect of this situation, but he himself will have seen the attention that has been focussed upon it by the various newspapers in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> The encroachment of these foreign trawlers has seriously damaged the livelihood of 500 fishermen.  I am informed, by the fishermen themselves, that there are German, Dutch, Polish, French and British trawlers&mdash;and I believe, according to a report this morning from Radio Eireann, four Russian trawlers&mdash;fishing in the vicinity of Dunmore East and the southern coast of Wexford, that is, fishing within the three mile limit.  These trawlers are from 350 to 600 tons and, as the Minister will appreciate, they are substantially bigger than any of the inshore fishing boats which our Irish fishermen have.  Apart from taking fish illegally, they are damaging the spawning ground which is very valuable as far as herring catches are concerned.  They are using trawl nets which again, as the Minister will appreciate, fish along the bottom of the sea and in that, they are doing serious damage to spawn.  They are taking and damaging the spawn.</P>
    <P>The Irish boats use ring nets and nets that do not drag along the sea floor.  These boats are not big enough, nor are they equipped, to compete with the other trawlers outside the three-mile limit and, of necessity, they are confined to fishing for herring within the three-mile limit.  I should like to report to the Minister what has been reported to me by these fishermen, that in some cases these foreign trawlers, with utter disregard for the rights of Irish fishermen, are coming within the three-mile limit and deliberately damaging the nets of Irish fishermen.  That is a situation which the Minister and the Government should not tolerate, despite the fact that our defensive resources, to say the best of them, are very limited indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government may ask: &ldquo;What is the remedy?&rdquo; Again I say it is true, as reported to me by the fishermen, that the two corvettes, the <i>Macha</i> and the <i>Cliona,</i> are doing their job well.  They are doing their job as best they can when one has regard to the size of the corvettes and the equipment they have.  I am informed, or at least I read in the newspapers, that they have made two arrests among the number of foreign trawlers <Col N="430" /> that are there, but it is impossible for them to trace and catch every foreign trawler that comes within the three mile limit.  At any rate, they have made two arrests and the skipper of one of these fishing boats was fined a meagre £25 and I believe that his gear was confiscated.</P>
    <P>That, in my opinion, and in the opinion of the fishermen, is not a sufficient penalty to deter these people from illegally fishing in Irish territorial waters because, as far as my information goes, the £25 is easily earned by these people.  Having regard to the size of their boats and their equipment, it is only portion of a catch for them, but the serious thing is that while the gear is confiscated, immediately after the court case in which the gear is confiscated has been held, the gear is auctioned and the skipper himself, or one of his fishing pals, buys it up and off goes the Frenchman, the Dutchman or the Pole to do again what he was arrested for.</P>
    <P>I think, first, that there should be heavier penalties.  The law may say that there should be some maximum, but if that maximum is not enough, I suggest there should be immediate legislation introduced to provide for bigger fines.  Secondly, the gear when confiscated should be held for protracted periods, that is to say, at least until the season is over.  But, above all, if these foreign trawlers come in to fish within three miles of the Irish coast, they should be punished by having their boats confiscated, and they themselves should be sent home at the expense of the Government of the State whence they came.</P>
    <P>I want to stress as strongly as I can the damage these foreign trawlers are doing, not alone to the Irish fishermen but to the spawning grounds of the southern coasts of Wexford and Waterford. I should like to make this suggestion to the Minister.  Many of us are aware of the generosity and bountifulness of the American Government. It is appreciated that we cannot have a big naval fleet, but at least we should provide for the protection of an industry which is regarded as being a fairly important industry in this country, that is, the fishing industry.  Would <Col N="431" /> it be too much to ask the Minister, or the Government, to request the loan of some fishery protection boats from the Government of the United States?  So far as I am aware, the United States have many boats at their disposal which could be adapted to fishery protection, boats laid up, as the expression is, &ldquo;in moth balls&rdquo; which could easily be lent to the Irish Government for the purpose of protecting our territorial waters.</P>
    <P>Along with that, I should like to suggest to the Minister that, as I said, having Dutch, Belgian, Polish, British and Russian fishermen operating illegally in our waters, would it be unreasonable to ask on behalf of our fishermen that a strong note of protest be sent to the heads of these Governments, requesting them to remind their fishermen to respect Irish territorial waters?  I have mentioned Irish territorial waters and the three-mile limit a few times, but I should like to know if there is a misunderstanding about this three-mile limit.  Has there been a change in recent years?  Is the Minister satisfied that the fishermen know what the three-mile limit is and, above all, is the Minister satisfied that the commanders of the corvettes know exactly what the three-mile limit is?</P>
    <P>Is it that foreign fishermen cannot fish within three miles of habitable land, or is it the fact that where the distance from headland to headland is less than 15 miles, foreign fishermen cannot fish within that base line from headland to headland?  I want to bring to the Minister's notice that the distance between Hook Head in Wexford and the Big Saltee Island is 11 miles, and that foreign trawlers are allowed to operate within that baseline. I understood that when the baseline was less than 15 miles, foreign trawlers could not operate inside it.  It was brought to my notice that there is a map or a chart described as &ldquo;Close's Irish Sea&mdash;St. George's and North Channel&rdquo; on which there is a black thick line which is supposed to be the three-mile territorial limit.  That is supposed to be the limit within which foreign trawlers cannot operate. There is also on that map or chart a <Col N="432" /> thin red line indicating that trawling inside that limit is prohibited at all times.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to do the best he can, in the time at his disposal, to answer some of these questions and particularly to say what exactly is the three-mile limit.  I should also like him to say whether or not the Irish Government propose to seek to extend the three-mile limit, because that is what the Irish fishermen want, in view of the fact that their boats are not equipped to trawl in what is regarded as deep sea.  Because they confine themselves to the inshore, it means they must have greater waters within which to fish.  It is a serious problem and it has affected, and will affect, the livelihood of 500 fishermen in that part of the country.  I trust that the Minister and his Department will try to do something to alleviate the difficulties of these men.</P>

      <P>I shall just say that our territorial waters are inadequate and leave it at that.  The Minister knows quite well that what Deputy Corish has said is true; the fishermen themselves said it and it was publicly stated in the Press.  The other point I have to make is that to protect <Col N="433" /> your fishing, you have got to surprise the marauding fishermen.  I have said it before in this House that if you are trying to protect your fishing fleet by corvettes which can be seen on a clear day up to 20 miles away&mdash;they are hung up right out of the sea&mdash;you are not going to get near these marauding trawlers and catch them.  If you had even a trawler itself manned by naval personnel, as is done in other countries, you could easily come up to these poachers.</P>
      <P>About a month ago, I asked a question about this matter and the Minister for Lands said that there were no foreign trawlers here.  Anyone who saw the photograph in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday could see one of the biggest fishing fleets ever before seen off our coast.  Unless the Government face the situation realistically and realise what the fishermen of that part of the country are up against, their livelihood will cease to exist.  They are being outfished by a stronger type of boat and unless we are prepared to give the fishermen facilities and proper protection, they will have no future here.</P>

      <P>I simply want to endorse what Deputy Corish has said.  Last Sunday there was a meeting of the fishing interests of most of the maritime counties, and the people connected with them, in Dunmore East, and the substance of their protest was exactly what Deputy Corish had said, that foreign trawlers are coming within the three-mile limit and that their method of fishing, and the kind of gear they have, is doing irreparable damage to the fish spawning grounds all along the coast.  That coast has been noted as excellent spawning ground for centuries back and damage is being done by these better equipped trawlers which are bigger than our boats and the Irish fishermen have no hope at all of competing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he would consider either the purchase or securing on loan from the British Government of a helicopter or number <Col N="434" /> of helicopters?  To my mind, the difficulty of using the corvettes is the question of coming across the trawlers when they are inside the three-mile limit.  With the use of radio telephony, a helicopter could render invaluable service by directing the corvettes to the actual scene when the poaching is going on.  In that way, more arrests could be carried out and more protection afforded to the grounds.  Whatever the Minister intends to do, I would appeal for an immediate decision on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate what Deputies Corish and Kyne and Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde have said about this matter.  It is no harm to say in criticism of the Ministers that they took no notice and said that there were no foreign trawlers. I have been pointing out this for I do not know how many years, that there is an armada there and there is always an armada down there when the fish begin to run.  Those vessels fish in and out of the three-mile limit.  The <i>Cliona</i> and the <i>Macha</i> are doing as good a job as they can in a big area which stretches from Helvick Head to Carnsore Point and it is a physical impossibility for the captains of these vessels to make more captures.  I agree with what Deputy Kyne said.  Air reconnaissance would be a great help and it would be worth while.  There must be millions of pounds worth of fish being taken from our seas and irreparable damage being done to the spawning beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of protection is the whole point for the Minister and it would be a great help to the <i>Cliona</i> and the <i>Macha,</i> if they were equipped with fast launches.  Such launches would be a great help in spotting out these poachers and making captures.  As far as the fines are concerned, I think a £25 fine is only nominal.  Of course if the gear is taken away, it is a very heavy fine. I believe the captain of a German trawler had to deposit £4,000 against his gear and his catch.  I think that what should be done is not to confiscate the gear but to fine the trawlers very heavily, to the extent <Col N="435" /> of some thousands of pounds.  If that were not a success, I should be in agreement with the suggestion of Deputy Corish, that their boats should be confiscated.</P>

      <P>The Naval Service provides fishery protection to the limit of its capabilities and during this period of the very large run of herrings on the south-east coast, the Naval Service has been paying particular attention to that area.  The arrival of these large boats, of course, and the consequent concentration of fishing trawlers of many nations in the area, and the spectacular catches made, have been a very good news item and many rumours that circulated in the area have received a great deal of prominence. Apparently some of the Deputies who have spoken have accepted all these rumours on their face value without making any effort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The allegations have been made that all these boats are fishing inside our limits.  That is not the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said that there were French, Dutch and German trawlers, all fishing within the three-mile limit.  I think that was said and will appear in the Official Report.  That is not the fact.  Most of the fishing has been taking place at quite considerable distances from our shores, at distances averaging from six to eight miles.  Since this run of herring came the <i>Macha</i> has been on patrol there from the very outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pressed in the Dáil in the month of November by Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde to make known in advance what our plans were for dealing with this situation when the herring arrived.  I pointed out it would not be <Col N="436" /> desirable to give that information in advance and now the Deputy who pressed me to give it talked about the necessity for surprise.  In actual fact, the area has been patrolled from the very start and fishing has been taking place in a restricted area comparatively easy to patrol.  That is my information, and the officers of the Naval Service are satisfied there were no gross infringements of our territorial waters and that the allegations being made are not, in fact, true.</P>
    <P>However, five arrests have been made.  Four of the skippers concerned have been charged and convictions secured.  The fifth arrest was made only to-day and the case has not been heard yet, so far as I know.  The five arrests to which I have referred were all base-line cases: there was no case of flagrant violation of the three-mile limit.  These cases were not actually within three miles of the land but within the limits of the base lines drawn from head to head to which Deputy Corish referred.  Convictions were secured and fines were imposed. So far as the fines were concerned, I have no function.  The Naval Service merely acts as agent for the Minister for Lands and, of course, the courts decide cases in accordance with law. The gear and the fish were confiscated and I know that in one case as much as 75 tons of fish were confiscated, in addition to gear.</P>
    <P>If the gear is bought back, as Deputy Corish says for very small prices, that, again, is not the responsibility of the Minister for Defence.  We arrest these trawlers, bring the skippers to court and prove our case.  It is all right for people to say these trawlers are fishing within the three-mile limit, but the officers of the Naval Service must be able to stand up in court and prove they were, in fact, inside the three-mile limit.  In the arrests made so far, they have been able to prove that, but these cases are being appealed which shows that the skippers of the trawlers, apparently, think or thought, or claimed they thought, they were in fact outside the three-mile limit.  Because of the appeals, I think these cases should be regarded as being still <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    <P>Fishing down there has been taking <Col N="437" /> place in a restricted area and the officers of the Naval Service operating there say it was comparatively easy to patrol the area and that the presence of the second boat, the <i>Cliona,</i> was hardly necessary.  Really, it was brought there only in an attempt to boost the morale of our own fishermen.  The Naval Service officers believe the <i>Macha</i> was quite capable of patrolling the area effectively and that even if we had other boats there, they would be unnecessary. While I agree that, generally speaking, the Naval Service is inadequate to patrol the whole of our coast line, in this case the area concerned was only a small one and I believe the patrolling was done quite effectively, and that the arrests made and the penalties imposed have induced a healthy respect in these foreign trawlers for the efficiency of our patrol boats.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde said that I said there were no foreign trawlers there, but that was in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 6th November.  I do not say now there are no foreign trawlers in the area.  There are, of course; but I can say the area is being effectively patrolled and that there is no wholesale or flagrant violation of our exclusive fishery rights.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is anything else I have to say.  If it had been a case of our having been taken unawares, I have no doubt there would be reasonable cause for complaint, but the area has been patrolled from the very start and I think that, taking account of all the factors, the situation has been satisfactorily dealt with and I believe that the local fishermen are quite satisfied that their interests have been protected. Of course, they would like us, no doubt, to prevent foreign trawlers from taking the huge catches of fish, but as the law stands at the moment, we cannot do that.  We can patrol only within the three-mile limit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish did ask that question.  There is no <Col N="438" /> confusion, so far as the officers of the Naval Service are concerned.  They know exactly what the three-mile limit is.  They must prove it in court and have proved in court successfully that these trawlers were within the limits, although they themselves apparently maintained they were not. What Deputy Corish said about base lines is correct and it is on these base lines that our Naval Service operates.</P>

      <P>The foreign fishermen have been kept outside our exclusive fishery rights.  No doubt due to the fact that they have superior boats and superior equipment, they have gained the greatest benefit from this influx of herring off our shores.  That is not our fault.  That cannot be helped. Since they have superior craft and superior numbers, they are bound to get superior catches, but in the main there is no doubt these catches were made outside the limits of our exclusive fishery rights.  That is my information, that there certainly was not in this case any inadequacy in our Naval <Col N="440" /> Service because they were there waiting for this to occur and the area has been patrolled effectively from the very start.  I have no doubt infringements do take place from time to time on account of the smallness of our Naval Service and the extent of the coast we have to patrol, but in this case we have been concentrating there and I am assured it was done effectively.</P>
