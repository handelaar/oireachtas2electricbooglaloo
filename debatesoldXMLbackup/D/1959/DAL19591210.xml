      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) That, if necessary, the Dáil sit later than, 11 p.m. today and that the hour at which business is to be interrupted be five and a half hours (exclusive of any period devoted to Questions to Ministers) after the conclusion of Government business, and</P>
      <P>(2) that the Dáil sit later than 2.30 p.m. tomorrow and that (a) the hour at which business is to be interrupted be 5 p.m., (b) business be confined to the introduction of Bills, formal business and the Motion for the Adjournment of the Dáil and (c) the Taoiseach shall be called upon by the Chair not later than 4 p.m. to conclude the debate on the Motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a few points on this Motion.  I would not do so, were it not for the fact that the Minister for Local Government failed to give us a reply last night when he was asked whether he proposed to <Col N="1148" /> give time this session before the House rose to conclude the motion concerning the Local Authorities (Works) Act. The Government have had notice of that because I told the Minister here last night that most Deputies, particularly rural Deputies, were anxious for a decision on the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  We asked him last night whether, if the Deputies gave way, he would give an assurance that time would be made available.  The second paragraph of this motion shows that the Government wish the business to be confined to the introduction of Bills, formal business and the Motion for the Adjournment for the House tomorrow and that the Taoiseach be called upon to conclude the debate on the motion not later than 4 o'clock.</P>
      <P>The Government should give an opportunity to have a very important matter like drainage dealt with prior to the House rising for the Christmas recess.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy McQuillan's point that time should be allocated for this very important motion.  There was never a more appropriate time for discussing it, for never has there been so much flooding.  I travelled from West Cork yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to get the position clear.  The Taoiseach states that he will discuss this matter with the Minister for Local Government for the purpose of suggesting that the Minister himself should speak on the adjournment debate.  I do not think the Taoiseach understood my point.  I want to find out whether the motion itself will be concluded.  I do not want to prolong this discussion but the normal procedure in this House over the years used to be that three and a half hours were allowed for Private Members' time, an hour and a half on Tuesday or Wednesday and two hours on Friday.  For years the opportunities for private Deputies to move motions in this House have been limited severely by all Governments.  Surely the serious effects of flooding make it a matter of absolute urgency that a decision be given by the Government as to whether moneys will be made available to relieve flooding under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  There is only one hour and ten minutes left for this motion and I suggest that between now and 12 o'clock tonight or between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. tomorrow the Government could find one hour and ten minutes to discuss a matter of such importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but No. 4 on the Order Paper deals with the question of the Order of Business and the time to be made available. Deputies who are not members of the major Parties cannot have a discussion on important matters of this nature.  Matters of importance in this House seem to be decided outside it as far as time is concerned and I wish to avail of an opportunity which rarely comes to a Deputy of discussing the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that the matter might be left there till 1 p.m. and that between now and 1 o'clock the Taoiseach will have an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Minister for Local Government? When we see how public business has gone between this and 1 o'clock it might be possible to complete Private Members' Business without cutting in on the Adjournment Debate.</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to accept any reasonable arrangement but I want to emphasise that it is not a question of raising this matter on the Adjournment Debate.  The Adjournment Debate generally deals with one or two specific matters which are arranged beforehand and the Taoiseach is responsible for the reply to that discussion, not the Minister for Local Government. However, if at 1 o'clock the matter can come up for further discussion I am prepared to wait. <Col N="1151" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to increase the salary payable to the Comptroller and Auditor General to £2,850 per annum as from the 1st January last.  In common with the salaries of judges and civil servants, the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General is controlled by statute and it has been the practice to increase this salary whenever judges' salaries are increased.  Having regard to the salaries of heads of Departments, a salary of £2,850 is considered appropriate for the post of Comptroller and Auditor General, regard being had to the increased responsibility placed upon him in connection with the commercial audits of State-sponsored bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise on this section a question which I raised on the Second Reading as to why civil servants and certain other parties are excluded from the scope of the Bill. The Minister indicated, on the last occasion, that the reason civil servants were not being brought in under the Bill was that there was no difficulty in collecting their assessments from them.  If P.A.Y.E. has any beneficial effects for the taxpayer, I see no reason why these people&mdash;civil servants, Gardaí, teachers and Army officers&mdash; should not be brought within its beneficial scope if there is a beneficial scope attached to the Bill.  At present, civil servants and these others pay their income tax deductions within a period of six months by way of monthly deductions from their salaries.  The deductions start about August or September or even October and are completed <Col N="1154" /> by the following March.  In other words, they pay their income tax over a period of approximately six months.  The new scheme here envisages that income tax will be paid by weekly or monthly deductions from any person employed or in receipt of emoluments.</P>
      <P>I want again to raise the question that civil servants, Gárdai, Army officers, teachers and such persons should be given whatever benefits are being conferred in the Bill on ordinary persons in employment.  I see no reason why civil servants should be excluded from the provisions of this Bill.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say they do not cause any difficulties in the administrative machine. If it is an easement of their difficulties to spread their income tax payments over 12 months, by 52 weekly deductions or 12 monthly deductions, they ought not to be denied the benefit of the provision which is being made available for other persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand Section 3, the definition of emoluments includes, not merely cash that is paid for wages, but benefits in kind that are also paid to employees.  We had a tremendous discussion on this subject on the Finance Bill, 1958, and, as a result of the enactment of that measure, various benefits in kind are now to be classed as taxable salary. For example, in the case of a director, I think I am correct in saying that &ldquo;emoluments&rdquo; covers the fees payable to a director by a company and that, therefore, whatever fees are paid to a director will be taxable under Schedule E.  I am not quite clear on that and I should like some confirmation, or otherwise, of the position. If that is so, then I am equally <Col N="1155" /> not clear at what stage it is determined that emoluments in kind are to be taken into account.  The framework of P.A.Y.E. is that in the case of persons whole-time engaged, it will apply to those who are in receipt of amounts in excess of £6 per week. If a person is receiving £4 per week in cash and, shall we say, living expenses valued for a further £4, does that person automatically have his £4 worth of&mdash;shall we call it?&mdash;living expenses added?  Is he, therefore, considered now to be assessable under P.A.Y.E. and is the employer bound to take cognisance of that and make the appropriate deductions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reinforce what Deputy Sweetman has said.  This would arise in the case of practically every commercial traveller, many of whom are paid salaries and then are given money for hotel expenses, petrol and such various things.  That can amount to a considerable sum, and yet in no way is that considered part of their income.  It would be grossly unfair if it were to come in sideways under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how anything can come in, as Deputy Dockrell has said, sideways under this Bill.  It seems to me that the definition of &ldquo;emoluments&rdquo; in this section is clear and unambiguous.  As far as I can see, it does not affect the existing position except to set out that &ldquo;emoluments&rdquo; means &ldquo;anything assessable to income tax under Schedule E&rdquo;, anything assessable at the moment to income tax under Schedule E.  That does not make any change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this change. As far as I see it now, it is not the Revenue but the employer who is to determine what is assessable to income tax, because it is the employer who has to decide whether the person concerned comes under P.A.Y.E. or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to come back to the definition in the section, which means &ldquo;anything at the moment assessable.&rdquo;  The point there is that there is no change, as far as I can see, in the method of assessment.  That will be continued to be made in accordance with the existing law.  I gather that, because arrangements are being made for payments by instalments, so to speak, there will be at the end of the year some assessment made as to whether there has been an underpayment or an over-payment of tax and that in certain cases there may be a formal assessment. I understand that one of the advantages of the present system is that, except where it is necessary to make a formal assessment, perhaps in such cases as were referred to by Deputy Dockrell, for the great generality of persons, there will be no formal assessment.  At the beginning of the year, however, when the tax deduction card is applied for, the question of the allowances to be made to that person will be settled once and for all for him on the basis of the information he has supplied to the Revenue Commissioners or to the inspector of taxes.  I understand that the deductions will be made on that basis and that there will be no determination by the employer as to what is properly chargeable to tax.  I think that is the point which the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;E&rdquo; for Edward. I do not see that there will be any difficulty in their case.  There is, of course, this vexed question of allowances, allowances in kind, allowances, say, in the use of a motor car, the use of a residence, and matters of that sort.  I gather that that has already been determined by the House in the Finance Act of last year and there has been no change made in that regard. I hope I have conveyed to the Deputy what is in my own mind in regard to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not made myself clear to the Minister. I agree that in the case of a person whose basic salary is over £6 a week and who is paid expenses in addition, there will be no change in the existing position.  What I am worried about is the marginal case.  As I understand it, an employer, if he does not pay a person more than £6 per week, has not got to deduct tax in any circumstances. Supposing an employer pays a person, let us say, £4 a week and provides expenses of some sort for him, then, as I understand the provisions of Section 3, it is the employer who will have to decide whether the expenses he is paying him are assessable to tax or not.  If those expenses are not assessable to tax, then the employer does not bring the employee in under P.A.Y.E. because he is being paid less than £6 a week.  If the expenses are <Col N="1158" /> assessable to tax, then he must make the appropriate deductions.</P>
      <P>My anxiety is to ensure that there will be some method of making certain that it will not be left to the employer in that position himself to make the determination at the beginning of the year, only to find that his determination, made <i>bona fide</i>, is wrong, that, in fact, what he should have been doing all the time was deducting tax from the employee and that, accordingly, the <i>bona fide</i> mistake he has made as to what is or is not assessable in the way of expenses or gain of that sort, as apart from a cash gain, means that there is arrear of tax and that he will have to make it up.</P>
      <P>I see Deputy MacCarthy shaking his head vigorously all the time.  Perhaps he will be able to explain the matter more clearly than I can.  There is no doubt whatever that there is the marginal case for which there must be some method of ensuring that the employer does not have to put himself in the position of being the judge as to what is assessable in the way of expenses and what is not.  That is a matter that must be determined in the last analysis by the court on appeal from the Special Commissioners and there must not be a situation arising in which, because an employer has differed from what is in the last analysis ultimately determined by the court, he, the employer, is liable for not having deducted the tax during the course of the year.  I accept that the method of providing that will probably have to be an administrative method rather than an express section in this Bill but it is a matter that must be covered in some way.  I should like to hear the Minister's views as to how it will be covered.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, when a person enters into employment, the onus is on the employer to secure from that person a tax free pay certificate.

In the case of an employee who is not a director, who works whole-time for one particular person, then is it clear that the value of emoluments other than cash does not come into the assessable computation unless the value of such emoluments other than cash and the value of the cash exceed £1,500?

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) emoluments arising from an office or employment of any class which is such that, in relation to the year 1958-59, tax on emoluments from an office or employment of that class was deductible or treated as deductible from the emoluments under any Rule, other than Rule 7, of the Rules applicable to Schedule E,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the House has been informed by Deputy Norton and Deputy Sweetman, Section 4 applies Part II of the Bill to all emoluments except those set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).  As the Bill stands, paragraph (a) excludes emoluments the tax chargeable on which is deductible pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules applicable to Schedule E.  The purpose of this was to exclude remuneration which was assessed departmentally. It has always been accepted in practice that the tax in such cases is deductible under Rule 11.</P>
      <P>Rule 11, as the Deputy knows, is of somewhat ancient origin.  I think it is to be found first in the Act of 1918 and a number of refined applications of that Rule have been made over a period of years.  It is now felt desirable to treat the tax in such cases as deductible not only under Rule 11 but under the Rules applicable in general to Schedule E, with the exception of Rule 7 which will be dealt with in Section 13 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The purpose of Section 4 is to apply this procedure for the collection of tax, not the assessment of tax to which the Deputy has referred on several occasions, to all emoluments with certain exceptions.  Now, the exceptions so far as the original paragraph (a) applies, are emoluments, the tax deductible on which is deductible in assessment pursuant to this Rule 11&mdash; that is to say, deductible in the way civil servants' salaries are; deductible more or less at the time of payment, or at certain specific or convenient intervals over the year, more numerous than the ordinary taxpayer has to provide for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So this method of collection does not apply to those emoluments which fall within the terms of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). In relation to paragraph (a) as I understand it, the tax on these emoluments is deductible.  The tax on emoluments falling within (a) is deductible in accordance with Rule 11, at more frequent and more convenient intervals during the year than the tax under Schedule E is normally collected.  I think the difference is that the general body of taxpayers have their tax collected under Schedule E at the moment.  In the case of those who fall within paragraph (a), the tax is deducted when certain fractions of the salary are being paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference furthermore is that those assessable under Rule 11 are assessed on the actual income received during the year of assessment and the tax so assessed is deducted over that year. The remainder of the Schedule E tax paying community are assessed at present on the income they receive, not in the actual year of assessment but in the preceding year.  That tax so assessed is payable in two instalments, on 1st January and on 1st July following.  What I am trying to get at here is: why is the definition of emoluments made by reference to tax deductible rather than by reference to tax assessable, because the fundamental difference is not the deduction <Col N="1164" /> of the tax but the assessment of actual earnings rather than the preceding year's earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason why it is necessary to exclude persons whose tax is assessed on their current year's earnings, on their earnings as they accrue from year to year, on their earnings as they accrue in the particular year in which the tax is deducted.  That is why it is necessary to exclude them from a Bill which is designed to cover another body of Schedule E taxpayers, that is, that body whose tax is assessed, not on the year in which a moiety falls to be paid but on their earnings for the year preceding.</P>

Words and phrases are being thrown about without producing any clarification to anybody other than those who resort to the very pleasant art of self-deception by pretending to understand it all.  I do not intend to do that.  As I understand it, the position is that civil servants, members of the Garda, the Army, Judges, Ministers, etc., pay income tax based upon earnings in the current year, that is, the year which ends on 5th April&mdash;for this year, 5th April, 1960.  I understand they pay their income tax within that year by the method of deducting employed and that all persons who are in receipt of what is described as official pay come within the scope of this Rule 11.</P>
      <P>In the case of outside persons, I understand they are assessed for the current year, not on what they earn in the current year but on what they earned in the preceding year.  Therefore, for income tax purposes, they are assessed in two moieties on their current year's income, their current year's income being assumed to be what they earned in the previous year, and they pay the current year's income tax on the basis that one instalment is due and paid in January and the other paid in July.  In other words, they pay portion of this year's income tax assessment&mdash;half of it&mdash;in January and the other half is paid outside the period, in July of the next year.  From what I can gather from what the Minister said, some of these manoeuvres and this amendment are designed to eliminate something under paragraph (a) in the section of the Bill as drafted.  An amendment to paragraph (a) is being offered by the Minister.  What I want to know is : does the amendment to paragraph (a) offered by the Minister do anything to disturb the present method of assessment of those in receipt of official pay and if it does&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That may be so in theory, but, in practice, that man, in 1960-61, will be in a worse position than his colleague who is not paid out of public funds and to whom P.A.Y.E. applies in that year and in that year only.  I do not propose to argue as to whether there is a difference in that argument as between paragraph (a) as <Col N="1167" /> amended and paragraph (a) as in the Bill.  There might be one very slight difference between one class and another.  It is better to take the broad issue.  Let us take it this way: we have two people, both of whom are married and both of whom have two children.  Their assessments in 1960-61 will be computable on the basis set out on page 23 of the White Paper in the last column.  In respect of the person whose earnings for the year are £1,000, the tax assessable in the last column is £54.12.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Page 23, Appendix 3.  The last two columns are for the married couple with two children. After this Bill is passed the taxpayer who earns £1,000 a year will be liable for £54 12s.  His tax liability in the year 1961-62&mdash;not next year&mdash;will be £54 12s., and Pat Murphy, who is in the public service, and Bill Fleming, who is employed, shall we say, by any outside private firm, in 1961-62 are both going to pay £54 10s.  But, in 1960-61, that is next year, Pat Murphy will pay £54 10s., the same amount, but in 1960-61, because P.A.Y.E. comes into operation only on the 5th October next year, Bill Fleming, who is employed by an outside firm, will only pay £27 6s.  In fact, the civil servant, the employee of the Bank of Ireland, the teacher, the Garda, the officer in the Army, the employee of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, of the Commissioners of Public Lights or of the Representative Church Body&mdash; all those people who are paid £1,000 per annum, and who are married with two children&mdash;will pay £27 6s. less than their colleagues in outside employment, earning exactly the same pay during 1960-61.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Theoretically there may be no change.  What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander, and their liability for the first year in which this scheme comes into operation should be equated.  I tried to provide this in a different way by adding a new subsection to Section 5, but it is easier, perhaps, to discuss it on Section 4, having regard to the <Col N="1168" /> fact that the Minister put down an amendment to Section 4.  Is there any reason why a person who has been in the situation, in the Minister's own view, of giving no trouble to the Revenue, because there are no arrears, should pay during 1960-61 double the tax that the ordinary salary earner will have to pay?  That is exactly what it amounts to, that the person who is in any of the classes I have mentioned, and as far as I know under Clause A there are no other classes involved, will pay next year twice as much tax as the ordinary person earning a salary from an outside firm.</P>
    <P>This was a case that was taken into account quite deliberately in the British legislation when pay-as-youearn was introduced in Britain.  Last night the Minister chided me, when I mentioned Canada and the United States, for not having given examples about our next-door island.  I am giving one to him now and if it was bad for me to take comparisons elsewhere, if the comparisons I should have taken should have been in respect of U.K. tax, then he is hoist with his own petard because the British, when they were introducing pay-as-you-earn, did take account of the fact that these classes would otherwise be paying more than the ordinary salary earners.  I think the technical phrase&mdash;the Minister's advisers will know this because I do not know whether I am correct&mdash;was that for them they had certain segregations of tax &ldquo;holidays&rdquo; to enable everyone to come up and pay the same amount for equivalent salaries in the first year in which pay-as-you-earn came into operation.</P>
    <P>There is no use whatever in taking the line that the existing legislation makes no change in people's circumstances. What matters in relation to taxation is that the burden is equally spread over the community, and if Bill Fleming and Pat Murphy are both in exactly the same personal circumstances, both earning £1,000 per annum, both married, both having to support a wife and two children of the age, or in the educational period of their life in which they are entitled to <Col N="1169" /> claim under the Income Tax Acts, is it not proper that both should pay the same amount of tax and be assessed for the same amount of income tax for 1960-61?</P>
    <P>As the situation stands, the civil servant will have to pay £54 12s. for 1960-61, will have that amount deducted from his pay, while the person in outside employment will have to pay only £27 6s.  That is reduced to the simplest language that I can reduce it, and I should like the Minister to say whether it is correct that one will pay £54 12s. and the other only £27 6s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the same point that Deputy Sweetman raised.  I must confess I am puzzled by the phrasing of the Bill, particularly in relation to present income tax practice.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to tell us what would be the position in this respect?  I take the case of two young men who have been at the university.  They both qualify and become engineers.  Let us say that one goes to private employment and the other goes to the Board of Works, both for the same pay, and both are in the same domestic set of circumstances.  The tax which they would both pay in the year 1960-61 is £36.  Let us also say that they both take up employment on the 6th April, 1960.  The engineer who goes to the Board of Works, in accordance with the customary method of deducting income tax from public employees, the moment he starts his employment pays his income tax in instalments at the rate of £9 in June, £9 in September, £9 in December and £9 in March.  In other words, he pays a total of £36, and that is his assessment for 1960-61.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other young man starts in private employment and commences work on the 6th April.  His P.A.Y.E. comes into operation on the following October, so he pays nothing between April and October, and in October he proceeds to pay.  As I understand the Bill, he pays whatever he is liable for from October onwards; he pays £3 in October, £3 in November and £3 in each of the months following right up to the end of March.  He pays, in <Col N="1170" /> other words, a total of £18.  I may be wrong in this and that is why I ask the Minister, with the technical resources at his command, to clarify the point.</P>
    <P>I understand the position to be that the person who goes into the public service on the same day as another takes up outside employment, the relevant circumstances being the same, in the year 1960-61, is in a different position from that of his counterpart in outside employment.  The person who goes into the public service will pay a total of £36 income tax; had he gone into private employment instead of into the public service, he would be called upon to pay only £18 because, in his case, payment would commence in October.  In the public service, however, it commences from 6th April.  Am I correct in that?  If I am not correct, will the Minister tell me what section in the Bill ensures that that will not happen, that someone in one employment will pay double the income tax paid by his counterpart in other employment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies had better cast their minds back, first of all, to the reasons which induced the Commission on Income Tax to recommend the introduction of this system and subsequently induced the Government to accept that recommendation. The general argument for the introduction of the new system is that the existing system can occasion grave hardship, particularly in the case of manual workers and persons in receipt of earnings from employment which is liable to interruption and whose earnings from these sources may not be very considerable.  A person may be employed in an industry in which he earns a considerable amount of overtime in one year. In the next year, circumstances may change, for one reason or another, and he may find himself out of a job. Because he is liable to income tax in respect of the money he earned in the preceding year and is now out of a job, it is impossible in many cases for tax to be collected.  Having failed to meet his obligation in respect of the income tax for which he was liable when he was in employment, he is now in the position that, in order to evade <Col N="1171" /> the Revenue Commissioners, he may have to leave his employment and go elsewhere.  What we are doing here is, in fact, changing the basis of assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of assessment under this will be on present earnings and not on earnings in the preceding year.  In the normal way, if there were no special provisions in this Bill, the result of the change would be that the person coming under the P.A.Y.E. scheme would, first of all, have to meet his liability in respect of the past year of assessment, that is, in respect of the year preceding that during which he comes under P.A.Y.E., together with an additional half-year's payment. The result would be that in the year in which he comes under P.A.Y.E., were it not for the special provisions in this Bill, he would pay not 12 months' tax but 18 months' tax. Everybody will concede that that would constitute a grave hardship on any taxpayer and, above all, on the general body of taxpayers for whose convenience and relief this P.A.Y.E. system is being introduced.</P>
      <P>The persons whom it is intended to exclude under paragraph (a) are not in the position I have just outlined. They have been in employment and on the hypothesis that that employment will be constant and lifelong, special rules have been made for the collection of tax.  They are in the position that their obligations, so far as Schedule E is concerned, have been met approximately to date.  They have paid their tax.  When this change takes place, they will not be liable to an extra half-year's tax.  The provisions of the Bill are designed to relieve a hardship which would arise because of the introduction of this new system of tax collection.  That hardship would fall only on those who are outside the categories covered by paragraph (a).  There is, therefore, no injustice being done to any taxpayer when one does not provide special measures to compensate him for a hardship he never suffered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I understand there has been a good deal of contention. First of all, let me deal with the special position of the British. Deputy Sweetman mentioned the British position.  He was not, of course, strictly accurate in his description of what the British did in 1944 or in relation to the circumstances in which the P.A.Y.E. system came into operation in Britain in 1944.  Prior to the introduction of that scheme, a scheme of compulsory tax deduction was in force.  Under that scheme, the tax collectable during the year 1943-44 had to be collected during the months of April to October, 1944.  When the P.A.Y.E. scheme commenced in April, 1944, the tax payable under the old scheme in the months April to October, 1944, was remitted because, if that were not done, then in a seven-month period from April to October, 1944, double deductions would have been suffered.  In Britain&mdash;and I think this is really relevant to the discussion &mdash;when civil servants were brought within the P.A.Y.E. scheme, they were not granted any remission of tax for the reason that there was no period during which, as taxpayers, they would be suffering deductions under the old system and under P.A.Y.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been talking here about a certain section of people who are being assessed under Schedule E and we are trying to say that they are being unfairly treated by comparison with the general body of persons who are assessed under Schedule E.  They are not being unfairly treated.  They are not being called upon to pay any greater tax.  The people who come under P.A.Y.E. will have to pay 12 months' tax in the year 1960-61; they will have to pay in that year 1960-61, the last moiety of their tax in respect of their income for 1959-60 together with six months' tax in respect of their earnings in 1960-61.  They will pay the equivalent of 12 months' tax in any event, and any Schedule E taxpayers who are excluded from P.A.Y.E. will also pay 12 months' tax. The cash obligations to the Revenue <Col N="1173" /> Commissioners in respect of the year 1960-61 will be the same, for all classes of Schedule E taxpayers, whether within paragraph (a) or outside of paragraph (a).  I am excluding those covered by paragraphs (b) and (c) from the argument because it is only with those who are covered by paragraph (a) that we are dealing.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that there is no injustice because there is no danger of hardship.  There would be a great danger of hardship in respect of the general body of P.A.Y.E. taxpayers if it were not for the saving provisions in Section 5. However, the Minister for Finance is prepared to give further consideration to this matter as it affects persons within Section 4 (a) and on his behalf, I propose to put the following statement on record:</P>
    <P>Since the Second Reading took place, it has been represented to me that certain bodies which are excluded from the scope of P.A.Y.E. by paragraph (a) of Section 4 of the Bill may wish to have the option of coming into P.A.Y.E. I would certainly accord the most careful consideration to the case of any bodies of which the great majority of the members desired to enter the scheme; and, if it appeared in all the circumstances that they should be included, I would be quite agreeable to introduce the necessary provision in next year's Finance Bill. There would presumably have to be in the first instance a ballot among the members and the result reported to me in good time&mdash;say, before the middle of next February, at latest.</P>
    <P>There is one important respect, however, in which persons within paragraph (a) of Section 4&mdash;that is, persons assessed departmentally, who are at present outside the ambit of Part II of the Bill&mdash;differ from those who are affected by Part II and are to come under P.A.Y.E.  It is this: that, in the former case, the whole of their tax for 1959-60 will normally be paid by the 5th April, 1960, so that, if they were to come within P.A.Y.E., there would be no case for deferring the commencement <Col N="1174" /> of deductions until the 6th October, 1960.  (The reason, of course, for deferring the deductions until that date for persons who do come within the scheme is that the 2nd instalment of their tax for 1959-60 does not fall due until the 1st July, so that, if P.A.Y.E. were to commence for them on the 6th April, 1960, they would have to suffer one and a half year's tax in 1960-61.)</P>
    <P>If, therefore, persons who fall under paragraph (a) of Section 4 were to be brought within P.A.Y.E. for 1960-61, the deductions would have to commence on the 6th April, 1960; and no more than twelve months' tax would then be deductible in 1960-61.  It would, however, be administratively impossible to make arrangements to have the scheme put into operation as early as April, 1960.  It would also be impracticable to operate, for any body of taxpayers, the existing system for the half year to the 5th October, 1960, and P.A.Y.E. for the half year to the 5th April, 1961. Accordingly, if any of the bodies in question desired to come into P.A.Y.E,. the new system would have to apply for them as from 6th April in a given year&mdash;the earliest feasible date being the 6th April, 1961.</P>
    <P>So far as a person coming within P.A.Y.E. is concerned, the benefit of the remission under section 14 of the Bill will not be felt until he will have ceased to be chargeable to tax.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister for Finance, in making that offer, is being exceedingly generous.  He is making it&mdash;it is not for me to criticise it&mdash;at the expense of a very large body of taxpayers who do not enjoy the secure employment which those who are covered by paragraph (a) enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I never heard such nonsense in all my life.  The great generosity and the great benefit which the Minister is giving to all the people in these five classes will arise when they cease to be employed.  They can cease to be employed when they retire on pension but they are still assessable in the same way and they will cease to be employed for tax purposes only on the day they die.  This is to be, as Deputy Norton intervened, a present for the wake.</P>
      <P>Let us put the correct facts on the record.  Let me take, for example, two people, my friends, Pat Murphy and Bill Fleming, both of whom start to be employed on 5th October, 1958. Pat Murphy is in the Civil Service and Bill Fleming is in outside employment. Pat Murphy is assessable for the income tax year 1958-59 on his actual earnings and the amount is deducted in the six months.  Bill Fleming, it being the first year of assessment, is assessable on exactly the same amount and he will pay his tax liability not prior to 5th April, 1959, but in two instalments, one on 1st January, 1959, and one on 1st July, 1959.</P>
      <P>In the following year, each of them will also be liable to assessment on their actual earnings, because, in the case of Bill Fleming, it is his first full year.  Again his tax will be payable on 1st January, 1960.  It would have been payable on 1st July, 1960, were it not for this Bill.  Pat Murphy will have paid all his tax for the current year before 5th April next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deliberately take both of these men as going into employment on 6th October because that is half a financial year.  They have both been working exactly the same period on <Col N="1176" /> 5th April, 1961.  The person employed by the Civil Service will have paid, between October, 1958 and 5th April, 1961, two and half years' tax.  He will have paid a half year of 1958-1959, the full year 1959-1960 and the full year 1960-1961.  That is Pat Murphy's liability&mdash;two and half years' tax.  Bill Fleming will have paid a half year's tax for 1958-1959, a full year's tax for 1959-1960 and half year's tax under P.A.Y.E. for 1960-1961.  He will have paid two years' tax for the period for which the civil servant will have paid two and half years' tax, although the civil servant was employed on exactly the same day and at exactly the same pay.  That is the effect of the Bill as it stands as amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The only conclusion I can come to when the Minister says that the Minister for Finance has made considerable concessions to these groups is that the Minister must have read the statement of the Minister for Finance rather hurriedly and that he does not fully understand its implications.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister for Finance may feel fully assured that there will be no queues of people waiting to take advantage of the oriental offer made to them under the Bill.  The whole phrasing of the document is clearly intended to frighten them off and it clearly tells them the woe that is coming to them under certain sections of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not come down to the one narrow point which indicates quite clearly the inequity of the hardship which is to be committed under the Bill.  He talked of people in regular employment and said that they should be glad to be there and that they should be glad to pay their tax sharply and up to the point.  I gave the case of two engineers, one of whom got employment in the Board of Works and the other who got employment outside. It might be said that the outside employment in that instance would be somewhat haphazard but I take the case of two people who leave the university on the same day.  One goes to the Board of Works and the other <Col N="1177" /> goes to the E.S.B.  No one can say that employment in the E.S.B. is intermittent. It is good, stable employment.</P>
    <P>The man who goes to the Board of Works will pay 12 months' income tax in that year.  He pays £36 income tax in that year in four instalments.  That is his assessment.  The other man goes to the E.S.B. on the same salary and on the same day.  He gets the same reliefs and allowances and is assessed for income tax for the same year, April, 1960 to April, 1961, but because he does not start to pay his tax until October, he has to pay at the rate of only £3 a month for six months, while the other person will have to pay his full income tax of £9 a month in quarterly instalments.  What grounds are there for saying that the man who goes into the Board of Works ought to pay twice the income tax of the man who goes into the E.S.B.?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has become confusing for the ordinary Deputy to follow this.  The Minister has said that these five categories of people&mdash; employees of the State, officers of the Bank of Ireland, officers of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, officers of the Representative Body of the Church of Ireland and the clergy of the Church of Ireland&mdash;are not suffering any hardship under this P.A.Y.E. system.  That is quite true but they have a sense of grievance that the general body of the public are being remitted a half year's tax and they feel that they ought to be given the benefit of that.</P>

    <P>In the case of the clergy of the Church of Ireland, apparently the British Government gave this corresponding reduction for the six months in the first year.  It is rather difficult to find where are the generous benefits which the Minister for Finance proposes to give these people as envisaged in the statement which the Minister read out.  In a hurried study of it, I cannot see what benefit they are to get and Deputy Norton and Deputy Sweetman do not think these benefits are real or tangible.  If they are to come into operation when the individuals no longer exist, most of us will agree that we are not being generous to those officials.  The Minister <Col N="1178" /> should make some better concessions to these bodies of people and I urge him to listen to the representations that have been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I put these figures on record to assist the Minister? If he wishes to see them, I shall pass them across to him when I have read them.  Take the case of two married men with two children and also assume that the allowances are not changed as between 5th April, 1958 and 5th April, 1961.  These two taxpayers are Pat Murphy, a civil servant, and Bill Fleming, an E.S.B. employee, as Deputy Norton suggested. Both started work on 6th April, 1958. For the income tax year 1958-59, each is liable for £15 income tax.  For the year 1959-60, each, being employed for a full year, is liable for £50 income tax.  For the year 1960-61, each is liable, under assessment, for £50 income tax.  If there were no Bill here, that would make a total of £115 tax to be paid out of their earnings over 2½ years.  On the basis of the exception in Section 4, paragraph (a), Pat Murphy would pay £115 out of the money he has earned in that period.  He would pay that because it is deducted from him.  A sum of £15 is deducted from his salary up to 5th April, 1959; £50 is deducted from his salary in the year ending 5th April, 1960; and £50 is deducted from his salary in the year ending 5th April, 1961.  That makes a total of £115. The effect of this Bill will be that Bill Fleming will have paid £7 10s. 0d. on 1st January, 1959, £7 10s. 0d. on 1st July, 1959, £25 on 1st January, 1960, £25 on 1st July, 1960 and £25 spread by deductions under P.A.Y.E. between 6th October, 1960 and 5th April, 1961. That means that Bill Fleming is paying £90, whereas Pat Murphy, the civil servant, who has earned exactly the same money during the same period, has paid £25 more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to study those figures.  If they are wrong, he will be able to point out to me where they are wrong and we shall be able to have the matter cleared up.  I take the view, and I think the Minister takes the view, that income tax should <Col N="1179" /> either be paid or saved out of the money you earn because that is what it is due on.  Both people have earned exactly the same money in exactly the same period.  In one case, one man has to pay £25 more than the other. That is not fair and there should be a remission of that £25 to that man.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke about the merits of the Bill and told us of the benefits that would accrue to the small man able to pay weekly. Am I not to be allowed to do the same?  First of all, I should like the Minister to state how much the State has lost as a result of default in paying income tax?  A case for the Bill can be made under two headings: that it benefits certain people and that it benefits the State.  I asked a question about the amount lost, but I was informed the Minister did not have any calculations.  The Minister must have them now because he did not come before the House without knowing what he was losing.  I want him to tell the House approximately how much annually the State has lost.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that thousands of people have left the country, not because they had no employment, but because they had to face income tax bills. That was the point I was trying to develop when the Chair intervened. This man had just married and he owed £40.  His situation had changed. He could not pay the £40, so he gave up a good job and went to England. The Bill at least taxes people on a weekly basis so that this nightmare does not arise.  What will happen in the case of people who have defaulted? Will they still be pursued?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment. The special provisions of this Bill relate to the year in which the P.A.Y.E. system is being introduced.  They are determined by the fact that if there was not this special provision in relation to the tax to be collected in the half-year 1960-61, those people, for whose convenience, in part, the Bill is being introduced, would be called upon to pay the equivalent of one and a half year's tax within 12 months. For the generality of the people, that will create a very severe hardship indeed.  It is to deal with the hardship which arises in the case of Bill Fleming, who is in the E.S.B. but not in the case of Pat Murphy in the Civil Service, that the provisions in Section 14 of the Bill will be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only question.  You have to relieve hardship.  You have to obviate the hardship which the introduction of the P.A.Y.E. system would <Col N="1181" /> otherwise impose on the very much larger body of Schedule E taxpayers who are being brought within the scope of this new system of collection.  You are not doing an injustice to any person if you do not give special treatment to those for whom the introduction of the Bill creates no hardship at all and they are, of course, the people who are covered by paragraph (a) of Section 4. That is the simple case.  There is not any other case than that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, and Deputy Sweetman to a less extent, have been pleased to be humorous at the expense of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  Let me say that, if his offer is accepted, the people in Schedule E, the people covered by paragraph (a), will be put in precisely the same position as the general body of P.A.Y.E. income taxpayers because there he says he would be prepared to consider bringing in a provision for granting an analogous remission or repayment of tax in the last year of employment and that is, in fact, when the real benefit of Section 14 will accrue to the body of P.A.Y.E. taxpayers.  It merely means that when they go out, when they cease to be taxable as employees, that moiety of their income tax in the last year of employment which, if it were not for the P.A.Y.E. system, they would be called upon to pay six months after they are out of a job, will in fact be forgiven them.  That is the position and the offer which the Minister for Finance has been prepared to make is not, as Deputy Norton said, an example of oriental humour; it is an example of a realistic, accidental approach to this very difficult question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's case now is that because for the general body of Schedule E taxpayers, he has remitted a half year to obviate hardship in their case, he does not propose to make the same concession for the others.  If, in the public interest&mdash; and it is in the public interest&mdash;under the introduction of this Bill, Bill Fleming should only have to pay £90 in the case I have given, I do not see any reason at all why Pat Murphy should not be put in exactly the same position.  They both earn the same money over the same period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the speech which the Minister has just made, both by what he has said and by his failure to answer points which were made, he has clearly admitted that the State knows that it is definitely penalising by comparison those in the Civil Service, the Garda, the Army and other public employments, under this Bill.  Certain people will get a remission of six months' income tax in the first year of commencement of this scheme.  I do not deny them that.  I think they are entitled to it under the mechanism which is operating and which is being altered by the introduction of this Bill, but it is expecting too much to imagine that it is acceptable that other people who see this concession being granted and who are in employment that is no more secure than that of those who will benefit should be denied the advantages which certain people are getting out of this Bill.  Some better effort ought to have been made to equate the advantages than has been made in the Bill.  To tell a man that in his last year of toil, 30, 40 or 50 years hence, when nobody knows what the world will be like, there will be a concession for him, which will be announced just before his wake, is making the thing absurd I think the Minister now admits that he knows this will happen, that the Government want it to happen and they are not prepared to make any concession in order to remove the obvious disparity that some people are getting a concession under the Bill which is withheld from others.  The fact that that comparison can be made is bad from the point of view of legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a matter which to some extent has been referred to in the discussion on the first amendment but which was not the focal point of discussion there. One of the advantages of P.A.Y.E. is that a person pays while he is working and when he is unemployed, he is not under an obligation to pay, in circumstances in which he has no income, in respect of periods during which he had good employment.  I should like to get some information from the Minister on this point.  Take the case of persons who are seasonally employed, for example, dockers or turf workers.  Dockers have busy periods at the port during which they earn good pay.  They run into lean periods in which there is very little or no employment.  A turf worker may commence work about February or March and is engaged on piece work until about September, when he is paid off. During that period, he may earn sufficient to make him liable, under P.A.Y.E., to income tax deductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a single turf worker supporting a widowed mother. Between March and September, he may earn sufficient to make him liable to income tax.  The pattern of employment on bogs is that when one loses employment, about September, there is practically no other employment available in the areas until such time as the bogs open again in the following year.  I want to find out whether that person will be assessed in the knowledge that he will have a long period of unemployment in the winter, which will be balanced with his earnings in the summer, or whether because he starts with a regular job and overtime in the spring and summer months, his income tax <Col N="1184" /> will be assessed on estimated earnings for the rest of the year.  When turf workers lose their employment, there is no alternative for them but to depend on unemployment benefit from the employment exchange and it would be rather ironic if, having paid heavily while in employment, it would take a considerable time to get a refund either from the employer or from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>These are cases in which the pattern of employment is intermittent.  There may be regular work in the summer and long periods of unemployment in the winter, which can be gauged beforehand.  I ask the Minister what will be the mechanism in those cases and how speedily will it work to ensure that there will be a refund of income tax when a person has been laid off and is likely to continue unemployed for a substantial period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hoping it will not be.  I want to get clarification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless I have specific cases, I cannot deal with the generality of hypothetical cases in relation to any one of which, if I attempted to make a statement in the House, I might be quite wrong because I did not understand it myself or because, perhaps, it was not put with sufficient clarity.  The first thing that has to be borne in mind in this is that earnings do not become taxable until the proportionate amount of the personal allowance has been exceeded.</P>
      <P>I have a case in front of me, the case of a single man.  The first thing is that he gets a tax free pay certificate which the Revenue Commissioners have computed on the basis of the information given to them as to his circumstances, whether he is married or single&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is a single man, he cannot be a married man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait; the Deputy need not pull me up on a simple point <Col N="1185" /> of grammar.  It just happens that in this case he is single.  He might be either single or married.  If he is single, he may have dependent relatives, in which case he would have something over and above the single person's allowance.  In any event, on the basis of information supplied by him to the Revenue Commissioners, his employer gets a tax deduction card on which is set out the cumulative tax free allowances to which he is entitled, week after week.</P>
      <P>In the first week, he is allowed a tax free allowance of £7 10s.  In the next week, he is allowed a tax free allowance of £15.  That is the cumulative tax.  In the third week, it is £22 10s., and so on through the 52 weeks of the year.  If in the first week of his employment he earns something in excess of £7 10s., then that excess becomes taxable and he is taxed accordingly.  If he earns less than £7 10s., he is not subject to tax and nothing is deducted but he has a cumulative allowance carried over into the next week.  If in the next week he should earn sufficient to bring his earnings for the two weeks up to £15, then again he is not taxed but he has reached the limit of his taxable allowances for those two weeks.</P>
      <P>In the third week, if he is out of a job, and earns nothing, or if because of inclement weather, his earnings are seriously reduced, then the amount which he has not absorbed is carried forward into the fourth week.  Even though the employment is seasonal, at the end of his term, which lasts, say, 26 weeks, he will be entitled to a tax free allowance of £195.  If within that period he has not earned £195, then again he will have paid no net tax at all.  If, on the other hand, he has earned more than £195 and has paid tax and if in the following week, the 27th week, he earns nothing, he can apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a refund, provided he is out of employment.  If he continues on the books of his employer, the employer will refund to him any tax which he has paid in excess of his tax free allowance. I hope I have made it quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has <Col N="1186" /> explained a case which is not quite the case I put to him.  He explained the case of a person who might have six months' employment.  At the end of six months' employment, because of his earnings, he might still have a reserve which could be utilised to cushion him against income tax assessment.</P>
      <P>The case I want to put is the opposite type of case, a case where a person, a single man, or a single man with a widowed mother, goes into employment. From the first day of employment, he is liable to income tax on his earnings and as the season goes on, and as he is on piece work and on overtime, his liability for income tax increases, with the result that after six months in employment, he has paid a certain sum in income tax&mdash;let us say, £10, £20 or £30.  Then the job finishes; he ceases to be employed by that employer.  That employer has no further use for his services, no further record of him officially and no further contact with him.  Here is this man who has paid income tax during the period of his employment.  He has paid £10, £20 or £30 which he badly wants when he is unemployed.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister this question. I take it he can apply to his previous employer or to the Revenue Commissioners for a refund.  The main point is how long will it take the man who has, in these circumstances, regularly paid income tax on his annual earnings, to get back what he has overpaid?  Will it take a week or will it take a month?  Will the Minister give any indication as to how long the unemployed man living on unemployment benefit will have to wait for the refund?</P>

      <P>On Section 5, I want to ask the Minister a question.  It is natural in examining this Bill in detail to appreciate its impact in the set of circumstances set out by Deputy Norton&mdash;the unemployed man who wants to get a repayment and the impact of tax on the employed man also.  Subsection (2) is the subsection which places on the employer the duty of subtracting the appropriate amount for income tax from the employee. Through the courtesy of the Minister, I have seen a copy in draft of the tax deduction card which is to be issued in respect of the employee.  Has the Minister considered what is to happen in rural Ireland when a small business employing 50 people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>How many?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifty&mdash;the kind of substantial business you would get in a small country town.  The employer is furnished with 50 of these cards and is required to make them up.  Are there any proposals to provide any financial assistance to cover the increased costs which will come in course of payment for employers of that character?  I do not know what the expenses of administering this will be for a large firm, but whatever the expense, it does seem to me that employers, for the general good, are being asked to take over part of the ordinary functions of the Revenue Commissioners whose primary function it is to collect the revenue.  If that is socially desirable, so be it, but there should be some regard to the charge that is being put upon the people, who, after all, are the people who provide the employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in Great Britain, and even in Northern Ireland where the P.A.Y.E. system has been introduced, some effort has been made to meet the cost of operating the system by employers by some percentage allowance on the collection they make on behalf of the revenue commissioners. I do not know whether some <Col N="1188" /> scheme of that kind can be operated here but in this House we are continually unloading burdens on to unorganised employers.  I mean the kind of employers who are to be found in the country towns and who, if the truth were known, are the greatest providers of permanent employment in the country because unlike the impersonal firm, the relatively small country business does not hire a man to-day and let him go to-morrow. Ordinarily, it carries him the 52 weeks of the year when, if the strictest methods of economy were employed, he would be out of employment when he was not economically necessary. That is what the big firms do.</P>
    <P>This small type of firm is having unloaded on to it from time to time, quite casually by this House, small additional burdens of charge and they are all piling up and becoming a very serious problem.  The social relation between such firms and their employees, where there is recognised a kind of social obligation to carry a man for 52 weeks even though you may want him for only 49 or even 45 weeks, is a good relationship and worth preserving but it is being made more difficult to preserve if a multitude of small additional charges is to be laid on these employers without any credit compensation for the work they undertake.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is present to the mind of the Minister for Finance that burdens of this character exist but I would remind him that it is within relatively recent years that firms of this type were requested to fill out quite formidable returns for the Statistics Branch in regard to production, output and a variety of matters into which they inquire.  There are other returns also in connection with quota orders and licences to import goods which require quite an extensive amount of clerical work.  Up to now, most of these have come forward for performance at regular stated intervals of six months or, at the most, every quarter but here is a duty that will devolve on employers every Saturday night and it has to be completed in order that the employees may be paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> So far as I can judge extra clerical assistance will have to be got to keep up to date in regard to it.  You cannot get clerical assistance in a country town on the basis of calling in somebody to fill up these forms and then letting them go.  You must either find someone who has not sufficient work to occupy his time and give him this job in addition to fill out his normal working time or else you must employ another man or girl to do it.  That will cost the firm about £260 a year. You may get a young girl for £4 a week but if you want a competent girl it will cost you £5 a week at the least.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that filling up that form once a week will not occupy all her time but you may not have other work to give her because you already have on your staff the clerical assistance you require.  It may be in certain cases that existing available staff will be able to carry this additional burden but I think in a good many cases they will not.  I suggest to the Minister that he should search the precedents in operation in Britain and Northern Ireland with a view to finding whether some basis of compensation could not be worked out to help to pay the cost of administering this scheme on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners by the employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to go back to the point I raised.  Perhaps in his anxiety to get this Bill through, the Minister does not appreciate how real the hardships can be, particularly in turf areas.  So far as I know, turf workers get a week's notice&mdash;some-times less&mdash;of the termination of employment. In cases where they are paid off and transferred from a condition of full employment with overtime into a condition of no employment, living on unemployment benefit, could some special steps be taken, if possible by the employers, when a man is leaving to refund to him what it is likely he would be entitled to if he were to make application for refund to the Revenue Commissioners?  In these turf areas you may take it that, in the main, paying a man off at the end of the turf season is equivalent to saying to him: &ldquo;There is not much chance of your getting work until we <Col N="1190" /> start again.&rdquo;  He is compelled to live on unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied the Minister will say, having regard to the type of persons who must be dealt with in these circumstances, that some steps will be taken to make the refund with the utmost expedition.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Norton, it will be quite within the competence of the Revenue Commissioners to make special arrangements for that type of case.  It must be understood however that it would not be possible to deal with the small individual concern in precisely the same way.  First of all, they would not, perhaps, have the resources to repay tax that they had already deducted and paid over to the Revenue Commissioners. So far as organisations like Bord na Móna are concerned, I am sure arrangements will be made to deal with the position of those who become unemployed.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Dillon, I think he is under a misapprehension in relation to the hypothetical reimbursement of persons who operate this scheme in Northern Ireland.  I think there is no question there of any reimbursement for the employer in respect of any expense to which he may be put in operating this scheme.  I am sure it would be regarded by the Revenue Commissioners as a legitimate expense against his profits and, accordingly to that extent, he would be reimbursed in that he would not have to pay tax on any expenditure that may have been involved, but I think Deputy Dillon is rather too apprehensive as to the difficulty of working the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in front of me here the reply given to an inquiry addressed to the Belfast Society of Chartered Accountants by our Commission on Income Taxation and what they said was: &ldquo;Without doubt there are considerable difficulties arising on the installation of the P.A.Y.E. system and many problems arose when the system was first introduced in Northern Ireland. Once the employers become educated <Col N="1191" /> in the system, there appears to be little difficulty in the actual operation of it, particularly when the firms employ more than six or seven employees and a competent wages clerk, or book-keeper, looks after the actual preparation of wages and tax deductions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the experience in the Six-Counties and I have no reason to believe that a concern employing 15 &mdash;I think it was 50 employees to which Deputy Dillon referred&mdash;would experience any great difficulty, or incur any great expense in making the tax deductions.  Again, it has got to be remembered that the Revenue Commissioners at present have powers under statute to compel employers to deduct from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 3, to delete in line 49 &ldquo;, accountable for it, and liable to pay it,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(whether or not made), accountable for the amount of the tax, and liable to pay that amount,&rdquo; and to delete in line 51 &ldquo;to be paid it&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, if it has been made, to be paid it, or given credit for it,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I can describe this quite legitimately as a drafting Amendment. The purpose is to ensure that the intention of the Legislature in introducing P.A.Y.E. will not be defeated by an employer who could simply refuse to deduct tax from his employees' pay, and who would not be held accountable for the tax which he refused to <Col N="1192" /> deduct.  If the amendment is accepted, as I assume it will be, then the relevant portion of Section 6 would read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For rendering persons who are required to make any such deduction or repayment, in the case of a deduction, (whether or not made) accountable for the amount of tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The operative words are &ldquo;whether or not made.&rdquo;  The person who is required to make the deductions, whether he makes deductions or not, will be accountable for the amount and liable to pay it and, in the case of repayments, be entitled to be given credit for it by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1) (b) line 53, before &ldquo;to&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on reasonable notice.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ensure that the employer would get some type of notice before he has to produce all these documents. I want to make it clear that in my experience, professionally and otherwise, I have found 99 per cent. of the Revenue officials with whom I have had to come into contact most reasonable people&mdash;people with a difficult and unpleasant job to do, and they do it most reasonably.  This amendment is not in any way necessary for that 99 per cent. but I am sorry to say I have occasionally found an odd official most unreasonable, and I can see a situation in which the odd official like that would come into a shop employing some 50 or 60 people while they were in the middle of stocktaking, or something vital like that, and say: <Col N="1193" />&ldquo;I want to see these record cards here and now.&rdquo;  Particularly would that be unreasonable in country areas.  In the city here, or in Cork, an unreasonable attempt like that would be shrugged off and the people concerned might be able to deal with it but there must be some point, so to speak, at which this stops.</P>
    <P>There must be some point at which it is made quite certain that inquiry cannot be inquisition, and unless there is something like this to ensure that if it is at an impossible moment the employer concerned can say to the official: &ldquo;I am in the middle of a job now.  That cannot be done but, if you come back in a couple of days, this job will be finished and I shall give you all the information you want.&rdquo;  Ninety-nine per cent. of the officials, if they were approached in that way, would agree without question. The other one per cent. would not, and there could be quite undeniable hardship if some provision is not made to cover such cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this amendment would have any effect against an official who was disposed to act in the very arbitrary way that Deputy Sweetman suggested, particularly in view of the fact that he says it is a very rare occasion in which an officer in any way acts so as to embarrass the Revenue Commissioners. It is quite clear that any employer fulfilling his obligations under this section has nothing to fear, and would not be dealt with in the way the Deputy suggested.</P>
      <P>On the other hand there may be employers who, the Revenue Commissioners have sound reason to believe, are not fulfilling their obligations.  If one were to give that type of person reasonable notice, then I fear one would only give him the opportunity of evading his obligations under the Act, or of concealing the fact that he was evading them.  In the circumstances, I suggest the Deputy should not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is designed to empower the Revenue Commissioners to treat as an employer a person who, though paying the emoluments of another person, is not the employer of that person in the strictly legal sense. Take the case of a building contractor, for instance, with a large housing scheme.  He may enter into an arrangement with a plumbing contractor under which the employees of the latter will carry out the work but will be paid for the work by the building contractor.  Regulations made under paragraph (b) will authorise the building contractor in that case to make the necessary deductions under the P.A.Y.E. scheme.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to subsection (3) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) Nothing in this subsection shall authorise the Revenue Commissioners to disclose (save <Col N="1195" /> with the consent of the employee) on any tax deduction card either expressly or by implication any information concerning any income of the employee liable to tax other than that payable by the employer to whom such tax deduction card is furnished.</P>
    <P>The principle underlying this amendment was debated pretty widely on the Second Reading.  There is very considerable apprehension abroad that one of the effects of the P.A.Y.E. system will be that employers will learn from the certificates of allowances issued by the Revenue Commissioners private details about their employees. If, for instance, an employee has some other income, the certificate of allowances will disclose by implication, since the amount of the allowances will be stated, what that private income is.</P>
    <P>The matter can be dealt with in either of two ways.  All the allowances can be offset against his pay, and therefore set out on the certificate of allowances, and a separate assessment can be raised in respect of the outside income without the allowances being credited against the outside income. Alternatively, the employee could have the option of deciding whether he wished for one, or two, assessments. If he opted for one assessment, as I understand is sometimes done at present on Schedule E. assessments, and to lump in the small investment income and have the allowances set off against it, that would be his own business; if the employee chose to do it that way and to let his employer know he had some other income, that is his own affair.  But, in the absence of consent by the employee, it would be very wrong that his private personal details of income should be disclosed to his employer.  If an employee is earning £800 a year direct from his employer and has another income of £200 a year, instead of allowances of £530, to which he would be entitled, his employer will see on the certificate of allowances that the employee is credited with only £330 by way of allowances and he will therefore know that his employee has £200 elsewhere. I do not think the system should be <Col N="1196" /> open to the disclosure of that type of private personal information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is overapprehensive in that regard, because details of the allowances will not be shown on the card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The total will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But the total can be arrived at in a multiplicity of ways. The employee will be entitled, first of all, to his personal allowance. Children's allowances also come into the picture.  There are dependants' allowances; bank interest; mortgage interest; life insurance premiums.  All these will go to determine the amount of the allowances to be deducted in the first instance by the Revenue Commissioners in order to arrive at the taxable income.  It seems to me that it would be very difficult, indeed, for an employer to determine what additional sources of income, if any, an employee might have&mdash;income which tended either to increase or decrease the allowances.  There is very little, if any, possibility that the secrecy normally attaching to a tax-payer's transactions with the Revenue Commissioners may be effectively breached.  There might be surmises. Beyond that, one could not concede that there would even be a remote possibility of an employer being able to compute for himself the sources of his employee's income.  It is, of course, always open to the employee, if he wishes, to apply for a direct assessment.  In the majority of cases, however, that might not be to the advantage of the individual concerned, but he is entitled to do that if he wishes.  It could mean that he would be paying larger sums during the course of the year for income tax and he might be involved ultimately in taking the necessary steps to have the overpayment recovered.</P>

It would help, I think, to allay a certain amount of fear, particularly on the part of commission agents&mdash; that is, commercial travellers&mdash;who may occasionally, on the side, as it were, purchase and sell on behalf of some of their customers.  I think there is a certain fear, too, on the part of members of the Defence Forces. Members of the Defence Forces have been known to take part-time employment.  If the money they earn in that way is divulged to the Minister for Defence, is there not a danger that they will be discharged?</P>

In the computation of the tax to be remitted, the taxpayer is to be granted all the personal reliefs to which he is entitled. As the Bill stands personal relief is defined as having the same meaning as in Section 9 of the Finance Act, 1958.  That Section, however, dealt with the apportionment of personal <Col N="1200" /> reliefs between husband and wife and consequently did not include allowance for a widow or widower.

Supposing the rate of overdraft interest was increased, quite clearly then the estimated basis on which the relief was provisionally given would be varied.  Can he apply at that stage for an amended certificate or must he wait till the end of the year?</P>

In respect of a life insurance policy, the premium was not heretofore deducted from the income before it was assessed, but after the income was assessed, the taxpayer was allowed tax relief based on the premium and that is why the two were dealt with differently in this section.

      <P>Yesterday Deputy Norton asked the Minister for Finance the number of civil servants who were to benefit under this Bill and in reply he was told that 1,439 civil service pensioners were to benefit.  There seems to have been some misunderstanding by Deputy Norton as to what was covered by civil service pensioners because, later in the debate yesterday afternoon, they were confused with Exchequer pensioners. When Deputy Sweetman was Minister for Finance in 1956 he was asked in the Seanad the number of Exchequer pensioners and he gave the figure at 6,760.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill Exchequer pensioners to the number of 5,068 will benefit.  I have the figures broken up here if the Deputies would like to hear them.  Under £100 there are 1,042; from £100 to £150, 741; from £150 to £200, 1,051; from £200 to £300, 1,572; from £300 to £450, 422 and over £450 a year there are 240.  That is a total of 5,068.</P>

      <P>When the Minister for Health was replying yesterday to a question I put to the Minister for Finance his reply was delivered in a temporarily noisy House and I missed some portion of it.  I got the end of the reply in which he said he could not supply particulars of certain categories of pensions.  As I had heard these particulars supplied in 1956, I asked why it was not possible now to give information that was given in 1956. When I tried to see what answer the Minister had given in reply I found that the written reply had been temporarily annexed by another person but when I recovered the reply last night I found it contained sufficient information for my purpose.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that one of the essential elements of a proposal of this kind is that it should be applied to all classes.  In some circumstances that is not possible because there is not enough money to do it but could the Minister give me an approximate figure of what it would cost to bring in the members of the Civil Service who retired to the date in November, 1952 and to the date in 1956 when the basic rates of the whole Civil Service were altered up?  There must be a microscopic group and we shall leave a few dozen people labouring under a deep sense of grievance in the particularly distressing circumstances that, in the ordinary course of nature, it is unlikely that we shall get an opportunity to redress their grievance if we do not do it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a very hard thing, when you are dealing with a group of over 5,000 and trying to make some contribution towards relieving their problems, that you leave, perhaps, 20 people who feel that they have been just unfortunate and leave them with a deep sense of grievance that their <Col N="1205" /> misfortune arises from the fact, not that there is an exchequer emergency and that there is not money to pay them, but because it is administratively inconvenient to cover their case.  I want to impress on the Minister strongly that there is a peculiarly acute sense of grievance among a microscopic group of public servants who have just got caught between the date mentioned in this Bill in November, 1952 and the date in 1956 on which all salaries were increased and which would have accrued to their pension rate benefit had they been allowed to remain in the public service up to that day.  I would be grateful if the Minister could give me any estimate of what it would cost to relieve their circumstances and whether, if it is as small a sum as I believe it to be, he could not consider doing something to meet their particular case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned yesterday, in the course of the debate, that in Britain and the Six Counties pensioners had received since 1920, or could receive, the benefit of seven pensions increase Acts which have been passed there.  The latest Act applicable in Britain and the Six Counties for the year 1959 provides for increases in pensions in the case of officers who retired up to as late as the 1st April, 1957.  We are providing no increase whatever in the case of persons who retired after October, 1952.  Therefore, if you compare the position of a pensioner in, say, Strabane, and that of a pensioner in Letterkenny, the Strabane pensioner, whose territory is connected with ours by a bridge, if he retired in 1950, can get the benefits of the legislation passed in the Six Counties since he retired.  Any person in Strabane who retired up to the 1st April, 1957 can get increases in pensions under the legislation passed since that date.  Here, however, a person who retired cannot get any increase in pension if he retired after October, 1952.  In other words, the pensioners living in Strabane can get increases if they retired up to April, 1957, whereas, if a pensioner lives across the bridge in Letterkenny, he can get no increase unless he retired <Col N="1206" /> before 1952.  That means that our pensioners, <i>vis-a-vis</i> their counterparts in the Six Counties and Britain, are at a disadvantage inasmuch as the pension increases are denied to them unless they have retired before November, 1952, whereas in these other areas they can get the pension increases if they retired as late as February, 1957.</P>
      <P>The hardship is all the greater here because of the substantial increase in living costs, particularly during the past two and a half years.  Knowing he is not making any provision for persons who retired after October, 1952, could the Minister at this stage say whether he hopes to be in a position to deal with the really meritorious claims of those who have retired since November, 1952 and for whom no provision in the way of an increase in pensions is made in this Bill?  Is there any prospect that an increase is in sight for those who have been shut out of this Bill because of the fact they retired after October, 1952?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill attempts no more than to deal with the hardship on those who were pensioned off before the 1st November, 1952.  If the Minister for Finance had taken in all the pensioners who retired after that date, there would be less out of this particular sum of money for those who are, I think, worse off relatively. I am afraid I have not got the figure Deputy Dillon wants of the number of people who have retired between November, 1952 and this date, but those who retired after November, 1952, had the benefit of being retired on a pension calculated on an increased salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the increase did not come until 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an increase on the 1st November, 1952.  There was another increase since.  Those who retired since 1956 are entitled to a pension calculated on the basis of their retiring salary.  All who retired after November, 1952 enjoyed a larger salary at the time of their retiral and, <Col N="1207" /> consequently, a higher pension than those with whom we are dealing in this Bill, that is, the people who retired before 1948 and between 1948 and 1952.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that we cannot deal with all the consequences of the inflationary trend we spoke about yesterday which has been going on roughly since the middle of the last war.  However, I think we are making provision for the civil servants who have been very badly affected by it, namely, those who retired before 1952. We are making provision for them, but we cannot make provision for the other categories of citizens who have also been adversely affected by this trend.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton compared what happened here with what happened in Britain.  I can assure him that the civil servants in Great Britain and the Six Counties are not satisfied or would like to get more than the increases they have got to date.  It is calculated that to give full parity to all the civil servants who retired before this year with those who retired on the present level of salaries would require £55,000,000 from the British Exchequer. In fact, all the British Chancellor of the Exchequer found himself prepared to give was £11,000,000.  We could, of course, do better than we are doing in this Bill for the restricted number of people involved but if we did so, we would have to do worse for other categories of citizens.  That is the dilemma with which the Minister for Finance has always to contend.  It is not that he is ungenerous and would not like to do what everybody asks but he feels compelled, as custodian of the finances of the people generally, to say that he cannot do certain things he would like to do and that other people would like him to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get some figures straight.  The Minister gave us some figures yesterday.  I do not think they were exactly comparable figures.  As I understand it, the total cost of this Bill in a full year is £70,000, decreasing.  The total cost <Col N="1208" /> of the equivalent Bill in 1956 was £140,000, decreasing, presumably, also. Of that £140,000 then, increases to civil servants amounted to £37,000; to national teachers, £40,000 and there was £28,000 to the Garda Síochána and other State pensioners.  Could the Minister give, in relation to this £70,000, a similar breakdown as between civil servants, teachers and Garda pensioners?</P>
      <P>Apart from that, as well as I understand the figures, in 1956 the Army pensions increase was £40,000 in a full year.  What is the increase in Army pensions in respect of the current Bill as apart from military service pensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave Deputy Sweetman the figures yesterday and he repeated them to-day and again I confirm them, that the cost to the Exchequer of the present Bill, covering the categories involved, in a full year is £70,000.  The corresponding increase in the 1956 Bill was £140,000.</P>
      <P>In regard to the increases to civil servants&mdash;I think I had better put it in percentages because the figure I have here is what the civil servants would get extra this year&mdash;of the total of this £70,000, for a full year, the civil servants will get approximately 35 per cent.; the national teachers will also get about 35 per cent. and 30 per cent. of the £70,000 will go to other pensioners.  Will that be sufficient for the Deputy?</P>

      <P>I wonder could the Minister conveniently find out the figure, about which I have been asking him, that is, the number of persons who fall in this category of persons who have retired since the vital date in this Bill and the date of the basic increase in Civil Service pensions of 1958?  Would that involve a lot of research?</P>

      <P>I want to be quite clear about what the Opposition want.  No one who has retired since 1952 is getting less than the corresponding pensioner, identical colleague, who left before 1952.  So, I think what the Deputy has in mind is how many pensioners left the Civil Service between 1952 and to date.  Is that right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), line 25, to delete &ldquo;seven&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;thirty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This matter has been fully discussed on the Second Reading of the Bill and because of the general feeling of the House, both on the Minister's side and on this side, I think the Minister should accept this amendment. As I pointed out yesterday, anybody who had an ordinary lorry with a merchandise licence, up to this, came within the weight of the merchandise licence.  Since the Financial Resolution moved by the Minister for Local Government, he has now to take in additions such as creels, horse boxes, or any other contrivance, as part of the weight.  These people were within the law.  The Financial Resolution puts them outside the law and the Minister for Local Government promised that the Minister for Transport and Power would come in here and rectify the matter by this Bill.  I think the Minister and the officials of his Department will agree that seven cwt. is a very small weight for one of these containers.  As a matter of fact, they would want to be built on a frame or have cardboard sides to come within the weight.  I do not think the Minister or anybody else would like to see these flimsy contraptions on lorries.  If a lorry were going around a bend, the weight of the animals in the back might press out and burst the sides.  It would be better to have the opportunity of putting up substantial creels, or horse boxes as the case may be, on the lorry.  From people I have been speaking to, and from my own experience, I know that 30 cwt. would be much nearer the required increase than seven cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister assured us <Col N="1213" /> that cases of hardship would be treated individually.  I do not think it is right that the Minister should put this burden on himself.  There are going to be 200 or 300 cases in the year and they will have to be dealt with separately.  He would be much better off if he gave a global increase, an increase not for the ordinary lorry weight but to allow the ordinary containers which are used in the course of carrying various types of goods, to be covered.  I do not think it is fair that all these cases should be dealt with separately.</P>
    <P>We are bringing in a Bill and the proper thing would be to make provision for what is actually necessary for these people.  As I said, they have been within the law all the time and have been certified by the inspecting Guard at Ballsbridge and other places. They have been regarded as being within the law and now the Financial Resolution has put them outside it.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows most people are anxious to keep within the law. It may have been different before, but now people are law-abiding and want to obey the law and they want to be put in a position where they can obey it.  I therefore ask the Minister, as he was asked yesterday on all sides of the House, to extend the weight to 30 cwt. rather than seven.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to agree to this amendment.  If he did so he would be doing a good day's work for himself and for the officers of his Department by not cluttering up the Department with claims over the next month.  The time is very short before the next licensing period.  If the Minister changes this from seven to 30 cwt. these people could go in and license their lorries in the normal way.  They can go in with a clear conscience and know that they will be within the law all the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say first of all, in connection with the amendment that I am not acting on the basis that these people have been within the law if they did not weigh their attachments. The position is that licensed hauliers <Col N="1214" /> have been very strongly represented in an association for many years.  There have been substantial increases in weight allotted to them over two or three important periods.  I should say that when they met the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it was made clear beyond all doubt that when they were granted weight increases, these were based on the definition of the weight of the then existing lorries, and excluding the attachments.  These people have been in a special position in that, whatever else other private carriers may have thought, it has been impressed upon them beyond all doubt that they had to weigh their lorries with the attachments on them.  There is no question that they could have been innocent in the matter.  They knew the position and they were organised, as I said, in an association with a competent secretary.</P>
      <P>They have been given very considerable increases of weight since 1933.  For example if you take the one ton, 15 cwt. lorry as it was in 1933, the allowance has now gone up to two tons 15 cwt., an increase of 20 cwts.  If the lorry has a diesel engine which a great many have, there is an addition of five cwts.  An allowance for carrying cattle of seven cwts. is granted to carriers who are licensed to carry cattle, so that the total increase since 1933 in such cases was 32 cwts. or almost 100 per cent.  Again take the case of the vehicle weighing 2 tons 10 cwt. in 1933.  The weight now permitted is 3 tons 15 cwts., an increase of 25 cwt.  If you add the five cwt. diesel allowance and the seven cwt. addition in the Bill, the total weight increase since 1933 is over 70 per cent.  If the owner installed tipping gear, the total has doubled.  If you take the larger lorry, 3 tons 3 cwts. to 4 tons 16 cwt., they are now increased to 4 tons basic, meaning five tons.  I have already mentioned the 33 per cent. increase and assuming only the diesel engines plus the seven cwts. proposed in this Bill, the increase is 27 per cent.  That is a very substantial increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware that the licensed hauliers naturally have striven to improve <Col N="1215" /> their position but there is no question that although the 1933 Act and the 1944 Act were clearly intended to limit the extent of licensed carrier operations in order to preserve the position of C.I.E., the net receipts from licensed carrier operations increased, for example, by 32 per cent. in the period 1953 to 1956, according to the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i> I imagine we can presume that the net receipts were not overstated by the licensed hauliers concerned when they made their returns and they have admitted a genuine increase in net receipts of 32 per cent. since 1953 thus revealing that they have been able to progress fairly well.</P>
    <P>If we were to accept Deputy Crotty's amendment, the total increase of carrying space for the whole of the licensed hauliers would be enormous and would represent a tremendous addition to the present carrying capacity.  As I have already indicated, I do not know what position will be revealed when applications are made under the hardship section, Section 115 of the 1944 Act.  I am very much in the dark about it.  All I can say is that the applications will be considered, and deserving cases of hardship will be sympathetically examined.  It would be wrong for me to say I am going to protect the interests of people who did deliberately evade the law because in relation to licensed hauliers, it certainly was made evident beyond yea or may that they were intended to add to the weight of their lorries the weight of any attachments. There can be no doubt about that.  Of all the groups in the carrying trade they were told most often.  Indeed they have been coming to defend their interests, year after year, claiming that if they did not get increased weight allowances, they would be thrown off the road.</P>
    <P>There was a general all-round increase for lorries of over four tons of 22½ per cent., and of 45 per cent. for lorries under four tons, excluding the additions I have mentioned such as the five cwts. for the diesel engine and the ten cwts. for the permanent fixed tipping gear and the allowance of seven cwts. for creels given to 190 persons who had not already been covered by the 1935 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister overlooks the fact, when he speaks of the increased takings of licensed hauliers between 1953 and 1956, that that is the very object for which the cattle marts were begun to be built and the licensed hauliers were fulfilling an essential function transporting cattle to and from these marts which did not exist until the marts were established.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crotty's amendment is infinitely preferable to the situation we had presented to the House yesterday. I deliberately choose the moderate word &ldquo;disingenuous&rdquo; and I charge the Minister with disingenuousness.  He is either deceiving Deputy O'Malley or deceiving the House because I understood Deputy O'Malley, when he intervened in the debate yesterday, to say he understood that little regard needed to be paid to the figure of seven cwt. in this Bill, because the Minister had discretion under a section of the 1944 Act which he proposed to use in such a way as to leave the licensed haulier at present operating substantially in possession of the same amenities as he now enjoys.  Is that not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what he hoped. Deputy O'Malley expressed that pretty clearly.  As I understood the Minister when he was replying on Second Stage, he seemed to adopt Deputy O'Malley's interpretation and said that really nobody had anything to fear under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Now, Deputy Crotty puts down a somewhat more restrictive amendment than the result of what the Minister appeared to undertake to do would be, and the Minister says he is quite unable to accept it because the licensed hauliers have got all they are entitled to and that, of course, power still remains to deal with cases of exceptional hardship.  In the Minister's judgment, they have had a very liberal expansion of their carrying capacity provided heretofore, and he does not see, over and above the seven cwt. provided in this Bill, there should be any general further expansion because if there were, he said, their carrying capacity would be expanded out of all knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> One cannot reconcile the undertaking the Minister appeared to give to Deputy O'Malley yesterday that the 1944 Act was to be used liberally to meet the carriers with his statement to-day that he would not give a general increase of 30 cwts. in lieu of the seven cwts. increase in the carrying capacity of the licensed haulier fleet. That would defeat the original idea of this legislation which was to give C.I.E. a quasi-monopoly in merchandise road haulage.  The House is at least entitled to expect from the Minister an honest frank statement of what the likely consequences of the Bill, without the amendment, are likely to be.  How many cases of hardship does he expect to deal with in the immediate future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to say. The licensed hauliers have been with the Department and they mentioned the furniture carriers and certain beet hauliers and certain people with very large cattle trucks.  They did not refer to any categories beyond these three groups.  If I could give the Deputy the information, I should gladly do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not very difficult to legislate if we have not the faintest notion what we are legislating about? If I am given to understand the Minister proposes to use his discretionary powers under the 1944 Act to allow all persons carrying livestock to use their customary cribs and creels; all persons carrying furniture to use their customary equipment; all persons carrying beet to use their customary equipment without reference to it&mdash;if you have livestock, furniture and beet, will the Minister kindly tell me what category of merchandise will not qualify for the exemption in the 1944 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that all carriers who are making use of their lorries to carry cattle would require hardship extensions.  I did not say that they would all get a liberal increase because I do not know the position.  There are a great many cattle lorries in the country which have creels which weigh about seven cwts. Some of these people will already have got an increase under the 1935 Act <Col N="1218" /> because they carry cattle and they are getting another seven cwts. on top of that.  Others who did not adopt this course will get seven cwts.</P>
      <P>There may be a number of other licensed carriers who have a heavier type of creel.  Of those licensed carriers, there may be a very high proportion who kept within the law and who may have sold four lorries and purchased three lorries instead.  Their total weight then comes within their basic limit.  They may have adopted some other course to keep within the law.  We are simply unaware of the position.</P>
      <P>One characteristic of the law is the fact that if a man has, say, three lorries and he gets three times seven cwts., he may apply, if possible, the whole of the 21 cwts. to one lorry. He may be a licensed carrier with two lorries that carry cattle and one which does not.  He may be able to satisfy his own position if he has, in fact, not understood the law as it is. There are so many complications that it would be very hard to frame a standardised pattern of legislation to cover all the possible variations that may arise.</P>
      <P>I said to Deputy Dillon last night that if, as the pattern unfolds, there appear to be so many anomalies that my discretionary power would be likely to cause a feeling of disquiet in the public mind, I might have to come back to the Dáil, after consulting the Government, to propose some legislation as a remedy.  The Deputy can be assured that we want to preserve the fine tradition established in the Department.  The discretionary power used in the past was fair and equitable and caused amazingly little comment or controversy in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that but the Minister will not forget that it was in the past three weeks we were told in this House that eight additional merchandise licences were issued in the Island of Achill consequent on a meeting summoned by Deputy Doherty and Deputy Calleary, the Fianna Fáil T.D.s for North Mayo. That may seem to him to be a very <Col N="1219" /> satisfactory exercise of his discretionary powers but to us it seems to be quite an amazing exercise of his discretionary powers, the details of which were not revealed until Deputy Doherty sprang to his feet to claim credit for the remarkable achievement that he and Deputy Calleary had managed to pull this off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that at once but I suggest that the Deputy should address himself to his colleague, Deputy Doherty, because Deputy Doherty stated in my presence that he and Deputy Calleary attended a meeting in Achill and that, as a result of this general meeting, representations were made to the Minister as a result of which eight licences were issued. Deputy Lindsay said he was not at any such meeting and Deputy Doherty said he was not asked because there was nobody on Achill who was not a Fianna Fáil man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

I am certain of that. I am pledging my word here now that I never attended a public meeting in Achill at which this matter arose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the fact that Deputy Calleary was not present but I would urge him to get in touch with his colleague, Deputy Doherty, and find out what happened.  Perhaps it was the ghosts of the two Deputies that were there and that they were mistaken, or maybe it was that they were so much there in spirit that they were there as manifestations while physically elsewhere, though I understand that is <Col N="1220" /> a saintly attribute which I would not associate with Deputy Calleary or Deputy Doherty whom I regard as extremely pragmatic politicians.</P>
      <P>Let the Deputy not quarrel with me. I know nothing of what transpired in Achill.  I was merely accepting Deputy Doherty as the authority who pledged his word, as Deputy O'Malley did to me in another context yesterday. Deputy Doherty pledged his word of honour that he was present in Achill and that his colleague was with him.  I accepted the word of Deputy O'Malley at once that he had no prior consultation with the Minister for Health.  I always accept the word of honour of any Deputy in this House.  Some people will quarrel with my discretion in doing so.  I would advise Deputy Calleary to take up the matter with Deputy Doherty.  I depend only on the words spoken by him in this House.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us&mdash;he may have had an opportunity of looking into it&mdash;how many times per year has this discretionary power been used since the Minister got it in 1944 for the increase of the authorised weight?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got our own experience.  We know perfectly well in our own constituencies that to get a new merchandise licence or a variation of the existing one has been for many years virtually impossible.  To listen to Deputy O'Malley talking, one would imagine that this power under the 1944 Act resolved everybody's difficulty and would be freely used.  Surely the only way you can test that is to find out what happened during the past 15 years since power was conferred on the Minister?  The Minister says it was used very infrequently&mdash;only a few times per year.  Has the Minister or Deputy O'Malley any reason to believe that the power that has been used most infrequently in the past will be used frequently in the future?  If it is, <Col N="1221" /> ought we not accept Deputy Crotty's amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to answer Deputy Dillon on the question of Achill.  It is very important, for the sake of the traditionally fair application of the Transport Act legislation, that the Deputy should know how the matter arose in Achill.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, Achill was an area where the Transport Acts did not operate because C.I.E. were not interested.  There were literally no licensed carriers.  One person applied and was granted a licence.  The rest of the people in the island realised that here was an area to which the Transport Acts would apply, under the section of the Act which enabled the Minister to grant licences where the public transport was inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A public meeting was held at which this matter was discussed.  In between 4th February, after the public meeting, and 10th September, 1959, there were 17 applications for new merchandise licences.  The then Minister, through his Parliamentary Secretary, made what I think was the only decision he could make in the circumstances.  He decided to grant a licence to all those persons who had applied before 20th April, 1959.  There were the months of February and March and up to 20th April during which time everything was known <Col N="1222" /> about this in the island.  The meeting was absolutely public.  It would not have mattered whether only Fianna Fáil Deputies were present and no other Deputy; it would not have mattered if only an Opposition Deputy was present and no Fianna Fáil Deputy.  The applications were received in a stream.  The Parliamentary Secretary asked himself what he should do in the unusual case where a number of people in an area applied for a merchandise licence.  He then decided to grant licences to all those persons whose applications were received before the date on which he decided to grant the licences.  It was completely above-board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite happy about the position in Achill, if it has any relevance to this matter.  If C.I.E. were interested, no licences would be given.  Whatever was done was done by way of open meeting.  If Deputy Dillon or any one of his colleagues were Minister, I am sure I should be just as happy about the position in this case.  All those who applied for licences did not get them but far too many licences were probably issued. I think the same thing would have been done by any Government and the decision is fair and reasonable under the circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is undesirable that the scope of discretionary power should be too wide.  I asked the Minister on the Second Stage to indicate how the figure of seven cwts. was regarded as the correct extra unladen weight to allow in this instance.  Unfortunately, I was not able to remain in the House when the Minister was replying and I do not know what he said.</P>

      <P>Even allowing for adjustments permitted as a result of legislation under this heading in recent years, everybody knows that the general pattern of commercial trucks has changed gradually in recent years. Those of us who deal with that business know the finer points.  We have to get acquainted with them in an effort to conduct our business on a competitive basis.  The general tendency is to have a heavier type of truck.  Transport nowadays is subject to keen competition, whether operated by road, rail or sea.  Apart altogether from diesel engines, and minor desirable improvements, there are changes in the chassis and attachments of vehicles.</P>
      <P>I have gone to quite a lot of trouble to assess a reasonable weight and it is very much in excess of seven cwts. Deputy Crotty's amendment which seeks to increase the weight to 30 cwts., is on the high side.  The Minister might consider increasing the limit of seven cwts. to 14 cwts., which is a more realistic figure.  In cases of special vehicles of container traffic type particularly, it might be rather difficult to legislate at this stage on the basis of a standard pattern of unladen weight.  Section 116 might be left open to deal with those cases. A number of these will be isolated but they should not be very many.</P>
      <P>The majority of licensed hauliers use only one truck.  The Minister may say that if a haulier operates two or three trucks, the aggregate could be passed on to one but that would be of no avail because nobody with two or three trucks would consider that a reasonable proposition.  At one stage of our transport history, I think there was an allowance of five cwts. unladen weight.  If that figure at that time was deemed to be realistic I submit that changes in the intervening period, since the time the original weight was increased, should be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody with an elementary knowledge <Col N="1224" /> of transport development knows that the suggested figure of seven cwts. is little better than nothing.  It will involve Parliament and the law in a considerable amount of difficulty.  I do not blame ordinary private operators with merchandise licences for seeking to preserve the facilities which those licences gave them.  When licences were originally given to the principal transport companies, they were on a fixed pattern of unladen weight.  Since then, as far as I know, these companies have been able to increase the unladen weight of their lorries without reference to the regulations. Take the case of a private operator who, under the 1933 Act, had a two-ton unladen weight.  He got a merchandise licence and possibly he has had that increased, if he has been lucky enough to be able to take advantage of the intervening legislation, to two tons five cwts., or two tons 10 cwts.</P>
    <P>At the original date, a number of licences were given on a fixed pattern of unladen weight to the public transport companies.  It is quite possible that most, if not all, of these licences are today being operated in respect of an unladen weight of three times the figure originally attached to them. Undoubtedly, there is preference, and I think almost an undue preference, being given to public transport companies. We must admit that they are common carriers and have been such up to recently.  I think that description has been amended last year in so far as public transport obligations were concerned.  Up to then, as far as road freight is concerned, they were common carriers and more or less still are.  It is reasonable to expect they should get some concession beyond that given to the ordinary operator. The concessions accorded to them have been very much above what I think are reasonable or equitable.</P>
    <P>The private operator has had his nose to the grindstone all along so far as difficulty in relation to the unladen weight of his vehicle is concerned. Every time he has to weigh it in, he is scared to death.  Whenever there is a new truck and whenever they are called upon to weigh it in, they merely avoid <Col N="1225" /> a very unpleasant situation of finding their vehicle is in excess of allowed weight by a number of lbs., quarter weights, and so on.  In trying to bring this matter into line with modern conditions we must do so at a figure that is reasonable.  At the same time we must prevail on the people to operate strictly within the law.  The number of cases the Minister should deal with under Section 116 of the 1944 Act should be very few.  I would much prefer if I needed an extension of the unladen weight to be entitled to act according to the law rather than to have to apply under Section 116 to this Minister or to any Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>I think the general attitude of the Minister's Department would be that except a case was made beyond yea or nay it would not be allowed.  The unfortunate applicant is in the position of having to place himself at the mercy of the Department and the Minister.  Furthermore it takes a considerable time and very often does not come through without very objectionable inquiries being made.  I suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider this limit of unladen weight and bring it up to the figure I suggest. That would be better in the long run and it would not in any way affect the public transport companies who operate merchandise licences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Crotty's amendment which is completely unrealistic.  If the Minister were to agree to give a global increase of 30 cwts. to every licensed haulier without sufficient knowledge of the increased tonnage involved, which I believe would be fantastic, it would hit C.I.E., and I for one like other Deputies on every side of the House am concerned about the prospects of C.I.E. and their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if C.I.E. were not there at all, I must say that Deputy Crotty and Deputy Dillon, with all due respect, have not grasped that as things stand there must be a very large percentage of hauliers who do not merit any increase in weight whatever.  Much of the trouble has been brought on the Minister's head by himself in mentioning <Col N="1226" /> seven cwts., in mentioning any figure.  His argument, if I have followed it correctly, is this: &ldquo;We shall give seven cwts. because seven cwts. would be about the weight of a creel.&rdquo;  The corollary from that line of argument is that there must have been people breaking the law who did not include the creel when it was weighed.  The Minister could not answer that point.  If he did not have to give them this sop of seven cwts. &mdash; and I am only using the Minister's own words&mdash;then he could assume that the creel was weighed with the unladen weight of the lorry for taxation purposes in the past.</P>
    <P>I also disagree with Deputy Moloney's suggestion in mentioning 14 cwts.  Neither that suggestion nor Deputy Crotty's amendment is realistic.  If the Minister insists and continues to rely on Section 114 of the 1944 Act and to use his discretionary powers as to whether hardship exists or not, if I were he, I would not put in the seven cwts. at all.  I would let each applicant prove his case.  If you accept Deputy Moloney's suggestion of 14 cwts. you are back to where you started.  You are definitely giving an increased tonnage on the merchandise licence which may not be required at all.  I would prefer to allow each person to make application under Section 114 of the 1944 Act and let his case be decided on its merits.  The Minister said he would come back to this House if he came across any anomalies.  Let him be sure he will be coming back to the House and before very long with improved legislation.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw attention to Section 114 of the Transport Act of 1944 which, to the best of my knowledge, states that the Minister may increase the unladen weight to a minor extent.  If the Minister is relying on Section 114 he will have to tell us what in his opinion is meant by &ldquo;a minor extent&rdquo;.  He may increase the unladen weight to a minor extent if he thinks hardship exists.  Why were the words &ldquo;minor extent&rdquo; put in?  They were not put in for pleasure I presume.  I do not want to advocate legislation because I would be out of order, but I <Col N="1227" /> think that the best and the happiest course would be for each applicant to go to the district court or the circuit court and prove his case.  The worst thing possible would be for Fianna Fáil T.D.s to be making representations. It is not necessary, because I believe applications will be dealt with on their merits.  I do not think anyone in the House has ever had any criticism of the Department of Industry and Commerce or the officials of the Minister in this regard.  Everyone has been satisfied that the latter has been dealt with fairly.  However, in the Minister's own interest I would suggest getting rid of this discretionary power where hardship exists and let the courts decide that.  That is what they are there for.</P>
    <P>Will the person make application personally to the Minister or through his solicitor and will he give evidence himself?  There is another point on which I should like a clear and explicit statement.  This is a point that will satisfy everyone, would satisfy Deputy Crotty as regards his amendment and Deputy Moloney in respect of his suggestion. Will the Minister tell the House and tell these carriers who are worried to death about the position that if he is reasonably satisfied that they carried a certain weight in the past 12 months or two years, he will amend their licence accordingly?</P>
    <P>What I did not like about the Minister's statement to-day was his suggestion that the licensed hauliers knew very well what they were doing.  He said that it had been drummed into them by their association that in weighing the lorry, any attachment to that lorry must be weighed with it.  The Minister himself by giving the seven cwts. as a step has admitted that there were anomalies, the admission being that people were not weighing their lorries with the creels.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows perfectly well that district justices could not make up their minds in different counties and, if they could not do that, how can an unfortunate lorry driver be expected to interpret the law?  We know that in one county a prosecution was dismissed and in the next county the <Col N="1228" /> defendant was fined substantially.  To cut a long story short, I would ask the Minister to tell us exactly what he intends to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to find out what is the position with regard to furniture vans or containers.  A number of these have attachments which weigh considerably more than seven cwts.  Does it follow from this legislation that they will now be prevented from using these trucks or can the Minister give them an increase, depending on the type of truck which runs from 25 cwts. to 30 cwts.?  One of the people who spoke to me on this matter said that he would estimate the average weight of these containers or vans at about 25 cwt. and a few exceptional ones exceed that weight.  Will it be the position when this legislation is passed that a haulier who is operating one of these lorries will be precluded from getting the increased weight because of the limitation of seven cwt. or has the Minister power under the 1944 Act to grant an increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has discretionary power under Section 116 of the 1944 Act to make provision for such unusual cases deserving generous sympathy.  The case of furniture removers is a complicated one, owing to the fact that the van is occasionally detached and put on to a boat or railway. The Minister for Local Government has decided that such attachments must be included for the purpose of unladen weight unless the goods are never put into the container when it is attached to the lorry. However, that is a matter that can be dealt with in the discretionary power of the Minister and it is one that will receive sympathetic consideration. Sometimes these containers are used to go from one door to another; sometimes they are carried to the railway, put on the railway and when the railway journey is finished, they are put on another furniture van.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned his discretionary powers with regard to cases of hardship but I would remind him that up to the present these discretionary powers have been used only in cases of general hardship.  Where a hardship is imposed on everybody they have been used but they have not been used in any particular case.  These discretionary powers were used in general cases where a good case could be put up that a hardship existed and where a case could be made that a hardship was being caused to practically every licensed haulier.  If the present Minister is going to change that line of action and is going to go into every single case that is a different matter.</P>
      <P>I would be prepared to withdraw my amendment if the Minister would agree with Deputy O'Malley's suggestion and give us an assurance that any person who has been using these containers over the last 12 or 24 months will be allowed to continue to use them.  It is not a question of giving a licence to those who never used them.  Will the Minister allow people who have been using these creels for the haulage of cattle for the last 12 or 24 months to continue to use them and give them a licence to keep them going?  I have been speaking to some of these people and one man told me that under this new legislation he will not be able to take cattle to Kilkenny mart as he has been doing.  They will be all outside the law whereas heretofore they were assured that they were within the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a man brought horses to Balls-bridge, the Gardaí on duty there would tell him: &ldquo;You are all right so <Col N="1230" /> long as you have the lorry under the particular weight.&rdquo;  Does the Minister suggest that that officer was trying to evade the law or that he was in collusion with the lorry owner?  I know of an instance in which a private haulier in my constituency was told by the Garda authorities that he was within the law but the Minister says that he was evading it.  I shall withdraw my amendment if the Minister will agree with the suggestion of Deputy O'Malley that where a person has been using such equipment for 12 months or 24 months in the ordinary course of his business he will consider the matter favourably and will allow them to carry on their business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy spoke of the discretionary power of the Minister, he was right in saying that it was not used in the past to any great extent in connection with creels. In connection with many other factors the Minister's powers are constantly exercised for the purpose of dealing with each application as it comes and to examine the particular facts in connection with that application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as regards weight, but the same sort of discretionary power is being used, involving the same meticulous examination, the application of a fair principle and the avoidance of an inequitable decision. We are, therefore, well experienced in the Department in dealing with such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the other observation made by Deputy Crotty is concerned, I could not make a promise of that kind. I must go into this question before I could undertake to grant an exemption to every person who, 12 or 24 months ago, was carrying a particular sort of container on his lorry.  I want to reiterate that the position has been made very clear to the licensed hauliers over the years.  They well know the position in regard to the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as he was then, towards the unladen weight of lorries. It would be an extremely serious thing if I were to make a decision which <Col N="1231" /> would have the effect of grievously imperilling the position of the C.I.E. I would like to hear some more defence of the C.I.E.  They employ 23,000 people.  They are costing the country £3,000,000 to £3,500,000, according to the way you calculate the interest paid. Every single person is paying an average of 3d. in the £ on income tax, 4d. per gallon on diesel oil, 4d. per gallon on petrol and 3d. per 20 cigarettes to keep the organisation going.</P>
    <P>I must state, therefore, for the record, the policy in relation to transport legislation as clearly set out in a letter to the Irish Haulage Contractors Association from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, dated 11th October, 1938, in which he said:</P>
    <P>While protecting the existing road transport businesses, the policy of the Legislature was to preserve to the railway companies the benefit of any expansion in the use of road transport.  The Minister sees no prospect of a departure from this policy.</P>
    <P>That policy has never been departed from, either in the case of the 1944 Act or indeed in the case of the 1934 or 1935 Acts.  That policy has been maintained.  Whatever decision I take, I am certainly not going to worsen the position of C.I.E. if it can possibly be avoided.  As Deputies will see, the examination will be difficult.  Nobody need envy me my task in dealing with this matter, which has arisen out of the necessity for clarifying the legal position in regard to unladen weight.  I shall do the best I can under the circumstances. I cannot say more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this extension of the weight can injure C.I.E. I can talk for my own constituency. These ordinary licensed hauliers are able to go up byroads for cattle which the big C.I.E. lorries could not possibly travel.  Instead, the cattle had to be driven down to the main road. Now, with the Bovine T.B. Eradication Scheme, the cattle will not be allowed to be driven on the roads.  The lorries will have to go into the yards, into the fields, for these cattle.  Unless you have local hauliers who know the byroads, <Col N="1232" /> these cattle cannot be brought to the marts at all.</P>
      <P>I thought Deputy O'Malley's suggestion was a reasonable one and I would go part of the way with Deputy Moloney, too.  I do not want to force this to a division.  If the Minister is prepared to be reasonable and say &ldquo;I will give the person who had these creels the same rate as that which covered their creels for the past 12 or 24 months,&rdquo; I am prepared to withdraw. I would ask the Minister to be reasonable.  He is, or ought to be, as interested in the cattle trade as I or any other Deputy.  If he is reasonable and not tied by red tape, he will say &ldquo;Yes, I will give these people, within reason, what they have.&rdquo;  I do not think that would interfere with C.I.E. in the slightest.  They would not lose the carriage of one beast by that.  They would still get the traffic from the marts, which the local men do not get.  They will not lose the carriage of one beast if the Minister agrees with the suggestion made by Deputy O'Malley and supported by Deputy Moloney and myself.</P>

      <P>Prior to 29th October, 1953, the date of enactment of the Health Act, 1953, the standard salary scale of permanent dispensary doctors was £528 a year, increasing by annual increments of £19.10.0. to £723 a year, including cost of living bonus then payable.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> In September, 1954 a revised scale was adopted by local authorities following upon discussions between the Irish Medical Association, the City and County Managers and my Department. This revised scale was made effective with retrospective effect from 1st April, 1953.  The new scale £623 rising by annual increments of £38 to £813 was £95 higher at the minimum and £90 higher at the maximum than the old scale.

    <P>The question of the payment of any further increase in cost-of-living bonus to dispensary doctors is a matter for the local authorities in the first instance.  I have received no proposals for the payment of such bonus from these local authorities.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Irish Medical Association: Attitude to Vacant Posts.</Title>
    <P>The following question appeared on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy G. Boland: <Col N="1236" /> 5.  To ask the Minister for Health whether, with reference to the statement in the current issue of the Journal of the Irish Medical Association that no ban exists on certain posts, he is aware that at a meeting in November last at Athlone of a member-group of the Association at which the dismissed County Surgeon, Mallow, was present, it was decided to continue to ban and proscribe all vacant posts as county surgeon; and whether, in view of the fact that the memorandum of association of the Association provides that it shall not support with its funds any object or endeavour to impose on, or procure to be observed by, its members or others any regulation, restriction or condition which if an object of the Union, would make it a trade union, he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I have some reason to believe that the position in regard to the meeting of the County Surgeons' Group of the Irish Medical Association, last month at Athlone is as stated in the question.</P>
      <P>The Memorandum of Association of the Irish Free State Medical Union, now the Irish Medical Association, contains a proviso that the Association&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;cannot support with its funds any object or endeavour to impose on or procure to be observed by its members or others any regulation, restriction, or condition which, if an object of the Union, would make it a Trade Union.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> As a layman, I would assume that in view of the proviso which I have just quoted, the action believed to have been taken at the meeting was <i>ultra vires,</i> that any person adversely affected by the boycott may have grounds for legal action. that those present at the meeting probably have not the protection of the Trade Union Acts, and consequently were acting on their own personal responsibility because the Association is expressly debarred from indemnifying them against the consequences of their action. Indeed, in my opinion, it would be prudent for any person engaging or proposing to engage in this kind of action to consult his lawyer as to his position.</P>

    <P>6.  To ask the Minister for Health if any Ministerial directions were issued to county managers by his Department in April, 1958, concerning a limitation on the amount of retrospection which might be applied to local authority rates of wages; and, if so, if he will give a general outline of any such directions.</P>

      <P>The Opposition watchdog is asleep.  No such direction was issued, but in April, 1958, county and city managers were made aware <Col N="1239" /> by my Department that, in relation to certain staffs for which I am the appropriate Minister, my approval might be assumed for the grant of cost-of-living bonus increases similar to those which had been adopted for persons in the employment of the State. In general, the date of commencement of such increases was 1st April, 1958, but it was intimated to managers that no objection would be raised to an earlier date where such date was part of a recommendation by the Labour Court, or, in regard to employments for which conditions are related to those prevailing locally, where an earlier date was agreed between other local employers and representatives of workers in corresponding employments in the locality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that the Dublin Board of Assistance refuse blue cards for free medical and surgical treatment to applicants who maintain their homes and the contents thereof in good clean condition; and if he proposes to take any action in the matter.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the Dublin Board of Assistance refuse to issue medical cards to applicants for the reasons stated by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The legal standard laid down in Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953, for entitlement to general medical and surgical services is the inability of the applicant to provide the services for himself and his dependants by his own industry or other lawful means.  I am satisfied that it is by reference to this criterion only that the Board decide applications for these services.  I am sure that, on reflection, the Deputy will agree that the suggestion that the cleanliness of an applicant's home and its contents operate to prevent the just determination of his application is one that should not be made.</P>

      <P>The method of assessment of means for old age pension purposes is set out in the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952.

Where remittances of the type mentioned by the Deputy are voluntary or gratuitous, any amount in excess of £52 5s. a year is, therefore, treated as means for the purpose of assessment.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I propose to take Questions 13. 14, and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The total amounts subscribed for Prize Bonds (a) to date and (b) at the recent issue were £16.96 million and £2.69 million respectively.  The total amount of Prize Bonds repaid to date is £2.74 million.  At the recent issue £0.72 million was subscribed through the Post Office and £1.68 million through the commercial banks, the balance being subscribed through stockbrokers and the trustee savings banks.  The amount of Savings Certificates and Post Office Savings Bank deposits encashed for investment in the recent issue is estimated at approximately £0.13 million.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the information sought by the Deputy is contained in a tabular statement, which, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  For the following reason I have included in the statement statistics showing the cumulative position up to and including the March, 1959, issue of the Bonds and also separate figures in relation to that issue.  On 21 April, 1959, in reply to Questions by the Deputy I gave certain statistics of Prize Bonds receipts (Dáil Debates, Vol. 174 No. 5, Cols. 665, 666).  The Bank of Ireland, which furnished the information, has recently told me with regret that some of the figures given were incorrect.  I have accepted the Bank's explanation and apology, and I am availing of the present opportunity of supplying the revised statistics to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The immediate and most important aspect of this matter is to ensure the free movement of livestock. My statement, published last Tuesday after consultation with the interests mainly concerned, does, I hope, make the position in regard to the handling and shipping of cattle clear and secure.</P>
      <P>The difficulties which led to my statement had their origin in the dispute between marts and fairs, and I would express the hope that this dispute will be solved peacefully on the basis of the principle, to which I referred last week, of the individual's right to buy and sell cattle as he pleases.</P>

Does he not realise that the longer the cold war goes on between these disputants the more difficult it will be to effect any working arrangement?  Further, does the Minister not now see that neither party to the dispute can very well risk rejection of an invitation to a conference at the instance of the Minister or of his advisers in his Department?</P>

I can only say again that it is not because of any fear on my part that I might receive a rebuff or that I might fail that I have not taken such a step, but naturally one has to use one's judgment in a delicate matter like this and I can only say again that if I see the slightest chance of intervening with a reasonable hope of success I shall not hesitate to do so.</P>

      <P>(3) the power of the Minister for Agriculture to remove an officer of a Committee of Agriculture under the provisions of Section 23 of the Agriculture Act, 1931, either upon giving a fortnight's notice as provided for in sub-section (2) of that section or, as the case may be, summarily upon the completion of the holding of a local inquiry as provided for in that section.</P>
      <P>The person appointed shall not in any event continue in office after he reaches the age of 65 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  Under Clause 1 of the Department's Scheme of Instruction in Agriculture the Minister for Agriculture has prescribed that no person shall be eligible to obtain or retain the post <Col N="1254" /> of Instructor in Agriculture under this Scheme in a county in which he or any member of his family with whom he resides is engaged directly or indirectly in trade of any kind; nor shall any person be eligible to obtain such post in the county of which he is a native or in which he resides permanently.

Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of the Schedule to the Committees of Agriculture (Salaries of Officers) Regulations, 1949, the person appointed may be allowed to enter the appropriate salary scale as specified above at an incremental point higher than the minimum.  Where an Instructor in Agriculture is appointed to be a Chief Agricultural Officer he may be allowed to enter the appropriate salary scale as specified above at a point not more than £165 higher than that which he had reached as an Instructor in Agriculture.</P>
    <P>4.  Maintenance Allowance: Maintenance allowance in respect of the cost of subsistence and hotel expenses incurred when travelling within the county on the business of the Committee will be paid in accordance with the regulations of the Minister for Agriculture.  At present the maintenance allowance is at the rate of £50 per annum, but is subject to modification at any time, by regulations which may be made by the Minister for Agriculture pursuant to Section 28 of the Agriculture Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>5.  Locomotion Expenses: In addition to salary, Chief Agricultural Officers shall be entitled, in accordance <Col N="1255" /> with the regulations of the Minister for Agriculture, to the refund within the limits of the amount allocated for the purpose of the Committee, of locomotion expenses necessarily incurred by them while travelling in the county in the course of their duties including:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to permit the export of barley, in exchange for coarse grain other than oats, was made in the expectation that our full requirements of coarse grain would be met from home sources.  Experience has shown that charges for interest, storage and transport of native barley have added considerably to the price of feed, particularly in those areas where sufficient barley is not grown to meet local requirements.  The export of barley from areas in which there are surplus supplies reduces the holding and transport charges and enables maize or other coarse grain to be imported at a later date at more convenient distribution points.  In addition, limited quantities of maize are required for special rations.  On the basis of present prices of barley and maize on the world market, the export/ import arrangement should result in the feeders in the non-barley growing areas obtaining their feed at a price less than the price of native barley <Col N="1258" /> when account is taken of the overhead charges on such barley.</P>

      <P>As regards oats. there is no official control on the marketing, the price or the export of that crop.  The general position immediately after the harvest was, however, relieved by exports, and users have already been warned to procure their full requirements from home sources.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> Present market opinion in Britain is that there is a prospect of a somewhat firmer trend in prices during the coming week.  It is also hoped that more active purchases of turkeys for the home market from now on will be beneficial to producers.  These are market opinions, and one cannot naturally speak with certainty.</P>
    <P>As the greater part of our turkey output is exported it would not be practicable to fix minimum prices for producers.  The prices paid for turkeys at markets in Britain and this country have since 1st December been published daily in Press and radio bulletins issued by my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Chomhairle, <Col N="1267" /> to take Questions Nos. 44, 45 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The Transport Act, 1958, empowers C.I.E. to terminate any particular train service provided the Board is satisfied that its operation is uneconomic and that there is no prospect of its continued operation being economic within a reasonable period.  The Act also imposes on the Board of C.I.E. the general obligation to conduct the undertaking so as to eliminate losses by 31st March, 1964.  This means, in effect, that the fate of any particular line or station must depend on whether sufficient public support is given to it to justify its retention.</P>
      <P>C.I.E. have already published notice of their intention to terminate rail services on the Claremorris-Ballinrobe branch line and have indicated the nature of the alternative road services which they propose to provide.  It is open to Deputies and other persons or bodies concerned to make representations to C.I.E. during the statutory two months' period of notice.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear that under the Act I have no function in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the closing of this line will bring business practically to a standstill in the town of Ballinrobe?  Even at this late hour, would the Minister make representations to the Board of C.I.E. to alter their decision, if only to the extent of giving the line a further six months' trial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is to manufacture radio sets at Shannon Airport from components, some of which will be made in the Shannon factory and some, as is common in the radio industry, by manufacturers <Col N="1271" /> specialising in the production of components. Components will be bought from manufacturers in Ireland and Great Britain and some parts, mainly transistors, from Japan.  When in full production Japanese components will account for only one-fourth of the exfactory cost of a set.</P>
      <P>I see no reason why the establishment of this manufacturing industry at Shannon Airport should have an adverse effect on Anglo-Irish trade relations.</P>

The Company will be incorporated as soon as the legal formalities relating to its registration under the <Col N="1273" /> Companies Acts have been completed. As indicated in my reply to a Question on 11th November, 1959, certain persons have agreed to accept nomination as directors, but they cannot be appointed until the Company has been incorporated, and it would, I think, be premature to publish their names or to disclose particulars of the remuneration which they will receive as directors. I understand that the directors-designate have inspected a number of districts in the Bangor Erris area, but that a site for the project has not been finally selected.</P>

      <P>Land Commission statistics are generally recorded by reference to financial years.  During the year 1958/59, a total of 40 Mayo families was migrated by the Land Commission, including 18 migrated within County Mayo. Since 1st April, 1959, an additional 19 Mayo migrants have been transferred, including 12 within the county.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The lady in question agreed in February, 1951, to sell an area of 78 acres together with an undivided one-half share of 224 acres at Aghavannagh, Co. Wicklow, to the Forestry Division of my Department which owns the other half-share.  She declined to complete the sale and proceedings were taken against her for specific performance of her contract. Following a High Court Order she executed a Deed of Assignment of the lands in April, 1957, but she refused to hand over the lands to the Department and a further High Court Order for possession was obtained against her in March, 1958.  She refused to comply with this Order and possession was taken of the lands on 15th October, 1959, by due process of law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this lady denies, in fact, that she signed away the 70 acres of her small holding?  She was under the impression that she had signed away the 112 acres of hills.  Why should she sign away her holding of 40 acres of arable land and 30 acres of pasture land? Surely it is a new policy in the Forestry Department to acquire compulsorily a small holding and dispossess the lady and her children?  I am sure the Minister does not approve of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that this matter has been going on since 1951. I have no doubt from reading this file that the lady did, in fact, sign voluntarily to the Forestry Department and transferred these lands to the Forestry Department.  In fact, the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Blowick, who was Minister for Lands, instituted proceedings for a specific performance against her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not follow that policy.  Like myself, the Minister is familiar with small holdings.  The fact that some other Minister acted unjustly towards this woman is no justification for the Minister carrying on that policy. This matter has been going on since 1951.  When she found out that her holding was sold, she denied it to her solicitor.  She appeals to the Minister not to dispossess her of her holding. She has no objection to giving the hill but she objects to giving the 40 acres of arable and the 30 acres of pasture land.  I appeal to the Minister, who understands the position, to waive the clause and not dispossess this woman of her holding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>While what I have said is true, I want to assure the Deputy that she did, in fact, willingly transfer these lands.  I have made a further suggestion to my officials if this lady will, even at this late day, see sense for the re-transfer of a certain portion of these lands.  If she does not, the law will have to take its course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The law has been taking its course since 1951.  This <Col N="1284" /> lady has no law.  Surely it is not the policy to take compulsorily arable land for afforestation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I again want to assert that this was not a compulsory acquisition at all.  This was a voluntary deal.</P>

If so, the Minister will see that Deputy Everett's case is correct and that some consideration should be shown.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reserve of land available for planting in the Portlaw district and the volume of general management and maintenance work (including work on forest road construction) at the Forest properties in the district is at the highest possible level.  The amount of work available is sufficient only to permit of the continued employment of the men at present engaged.  Recruitment of additional staff would result in the rapid depletion of work reserves and would almost certainly lead to redundancy among the existing staff in a short time.  In the circumstances, I regret that it would not be practicable to take on additional men in the area in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that during the term of office of his predecessor a situation arose in Portlaw identical to the situation that now exists there of great unemployment? His predecessor allocated a special sum of £5,000 for extra work to be done.  I respectfully ask the Minister to look into this matter because this village is very hard hit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not fully accept that the effect on net fishing for salmon in the river Feale estuary of carrying out the recent arterial drainage scheme is as represented by the Deputy.  I am <Col N="1294" /> not aware of any resolution from the Limerick Board of Conservators of 7th August last dealing with this matter and the Clerk's report on conditions in the Feale estuary does not contain the essential information as to catches by net fishing.

      <P>As I have already announced, the Government have decided to set up a public Authority to control both sound broadcasting and television and an Advisory Committee has been appointed to advise and assist me in putting in hand, on behalf of the future Authority, certain arrangements for expediting the opening of the proposed television service.  Tenders have been invited for the transmitter station at Kippure; plans are being prepared for television broadcasting studios at the Montrose property at Stillorgan Road, Dublin, and arrangements are being made for the acquisition of four television transmitter sites which were selected after survey as being the most suitable for giving coverage of the areas which will not be served from Kippure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>
        <i>State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) (No. 2) Order</i>, 1959, a copy of which Order in draft has been laid before the House.</P>
      <P>The Draft Order has been laid before the House and its purpose is to guarantee further borrowing by St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd., Avoca to the extent of £550,000.</P>
      <P>In February, 1958, the Oireachtas approved of an Order made under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, for the purpose of the guaranteeing of the borrowing of an amount of £1,300,000, approximately, by St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd.  That sum was used by the Company to bring the copper mines at Avoca into production and to repay a loan of £350,000 which had been guaranteed under the Trade Loan (Guarantee) Acts.</P>
      <P>The Company has been in production since October, 1958.  After a period, difficulties were encountered in connection with the grade of the ore, since it transpired that the copper content was appreciably lower than had been anticipated.  The cause of the difficulties was, partly, that low grade material associated with the old workings formed a relatively high proportion of the mineralised rock being processed by the Company.  It took longer than anticipated to reach mineralised rock with a copper content as high as that hoped for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was necessary for the Company to consider methods of overcoming the difficulties associated with the low copper content of the ore and after careful study of the possible courses of action the Company decided to open up the deposits at Tigroney on the east side of the Avoca river.  Exploratory work has been carried out at Tigroney and the Company's proposal is to mine 1,000 tons of ore per day from that area.  In addition, the Company's <Col N="1303" /> operating methods on the west side of the Avoca river will be altered and mining will be carried out on a selective basis with every effort being made to secure the maximum tonnage of highly mineralised ore to the exclusion of low mineralised material.</P>
    <P>At the commencement of its activities, the Company hoped that a substantial revenue would be derived from the sale of pyrites which is a byproduct of the industry.  In fact, sales of pyrites have been extremely limited, and the revenue which the Company hoped would accrue, has not materialised. At the present time there are a number of projects under consideration which would provide a market for Avoca pyrites but it is not possible at this stage to give any definite indication as to the prospects of such projects coming to fruition.</P>
    <P>With the object of overcoming these difficulties the Company placed before me a proposal which involves a State guarantee of a loan of £550,000.  The proceeds of the loan would be used, <i>inter alia</i>, to finance conventional mining at Tigroney and for selective mining on the west side of the Avoca river.  The Company have expressed the opinion that assuming the price of copper does not fall below £232 per ton (the price ruling at the date of the application for a State guarantee of the additional loan) the carrying out of the new development work envisaged would enable the Company in due time to discharge its liabilities in respect of State-guaranteed loans.</P>
    <P>While the Company may be able to raise and process ore of the quality and quantity estimated, it is recognised that the success of the Avoca mines is closely associated with the price of copper.  When the original negotiations with St. Patrick's about commercial development of the Avoca ore deposits were proceeding, the price of copper was £430 per ton. This high price was due to international stockpiling.  Since then the price has fallen steadily and was at one time as low as £180 per ton.  The price during the last 12 months has varied from a low point of £209 to £267 and the present price is around <Col N="1304" /> £247 per ton.  It is impossible to forecast the trend of future copper prices but the Company's estimate is that the long term price will be in the region of £240 per ton.</P>
    <P>The company which made the loan of £1.3 million to St. Patrick's in 1958 has agreed to lend the additional amount of £550,000 to St. Patrick's.  I understand that it is the intention that the new loan will be consolidated with the existing loan, the security for which is a first mortgage on the assets of St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to guarantee the additional loan has been taken only after very careful consideration of the present position of the Company.  There is a reasonable prospect that the new development work which the Company proposes to undertake will lead to production on an economic basis.  Great importance must be attached to the fact that nearly 500 men are employed by the Company and a further fifty will be employed in connection with the new operations at Tigroney. The industry is important to our export trade as its entire production is sold on foreign markets and represents an important item in our industrial exports.  There can, however, be no certainty that the project will be a success but in my view the chances of a successful outcome are sufficiently good to justify guaranteeing the additional loan.  It cannot be denied that there is an element of risk in so doing but I consider that it is a risk which should be taken.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the House that it should approve of the draft Order which is laid before it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If ever anything was required to vindicate the decision taken by the previous Government at the instance of Deputy Norton and myself, the Minister has now produced that vindication.  At that time we based our arguments on the belief that we had got a price for copper that was higher than what we believed would be ruling over a long period.  We were assailed in this House by the present Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, as <Col N="1305" /> he then was, and by Deputy MacEntee, the present Tánaiste, because we had made that bargain.  It now appears clear beyond question that the bargain made by the inter-Party Government at that time was a bargain well worth while for this country because it got certain men employed in Avoca who would never have been employed if we had not struck when the iron was hot.</P>
      <P>I presume the Minister had to bring the draft of this Order to the Government to get approval for it.  I should like to have been a fly on the wall of the Cabinet Room on that occasion to see whether the face of the Taoiseach was as red as it should have been, and whether the face of the Tánaiste, who prophesied that the price of copper would go over £400 a ton in the foreseeable future, was as read as it should have been.  I have not gone back to read over those debates to see if the Minister committed himself on that occasion so I will say no more about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Every argument put forward by us at that time has been completely vindicated.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste should come into the House on this occasion and say to the people on this side of the House and to the Irish people generally that they are sorry for the mess they made in the way in which they tried to mislead the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving that aside and coming to the proposal now before us, am I to understand from the Minister that Tigroney is on the other side of the river from the works now being carried on?  There is a suggestion that in Tigroney the percentage of copper <Col N="1306" /> available is greater than where the work is now being carried out.  I remember hearing some time ago that Mianraí Teoranta had done their exploration work on the west side of the river in the wrong place, that it was not done in the valley of the mountains where the relatively high-grade copper was but up at the top of the mountain.  Is the other work which it is now proposed to undertake being done on the basis of the suggestion at that time that there is better grade ore to be found at the top of the mountain?</P>
    <P>I should like also to know whether the Minister has obtained details of any geographical exploration in relation to the mines on the west side of the river and to Tigroney on the east side.  If he has, could he give us the comprehensive results of that geographical exploration compared with the place at which mining is being carried on up to this?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to tell us what is the amount of copper concentrate exported in volume in 1958 and in this year up to the last time for which the figure is available and what are the values for the respective periods?</P>
    <P>Can the Minister also give us any indication of the volume of pyrites that is there?  There has been, in other countries, and in the Rio Tinto valley in particular, an obvious problem where pyrites have been allowed to accumulate.  It has become a nuisance in the area.  Is the Minister satisfied that in this case there is no danger of that and that there will be no danger, by reason of the gases, to each of the valleys concerned?</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any possible thing the House could do or should do other than to grant this money so as to keep up the development. It is money which will be advanced to the company and which will be payable by the company before there is any question of the ordinary shareholder in the company receiving anything.  I should like to know what the issue price of the ordinary shares was and what the present price is, both on a market value basis and also on a break up basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Sweetman that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste ought to be committed to read the brief from which the Minister has just read introducing this motion.  As the Deputy said, it should bring a blush of shame to the cheeks of these gentlemen.  However, I am not surprised, or indeed disillusioned. I have always regarded the Taoiseach and Tánaiste as two gentlemen extremely skilled in the international game of &ldquo;chancing your arm&rdquo;.  For over 30 years here, I have listened to the most outrageous statements and prophecies being made by these people, only to be falsified by the effluxion of time.</P>
      <P>Here is another example of the skilled arm-chancers being confused and confounded by what, in fact, is the position today.  Deputy Sweetman and I were endeavouring to have the whole code of mining taxation revised and the whole code of mining laws revised to permit of the development of the copper deposits in Avoca and elsewhere. We had literally screeches from the then Opposition Party, Fianna Fáil, that we were selling out the mine, selling out a very valuable national asset, giving it away for nothing, that we had, in fact, made a soft deal with the Canadian group who were to operate the mine.  In fact, we got them to invest, speaking now from recollection, well over £2,000,000&mdash;well over 6,000,000 Canadian dollars&mdash;in the mine.  Nobody else in the world was prepared to invest in the mine, not even people who claimed to be friends of Ireland beyond the seas and who talked about the motherland.  We could not get a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; out of them for investment in the Avoca mines.  The only group in the world prepared to invest in Avoca was the group to which we gave the lease.  We got them to invest over £2,000,000 in it.  Not only that, but to repay the £500,000 which the State had spent in exploration work there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company has run into difficulties because of the change in the price of copper.  Of course, the view of Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee, as they then were, was that the price of copper would maintain a lifelong <Col N="1308" /> high record, that we would never see copper lower than £300 or £400 per ton. They said that fortified by whatever expert knowledge they had at the time. Of course, the statement was stupid. The Canadians knew perfectly well that copper would not remain at that price.  They never financed the project on the assumption that it would remain at that price.  What happened was when they came in to negotiate about the mine, copper was.  I think, about £240 or £250 per ton.  While they were negotiating, copper prices jumped up to nearly £400 per ton. They took a lease of the mine.  As far as my recollection goes, I think they said they could make an economic proposition of it so long as the price of copper did not fall to between £220 or £230 per ton.  Unfortunately, copper prices slipped back to about £187 per ton, but are now up to £240 or £247 per ton.  Therefore, on the assumption that the ore they expected was found there, Avoca should be an economic proposition.</P>
    <P>But let me not go away from the first point, that the prophecies of the then Deputy Lemass and the then Deputy MacEntee have been completely falsified by the fact.  Copper did not remain at the high level they prophesied. It must be clear now to everybody that the lease granted to the Canadian group to operate Avoca got for this State the best possible price we could get.  Will anybody lend this company money today?  If we gave away the mine for nothing, there ought to be millions of people willing to lend money to this company, so bright was their future because of the low price at which they got the mine, according to the then Deputy Lemass and the then Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    <P>The fact is that nobody will lend them money, not even the insurance company which has apparently come to their aid.  It is not willing to lend them money unless the State comes in and gives a State guarantee to the insurance company.  Therefore, although we were supposed to have sold them a very valuable deposit at a knock-down price and to have lined the pockets of the Canadian investors with gold, we have now reached the <Col N="1309" /> position that nobody in this country, and, so far as I know, in the world, will lend them money to get over their present difficulties.  The only source from which the loan can be got is from an insurance company here which is guaranteed that it will not lose one penny because of a State guarantee behind the loan.  Surely, in any fair assessment of the situation, it must be obvious that we made the best possible bargain that could have been made in regard to Avoca?  That we got a good price and a substantial investment is proved, not only by the Minister's speech here today, but by the speech made by his predecessor when the previous loan was made available to this company.</P>
    <P>What I say is not in any sense in derogation of the company itself.  I think they have brought into Avoca the latest and best possible mining methods.  They brought in methods and processes our people never previously saw, processes and methods, in fact, which are not to be found in many other places in Europe where mining operations take place.  As far as the company is concerned, they have done their best to live up to their obligations.  So far as my dealings with them were concerned, I found them fair and honourable.  They never tried to wriggle in the slightest. They now have run into difficulties, apparently because the quality of the ore is not up to their expectations.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is prohibited from giving us some information about the content of the ore.  The ore, of course, is a lowquality ore, which is mineable and merchantable only because of the present methods of processing.  However, as a copper ore, it does not at all compare in lode with what is produced in Chile and Rhodesia.  It was believed, with the relatively high prices copper was fetching and the new methods of production of copper concentrates, it would be an economic proposition to mine the minerals at Avoca or to extract the concentrates at a price which would then enable them to be sold at an economic price and thus maintain the industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the <Col N="1310" /> Minister, if he can tell us without revealing any company secrets, what copper content the company expected to get and what copper content they got.  I should like to ascertain also what the selective mining on the west side of the Avoca River means.  I think it was stated to us&mdash;I am not sure whether it was by the Canadians or by somebody who had extensive mining knowledge&mdash;that Mianrai had not, in fact, operated on the best portion of the mineralised area, that they had by-passed a much better mineralised area than the area on which they were operating.  Does this selective mining mean that the company will operate in what was believed to be the better mineralised area or what, in fact, does selective mining mean in the context of the Minister's speech?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the exports of this company were valuable from a national point of view.  I agree that they are and I should like the Minister to tell us at this stage what the exports of the company have been in three-monthly or six-monthly periods since they went into production.</P>
    <P>The final matter for decision here is whether or not we should give this guarantee.  A great deal of money has been invested in the enterprise, a very substantial portion of it foreign money, and a fair amount of Irish money will be invested in the enterprise if for any reason the company fold up.  Nobody wants a situation of that kind to develop.  I still believe that Avoca is well worth thorough investigation and it would be commercial imprudence at this stage to stop the operations there because the going has got a bit tough financially and because of the difficulties in regard to ore which are being experienced.  It happens in many enterprises throughout the world and throughout life that difficulties arise from time to time and if they are not faced, the enterprise might collapse but, because people push on doggedly, overcoming difficulties, success which stuns the world is ultimately achieved for the record.</P>
    <P>It would be a great pity if anything should happen to suspend activities <Col N="1311" /> at Avoca.  This drive is now giving employment to 500 people there, whereas, in 1954, it was employing about 40 people, all of whom were under notice.  The arrangement was that 12 or 20 of them were to be retained as a maintenance party but the rest were to be dismissed because at that time nobody would put a penny into the mine.  It is a substantial change from the position in 1954 when 500 people are now getting well-paid employment in Avoca and to keep them off the labour exchange and to keep them from emigrating is worth a substantial risk so far as the State's finances are concerned.</P>
    <P>On balance, notwithstanding the difficulties the company have met with, the State is quite justified in giving this further guarantee.  The company on their part have met their obligations without question and their methods of production are, in my view, first-class and that is a view held by many other people who are in a much better position than I am to judge the efficacy of their mining operations.  Therefore, it is well worthwhile taking a calculated risk in a matter of this kind and I personally favour giving the guarantee for the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to indulge in the scoring of points or to be at the receiving end of points that Deputy Norton and Deputy Sweetman feel they have got home, particularly because I do not want to say anything here that might in any way prejudice the operation that is going on at Avoca.  No matter what source any opposition to the leasing of these mines to St. Patrick's Copper Mines came from, or on what it was based, during the period of office of Deputy Norton as Minister for Industry and Commerce, the fact is that to an extent the risks of this operation have come home to roost as far as the Government are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent to which investment was made by the outside body was, as Deputy Sweetman has said, in the neighbourhood of 6 million dollars.  I <Col N="1312" /> believe it did not quite reach that figure.  The State's commitments to date at least match the investment of the outside company, so that constitutes an element of risk as far as the State is concerned and a degree of backing of this enterprise but it must be remembered that it was this Government who had to take whatever risk was involved.</P>
    <P>At the time that Deputy Norton negotiated this agreement with St. Patrick's Copper Mines, it was not then envisaged that the company would have to borrow any money from this State or would have to receive any financial assistance.  The fact is that they now have to do so because they ran into certain difficulties, as has been stated.  These difficulties concerned the ore content of the material that they have been mining. I am advised that it would not be in the interests of the company to indicate what the percentage of this content is but the content in the west side, as a result of meeting with the castaway, if I may call it that, of the old borings, was considerably lower than was anticipated.  The selective mining that is envisaged means, in so far as they can do it, ignoring the mineral deposits of very low ore content and seeking only the deposits of high content.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer to what extent there is a change in the height of the scene of operation, but the fact is that they are by-passing the low grade ore.  Originally, it was thought, in the case of the old workings, that when the old operators came to the end of their operation, it was by reason of the difficulty of further borings and the lack of technical <Col N="1313" /> ability, but St. Patrick's Copper Mines have now discovered that it was not lack of technical ability alone that hindered the old operators from going further, that it was because of the lower grade material they were meeting with.</P>
      <P>However, as a result of the selective mining that it is now proposed to do and as a result of the slightly higher grade of ore which it is hoped to obtain on the east side, that is, in the Tigroney area, they hope that an amalgam of the two will give an output of ore of sufficiently high copper content to make the operations economic.  They will, of course, have the same mill and they will admix the output of the west side with the output of the east side and hope to produce material of reasonably high copper ore content.</P>
      <P>The operations on the west side will still constitute the major portion.  It is at present envisaged that it will be in the neighbourhood of four to one. I have already mentioned that it is expected to produce about 1,000 tons of ore per day from Tigroney.  Therefore, there would be 4,000 from the other side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been advised of a new lease so I take it they can operate under the existing lease. In answer to Deputy Sweetman, there is not any problem at the moment about the piling up of the pyrites.  The difficulty is finding a market.  The uses to which I referred in my opening speech are the possibility of producing sulphur from which fertiliser can be produced.  There are other by-products even of pyrites itself which may or may not be useful in the long run.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I have not got any information about the price of shares issued by St. Patrick's, but I believe they are quoted on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  I might say in that connection that it was not only in regard to any doubt about the success of St. Patrick's operating successfully as a mining company in Ireland but also to the depression which took place in recent months in stock exchanges in Canada generally that the company were faced with financial problems, and even other stocks that would be quite valuable were quoted at somewhat below ordinary prices.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked in Committee to explain the justification for taking power to sell mineral rights which are in the possession of the State and to which Section 72 relates. The sale of petroleum rights is dealt with in Section 6 and, of course, I have agreed to delete that section.  The point was that the Minister ought to secure the development of State mineral deposits by leasing rather by a sale of them to commercial interests. I think there is a mistake on the Deputy's part and on the part of any other Deputy who thinks there is any general intention on my part to sell mineral rights in the State's possession. I would agree that, as a rule, development ought to be on the basis of State lease and this would be especially true if there were obligations about compensation to previous owners of the mineral rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of taking the powers conferred by Section 72 is to enable us to surmount a particular kind of difficulty which has already occurred in practice and which may recur.  It could happen, for instance, that in a particular area which is suitable for development, about 90 per cent of the mineral rights might be in private ownership, the remaining 10 per cent being State owned.  It would be possible for the interest party to procure a State lease in respect of the mineral rights in State ownership but royalties would be payable to the Minister on the basis of the quantity of minerals produced under the State lease.  There would be obvious difficulties in determining the quantity of minerals produced in the State leasehold or <Col N="1319" /> leaseholds, if they represent no more than fragmentary areas in the middle of private leaseholds.  In a case such as this, it would be most helpful to the operator that the State should be able to sell the mineral rights and the powers contained in Section 72 would be extremely useful to deal with this kind of difficulty.</P>
    <P>It is possible that circumstances could arise in which the development of mineral resources would be dependent upon the sale by the State of mineral rights to some commercial organisation.  It might be one of the conditions of the development, for instance, imposed by the organisation that the mineral rights should be sold rather than leased.  The important thing is to secure the development of whatever mineral resources we have and there would be obvious advantages in being able to sell State mineral rights if this would promote their commercial development.  It may not, perhaps, be appreciated that comparatively extensive mineral deposits are being developed otherwise than under a State lease.  An outstanding example is the case of Castlecomer coalfield. Also, extensive areas in the Arigna coalfields are developed on a similar basis.</P>
    <P>To sum up, only in the case where, the State owns little patches of mineral rights in a wider area which is being developed and for the sake of convenience and perhaps for the sake of inducement to particular operators, the Minister might be empowered to sell these small patches to make the operation of the mines more practicable and to avoid difficulties in determining what royalties there should be when only a limited portion of the total area of operation is in State ownership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that, while we cannot do it now because of the Stage of the Bill with <Col N="1320" /> which we are dealing, he might consider between now and the Seanad sitting, putting in some provision requiring him to get a resolution passed by the House to approve a sale in such a case.  I have no doubt that the Minister will honour his obligations and I am not questioning the Minister's word but it is a wide power to give in one line and a half.  If it is used only in the circumstances explained by the Minister, I am not worried about it but in order to ensure that nothing can take place under the section without the House knowing it, would the Minister ensure that proposals for the sale of mineral rights are laid on the Table of the House or if there was anything substantial involved, that a resolution of approval would be sought in the House?  I leave it to the Minister to consider.</P>

      <P>I should like to explain in that regard that the Ambassador Oil company are quite prepared to give an extension of some months for the enactment of this legislation and they would be prepared to amend the agreement accordingly.  It is not my intention to introduce the Bill in the Seanad on this side of Christmas because I thought it would be only fair to the Seanad that they should have some reasonable time in which to debate it.  Therefore, I hope to present it to the Seanad early in the New Year and ask the Ambassador Oil company to alter the agreement as they have undertaken to do, so as to make the agreement operative provided the legislation is effective by the end of next March.</P>

It is then up to the Opposition, if there is anything amiss in the instrument, to raise it themselves. Otherwise, it goes through.  I admit that is not the customary approach of the Opposition but I believe it is a practicable and reasonable procedure and if the Minister did that, he would be meeting the House fairly.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to include as ground for compensation <Col N="1323" /> as well as damage the causing of nuisance, which was Deputy Dillon's point.  It was suggested that perhaps common law method might be sufficient, but at present the only means of avoiding a nuisance under such circumstances might be an injunction restraining any operatives from carrying on certain works which would constitute a nuisance. That would obviously be undesirable if we are to get any benefit from mineral exploration.  Therefore, it was thought more advisable to put in a provision which would provide compensation for nuisance and that provision will go right through the scale of amendments, whether it is in relation to acquisition of rights, exploration, or any other activity in relation to mineral development.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, section 2 (1), between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following new definition:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;petroleum well&rsquo; means a boring or other excavation in the earth's crust made for the purpose of extracting petroleum;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the amendment suggested by Deputy Esmonde and I do not think it is much of an improvement on what I stated to be the definition of a petroleum well, a hole in the ground made for the purpose of extracting petroleum.  Probably more flowery language is used and it now reads &ldquo;&lsquo;petroleum well&rsquo; means a boring or other excavation in the earth's crust made for the purpose of extracting petroleum.&rdquo;  I hope that meets the Deputy's point.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Minister for meeting me on this point but I find myself in a further difficulty in this matter in that, since Committee Stage, I have had information which I have checked and I understand that petroleum in America is a term for gas and that the usual term that is used is oil.  I was wondering, since there seems to be a certain amount of ambiguity in the word &ldquo;petroleum&rdquo;&mdash;it is extensively defined in the context of the Bill; I think in the first section&mdash;would the Minister think on it again and consider might it not be better to use &ldquo;oil well&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;petroleum well&rdquo;?  The definition would be exactly the same but it would cover the point completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know very little about it except what I have read but I find in Caltex and other company reports they are referred to as oil wells rather than petroleum wells.  I do not know if there <Col N="1329" /> is anything in the point, but apparently this Bill is for the purpose of dealing with an American company and I thought it might be desirable, when the Bill is considered in the Seanad, for the Minister to turn it into an oil Bill instead of leaving it as a petroleum Bill.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage, I raised a question in relation to confining the area to a quarter square mile.  I made the point that it was possible for oil to be discovered outside that area.  Oil might <Col N="1335" /> extend further than the quarter square mile and a person who was outside that area would get no compensation.  I have been informed that I am correct in what I said then, though the Minister and his advisers maintained it was not possible.  I am advised it is possible that oil may extend a very considerable distance underground.  For that reason, I should like the Minister to take a further look at the position between now and the introduction of the Bill in the Seanad to see if he could extend the area or make it possible in some way to compensate people who would have oil extracted from under their soil, although they are not in the actual area itself.

      <P>On the occasion of its adjournment, it is not unreasonable that the House should embark on some stocktaking of the general economic <Col N="1337" /> and social conditions which have emerged and with which we are now confronted.  I recall when this Government took office it was in the atmosphere of a plan announced by the Taoiseach at a meeting which he held in Clery's Restaurant.  So impressed was he with the validity of this plan, that he bespoke the cooperation of the <i>Irish Press</i> and they published it as a special supplement.  Its outstanding feature was that there was an unlimited number of millions of money to be borrowed for investment in this country, with the consequential creation of 100,000 new jobs, at the rate, I think, of 15,000 new jobs per annum.</P>
      <P>In the election that followed, Fianna Fáil harked back to those happy prognostications and confined themselves to plastering the country with posters: &ldquo;Women, vote for Fianna Fáil and get your husbands jobs.&rdquo;  That poster had two agreeable implications.  One was that the Taoiseach was &ldquo;raring&rdquo; to go, if he got the chance, and the other, and more sinister, implication was that the members of the Government then in office were relatively indifferent to the trials and tribulations of their unemployed fellow citizens, and that the economic difficulties through which the country was then passing were the responsibility of an indifferent body of men who saw their neighbours suffering and did not care.</P>
      <P>We were not concerned to say&mdash; perhaps we were not so touchy&mdash;what the Taoiseach is reported as saying last week in a reference to us as representing a banshee convention.  We did not think it was a banshee convention. We thought it was a very dishonest attempt to deceive our people and a heartless attempt to exploit the sufferings of unemployed people for the political advantage of a Party, hungry for power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think ambition is any fault in a public man.  That is why that is a charge which I have never levelled against the Taoiseach.  It burns brightly in him and indeed it should.  The person who aspires to the leadership of the public life of the country is entitled to be ambitious to serve his country and I am prepared to say that the Taoiseach is so ambitious. <Col N="1338" /> We are entitled, when he attains to the power he sought, and has had a reasonable period of three years in which to put his policies to the test, to ask him to render an account of his stewardship.  That is the purpose of this debate tonight.  The Taoiseach has had a clear majority in Dáil Éireann now for three solid years and we are entitled to look for results.</P>
    <P>I know that statisticians rejoice in preparing endless tables and I make no apology for admitting freely that, although I have as much experience of those calculations as any man, I have never got the wheel of my intelligence around the axle of a number of speculative calculations made by statisticians. When I read these tables setting out the net and gross annual product and the net and gross annual income and study closely the constituents of those calculations, they are of so ephemeral a character that I am inclined to say: &ldquo;You pays your money and you takes your choice.&rdquo;  If you are feeling gloomy, you can shift the figures and the results will be gloomy. If you shift them to a different place the whole result comes out looking rosy and lovely.</P>
    <P>It may be that the fault is in me that these types of calculations leave me in the greatest doubt as to their validity, but there is one calculation which in my experience has been in the past and will forever be, in my judgment, a fairly reliable indicator of the fundamental prosperity or imminent economic difficulty of any country, and that is a study of its physical exports and imports.  They can be measured by ascertainable methods which are clear and certain and free from equivocation.</P>
    <P>We were in office from 1954 to the Spring of 1957 and in that time the world, particularly Europe, passed through a series of great political and economic difficulties.  I think when we left office the bank rate in England was 6½ per cent. and rising. It was the highest it has ever been since the beginning of the 1914-1918 war.  I give that statistic merely as an indicator of the general economic confusion raging in Western Europe <Col N="1339" /> over that period.  Of course, it had its repercussions here, but as a result of the measures taken by the Irish Government of that day without much regard to their political popularity, we have it to tell that for the first time since the conclusion of the European war of 1939-1945 there was a credit in our balance of payments for the calendar year 1957 of £12 million.</P>
    <P>That fact I think secured and consolidated the economic foundations of this country at a time when the economic foundations in other countries were being rocked by economic events that were passing all round.  On that basis of security, I think it was legitimate to expect that real solid progress might have been built up in the years that followed on because, mind you, a credit in our balance of payments can be bought at an excessive cost.  If you secure credit in the balance of payments by no other device than shrinking the volume of your trade, especially of your exports, it may have a very undesirable result.</P>
    <P>But in the year to which I refer the volume and the value of our exports rose higher than at any time since Fianna Fáil first took office in this country in 1930.  I speak deliberately not only of the value but of the volume of our exports.  It was in that situation, a record year of exports from this country, that we secured a credit in our balance of payments of no less than £12,000,000, which is something which had not been secured before except in the years of the actual war.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the situation that has supervened since we attained that point&mdash;the maximum volume and value of exports of credit balance in our payments in 1957.  In 1958 we had retreated substantially but still there was practically no balance one way or another.  If we assume that our calculations of invisible exports at £60,000,000 per annum are consistently correct and if we come to 1959&mdash;that is the year in which we now are&mdash;the adverse balance of trade for the first ten months of this year amounts to <Col N="1340" /> £71.27 million.  By the end of this year we shall be fortunate if the adverse balance of trade is less than £80,000,000 and if we accept as the average, that our invisible exports are running to £60,000,000 or thereabouts, we shall be fortunate if we reach the end of this year with a balance of payments deficit of much less than £20,000,000 sterling.</P>
    <P>That figure standing alone, I think, will be sufficient to cause the greatest possible concern if you take that figure with the realisation that our exports are sinking steadily.  If you take that figure in the light of the fact that to-day we have no exports of butter or bacon and that our farmers will have to go back to dependence, so far as our agricultural exports go, on cattle, sheep and meat products, we are brought slap up against the very formidable question: What is going to happen to this community if for any reason we should cease to have them?</P>
    <P>I think we have lived so long in the enjoyment of the livestock exporting industry that we have never stopped to think what would happen to this country if it came to an end.  The great danger is that there are people in high places who do not understand what the livestock industry of this country means.  There are people in high places who imagine that this country might profitably exchange the traditional store cattle export trade of this country for a dead meat industry. Such people believe, because they do not understand, that there is a reasonable prospect of a dead meat industry compensating our economy for the disappearance of the store cattle trade.</P>
    <P>With that kind of mentality abroad, I look at the progress made with the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme and I ask myself whether this Government is serious in the efforts to stamp that plague out.  Have they asked themselves what will happen if the livestock trade should go?  At the present time the farmers of this country are struggling not only with the problems created for them by the task of eradicating bovine tuberculosis in cattle, but they are struggling with the fact that, since the economic war, the price of cattle has never been <Col N="1341" /> more disastrous.  There are very few farmers to-day who have made any profit out of cattle in the past twelve months.</P>
    <P>The price of sheep and lambs this year has left very little profit for any farmer who deals in them.  The price of turkeys, which, after all, is an important thing in the economy of most rural households, has been utterly catastrophic.  I do not think I am exaggerating if I say that anyone who reared turkeys this year has lost money on every bird produced.  I do not think I am being unreasonably alarmist when I say that the consequence of that will be felt not only in every house but in every rural establishment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>From the first to the last week of December, 50 to 60 per cent. of the normal Christmas trade in many departments of the rural distributive trade depends on the proceeds of the turkey market.</P>
    <P>I ask myself what are the Government doing in the light of these events. I gather the Minister for Agriculture feels that past Administrations charged themselves with too great a responsibility in the presence of facts such as these.  I do not think they did.  I think it is a source of considerable help and consolation to farmers when faced with a situation such as they are now confronted with to know that the Minister responsible for their industry is concerned about them and anxious to help in any way he can.</P>
    <P>I view with astonishment the atmosphere of sleepy inactivity which the Department of Agriculture appears to manifest to-day in the presence of what I consider to be as acute a crisis for the farmers as any I remember since the Economic War.  When I think of the reduction in the intake of milk by the creameries and translate that as nearly as I can into the reduction of a cash income to our farmers, I believe they have lost at least £2 million this year from reduced intake of milk alone.</P>
    <P>No rational man will blame the Minister for Agriculture for the type of weather we have had.  I think many <Col N="1342" /> people in the Government labour under the delusion that because the weather was fine and suitable for the seaside, everyone living on the land of Ireland had a good time.  It may astonish some members of the Government but I venture to suggest that our farmers for the past year, with all the sun and fine weather we had, had a worse time, by and large, than they had in the catastrophic wet year of 1958.</P>
    <P>The reduction in income experienced by our farmers in the past 12 months was much greater than the losses involved in the inclement harvest weather of the year before.  What causes me acute concern is that the collapse of the number of cattle exported coincides with the catastrophic fall that has taken place in prices.</P>
    <P>I do not understand fully the astonishing fall in the numbers of cattle exports.  I know there must have been a shortage of grass and feeding stuffs in Great Britain which, undoubtedly, to some extent would react on our exports of store cattle but I cannot imagine it having as much effect as it appears to have had unless something else is operating.  I ask myself, in these circumstances, what this Government intend to do or propose to do. The only clue I have to what they propose to do is a document on which they have been resting cheerfully for some considerable time, the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> to which I want to refer.</P>
    <P>Before I do that, I put it to Dáil Éireann that if we are to get the kind of expansion necessary to restore the trading position of this country, if we are to get the kind of expansion in exports requisite to put our trade in permanent and enduring balance, is there any source from which we can hope to get it other than the land?  I do not want to denigrate the possibilities of getting industrial exports from as many sources as we can, but, when you put them all together and look at the sum of nearly £50,000,000 that exports of cattle alone are worth in a given year, it must be manifest that if you really want an upward surge in exports, it is to agriculture you must look.  We are badly in need of that <Col N="1343" /> upsurge now if the present trade position is to be corrected.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any evidence of action. It is a source of amazement to me that the Government have turned their back on what I call the parish plan but which was really the germ of a national advisory service.  I do not believe we shall get the kind of expansion urgently necessary for our agricultural output unless we provide a national advisory service under the direction of the Minister for Agriculture and working in the closest cooperation with the Agricultural Institute which was recently established by an Act of this House.  If we get that and use it, valuable progress might be made in expanding agricultural output, always bearing in mind that we have to deal with the problem of marketing the product profitably, if and when we get it.  When I look at the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> for light and guidance as to what the Government themselves propose, I find that paragraph 15 refers to &ldquo;the welcome upward trend in agricultural output which has been evident in recent years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The tragedy of our position is that that welcome trend is now reversed.  I think it was there when that paper was published but it has now stopped and we are travelling in the opposite direction. I find in paragraph 17 &ldquo;Climatic and market influences combine to make grass the most important feature of Irish agriculture.&rdquo;  I welcome that conversion, I welcome the recognition of that by the leaders of the Government. It is not a very revolutionary discovery to anybody who understands the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I rejoice to find in paragraph 18 that &ldquo;we are now one of the largest users of lime per acre in Europe.&rdquo;  I need not remind the House of when we started on that road.  Up to now, nothing new is heard.  In paragraph 20, clovers are recognised as by far the cheapest source of nitrogen.  Fortunately, that wisdom was pressed home on the Government in time to prevent them from saddling us with the dearest source of nitrogen.  It is not so long since they were indignantly <Col N="1344" /> resolved in this House to spend £7 million on building a factory to produce nitrogen of the wrong kind, at the wrong price and at the wrong time.  They have changed their minds about that and I welcome that decision.  I could go through all the proposals contained in this <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and am much tempted to do so for the purpose of pointing out to the House that every single suggestion contained in Part II of this <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is in fact a reference to the proposals which were in operation when this Government came into office and which were initiated by their predecessors.  I do not think that matters so long as they are continued.</P>
    <P>I turn now to Appendix I and this provides the key to the whole mentality of the Government and the man who is Taoiseach.  Appendix I sets out the estimated net capital cost of development proposals.  Remember, this is the programme for economic national expansion.  In the first year, it envisages, in respect of the net capital cost of the development proposals in 1959-60, an outlay of £6.15 million, of which £2 million relates to agriculture, £500,000 credit provided for the Agricultural Credit Corporation and £1½ million for the subsidisation of phosphate fertiliser, but that is accompanied by a footnote to say that £500,000 will be taken from the Land Project.  For 1960-61, the total sum provided is £9.2 million, of which £2.25 million is for agriculture; for 1961-62, the sum provided is £10.58 million, of which £2.75 million is for agriculture.  In respect of 1962-63, the sum of £12.55 million is provided, of which £3.25 million is for agriculture; in 1963-64, there is £14.6 million, of which £3.75 million is for agriculture.  That gives you over the whole five-year period, of which one year has already passed, a total extra investment of £53.04 million, of which extra, £14 million is for agriculture, and of that £14 million, £7½ million is given over to the Agricultural Credit Corporation to issue to farmers if they ask for it.</P>
    <P>I turn to Appendix II which gives <Col N="1345" /> the estimate of the public capital expenditure programme from 1959-60 to 1963-64, inclusive of additional expenditure projected in the Appendix to which I have just referred.  The total expenditure over the five-year period is estimated to be £220.44 million, of which £48 million is provided for agriculture, of which £11 million is in the form of agricultural credit to be offered to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, if they can find farmers to borrow it.</P>
    <P>What shall we say of a programme for economic expansion which envisages the investment of £220 million over the next five years, out of which, in effect, £37.66 million is provided for agriculture; if you choose to add the £11 million for the Agricultural Credit Corporation, you can call that £48.66 million.  All the rest is for aeroplanes, railways, shipping, fuel and power, telephones, industry, industrial credit, tourism, ports, harbours, airports, and building and construction. Surely a Government who seriously believe that our economic problems can be resolved by a programme which is to be measured in terms of £220 million, out of which effectively £37.66 million is to be made available for agriculture, is a Government gone mad.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Government if they have considered the marketing reports which have been laid before them.  I have inquired repeatedly from the Minister for Agriculture who tells me he is preparing a White Paper and that preparation on that White Paper is going on and on and on.  He was given a report on the marketing of turkeys especially early with a view to offering some help to the producers of turkeys, but, of course, nothing whatever has been done in relation to it.  I ask if and when he proposes to make any announcement of what the Government intend to do over the whole field of marketing, because the hope of getting increased production, unless we can make it abundantly manifest to the farmers that they can sell their output, is very poor.  On the other hand, I believe if we can find the demand and take the requisite measures to smooth out violent oscillations in price and give the farmers an assurance that there will be a market for whatever <Col N="1346" /> volume of produce they extract from the land, we can easily increase our output by at least 50 per cent. and what is so vital is that if that were achieved, it could represent an increase of at least 250 per cent. in our total agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>I shall give the Taoiseach, who is very sensitive to criticism if it is not accompanied by constructive counter proposals, some proposals that may be of assistance to him and I do not think they are of the character of his assurance to us that copper would be worth £400 a ton in the foreseeable future. These are practical proposals and proposals which could be put into operation without delay.  The first is&mdash;and it astonishes me that no progress has been made in this field heretofore&mdash;to seek an agreement with the British Government of a reciprocal character which would give us a secure market in Great Britain.  I believe that agreement should go the full length of integrating the two economies of these countries.</P>
    <P>I recall that 50 years ago Norway and Sweden were amalgamated under one crown as this country and Great Britain were.  Fifty years ago, the people of Norway took the decision that that was no longer acceptable to them.  Though that decision created much heart-burning in Sweden, they divided their political institutions, established two separate Governments and became two sovereign and independent States.  In a recent publication by the Government of Norway entitled: &ldquo;The Nordic Council and Co-operation in Scandinavia,&rdquo; the following paragraph occurs on page 27:</P>
    <P>The year 1905 saw the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden, following various Norwegian steps which caused bitterness in Sweden.  Nevertheless, the statesmen of the two countries succeeded in reaching a peaceful solution to this difficult conflict, which left no lasting discord between the Norwegian and the Swedish peoples.  Nor did the conflict over the union cause any major setback in Nordic co-operation. Only two years after the events of 1905 the members of the Scandinavian <Col N="1347" /> parliaments set up their own private organization for Scandinavian collaboration, the Nordic Inter-parliamentary Union.</P>
    <P>These are the words I want to emphasise:</P>
    <P>After Norway had attained complete political independence it was in fact easier to interest the Norwegians in Scandinavian co-operation, the three peoples now meeting on an absolutely equal footing.</P>
    <P>Many difficult political decisions have had to be taken and in so far as this part of our country is concerned, in any case, we should be in a position of matching the benefits to be offered by Britain and ourselves to our mutual advantage.  The time is overdue when our Government should boldly confront that situation and seek to negotiate on the basis that it is common sense to provide the maximum resources from these two islands for the benefit of the population of each.</P>
    <P>There are 55,000,000 people living in the two islands.  We here in this island with 3,000,000 people can feed 10,000,000.  They, in the other island, with more than 50,000,000 people cannot feed 25,000,000.  Our combined resources could go, not all the way, and I do not believe the British people would want to go all the way, to provide themselves with all their requirements of feeding stuffs and food, but we could go a considerable part of the way and thereby increase the purchasing power of a community which to-day is one of its best customers in Europe, if not in the world.</P>
    <P>Surely on that basis there are grounds for the negotiation of a reciprocal trade area agreement with Great Britain.  If we were prepared to contemplate association with the Free Trade Area of Europe subject to certain qualifications it ought to be possible to negotiate at least some modification of that exhaustive agreement with our next door neighbour and it ought to be our first priority in the negotiation of markets for the products we have to sell.  I think that should be followed up by realistic inquiry <Col N="1348" /> as to the possibility of markets elsewhere and I think the first problem that that realistic inquiry will bring to our attention is the fact that there is more than one European country at the present time exporting to us five, six and ten times the quantity of goods they buy from us.  That is not due to the fact that we have not got anything that we can sell to them.  It is due to the fact that our products are greeted on their thresholds by quota restrictions whereby they positively refuse to accept our goods.</P>
    <P>I know from my own experience that in these negotiations one must be flexible and at times be prepared to accept less than one would want to receive, but there does come a time, after flexibility has been given the fullest play, when one should say to a trading partner: &ldquo;Either you are prepared to increase your purchases from us in order to restore some approximation to equality or, if unilaterally you consistently refuse to take from us what we have to sell and prefer to buy it from other sources, then the time has come when we shall restore the balance by restricting importations of your goods.&rdquo;  I think the time is overdue in respect of more than one Continental country when we should take that action.  I particularly refrain from particularising because it would serve no good purpose, but I do say that if we are to accept motor cars and cheese&mdash;and we do sometimes accept products of this sort which at first glance it seems unreasonable to ask us to accept, but in the give and take of negotiation we do it&mdash;if we have done it we are entitled to say now: &ldquo;We shall not do it any more if you are not prepared to buy back from us sufficient goods for the purpose of establishing a satisfactory balance between us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we have got to face the fact that if we want to make effective progress there must be a very substantial investment in the agricultural industry. It must be of an informed kind and it must be done with informed co-operation from the agricultural community. I think the Taoiseach may challenge me by asking: &ldquo;What are you going to do with the increased <Col N="1349" /> output?&rdquo;  I do not think the duty devolves on me in my present situation to answer that kind of question.  I am entitled to ask the question but I believe the situation to be such that I shall undertake the duty of making a concrete suggestion to the Taoiseach as to where I believe an extensive increase in our exports could be achieved forthwith and rapidly.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach might very well consider with Great Britain the question of the export of live pigs.  At present we are exporting bacon and I think we should extend and develop these exports to the limit of our capacity but that should not be the limit of our potential exports.  I believe that at present there is a shortage of pigs in Britain.  They cannot be brought in from any other country in the world except Ireland for veterinary reasons.  There was a time when we exported to Britain between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 pigs per annum.  Under the 1951 trade agreement with Britain provision was made for the export of live pigs but circumstances obtained at that time which made it expedient that these pigs be slaughtered here at the commission of the central purchasing agency then existing in Britain.  I suggest that there is scope there for immediate and dramatic expansion of our total exports.  It would involve a comprehensive agreement with Great Britain which, I suggest, is not impossible and which, I suggest, there is a grave duty on the Government to undertake.</P>
    <P>I think this country is mad if it sits back and watches the whole of Europe divide itself into two great trading areas&mdash;the six Rome trading countries and the Free Trade Area of the Seven Outer countries&mdash;and drift into the position in which we are in complete economic isolation.  If that situation is allowed to develop without our having taken precautions in advance to secure for ourselves some safe market we shall be subject forthwith to economic strangulation by anybody who wants to attempt it upon us.</P>
    <P>The time has come when that requires to be said openly, because I apprehend that this Government are, <Col N="1350" /> for their own reasons, which I do not fully understand, trying to spread a kind of artificial equanimity everywhere and to proceed, both by their spoken word and their day-to-day actions, as if it did not matter a damn to this country that the whole of Europe was dividing itself up, as it undoubtedly is.  But bad and all as we would be if Europe divided into two economic <i>blocs</i>, leaving us outside, what will be our position if they forthwith come together and form one <i>bloc?</i> Where will we turn for the means of disposing of what we have to sell?  Do not let us imagine that that will exclusively affect our agricultural exports, which, of course, it certainly will. If we should find ourselves in economic isolation outside Europe, united within a Free Trade Area or a common Market, I seriously doubt the possibility of this nation's survival economically at all.</P>
    <P>It will be a very grave reflection on those who took over the responsibility for this country in the year when our exports reached their maximum in value and in volume if we are allowed to drift quietly into a backwater and to die of economic inanition.  That is the danger with which this country is confronted at present.  It is not a danger that cannot be averted.  If this Government would show any realisation of what the situation is, I believe effective and useful measures could be taken forthwith.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Taoiseach something which simply appals me. The Taoiseach must know at present the great difficulties associated with the fourteen-day test, the herd test and all the other complications that confront the export cattle trade at present.  When, on top of that, is superimposed some deplorable domestic quarrel between the cattle dealers and the marts at which the cattle are habitually sold, how on earth can any responsible Minister for Agriculture simply sit on his sash and announce that he proposes to let things rip until somebody comes to him?</P>
    <P>Suppose neither of them comes to him?  Is he going to let these two <Col N="1351" /> bodies completely disrupt the livestock industry of this country?  Mark you, it is within their power to do that. The Dublin cattle market is already seriously upset.  The evil is spreading throughout the country.  The longer it goes on, the more insoluble and difficult of solution it becomes, because people take up positions and then find it extremely difficult to depart from them.  Surely any responsible Government&mdash;if the Minister for Agriculture will not do it, maybe the Taoiseach will?&mdash;should bring these people into the Department of Agriculture preferably, sit down and hear both sides of the question and point out the urgent necessity for the removal of such complications for the cattle industry?</P>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that if that were done, a reasonable and rational settlement of the outstanding difficulties could be arrived at.  But if it were not reasonable and proper, steps could be arranged to put an end to the position with the full authority, not only of the Government, but of this House behind them, once it was established that a full effort had been made at conciliation, which, I have not the slightest doubt, would succeed if it were undertaken forthwith.  It is a matter of acute and urgent necessity that that should be done, and the fact that it has not been done suggests to me that this Government in some way are suffering from a type of lethargy which I consider constitutes a very real danger to the whole of this country and to its economy.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I fully appreciate that, fundamental as is the importance of the agricultural industry to our whole balance of payments and trading position&mdash;I do not think that can be over emphasised&mdash;it would be ridiculous to maintain that the development of our industrial economy should be a matter of relative indifference to any responsible man.  It is of vital interest to everybody concerned with the economic welfare of this country. It has been deplorably delayed and frustrated by the whole cracked policy of economic self-sufficiency operated by the Fianna Fáil Party, which is <Col N="1352" /> now collapsing around their ears.  The trouble is that they have taken up certain positions and they find it extremely difficult to retreat from them. The whole atmosphere is thick with it.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach inaugurated this doctrine of economic self-sufficiency, one of the first things he did was to prevail upon this Parliament to pass the Control of Manufactures Act.  I think it was true of the Taoiseach that at that time he believed there were long queues of rich capitalists rushing to invest in Ireland. I think it has taken a quarter of a century for him to discover that, far from that being so, it was extremely difficult to get anybody to come in and establish industry here.</P>
    <P>We still have on the Statute Book the Control of Manufactures Act, originally designed to keep all foreign capital out of this country.  I admit that, by amendment and subsequent legislation in recent years, a great deal of the effect of that has been reduced. But surely the time has come to take our courage in our hands, abolish the whole fraud and acknowledge that we want foreign capital in this country, that we want foreign technology, that our primary concern is to get employment for our own people in their own country, that we would much sooner see industry come from Birmingham, Manchester or Pennsylvania and establish itself here in Ireland rather than see these industries draw our people out of Ireland to labour in Birmingham, Manchester and Pennsylvania?  Is it not time we faced that and said it out?  I often ask myself the question: do Deputies ever ask themselves why we want industry in this country?  I often think they do not.  I wonder would I shock anybody if I said the only reason why I want industry in this country is to see my neighbours employed at good wages in their our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it matter a hoot, provided this employment is given to our people at fair rates of wages and under decent conditions, who runs the show?  This is a sovereign Republic and we can legislate to prevent any gross abuses.  We are not living in midVictorian days when the sweatshop and exploitation were lawfully possible in a civilised community.  All that belongs to yesterday.  We want to get established here industries which will employ our people under decent conditions in their own country.  What is the essential prerequisite of getting that done on an expanding scale?  Is it not the attainment of markets into which the output of this industry can be sold at a profit?  Do we not know ourselves that, with our own best endeavours, we here in Ireland encounter very special difficulties in breaking into the very large industrial markets where the large output of industry in international trade can be absorbed?  We all know that if some genius produces some exceptional specialist article for which there is a world demand in a highly selective trade, he will be able to sell his product because people will beat a footpath to his door owing to the uniqueness of his product but that is not the kind of industry that will employ large numbers of our people at decent rates of wages in their own country.</P>
      <P>Think of what it requires to get employment for 10,000 men in industry in this country.  Think of ten factories each employing 1,000 men.  They would be very large enterprises from our point of view but chicken feed from the point of view of the great industrial combines of the world, and I am never tired of pointing it out to this House and I point it out to it again.  I had the experience of seeing a first-class factory in this country that was producing a first-class product from domestic raw materials and employing a very considerable number of people&mdash;men&mdash;at decent wages under decent conditions.  The product of that factory was submitted to the test of international standards and met it handsomely but the fact remained that its produce piled up and could not be sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> I was myself approached to know if I would give assurances, as Minister for Agriculture, in regard to supplies of raw material to a big international corporation engaged in the same trade &mdash;Bowaters&mdash;and fortunately, with the collaboration of my colleague, Deputy Blowick, we were able to give the guarantees that were required. Bowaters came in and associated themselves with that enterprise.  Within 12 months, the entire accumulated stocks were marketed.  They have since doubled their output and, I believe, contemplate increasing it again.  The whole marketing difficulty has finished. Why?  Because Bowaters have a marketing organisation in existence all over the world into which they simply poured the product of the installation here which, from the point of view of their total output, was a mere drop in the bucket.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why it is not possible to seek similar enterprise in other lines of production and I believe it could be done if we went the right way about it but I am bound to say that if we spend much more time at the United Nations with our present Minister for External Affairs, I do not know where we shall go to get the kind of co-operation I think we stand in need of at the present time.  I am sure the poor man was well-intentioned but since he turned up in New York, it is sufficient for any traditional friend of Ireland to appear in discussion at that council table for our Minister for External Affairs to take the earliest possible opportunity of kicking him in the stomach.</P>
    <P>It is true that, as a result of alienating the United States of America, as a result of kicking France in the stomach and as a result of giving the Union of South Africa a swift kick on the shin, we have secured the undying friendship of the Dalai Lama, and I am glad to have it.  I think the Dalai Lama is entitled to the sympathy and respect of every independent nation.  But, I have always understood that the purpose of diplomacy was to serve the vital interest of my own country and it seems to me that the vital interest of Ireland is to multiply the number of our friends among the <Col N="1355" /> nations of the world.  Apply that foot rule to test the activities of our Minister for External Affairs at the United Nations and I invite the Taoiseach to say does he consider that our foreign policy has been a success.</P>
    <P>There are many Deputies who think that foreign policy is a kind of nice game that you play in Iveagh House, at cocktail parties in New York and at luncheons and dinners in Paris, Rome and elsewhere and that it is entirely divorced from the practical day to day life of our people.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We want help from our neighbours and we are not the only country which wants help.  The United State of America is as busy as a bee making friends for itself, sending its Vice-President all over South America and, when he is mobbed, finding out what gave rise to the misunderstanding and trying to put it to rights; sending the highest officers of the State on trips all over the world and sending, at this time, the President of the United States of America to visit countries as far away as Afghanistan.  For what purpose?&mdash; to make friends for America.</P>
    <P>America is a big, powerful country. You have to be a little member of the society of nations, like ourselves, to be able to afford a Minister for External Affairs like ours.  He does not go travelling all around the world to make friends for Ireland; he goes to New York in order to take the United States of America out by the lug and make it stand in the corner and tell it where it went wrong.  When he is finished with them and has put the dunce's cap on their heads, he calls out France and says, &ldquo;You are going to get into trouble, fidgeting around with an atomic bomb.  I know what is good for you.  Go home, de Gaulle.&rdquo;  But, of course, de Gaulle does not go home but the Press of the city of Paris say very plainly and bluntly what they think of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Then, when we are finished with them, we call up South Africa.  I am sure Dr. Browne was delighted and <Col N="1356" /> thought we were very well advised to give them a slight lecture on how to deal with their racial problem.  We may have our own personal views about many problems in the Union of South Africa.  It could happen that we might have a solemn duty to go on record on matters arising there but it would suit us better to apply ourselves first to the task of multiplying our friends before we start on the unrewarding task of trying to reform the few who are left to us.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more disagreeable, no one from whom we flee more expeditiously, than the frank friend, the person who is always protesting that he loves you dearly but would like to tell you that your face is dirty, that you are ugly, badly dressed and do not walk well and that it would be better for you if you changed the way you went on.  We all say of that person: &ldquo;That is a most edifying man but God deliver me from him&rdquo; and, if he is peculiarly good&mdash;I cannot imagine anyone saying this in contemplation of our Minister for External Affairs but the most charitable of the United Nations must have said some time, as they looked down on him telling them what the moral law was: &ldquo;To live with the saints in Heaven is glory but to live with them at the United Nations is quite another story&rdquo; and certainly we are getting the backlash from that disaster, and he is a disaster.  Our Minister for External Affairs is a disaster and I suggest to the Taoiseach that he take the earliest possible opportunity to make him the Tánaiste or anything else he likes if he could wean him out of his perennial expeditions to New York.</P>
    <P>Why have I dwelt on this at such length?  It is because I feel that it is from our associate members of the United Nations and our associates in the O.E.E.C. that we might reasonably look, not for financial help for we do not want that&mdash;we are almost in the unique position in the world that we do not want money from anybody, and that is something for which we should be profoundly grateful&mdash;but we do want technical know-how and we do want access to markets which are being furnished at the present time by great <Col N="1357" /> industrial enterprises of France, of Great Britain, of the U.S.A. for historical and geographical reasons, which make our entry into these markets peculiarly difficult, whereas for them it is relatively easy.</P>
    <P>It would be of immense assistance to us if we could persuade certain industrial units in these countries to establish branch factories here.  Let us presume that we persuaded ten such industries to establish factories here, giving employment in the order of 1,000 men each.  But that is not all.  I think that would be an immensely valuable first step, but, in my judgment, it would be only a first step, because I believe that around each of these establishments there would arise a whole group of relatively small Irish industries engaged in the business of supplying, at economic rates, the components for the larger industrial units primarily concerned with the export markets into which we cannot, at the present time, make our way.</P>
    <P>That hope is intimately associated with an improvement in our international relations which should be the concern of the Minister for External Affairs to promote.  I think he has made a &ldquo;hames&rdquo; of that part of the business.  I do not despair, despite his unfortunate <i>démarche</i>, that something along these lines might be done. I want to suggest that we are building up a whole network of grants, allowances and complications which, because we have enacted them and debated them in this House, we understand and which of course strangers, if they come to inquire, can understand after they have been explained to them.  But I think the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will agree that for strangers coming in here to tread their way through the whole maze of rules and regulations that we have now enacted in connection with industrial grants and inducements, is quite a formidable assignment.  No ordinary board of directors could make them out without getting expert advice.</P>
    <P>I think we have ready to hand a device which is perfectly simple and which would present a prompt and <Col N="1358" /> attractive inducement to any foreign firm which establishes itself here.  I may be wrong.  I may have a blind spot in regard to this but I cannot see that there is any disadvantage, from the point of view of the Irish Exchequer, or the Irish economy, if we said to any firm who came in: &ldquo;In respect of any building or machinery which you may instal, we will give you a 20 per cent. depreciation allowance for five years, until it has completely depreciated&rdquo;.  I think that is simple.  I think it is attractive and it gives the entrant a virtual assurance that his capital is safe.  He will get it back unless the thing collapses at once and presumably he will not establish it if it is going to collapse immediately.  It also gives us the guarantee that after recovering his capital and operating the enterprise for five years, if he wants to withdraw, he leaves after him the capital investment which he originally made.  It is highly unlikely that he will do that but if he does, and if we believe he does it from some ulterior motive, we always have the opportunity of carrying on where he left off.</P>
    <P>The simplest board of directors could understand that.  I mention it because I consider it would be something of consequence and importance and especially in the light of the figures which so greatly irritated the Taoiseach when I quoted them.  I can only quote the figures I am given.  Recently in this House the Taoiseach was asked what were the numbers of people actually working in insurable employment each year to the most recent available date.  I have since got the figures for 1954 and 1955.  They were not included in the series which the Taoiseach gave but the calculations were made on the same basis.</P>
    <P>My reference is volume 177, column 885, for the four last numbers in the series which I now read out.  In 1954, the figure was 490,000; in 1955, it was 500,000; in 1956, it was 501,000; in 1957, it was 486,000; in 1958, it was 465,000; and in 1959, it was 460,000. I said recently in public that, so far as I could read those figures, they represented a decline of 40,000 in the number of people in insurable employment. <Col N="1359" /> That caused the Taoiseach great exasperation and resentment but I am going to say now that they not only represent a reduction in people employed in this country but that figure is to be read in conjunction with the figures provided in the British House of Commons which suggest that over that period more than 50,000 of our people emigrated to Great Britain. In one year, something like 40,000 are calculated to have gone to Great Britain.  I wonder over those six years how many have gone?  Certainly if you were to judge by the atmosphere obtaining in the part of rural Ireland where I live, I would say that 20 per cent. of the population in that area have gone.  That is 20 per cent. of the total population, but a much higher percentage of the working population have gone from it in the past five years and that is manifestly evident on any fair or market day if you enter a town in that area.</P>
    <P>Those are alarming figures and they are figures that call for energetic action.  I believe the action is available to us which should do much to set these things right, if we embarked upon them.  Certain preliminary measures are requisite to make them effective.  One is to establish good relations with our neighbours, which is the duty of the Minister for External Affairs.  The other is to obtain markets in which we could possibly dispose of our increased production. A trade agreement with Great Britain is the essential prerequisite, followed by such ancillary agreements as we could get with other countries.  No other country can ever have for us a tithe of the value of the British market, which was for so long despised in this country.</P>
    <P>I cannot conclude this inquiry from the Government as to what they propose to do without recalling the condition of the fishing industry at the present time.  I have a special interest in the fishing industry because I was Minister for Fisheries and I first entered public life as a member for Donegal.  Am I right in believing that the Government have been effectively <Col N="1360" /> cured of what I describe&mdash;with no intention of being disrespectful&mdash;as &ldquo;Bartley's follies&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>On the last occasion when I was Minister for Fisheries, I had the three old wrecks on my hands down at the North Wall which Deputy Bartley bought when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands. They are still floating around.  I could never get them all to sea at the same time because whenever one went to sea, the other broke down and at one crucial stage the engine fell out of the bottom of one of them.  Incidentally, part of the stock I had at Killybegs was an engine which somebody bought for one of them and which did not fit it when it arrived.  I had that on hands also.  When I left office, they were still floating about at the North Wall and I had given instructions to sell them to the highest bidder.</P>
    <P>When I went into Opposition, I do not know who succeeded Deputy Bartley in his former post but it was announced that the three old wrecks were to be revived and made the foundation for&mdash;it was Deputy Childers, of course&mdash;a grand new campaign greatly to increase the fishing intake of the country.  They were all to go to sea.  Quite recently, I heard one of them was on the rocks and two of them on the stocks for sale and my hopes are rising again that this Government have come to realise that our fishing industry is of very real value to our people, so long as it is established firmly on the foundation of the owner fisherman and that the moment we go into the business of sending trawlers to sea to flood the domestic market, we are throwing something away of infinite value and acquiring something which can never be of any industrial value.</P>
    <P>I know there are some poor innocents here who say that if Norway and Iceland can live on their catches of cod, why could not Ireland do so? Because cod means a different thing in Ireland from what it means there. &ldquo;Cod&rdquo; here means Bartley's three navies; &ldquo;cod&rdquo; in Norway and Iceland means white gold.  Why?  Because the continental shelf runs all along the <Col N="1361" /> coast of Norway and Iceland and the temperature of the sea around Norway and Iceland is as near freezing point as it can be without freezing solid. We are sitting in the middle of the Gulf Stream and our Continental shelf is 150 miles west and south of our coast.  Our circumstances and conditions are entirely different from those in the Scandinavian countries.</P>
    <P>We have something that is of immense value and despite all that Deputy Childers has ever said in this House we are never going to make any material contribution, in my judgment, to exports or international trade but it is going to keep hundreds of families that were traditionally associated with this industry in a decent standard of comfort in their own homes and it is going to provide a market for boat-building facilities and a boatbuilding trade which will mean the difference between emigration and a living at home for a great many people in the inaccessible parts of this country. It will enable persons to obtain highly skilled training for those who want to go and assures for them employment of a decent standard as shipwrights, if they want to leave and seek industrial employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>All that has value if the whole codology of destroying owner fishermen is not persisted in as Deputy Bartley and Deputy Childers apparently want to do.  I hope and pray that with the nitrogen factory, the trawlers will be laid to rest also. I wish the Taoiseach all the success that can attend his efforts in getting a fair and equitable price for these three hulks when he goes to sell them.  I assure him of the cordial collaboration of this side of the House in any measures he can take aimed at promoting the interests of the fishing industry from our own shores.  I assure the Taoiseach that I am not pessimistic about our future.  I have always believed and have often been rebuked for excessive optimism in my estimate of what could be done with the land of Ireland.  I think the event has amply justified the most extreme optimism I was ever heard to express.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was very shortly in office attending a luncheon on a <Col N="1362" /> cattle boat at the North Wall and the proprietor of that boat made some polite suggestion that it would be well to hope that some day the capacity of that vessel would be taxed.  I remember earning some criticism by saying that our purpose was not to tax the capacity of that vessel but to tax the capacity of this and many more in carrying livestock of this country to the markets of Great Britain.  Within relatively few years, we had achieved that objective and, as it seemed to me, to be well on the highway to going much further.</P>
    <P>I believe we have immense capacity here if we are prepared to use it.  I believe there is a fair prospect before our people if we have the courage and common sense to realise it.  I believe that unlike the great industrial nations of the world, we are blessed by the fact that our future is indissolubly associated with the land.  I believe that places no embargo whatever on a very considerable volume of the most desirable kind of industrial development at the same time.  But those who forget the land put this country in precisely the same danger as that into which Newfoundland staggered ten short years ago.  How many Deputies recall that Newfoundland was an independent nation depending for its economy on the sea but they got too &ldquo;grand&rdquo; in Newfoundland to exploit and develop their fishing industry as should have been done.  They turned their mind away from the fundamental industry that Providence had endowed them with and concentrated all their energy in attempting rapidly to industrialise a country that had not got, without its fisheries, the economic foundation to sustain an industrial superstructure.</P>
    <P>Where did they end?  They ended with three British Treasury Commissioners. Finally, by electing to surrender their sovereignty to the Federation of Canada, they found their way back through becoming a Federal province of Canada.  We have no federation to which, with dignity, we can turn.  We have chosen&mdash;I think, rightly, with our history behind us, politically to walk alone.  We made that choice freely by Act of this <Col N="1363" /> Parliament and let us not forget it was by the free Act of this Parliament we made that choice.  It would be a dreadful humiliation if, having made it, we were constrained to reverse it.  It is in our power to avoid that humiliation and to prove that a country like ours can maintain the very high standards that we have and make them available to more and more of our people who choose to stay.  If we fail, we have no one but ourselves to blame.  If we continue as we are going, I am desperately apprehensive that we shall fail.  I would far sooner see this Government succeed than give it to our enemies to say the whole nation failed to justify its destiny.  If this Government do not feel equal to the task, if this Government entertain the fear, which some of the recent pronouncements of the Taoiseach would suggest, to disturb their sleep, then I suggest to them they throw in their hand and they will find there are people left in the country who are prepared to take up the burden and make a success of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of his supporters were expecting Deputy Dillon on that occasion to declare what his policy would be as Leader of the Opposition. I have heard that many of the Fine Gael supporters having read the Deputy's pronouncements, made as a result of his deliberations during that weekend, were gravely dissappointed but, nevertheless, some of them looked forward to this debate to hear that perhaps at last he would give them that gleam of hope that would enable them to look to the future possibility of a Fine Gael Government, with some degree of confidence.  In so far as I read his Malahide speech I think what he has said here this evening is to a large extent a rehash of that and, therefore, so far as he disappointed his supporters at Malahide he will have disappointed many more of his supporters here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> He was, however, reasonably comprehensive, as one would expect the Leader of the Opposition to be in such a case as this, and he did make fundamental assertions with which I do not believe anybody could quarrel.  One, of course, was that our economy depended largely on the success that we can make of our agricultural industry. Nobody can quarrel with such an assertion and I want to assure him that so far as this Government are concerned they have no intention of following the example which he gave us by way of analogy of Newfoundland.</P>
    <P>However, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, it will be my function to deal to some extent with our industrial progress and the fact that I shall do so does not, and should not, lend any force to his implied suggestion that this Government have not got a full appreciation of the importance of our agricultural industry.  I had to leave the House shortly after Deputy Dillon began to speak and, as far as I could gather during the couple of minutes I did hear him, he prefaced his remarks with the theme: &ldquo;There are lies, damn lies and statistics.&rdquo; Of course he later came to using certain statistics to help establish a point he tried to make in relation to the employment figures over the last seven or eight years.</P>
    <P>Many of Deputy Dillon's colleagues put questions on the Order Paper yesterday which were intended to provide ammunition for the purposes of this debate.  Many of those questions, I think, had a boomerang effect on the people who put them.  They tried to establish the contention that has been repeated so often that there has recently been a 40,000 decrease in the numbers gainfully employed.  I should like to remind them that 40,000 decrease happened during the period towards the end of 1956 and early 1957, when the weekly Statistical Bulletins in relation to employment that were issued by the Central Statistics Office showed the number on the live register of those unemployed to range between 94,000 and 95,000. Anybody who cares to look at these figures at this stage will find what I have said is correct, and it was in that <Col N="1365" /> 94,000 or 95,000 that the reduction of 40,000 in the numbers employed was reflected.</P>
    <P>This was a very quick trend that happened in 1956 and early 1957.  As the Taoiseach pointed out yesterday in reply to questions put by Opposition Deputies, that trend was checked by 1958, and since then the trend has been reversed and the employment figures have been going upwards.  He took for example the sale of insurance stamps as a basis and these show that for the nine months ending 30th December, of this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If we take a shorter period, the six months' period ending on the 30th September of this year, the increase was 17,052, and if the shorter period in relation to the longer period is any indication it must mean the rate of increase has accelerated.</P>

      <P>These figures relate to all persons in insurable employment, and if I take the category of workers with whom I am more directly concerned as Minister for Industry and Commerce, those engaged <Col N="1366" /> in the industrial production of transportable goods, I think I can show the same trend is reflected.  If I take the three years 1957, 1958 and 1959, the numbers of persons employed in industries producing transportable goods have been as follows: in the first quarter of 1957, 147.2 thousand, and that has been rising gradually over each quarter of 1957, 1958 and 1959 to a figure of 156,000 at the end of the third quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>The increase, happily, has been steady if not spectacular, ranging from 147.2 thousand in 1957 to 150,000, 151,000 and 152.1 thousand in the remaining three quarters of that year.  At the end of the fourth quarter in 1958 it was 152.5 thousand and, as I said, at the end of the third quarter of this year 156,000.</P>
      <P>These figures are borne out also by the volume of production in industries producing transportable goods.  If we take the year 1953 as the base year, and take the figure 100 as a base, the industrial production of transportable goods at the end of the fourth quarter of 1958 was 110.2, an increase of over ten per cent., and at the end of the third quarter in 1959, 115.9, an increase of almost 16 per cent.</P>
      <P>The index of the volume of production, incidentally, for the September quarter of 1959 was the highest ever recorded in any corresponding period of any previous year.  I should like to remind the House that I am referring now to the volume and not to the value.  No regard need, therefore, be had in this context to increasing values of goods or the falling value of money.  Much of this industrial expansion is reflected in exports of industrial transportable goods. These stood at roughly £17,500,000 last year.  In the current year there is expected to be an increase of some £6,000,000, or roughly an increase of about 30 per cent.  It is expected that that increase will continue apace into 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of new industrial concerns and extensions to existing concerns has shown a remarkable increase in the current year.  The total of these <Col N="1367" /> which commenced production in the period on 1st October, 1958, to 30th September, 1959, was 92.  The figure for new factories in the course of construction was 26 in the current year; during the same period in 1958 the figure was 16.  The locations of these new industrial undertakings are again happily widely flung, ranging from Dublin to Donegal, where there are two factories in course of construction at Ards and Killybegs, to Scariff in County Clare, Wexford, Ennis, Tralee, Killarney, and Kilsaran, Co. Louth.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I have not got the particulars.  These are just the locations.  Normally, I hesitate to give figures on occasions like this because they tend to confuse the issue. From now on, I shall try not to refer to statistics in order to illustrate that there is and continues to be an upward trend&mdash;a trend we hope will continue&mdash;in industrial production.</P>
      <P>The references I have made are to private enterprise.  In State-sponsored concerns, or concerns in which there is direct State participation, there is evidence of increased expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann Teo. have decided to embark on the processing and export of fruit and vegetables. The intention of Irish Steel Holdings to expand and modernise their plant has already been announced, and their proposals are under detailed consideration at the moment.  To a smaller extent, we have the prospect of State industrial expansion in the West of Ireland, in a form that has been much criticised by the Opposition in general and by Deputy Dillon in particular.  I refer to Mín Fhéir Teoranta.  It is hoped that, side by side with the Peatland Development Station, this company will expand and develop the opportunities of employment in that part of the country.  The Avoca copper mines, as was indicated here to-day by the approval of a Scheduling Order to the State Guarantees Act, were <Col N="1368" /> assisted to the extent of over £500,000 by a State guaranteed loan to make their works more economic and, incidentally, to expand their output.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggested, while he did not appear to criticise in any way our policy of giving industrial grants, that other means might be more fruitful for the purpose of inducing foreign industrialists into this country.  I shall refer later to his comments on our policy of protection.  Industrial grants which have been approved of since August of this year amount in all to some £721,000 involving a capital outlay on industrial proposals of something in excess of £2,015,000.  I recently had the opportunity of giving the breakdown figures of those likely to be employed in these industries when they are in production, having regard to the amounts already spent or the amounts committed for grant purposes. The figures are 4,500 and of that 4,500 the proportion is two to one of male labour against female labour.  That, I think, is a happy balance.</P>
    <P>These are the figures directly available to me.  There are, too, general trends indicating that there is an expansion all along our industrial front and that there is a greater degree of confidence amongst those who finance and undertake industrial proposals.  If we take the manner in which that confidence is reflected in the willingness of people to spend their money on goods other than essential goods, and if we look at car sales, for instance, we see that there was an increase of 30 per cent. in the sales of new cars this year as compared with last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Related to some extent to hire purchase, but, unless people have confidence in themselves to make hire purchase repayments, they obviously will not embark on an expenditure which might be described in some respects as an extravagance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bank credit has increased.  Perhaps the increase in bank credit has assisted <Col N="1369" /> increased purchases of motor cars and other non-essential goods.  Bank credit increased in the past year to almost £20,000,000, an increase of 10 per cent. Of that £20,000,000 it is estimated that about £10,000,000 has been diverted to the farming community.  I suggest the farming community have not been spending these credits on the purchase of motor cars alone.  They must indicate to the banks the extent to which they are prepared to put these loans to productive purposes.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to read yesterday the annual report of the Cork Chamber of Commerce.  I am sure I shall be forgiven if I refer to it.  I know I am Minister for Industry and Commerce for the entire country, but the welfare of Cork is naturally very dear to me.  I was very happy to read in the annual report, which, I think, will be read at the meeting to-night, a reference to the various new industrial projects undertaken throughout the city and county of Cork in recent months.  The report says: &ldquo;All these will add substantially to the forward march which is in evidence in all spheres&rdquo;.  I know the man who wrote that report.  I know he is a man of good economic standing and that he writes such matters from a very objective point of view.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is an indication&mdash; and it has been borne out not only by the facts but by the trends and the air of confidence that people display&mdash; that there is expansion; that there is room for greater expansion, that the people have confidence in themselves that they are able to take advantage of such industrial expansion; and have confidence in whatever moneys they are prepared to put into Irish industry.</P>
    <P>In referring to that, I should like to mention the extent to which the Industrial Credit Company have been put into new funds by the enactment of the Industrial Credit Act, 1959, which authorised that company to increase their share capital from £5,000,000.  Their borrowings which hitherto were limited to £5,000,000 were also increased.  The share capital <Col N="1370" /> of the company increased to £10,000,000 and the amount which might be borrowed with the consent, or under the guarantee, of the Minister for Finance was increased to £15,000,000, making available to the Industrial Credit Company a total of £25,000,000 in all for investment, for loan, or for advances by way of hire purchase to industrial undertakings.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that as a result of that no sound industrial project need suffer from lack of capital in this country.  That has been interpreted rather loosely.  Many people felt their own particular industrial proposal was soundness itself, and some people, to my knowledge, have been disappointed, but by and large, the Industrial Credit Company are liberal in their application of these funds and, being a board of experts, they must assess each application on its merits and only on what are, in their opinion, sound projects, do they feel justified in making advances.</P>
    <P>If I may refer to an announcement I made last week-end, an increase in the money available for investment was provided by the agreement come to with the British life offices, an agreement which will divert £2,000,000 per year more in funds to investment in industry and other proposals in this country in the future.  It will take some years to reach that stage but the British life offices have agreed to increase their investment in this country progressively, out of their liabilities to their Irish policy holders to that extent.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to a number of activities which have been taking place in the past year, and in perhaps less recent times, which are designed to assist industrial expansion. Córas Tráchtála were established some years ago but by reason of their lack of security of tenure, they found they were, to a degree, inhibited in their work and that was reflected in the results that were achieved, good though they were.  As a result of their being established as a full statutory board, they now feel they can extend with greater advantage all advances and assistance they provide to industrialists <Col N="1371" /> for the export of goods from this country.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I should like to refer to what Deputy Dillon has just said about our foreign trade imbalance. The Taoiseach has already announced that this is a matter which is being reviewed because, as Deputy Dillon has also just said, that imbalance is reflected in many cases in a ratio of three to one, five to one, and even seven or eight to one against us, in some cases.  I should like to mention that before General de Gaulle ever thought of producing his own atom bomb, and before the Minister for External Affairs, in the interests of world peace, ever advised that no new powers ought to acquire, or experiment with, an atom bomb, we had difficulty in breaking down the French quota wall.  Long before the Minister for External Affairs went to the United Nations this year, our negotiations for a review of our trading agreement with France were broken off because of the intransigence of the French position.</P>
    <P>The negotiations which have been initiated with Britain, and which will shortly be resumed, will have full regard to the possibilities there are for the expansion of trade between our two countries, to our mutual advantage.  I should like to say that while Britain is our best customer, we, too, are a very good customer indeed of theirs&mdash;in the European continent, we are their best customer &mdash;for industrial goods, so it is not with any degree of empty-handedness that we need enter these negotiations.</P>
    <P>I referred to the establishment of Coras Trachtála as a statutory body. That, in itself, will not achieve a spectacular increase in our export markets but at least it gives the nucleus of an organisation which will give the necessary assistance.  There have been complaints for a number of years that our industrialists have not been taking advantage of the services provided by our Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  As has been announced, the Institute is being reorganised. Their premises are being extended in <Col N="1372" /> order to provide greater facilities for assistance to Irish industrialists.  I hope to be announcing shortly the intention of the Institute to come more closely to the assistance of individual firms in any manufacturing difficulties they may encounter.</P>
    <P>Technical assistance grants were initiated some years ago and are still being availed of by firms who realise the value of getting foreign know-how, of getting in experts to advise them in running their firms&mdash;even those firms which have a high degree of productivity already.  All these assistance projects and facilities come, perhaps, at the end of our industrial pattern.  It is as well that it has been realised that the initial stage of our industrial productivity and industrial ability must be looked after as well.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Oireachtas passed the Apprenticeship Act of 1959.  That Act aims at providing more satisfactory apprenticeship schemes designed to raise the scale and the standards of Irish industry.  Everybody realises that our industrialisation programme has reached the stage where further expansion depends on our ability to find export outlets for some of the goods we produce.</P>
    <P>There is no use tilting at windmills. I do not think we can say that we can hope in the foreseeable future to compete with the larger and more industrialised countries of the world for export markets in mass-produced goods.  Of course, we have industries that have long export traditions.  I am sure that they are making every effort to step up the level of their exports but the main purpose of achieving a significant expansion in industrial exports is in finding markets for speciality products.</P>
    <P>Some of our industries producing goods that require a high degree of skilled workmanship are already exporting very successfully and some are even achieving greater success than perhaps might have been envisaged in that direction.  I believe that the markets for a substantially increased volume of such exports are to be won. If they are to be won in the face of growing competition, every effort must <Col N="1373" /> be made to bring the industries concerned to the highest pitch of efficiency.</P>
    <P>First, we must ensure that they will not be short of highly trained workers in the critical years that lie ahead.  I believe that the framework of the present Apprenticeship Act will not only ensure the standards of craftsmanship required but will ensure also that the number of operatives in each of these specialised trades will be sufficient to produce the speciality goods on which we are placing so much hope for the expansion of industrial exports.</P>
    <P>Before I leave that, I should like to refer to Deputy Dillon's suggestion that to allow a 20 per cent depreciation for a period of five years would be a more effective inducement to foreign companies to set up here than we have at the moment.  I do not suppose that he envisaged industries being set up <i>ab initio</i> when, perhaps, even in the first five years, 20 per cent would mean very little to them having regard to the fact that they might take that time to get going on a worthwhile basis for the purpose of making a profit.</P>
    <P>May I refer to his remark that our policy of protection has been daft?  I believe that, without that policy of protection, we would not have the nucleus of industries here which, having commanded the necessary bases on the home market, would enable them to go into the export market to find an outlet for their products.</P>
    <P>I believe, too, that the coming of the Free Trade Area and of a Common Market would have very little effect on our industrial front, were it not for that policy of protection.  We would not have any industrial output and we would have no factories if such a policy of protection had not been pursued down through the years.  However, the policy of protection is still there but our industrialists are alive to the possibility that they will, perhaps, have to rely less and less on such a policy.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note that the Federation of Irish Industries have already taken steps to ensure that we can, by <Col N="1374" /> an increase in productivity or by a system of rationalisation amongst ourselves, be better equipped to meet whatever changes the future years might bring in the form of industrial production.  I mentioned the Apprenticeship Act as a means of ensuring a greater degree of efficiency in our industry.</P>
    <P>We have, too, taken part in a number of other activities, such as the establishment of a Committee of Human Sciences which is an offshoot of the European Productivity Agency. The main functions of that committee are to promote research into human problems which arise in industry as a result of technological and other changes and to co-operate with the European Productivity Agency in the overall programme which this agency has undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Human Sciences Committee had a symposium in Dublin which was attended by manufacturers, workers and their representatives.  I am told by those who attended it that it is something which, taken seriously and with the necessary enthusiasm, is bound to assist us in our efforts to achieve greater productivity from our workers.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House much longer but I should like to refer, before I close, to industrial relations.  In the first instance, I should like to point out that, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach stated in reply to a question to-day, there is a reduction of some two per cent. in the cost of living over a recent period.  The consumer price index, taking 100 as a base in mid-August 1953, increased to 116.9 in midNovember last year.  In mid-August of the current year, that was reduced to 115.6.  Therefore, whatever the present trend the demands of individual unions for increased wages as related to it cannot be related to an increase in the cost of living over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>We are, however, at the present time going through what is a rather difficult period in wage adjustments but I am confident that both sides will deal with the problems and continue to deal with the problems that will arise in a responsible way and will avail to the full of the services of the Labour <Col N="1375" /> Court.  The Labour Court has come in for some comment as a result of the recent petrol strike.  It was suggested that there should be some form of appellate tribunal set up.  If such an appellate tribunal from the awards of the Labour Court were set up, one might contemplate the immediate abolition of the Labour Court itself.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made that the Government should step in here and there when an award of the Labour Court proved unacceptable.  The Taoiseach and I, having discussed the situation that arose over the recent petrol strike, decided that the situation was grave enough to intervene but only in such grave circumstances would it be necessary and desirable for the Government to intervene, after the Labour Court had made an award. I might say, too, that there appeared to be a new issue following the Labour Court award and to that extent the exceptional step was taken by the Taoiseach of requesting the parties to negotiate under a chairman supplied by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  But I am suggesting that that is not a practice that should be lightly undertaken or followed too readily, if at all.  The parties should, in so far as they can negotiate, produce agreement amongst themselves. Only in the event of failure to reach agreement amongst themselves should they have recourse to the facilities offered by the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest that, in their negotiations for any increases, the parties on both sides might have some regard to the relation of wage increases to productivity.  I think this matter up to the present has not met with the attention it deserves.  If we are to progress to any extent industrially and to maintain our competitive position in overseas markets it is essential that both employers and workers should come together to reach a practical working formula on this subject in their own and in the national interests.</P>
    <P>The award of the Labour Court should be the final award and should be accepted in so far as it can be accepted.  To suggest that there should be a tribunal over and above <Col N="1376" /> the Labour Court is a vote of no confidence in the Labour Court.  So long as we have the Labour Court we have a very useful instrument in industrial disputes.  Since we have had the Labour Court, our record of strikes compares very favourably with the incidence of strikes in European countries. The Labour Court has intervened to very good effect.  It has avoided industrial disruption to a considerable degree and to the benefit of the whole economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of statistics in a debate such as this can be of considerable assistance.  I do not see the need for the hesitancy of some of my colleagues when discussing their usefulness in surveying the general economic situation and the Government's record in the past two and a half years. The use of figures recently published is important in that we and the country as a whole can understand and appreciate the economic circumstances and the problems which face us.</P>
      <P>The figures recently published in the <i>Statistical Survey for</i> 1958 and in the <i>Trend of Employment and Unemployment</i> paint a picture that is gloomy and depressing.  It is depressing when it is realised that the national wealth has been stagnant and has indeed been declining.  The figures for the gross national product at constant market prices show, with 1953 as the base of 100, that there was some increase between 1953 and 1955 to 103 and that last year, three years later, it declined again to just above 100. In the past five years, no significant progress was made in our industrial wealth and in the past three years there has been a decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures have been given for employment and unemployment.  The Minister quoted figures which appeared in today's papers in answer to a Question yesterday concerning the increase in the number of insured workers which was ascertained as a result of the sale of insurance stamps.  The Minister and the Government are inclined to lose sight of the wood for the trees. There has been a modest increase in industrial employment in the past year, an increase which we must all <Col N="1377" /> welcome, but it must not be forgotten that industrial activity is only one activity of the economy.</P>
    <P>The figures of the number of persons in employment make depressing reading.  The labour force in this country, the number of people employed, has in the past seven years, from 1951 to 1958, declined by nearly 90,000.  In the past two years, according to the figures on page 37 of the <i>Irish Statistical Survey</i> of last year, there has been a decline of 32,000. The Minister, his Leader and his Party can make whatever points they like concerning the figures for employment in the past few years.  If they so wish, they can endeavour to place the blame on their predecessors. What they as a Government and we as a Parliament have to bear in mind are the gloomy and depressing facts that employment is nearly 90,000 down since 1951 and has been declining every year.</P>
    <P>The facts of this economic situation are all too apparent to those who have to suffer the terrible hardships of unemployment but these are only some of the economic conditions which bear on some people in this community.  Prices bear on nearly everybody.  In the past seven years, prices increased by 41 per cent. and since this Government came into office they increased by 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The most significant figure of the recent statistics is that which shows the decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation.  It is a truism for economists to say that economic expansion depends on investment.  The figures show a constant crisis since 1953.  There was some increase in 1954 and 1955.  Since 1955, through 1956, 1957 and 1958, the amount of fixed capital formation has been declining each year.  The decline in the past three years has been of the order of £20 million at constant 1953 prices.</P>
    <P>The picture these figures show is that notwithstanding the fact that this country shared in the industrial expansion that has occurred in England and throughout Europe in the past year or two, notwithstanding the fact <Col N="1378" /> that industrial production has increased and reached the peak and passed the peak which it had achieved in 1955, the other operations of our economy have not been expanding. The economy is stagnant, if indeed it is not declining.  There is a continual decline in employment opportunities and there are soaring prices which bear upon every sector of the community.</P>
    <P>It does not require statistics for those of us in this House and elsewhere with knowledge of our social conditions to know the real and great poverty that exists at present in this country, to know of the malnutrition and disease which exists here due to inadequate incomes, inadequate housing and inadequate educational facilities which are the lot of a great many of our citizens.  Our society is not one of which we can be proud.  A concentrated effort on a vast scale must be made to increase the national wealth. We must not be afraid to demand other measures, other concepts, other ideas and to adopt new ones more suitable to our needs and demands at the present time.</P>
    <P>The proposals for economic expansion are totally inadequate to meet the real needs of the Irish nation at present.  The Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which they put forward last year will not give us the increased wealth, increased production and increased employment opportunities necessary to make this a proper Christian community. It is of some significance that the Government have carefully eschewed the use of any statistics showing the amount of employment that is likely to be given by their <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> They have failed to give any indication of the production increases that are likely to come about if their programme is put into operation.  In the recent document they produced, showing their alleged progress in relation to this <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, again no figures have been given to demonstrate what effect it is having on the unemployment situation and on the position concerning production. <Col N="1379" /> These omissions are significant because, as I hope I can show, the Government's programme will have very little, if any, effect on the employment situation.</P>
    <P>This programme, which has been blazoned over the newspapers and which has been given such a tremendous amount of publicity, contemplates the expenditure under public capital over five years, of the sum of £220 million.  Already that has been pared in respect of the provision of £7,000,000 for the fertiliser proposals. In money terms, that programme over the next five years is no greater than the public programme of 1956-57, which was a year of some prosperity but still of unemployment and emigration. In real terms, it is most likely that it will be lower than the amounts for 1955-56 and 1956-57 because our experience of the past few years is most likely to be followed in the future and the decline in the value of money is likely to continue.</P>
    <P>The great criticism which can be made of this programme is in relation to the realisation of what the Government are proposing in it.  The Government appear to have resigned themselves to the fact that Government and local authority capital expenditure is likely to decline over the years and the Government are making available large sums of money for private interests to spend if those private interests make decisions to do so.  Agricultural credit for the next five years is to be at a figure of £11 million; industrial credit is to be at a figure of £20 million; and hotel grants are to be at a figure of £2.35 million. Of the total sum under this programme, the expenditure of over £33 million will depend on the decisions of private investors, industrialists, farmers and hotel owners.  It is an undeniable fact that the decline in the Government's own expenditure will have a deflationary effect on the economy and is likely adversely to affect the decision whether this money which is now to be made available will be taken up or not.  The expansion in industrial credit proposed on paper is a vast expansion over what has been the experience of <Col N="1380" /> the recent past.  The expansion in industrial credit is a vast expansion over what has been spent on industrial credit in recent years and there is no indication to show that the Government are justified in believing that this expansion will take place.</P>
    <P>As I have said earlier, even if this programme is fully implemented, which is indeed most unlikely, it will not significantly affect our employment situation.  It is true that employment may be given in different sectors of the community but the fact remains that the total programme of the Government over the next five years will be on no greater scale than in 1956-57 and is most likely to be less.  For these reasons, the Government have been very slow to give any idea of what the employment position will be as a result of this programme.  The omission is a significant one because the Government realise that this programme will have but little effect on the general employment situation.</P>
    <P>It is time that this Government, this House and the public faced up to certain consequences of what has been our experience in the recent past.  We must accept the fact that private enterprise in this community is inadequate to give us the economic expansion we need.  A distinguished economist in this country recently said that what is needed here is enterprise, whether it be private or public, and we must accept the fact that the private sector of the economy will not be sufficient to give us the economic development this country requires and produce the employment opportunities which our workers want so that emigration can be stemmed.</P>
    <P>We must also accept the fact that ours is a mixed economy in which the private and the public sector have to play a part.  If the private sector is unable to give the expansion needed, the public sector must play its part. We must face the fact that private enterprise, for many reasons which it is unnecessary to go into here, will not be sufficient in the future to give us the economic expansion which is needed and that the public sector will have to undertake activities on an ever-increasing <Col N="1381" /> scale in order to produce the conditions that are necessary.</P>
    <P>There has been a curious approach to the whole concept of planning economic development in Ireland, and &ldquo;planning&rdquo; is one of those words which are regarded in some way as being almost anathema.  I welcome the fact that the Government have set up a planning section in the Department of Finance but I still feel that the steps taken by the Government are inadequate for future economic development, that there has been in the past and there is at the present time a situation in which expenditure by the Government, by State bodies, and by local authorities is largely haphazard, unplanned and unco-ordinated and that if we are to get proper economic development, it must be planned on a much more extensive scale than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to the welcome fact that bank credit in this country in the recent past has expanded considerably. It has been our experience in the post-war years that bank credit has expanded considerably, that we have run into large balance of payments difficulties and that bank credit has very quickly and drastically been reduced.  We have had sufficient experience in the recent past of the banks expanding credit to a very large degree and suddenly contracting it, and we have had booms followed by slumps in this economy which have caused grave hardships to those who have had to suffer from them.</P>
    <P>I feel that the evidence shows that the time has come when the Central Bank must adequately control credit in this country.  The ultimate operator of the level of bank credit in this country should be the Government, through the medium of the Central Bank.  There have been various arguments put up as to why the present informal system with the banks is adequate. I feel that those arguments, in the light of the recent past, are not convincing. Our experience has been that the large scale expansion of bank credit has contributed to a considerable <Col N="1382" /> degree, even more so than the recurring increases in wages, to bringing about a deficit in the balance of payments.  It is necessary, to my mind, that there should be a properly graduated expansion of bank credit, co-ordinated with the Government's general economic policy and that should be done through the medium of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>There are, I know, very great technical difficulties but they can be overcome. They have been overcome in other countries in circumstances similar to ours and I think they can be overcome here.  I do not suggest that manipulating the currency is the sovereign remedy nor am I suggesting such a course.  Past experience has shown that economic expansion can be hindered rather than assisted by such a course.</P>
    <P>I do not see any prospect of this Government dealing adequately with the grave economic and social problems which confront us.  I see no sign of recognition of these problems and I see no sign of great concern.  On the contrary there is ample evidence of complacency on the Government benches.  The country's social problems are great and very urgent.  The difficulties under which many thousands of our people are living are crippling.  What is needed is a sort of vision, initiative and courage which public men in the past had in a high degree in this country.  They are sadly lacking now and that is the reason there is not, throughout the country, the optimism and hope that the Government have talked of, but, on the contrary, there are despondency, depression and pessimism which, to my mind, in the light of our experience and knowledge of the Government, are fully justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity given to us in this debate.  I think it is time, since the present Government came into office, to have a searching of conscience and an expression of our condemnation of the conditions in which we find ourselves to-day compared with two and a half years ago.  Up to this the two most important problems facing any Government in this country were unemployment <Col N="1383" /> and the high cost of living.  These two problems are with us today, but, coming from a rural constituency, I can say that a much more serious problem has arisen for the people living on the land.</P>
      <P>Without exception, every single item of produce that the farmer is producing is now without a market.  I shall deal first with the deplorable condition of the cattle trade which has gone.  It is completely gone and it was our principal export.  I am speaking of the export of store cattle on the hoof and not of the dead meat trade.  That trade has now completely gone after having been in a stagnant condition for the last nine months.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister for Agriculture is present.  I want to ask him what steps are being taken at the present time to get rid of the glut of cattle on every farm in the country at present.  At the present time we have over a quarter of a million cattle on hands that could have been and should have been exported.  The value of these cattle is in the region of £18,000,000. In the West of Ireland, where the creamery industry is not yet developed, every holding is black with the finest of cattle that cannot be sold.  Fair after fair is teeming with these cattle and there is no demand for them.  I am not blaming the Minister entirely for that because a situation has arisen in Great Britain where, through the energetic measures taken by the British Government in the years after the last war, the British farmer is now completely independent of the Irish store cattle trade.</P>
      <P>The facts are these.  If English, Welsh and Scottish farmers can produce one store beast extra for every one hundred acres of land they will be completely independent of the Irish store cattle trade.  That is a very serious situation for us, and, while I do not blame the Minister for it, I think it fair to ask him if he is aware of this position and what steps he has taken for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To turn to other sorts of produce, I want to say that the sheep trade has become a farce.  Lambs and sheep are gone.  Bacon is practically nonexistent. The turkey trade has gone <Col N="1384" /> and for the average farm household this is ruination.  These were what they lived on.  Even at the best of times no farmer was paid a price which covered the cost of production and left him with a fair margin for himself and his household.  They were not paid a fair price and the result is now plain to be seen in every household in the country where fathers and mothers after rearing a family, cannot get a sor to remain on the land.  It is very hard to blame them.  There is no return for what they produce.  There is no guaranteed or minimum price.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked to-day i he could fix a minimum price for turkeys&mdash;a very small item&mdash;and he said that he could not or would no do it.  I tell him that the time has come when some measure of security will have to be introduced, otherwise the farmsteads of this country will become vacant.  Anyone who has any knowledge of rural conditions must be appalled at the number of nice, comfortable dwellinghouses built in the last twenty or thirty years, many of them at the expense of the ratepayers, which are now shuttered up and the families gone to England, Canada, or the United States.  If we are to allow that to continue and if we are to allow the richest agricultural country in the world, through sheer bad management, to become derelict of its population we shall stand before the bar of history charged with criminal neglect.</P>
    <P>The T.B. Scheme is meeting with an excellent response from the farmers. However, the Minister has not yet come forward with any plan to take the place of the 14-day test green tag cattle.  It is about time the Minister put some scheme into operation. When questioned last week he would not tell us what the abuses were which made him close it down.  I have no doubt there were abuses.  In any public scheme there is always the odd character who sees an opportunity for making money illicitly and who will not hesitate to take it.  I congratulate the Minister on putting a stop to these abuses, whatever they were.  I was glad to note from his reply that no <Col N="1385" /> farmers were involved in them; a different type of person altogether was involved.  My experience has been that the farmers are most anxious to get on with the clearance of their herds.  They realise, both from their own point of view and from the point of view of the export market, that that is the only course to adopt and they are willing to give the Minister every help and co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I want to make this suggestion to the Minister. It may not be the proper time to go into details of his Department but, seeing that our principal export is store cattle, I do not think it will be amiss if I make this suggestion.  I would suggest to the Minister that he would make every effort to get the area enclosed by the River Shannon&mdash;west of the Shannon&mdash;cleared as quickly as possible.  That would be a step in the right direction.  If the Minister tries to spread the effort over the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties, admirable as that would be, I think he will be grasping too much and, like the little boy in the nursery rhyme, will lose all.  However, I hope he will consider this suggestion for what it is worth. If he bends his efforts to clearing the area west of the Shannon he will not find it so difficult then to make halves of the remaining portion of the country. I honestly believe that is the best way to approach the problem, but the Minister has very good advisers in his <Col N="1386" /> Department and has more up-to-date knowledge than I have.</P>
      <P>I want to turn now to the question of employment.  The number employed here has gone down steadily despite the promise of the last election, which even caught some Government supporters, that there would be 100,000 new jobs.  That was backed up a short time after the election by mention of the sum of £220,000,000 for the spending, though we have not seen much of it since.  I think both of these things were figments of the present Taoiseach's imagination at the time.  I think it fair to accuse him of knowing at the time that these things could not be done, that 100,000 new jobs, at the rate of 15,000 a year for a number of years, could not be accomplished.  Anybody who was Minister for Industry and Commerce for so many years must have known that such was utterly impossible without a fabulous windfall that could hardly be expected.</P>
      <P>If we look at the Book of Estimates, we find there a very ready reason why there is such vast emigration from the country.  The reason emigration is so high is due to one fact alone&mdash;the fact that there is no employment for those who go abroad to seek it.  I agree there is a certain amount of attraction in the form of better wages and, perhaps, more attractive conditions in England, the United States and Canada.  At the same time, an astonishing number of boys and girls, particularly boys, would be content to stay at home, even at the low wages we could offer them, if the employment were there.  I think any young fellow worth his salt would be giving bad example if he sat down calmly and wasted his youth here for the sake of being a good patriot or a good Irishman and did not join the crowd emigrating when we cannot provide work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Book of Estimates we find that it costs over £115,000,000 to run this country.  Going through the Estimates we find that only two or three Departments employ working men to any extent at all.  The first of these is the Forestry Department, which employs about 5,000 people <Col N="1387" /> and spends £1,300,000 on employment. Next comes the Office of Public Works and arterial drainage.  A sum of £125,000 is spent on arterial drainage, most of which goes on labour. The Office of Public Works in various schemes spends, including expenditure on materials, concrete, pipes, tools, etc., £776,000.  In no other Vote can I see a Department employing working men.  The net result is that from these three Departments&mdash;the Board of Works, Forestry and the Land Commission&mdash;we get a total expenditure for wages for the working man of £3,092,000, made up as follows: Forestry, £1,300,000; Board of Works £1,292,000 and Land Commission, £500,000.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is serious in his desire to put a stop to emigration, he should consider this £112,000,000 in the Book of Estimates, which goes in some mysterious way I do not understand and gives very little employment beyond the staffs in Government offices.  He should consider doubling the £3,000,000 spent in the Departments I have mentioned on providing wages for the working man.  Surely, out of £112,000,000 it should not be difficult to effect a saving and find another £3,000,000 to give employment to those engaged in the development of our country?  As I said, it is not for pleasure that our young people are emigrating.  It is because there is no employment at home.  The reason we are not giving them employment is that we are not inducing private individuals or concerns to provide employment and we are not providing employment ourselves.  Deputy McQuillan has a motion before the House on the question of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That gave wonderful employment and helped to take a little trickle off the tide of emigration, but even that has been cut away.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Taoiseach has been adopting the attitude that everything is all right, that there is nothing wrong about the serious deficit in our balance of payments, and anybody who raises his voice to point out what is going wrong is accused of being something of a banshee.  I do not see that that <Col N="1388" /> will produce the results anticipated. The average person down the country, who has not £1 in the house for the last eight or nine months because of the complete collapse of every item of agricultural produce, knows that things have gone seriously wrong and that the Taoiseach's statement is not correct.  The Taoiseach was not here a moment ago when I pointed out that, so far as the people in the rural areas are concerned, things with them are in a pretty desperate condition.</P>
    <P>Cattle are not being sold.  The price of sheep has dropped by more than 50 per cent and in most cases they are unsaleable.  Through the autumn and up to the present time, the roads have been white with sheep returning from fairs.  There was nobody to buy them. I do not know where the bottle-neck is or the reason for the sudden collapse in the market for cattle, sheep, eggs, butter, and so on.  Somebody is at fault because the markets for these products cannot have dried up.  It may be suggested that the collapse of the cattle trade is due to the dry summer in England and the resultant shortage of grass there.  I do not think that is the answer.  Certain things happened with regard to exported cattle that were supposed to be free from T.B., but these were only isolated incidents. Nevertheless, they did a certain amount of damage.</P>
    <P>The Government must face up to the problem and find a solution. Approximately 250,000 cattle have been in the right condition for sale for the last six or eight months.  They are still in the country, with the result that every holding and farm is black with the finest cattle that cannot be sold.  Fodder to feed them in the winter is not available.  It may be too much to expect the Taoiseach to be as familiar with this matter as a person from the country would be but I assure him that the position is pretty desperate.</P>
    <P>The turkey trade is gone.  Prices ranging from 1/4d down to as low as 10d per lb. have been paid for turkeys. While turkey exports were small, nevertheless, they formed a very important item in the average country house.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> The figures for unemployment that we are getting do not show the real position.  Due to an effort by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare in letting loose on the country a host of inspectors, genuine applicants for unemployment benefit have been scared off.  They could not stand the constant badgering from inspectors and the constant questioning.  The result is that many people are off the list and have had to go to England to get employment or have remained unemployed at home and have not registered.</P>
    <P>I am not referring to the odd cases here and there of persons who drew unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance wrongfully.  I have no doubt that there were such cases.  That small element is always there.  The vast majority of those who have been struck off the list are persons who have not drawn benefit or assistance wrongfully but are persons who were afraid to apply.  These people do not want to get their names up in court or elsewhere or in the public eye as being associated with any wrongdoing.  The result is that the list published by the Statistics Office every week is artificial and does not show the true position. The actual figure would show 15,000 or 20,000 more than the list shows.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Taoiseach and his Ministers should go through the Book of Estimates with a view to cutting out wasteful expenditure and spending the money so saved in creating employment. It would also help to solve the problem of emigration.  There is great need for drainage.  Afforestation could be developed.  The former Minister for Lands, Deputy Childers, was more concerned to cut down on afforestation except where a positive dividend was guaranteed in 50 years' time, when the forests would come to maturity.  I could not tolerate such a narrow niggardly outlook.  I would not tolerate the squandering of public money but I would take a slight gamble in establishing forests, in view of the fact that we spend £30,000,000 a year on imported timber and wood products.  If the Government do not develop the forests, nobody else will.</P>
    <P>Once again, I would ask the <Col N="1390" /> Taoiseach to consider the question of the market for agricultural produce, which has completely collapsed. Deputy Dillon suggested that it should be possible to develop markets for our produce in countries which export to this country and buy very little in return.  I entirely endorse what Deputy Dillon said on that subject. I shall not mention specific countries but it is scandalous that we are buying goods and materials of various kinds from them while they have erected a steel curtain to debar our goods from entering their countries.  The Taoiseach would be perfectly justified and would gain more respect from these countries in telling them that, if they do not buy goods to the approximate value of the goods we buy from them, we shall turn to a country that will buy from us.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the standard of criticism I have heard so far in this debate because it has been so completely destructive, so completely lacking in evidence of positive thinking by any member of the Opposition.  That was particularly obvious in the speech of Deputy Declan Costello who wandered far and wide around the whole political scene but seemed, to my mind, to be mainly concerned with preaching the new Left Wing policy of Fine Gael. Whether he was speaking on behalf of his Party or was flying a kite, I do not know but I strongly suspect the latter because his Party appear at the moment to be putting up numerous kites to see which will fly the highest or which will fly at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello produced that kite before and was shot down by Deputy Dillon, who is now the Leader of the Opposition, at a Fine Gael meeting and now we find it produced again: &ldquo;The Government must interfere and must take over.&rdquo;  It sounded to my mind almost like a policy of complete nationalisation.  I should like somebody to explain to the House and to the country whether this is a new Fine Gael policy or whether it is just an effort to see what will get more votes.  If it is a new policy to which the Party is firmly pledged, we would <Col N="1391" /> all be glad to know it.  Personally, I doubt that very much.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, followed by Deputy Blowick, gloried in a general atmosphere of pessimism, which depressed them enormously, but at the same time they delivered their speeches with the greatest enthusiasm and, having delivered them, both Deputies immediately left the House, having done their duty to the community to their own satisfaction.  How anyone with any sense of Parliamentary propriety, apart from anything else, can do that, I do not know. If these Deputies really felt as desperate as they would have us believe, they would have sat on for a little while longer to see what some Government Deputy, even a backbencher, might say in reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making was that this general spirit of pessimism which we heard proclaimed by Deputy Costello and Deputy Blowick is to my mind entirely false and entirely unfounded.  It is easy to accuse the Government of complacency, and it is a charge which we are fully prepared to meet, but there is a difference between confidence and complacency and an even greater difference between confidence and utter pessimism.  There does not appear to me to be any grounds for believing that the Government has failed to appreciate the urgency of dealing with current social problems.  That charge could not be laid at the door of a Government which took office, as this Government did, in 1957 with the whole country then really, honestly and genuinely in a crisis, when unemployment was never higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only yesterday in reply to a question by Deputy O'Malley the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach informed him, and the House, that <Col N="1393" /> on the 26th January, 1957&mdash;which was very shortly before a general election &mdash;the number on the live register was 94,648, and that the number of unemployed on the 28th November, the latest available date, was 62,273, which showed a reduction in the number of registered unemployed of 32,375.  Now Deputy Blowick has decided that this figure is entirely false and he has produced the fanciful suggestion that people who are genuinely unemployed, who are genuinely seeking work and who are genuinely in need of assistance are so frightened of the possible embarrassment of investigation of their claims that they have failed to register as unemployed.  Out of the back of his head somewhere, he has produced a figure of about 15,000 to 20,000 frightened people.</P>
    <P>If we are to have criticism of the Government on such flimsy evidence as that, the Government has nothing to fear.  There is no evidence whatever that the Central Statistics Office have juggled with the figures of unemployed nor is there any evidence that people who are genuinely unemployed have failed to register or are frightened to register.  That, I might confidently assert, is a pure figment of Deputy Blowick's imagination.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick brought up the question of the decline in the cattle trade&mdash;something which is a great grief and concern to everyone, whether they are inside or outside this House.  Yet it is not so long since the Government were being castigated for failure to place all their trust for agricultural prosperity on the development of cattle exports.  We were told time and again that it was false to overlook what the Fine Gael Party believed to be a fact, that our whole prosperity depended on increased cattle exports.  At the time it was clearly put forward that Government policy was to try and put agriculture on a much wider basis and we were told that was wrong.</P>
    <P>Now it has been suggested that we were right, that while cattle exports and markets are favourable and a <Col N="1394" /> very valuable asset we cannot always rely on having the cattle market open to us.  That is exactly what has happened in this particular case.  That is precisely why the Government have been trying to develop agricultural exports other than cattle.  For that reason the Commission on Marketing of Agricultural Produce was set up and very correctly that matter was given priority, because if efforts are made to increase agricultural production without first investigating market possibilities for exports you are going to ask the farmer to over-produce and put himself out of business.</P>
    <P>What we have to do first is to establish definite markets for our produce and then get going and produce the articles required on that market.  Everyone should be very grateful to the Commission which has worked very hard and produced numerous reports already, which, we have been informed, are receiving the close attention of the Government. Here again it is not a question of taking a snap decision; it is not a matter of taking a decision here by which we can export poultry, livestock and all sorts of agricultural produce to certain countries without their consent and without their willingness to accept them when we send them. Consequently a lot of bargaining has to be done before the market can be established.  Again, it is only right that the farmers themselves, through the N.F.A. and other organisations, should take a share in exploring markets and not leave everything to the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>In this criticism we find contradictions. There are some people who criticise the Government because they keep on interfering and other members of the same Party very often keep on saying that the Government should take responsibility for everything. You cannot have it both ways. The Government are doing as much as they can but they are trying to get the interested parties themselves to take an interest also and to take their share of responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> We heard not only about unemployment but about emigration.  Here also, efforts have been made to secure definite figures but all that can be established is a trend.  The Opposition find that the trend does not appear to be suitable for their arguments; so they overlook it and start inventing figures of their own.  I think we should pay attention to outside observers and I refer to the opinion of Mr. Garrett Fitzgerald who cannot be regarded as being naturally prejudiced in favour of Fianna Fáil and who has recorded his opinion that emigration has been substantially stemmed.  It has not been stopped but the rising tide of emigration has been stemmed and the weight of emigration appears to him, as a statistician, to have been considerably reduced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the total numbers in employment but no reference was made to the fact that all over the world the number of people employed in agriculture is steadily declining.  Likewise, no mention was made of the fact that the number employed here in industry is steadily rising. We cannot do much, if anything, <Col N="1398" /> about increasing employment on the land, apart from what is being done in forestry and so on, but in general the development of agriculture leads to its giving less employment.  But if we can step up industrial development and employment, that, in itself, produces a home market for agricultural produce and should help to alleviate the present trend towards unemployment in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Getting increased industrial employment is not easy.  I do not think anyone on this side of the House ever said it was.  It should be remembered that when this Government took office, they first had to stop the rot. Unemployment was mounting steadily and you cannot turn a trend of rising unemployment into one of rising employment. You must first stem emigration and stem rising unemployment.</P>

      <P>In fact, the rot has been stopped.  Emigration has been greatly reduced and new industries are starting up steadily.  To my mind, that gives much greater ground for confidence than if there were a sudden burst of employment.  That would not look like proper economic or industrial planning.  No new industry can start up overnight but plans have been maturing over the last year and new factories are now going up.  Only about a month ago, I was talking to a director of one of the biggest building-contracting firms in the country.  They deal exclusively with factory building and he informed me that their work during this year was at a substantially higher level than last year and that his firm was fully booked and could not accept any further orders for 1960.</P>

      <P>The idea was that a statement of mine could be written off.  That statement of mine can be written off only if I am telling a deliberate untruth&mdash;which I am not&mdash; or if my informant was telling a deliberate untruth, which I confidently believe he was not.  I should be prepared to discuss the matter with Deputy Carroll outside the House or in the lobbies and give him further information but I honestly believe that statement to be absolutely true. Believing that is absolutely true, I am confident that new industries are starting up and that not only this building contractor but many others are also involved, not only in this part of the country but in the new Shannon free airport, and other parts of the country as well.  It is a truism that every man who gets a job becomes a better market for local shopkeepers, and so prosperity will begin to flow again&mdash;but it is not easy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick has been weeping crocodile tears over cattle and sheep prices.  What the Government were supposed to do about cattle and sheep prices he never suggested.  It is a fact that cattle and sheep prices have recently fallen very low on the British market and, as we are linked so very closely to the British market, we are suffering with them.  Whether the Government could be held responsible for weather conditions I very much doubt, though Deputy Blowick did admit to a certain extent that the drought during the summer had had some effect on cattle prices, but it is not yet obvious what the Government are supposed to do about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> I cannot see the Government jacking up cattle and sheep prices.  I do not see that they should try to do that. It is part of the risk undertaken in any business, and farming is a business like any other.  Sometimes the market goes in your favour, sometimes it goes against you.  Criticism is being levelled at the Government that they even should do something about turkey prices, but nobody says what. Are we expected to subsidise cattle, sheep and turkey prices?  If so, why should we stop there, and what are we going to use for money?  The market has got sticky at the moment but it is not anything as bad as Deputy Blowick makes out.  If he would go and watch the actual exports of cattle through the Port of Dublin alone, he would get quite a different opinion about the market position than what he appears to have at the moment.  He appears to have got that opinion simply by standing at a gate, looking into a field and seeing cattle in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in forestry, contrary to what Deputy Blowick said.  The report issued to us to-day shows the average planted was the highest ever. Deputy Blowick had an opportunity of reading the report of the Forestry Division but apparently did not bother to do so.  That again is irresponsible because, when a report has just come out to show that the rate of planting has never been higher, <Col N="1401" /> it is completely unjust to levy criticism on the predecessor of the Minister for Lands, Deputy Childers, and say he was trying to cut down the rate of planting.  That is nonsense.  In actual fact he has stepped it up.  It was he who introduced the incentive system which contributed very largely to the progress made even subsequent to the compilation of that report.</P>
      <P>The only difficulty set out in the report is that the building up of a sufficient reserve of plantable land is extremely difficult.  That again has been tackled as vigorously as possible, and considerable progress has been made.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made also with regard to fisheries, not only in the development of new plans for the training of crews, for the building and purchasing of boats, but also in the question of marketing.</P>

      <P>The purchasing and the sale of boats.  The really exciting thing is that the consumption of fish in Ireland has gone up amazingly.  Our rate of consumption on the home market was incredibly low and, through much better marketing and better handling, there is now an infinitely better home market for our fishermen than there ever was before, and exports have also gone up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall accept that if the Deputy has the official figures before him, which I have not, but the important thing is whether those industries, and they are industries, are being put on a firmer basis.  You can always employ men on an uneconomic level but that is not the way to deal with an economic problem.  You have got to get the business running economically before you expand and take on additional labour.  That is <Col N="1402" /> what is being done and has been done to some extent here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  I do not think even Deputy O.J. Flanagan, in his wildest dreams, would expect me to suggest such a thing, but I was dealing with an interjection from my left which was on a different point altogether. I am in favour of giving increased employment, just in case Deputy O.J. Flanagan does not know that, but the increased employment must be on productive work and must be done economically.  I am delighted we have got that point over though it is in a different context.</P>
      <P>I do not want anything I have said to be regarded as evidence of complacency because there are no grounds for complacency whatsoever.  We shall be facing grave problems in the future and our whole marketing of agricultural produce in other lands is tangled up with the economic framework of Europe generally.  Here again we have taken a positive stand, and I think a valuable one.  We have been criticised for not going in with the Six or with the Outer Seven&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual fact, there does now appear to be a growing realisation that neither the Six nor Seven can make any progress on their own, and that consequently the Six and Seven must come together rapidly. That is what the Government have always advocated.  They have always struggled very hard to prevent that division arising in Europe, and are now trying to bridge the gap and bring the parties together under the aegis of O.E.E.C.  When that has been negotiated, and I think it is only a matter of when&mdash;not if&mdash;we can look forward to an increased market potential in Europe generally, but it is quite impossible in the present state of uncertainty to plan with any confidence on the European market or any market, especially for agricultural produce, other than the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> Here again the Government have acted with decision and have initiated high level trade talks in London which are at present being continued, at intervals admittedly, but the results of which are being carefully investigated on each side of the Irish Sea. That, to my mind, is a very healthy trend.  It shows that the Government are fully prepared to negotiate, as they have been asked to do, with the country which is by far our best customer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Deputy Flanagan is feeling better now.  The point is that a definite step has been taken to reach a new trade agreement with Great Britain.  I think it will be found that, when that has been achieved, the Government will proceed as rapidly as possible to bring the other countries together and have a proper European trade agreement brought into operation. That may be exciting.  At the same time, it may be dangerous.  But the Government are fully prepared to negotiate and to act whenever they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see any signs of any complacency anywhere in the Government. I can see plenty of signs of active and constructive work.  All around us are the signs that that work is bearing fruit.  The fact that conditions are improving does not mean that we have not got to work very hard.  We shall certainly continue to work very hard. The preaching of pessimism and disaster <Col N="1404" /> is something which is of very little political advantage to anyone.  It is certainly very bad for the country. I do not expect the Opposition to hand out bouquets just for the fun of it. To keep on shouting that the country is in a crisis, that emigration is mounting, that unemployment is increasing when the facts clearly show the reverse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is nonsense.  Take the balance of payments position.  This Government will not get panicked into taking action with regard to the balance of payments because they have the foresight and the confidence to see that no crisis is in fact impending. They know the situation will right itself.  How right they have been proved in that in recent months when the balance of payments position has taken a marked turn for the better.  It would have been much more like the Opposition to panic, but this Government do not panic.  They keep resolutely on their course, and have been proved right in doing so.</P>
      <P>There are criticisms which can quite properly be made and I hope that, for the benefit of the Government, they will be made, but those criticisms must be constructive and they must be based on facts.  If they are based on imagination, they will not be of very much help, either from the point of view of the Party which makes them or from the point of view of the country.  By all means, let us have criticism, but let it be constructive, and positive, and based on facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in what Deputy Booth had to say.  I think everybody will admit, especially the members of the Government, that they have quite a difficult task.  I do not think the picture Deputy Booth painted in the last half an hour is the right picture.  I think he has good reason for saying that the Government should not be complacent about the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intervene principally because of two questions addressed to the Taoiseach recently in relation to employment figures.  Mark you, I <Col N="1405" /> think the Taoiseach has transmitted some of his optimism about the figures for employment to people such as Deputy Booth, who honestly believe that employment is rising when the contrary is the case.  It was suggested to the Taoiseach last week that the contrary is the case.  He became very indignant at the suggestion and he said he would produce figures to show that employment was rising in 1959 as compared with 1958 or 1957.</P>
    <P>It may be true to say that the trend in emigration has turned the other way, but there is still emigration.  All of us will admit that emigration has decreased but that decrease is due to the fact that we have practically reached saturation point where emigration is concerned.  I do not think Deputy Booth could quarrel with me on that. There may be other factors, but the main factor contributing to the decrease is that we have reached saturation point.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach replied to a question tabled by Deputy Desmond. I have not got the actual question but the reply is reported in today's <i>Irish Times:</i>&ldquo;The Taoiseach told Mr. Desmond that in the nine months ended September 30th the number of insurance stamps sold amounted to 18,616,500 compared with 18,271,200 in the nine months ended September 30th, 1958.  The increase over 1958 was 345,300 which represented an average increase of 8,854 insured workers a week throughout the nine months compared with the corresponding period in the previous year.&rdquo;  I am sure every Deputy believed that was the correct picture, but I know the Taoiseach knows it is not the correct picture.  I do not say the Taoiseach was dishonest, but the Taoiseach should have mentioned other factors.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the number of insurance stamps sold in the particular period was 8,854 more than in the same period in 1958, but surely the Taoiseach remembers that he gave permission to his Minister for Social Welfare in October of last year to introduce what was described as the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1958.  That raised the insurability of <Col N="1406" /> certain persons from a maximum of £600 to £800, and that meant an increase in the number of insured workers.  On that occasion, those of us who spoke in the debate asked the Minister, or his Parliamentary Secretary, what new number of insured workers would be brought in.  In column 913 of volume 171 of the Official Report the Parliamentary Secretary replied, and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We estimate that the number of persons who will come in as a result of this Bill will be about 18,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>What has the Taoiseach to say now about this increase of 8,854?  We have got 18,000 new entrants.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot follow that argument.  It seems to me that the figure which the Taoiseach boasts of is now reduced to a minus figure of 10,000.  I must confess that I cannot understand the Taoiseach's line of argument in this debate.  I suppose I must accept his word when he says that no stamps are bought for these people.  What sort of transaction is carried on between the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Welfare, I have not been aware of, and I am not aware of it tonight. In any case, it needs a good deal of explaining.</P>
      <P>Apart from figures which many people in this House seem to ridicule, there is not much evidence that there has been an increase in employment. Deputy Booth admits, and all of us know, that so far as employment in the rural areas is concerned, it is steadily decreasing.  There is a reason for that in respect of agriculture.  Agriculture has become so mechanised, and has been for the past ten or 15 years, that the tendency is to lay off men.  These men have either to seek employment in the towns or cities or emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I frankly cannot see&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;see&rdquo; deliberately; I am not depending on figures now&mdash;any increase in employment to the extent the Taoiseach suggests there has been in industry.  For instance, I saw in a reply which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave here today to a question about the number of new factories which have been established in recent years, that four new factories were established in Wexford.  I shall not say that I am the best Deputy in the country, but I have a fair knowledge of my own constituency and I do not know of any four factories started in Wexford.  I honestly have no idea whether small additions have been made to existing factories in Wexford, whether it is a new type of processing in an existing factory, or whether some <Col N="1408" /> small factory has been started and carried on in a backyard.  I do not know anything about the four factories in Wexford which the Minister for Industry and Commerce talks about.</P>
    <P>A Deputy from Waterford said it was suggested in that reply that there were seven new factories in Waterford county.  He does not know of seven new factories.  The whole total comes to about a few hundred.  Of course, if we were to believe the <i>Irish Press</i>, there are about 25 new factories every Sunday.  No reference is made to any factories being closed.  I have read reports of the speech of the Taoiseach in Limerick last week when he talked about pessimism, about banshee wailing and hand-wringing.  We heard the same from Deputy Booth.  Will some one tell me who wailed and wrung their hands more often and more loudly than the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, the <i>Sunday Press</i>, the <i>Evening Press</i> and the <i>Irish Press</i> in the three years from 1948 to 1951 and in the period from 1954 to 1957? No one minds criticism and, of course, the Press have a special privilege to criticise as strongly as they can, but if the Government say there is an attempt by the Opposition Parties to undermine confidence in the Government, I say the criticism could have been stronger during the periods I have mentioned especially in view of the fact that there were three newspapers behind that criticism.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth is a relatively new member of the House and he criticises the Opposition for the questions they ask as if he had no idea what it meant to be in Opposition.  Deputy Booth and his colleagues asked the same questions and made the same criticisms. The Taoiseach told us it was the duty of an Opposition to criticise. He said that was a right of the Opposition and that he reserved the right to criticise and not make suggestions. The record of that can easily be found. I well remember Deputy Lemass, as he then was, saying it was the duty of the Opposition to criticise and of the Government to produce results, if they could.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Flanagan, Deputy Booth said that the Government <Col N="1409" /> wanted to provide work but that it had to be productive and economic work.  I disagree with him thoroughly, in view of our circumstances. I appreciate that efforts are being made, and I am sure they are being made at the present time by the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to provide employment, but the fact is that we will not get it this year to fill all our demands.  I feel that we will not get it in the next three, four, five, six or seven years.  We shall not have established in this country factories that will be productive and economical and therefore I believe it is our bounden duty, and the bounden duty of the Government, to provide work &mdash;just work, without any qualification.</P>
    <P>I believe there is still quite an amount of work to be done in housing. A reply which I got from the Minister for Local Government today was to the effect that there are still 177 cottages needed in Wexford, but the Minister has so directed his housing policy that the Wexford County Council will build in each of the next three or four years only 40 cottages.  That means that some of those 177 people who the Minister admits need cottages, will not have a cottage for another five years.  That is a small example, but it is an example of work that could be done and should be done.  I do not know why the Government are going slow on the housing question.  There is a motion before the House at present in relation to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Suffice it for me to say that I think it was a tragedy that scheme was stopped by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I wonder what was really in the mind of the Taoiseach when, in his usual spectacular way, about six months ago, he sent letters to the chairmen of the local authorities all over the country, and gave the impression, whether he meant to or not, that they were to send up all the schemes they could which would give employment&mdash;and I do not think he said productive employment.  So far as the <Col N="1410" /> Government were concerned the sky was the limit.  I know the local body in my home town, Wexford Corporation, sent up a scheme which would cost about £½ million.  There are some simple people and there would be some Fianna Fáil people on that corporation who would be simple people &mdash;politically, I mean&mdash;and I think they have an idea in their minds that there will be sanction for a scheme for the improvement of the harbour in Wexford at a cost of about £½ million.  Tipperary, Mayo, Limerick and Cork and the other local authorities have sent millions of pounds' worth of schemes to the Department or the Board of Works.  I do not know which.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach is replying, I should like him to say what is to happen to these schemes.  As yet, I do not know of any scheme that has been approved.  I was very suspicious, and I am still very suspicious, of that invitation to those people to send up all these schemes because I remember that in the Department of Local Government, in the Board of Works and in the Fisheries Branch, there are, at the present time, and have been for the past ten, 20 and 30 years, schemes filed away which could be put into operation if the objective of the Taoiseach is to provide employment.</P>
    <P>Again, let me stress that I believe we should be able to afford, as Deputy Blowick said, an expenditure of anything up to £10 million per year in the giving of employment.  Some people may be critical and say: &ldquo;We do not want relief,&rdquo; and may try to persuade the workers that it is only relief work and work given for charity, but it is an investment of £10 million to keep people in this country so that when this productive work about which we all speak gets going, we shall have these workers to engage in it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is anxious and so is every member of this House to see that factories are established, whether in the Shannon free trade zone.  Wexford, Mayo, Dublin or Cork.  We are all anxious to see factories established but we know how slow a process it is. We know the protracted negotiations that must, of necessity, go on between <Col N="1411" /> Departmental officials and Germans, Belgians and Americans.  Sometimes it takes three years to establish a factory. A man with 38/- a week on the dole cannot wait so long.  The rural worker, who is employed for nine months of the year as an agricultural labourer, cannot afford to be living on £3 1s. per week for his wife and family for the other three months in the hope that these factories will be established. There is plenty of work to be done. There is plenty of productive work to be done in factories.</P>
    <P>What are the detail difficulties about extending the forestry programme? We have stepped up our forestry programme spectacularly over the past ten years: whether it can be stepped up any more or not, we do not know, and we do not know whether it would be a good investment to pump more money into it.</P>
    <P>We cannot be particularly proud about the roads we have in the country. Many local authorities boast about the condition of their roads and say that they have now reached saturation point, as far as the expenditure of money is concerned.  Many roads are not in good condition, in view of the increased car and lorry population. It seems that we shall have to pay more and more attention to the roads. Therefore, an expenditure of another £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 on the roads would, in my opinion, be justified, not alone to keep money in this country but also to provide adequate highways for the traffic that will travel on these roads in a relatively short period. Whether it is on land, drainage, or road work, I think the expenditure of money is justified.</P>
    <P>I cast no aspersion on the 62,000 who are unemployed at the present time.  If there are instances where 10, 20 or 30 men want to go into some business or factory, employers have difficulty in getting the right type of worker.  I do not necessarily mean the man who will work as against the man who will not work.  Amongst those 62,000 there is a big proportion of men who are used to rural work only.  Many of them are not suitable for factory work.  They cannot adapt themselves <Col N="1412" /> too easily to the operation of a machine or the making of different articles but we will be left in a position in a short time, if we do not do something about the matter, in which 20,000 of the 62,000 will be forced to emigrate, and we shall never have any skilled operatives in the country or workers who can be trained.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for repeating that the expenditure of £10,000,000 to keep workers in the country will pay off in the long run.  The Government propose to spend substantial amounts in the near future in making grants to the hotel industry.  I have no objection to that.  They have poured out, I suppose. some millions of pounds to the hotel industry over the past two years.  I have no objection to it.  That will not pay off for another few years and maybe for three, five, seven or ten years, but still we thought we were justified and are justified at the present time in throwing money into the hotel business to promote the tourist industry and we will not get a return possibly for another seven or ten years when we hope this country will attract more tourists.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Taoiseach has&mdash;shall I say&mdash;gambled as far as the transatlantic air service is concerned.  I expressed doubts in this House as to whether or not it would be a success and I do not want to comment further on that.  He admits himself that it is now in the growing pains stage.  He says it is more than an experiment.  It is going to be a success.  Still we have to give it a chance.  Still he is prepared&mdash;I do not object to his doing it &mdash;to pour millions of pounds into the development of a project that will not show a return for five, six or seven years.</P>
    <P>It is much more worthwhile to expend money on the employment of people in our own country or on giving them the means to live in their own country so that, when we do want them, they will be available.  I would ask the Taoiseach, when he is replying, to refer to the reply he gave to Deputy Desmond yesterday and to relate it to the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare when he spoke <Col N="1413" /> on a Social Welfare Bill on 25th November, 1958.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Booth made an appeal that criticism of the Government in this discussion should be based on facts.  I hope to criticise the Government and I hope <Col N="1414" /> to back every word of criticism I say with facts which I have before me.</P>
      <P>I want to start by asserting it is a fact that this Government have failed disastrously all along the line.  I want to assert that this Government have failed in dealing with the problem of the cost of living.  I assert that this Government have failed in dealing with the problem of unemployment.  I assert that they have failed in dealing with the problem of emigration.  I assert that they have failed on the question of the balance of payments. I assert that they have failed in dealing with the problem of illegal activities in the State.  I assert that they have failed in dealing with the question of health services and the preservation of harmonious relations between the Government, on the one hand, and the medical profession, on the other.  I assert that they have failed in dealing with the agricultural industry.  I assert that they have failed in their external affairs policy and have failed even in their effort to abolish P.R. and make the future safe for Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I think that even Deputy Booth will acknowledge that, prior to and during the last general election, all the artillery of the Fianna Fáil Party was turned on the previous Government and all their criticism levelled against that Government, principally on the question of employment and unemployment.  I have here, and I intend giving, fact No. 1 from a pamphlet entitled &ldquo;Facts for Voters&rdquo; produced by the Fianna Fáil Party prior to the last general election on the occasion of a by-election in Cork city.  I do not know if Deputy Booth will agree with me.  Will the Deputy accept that what is stated in this at least was presented to the public by the Fianna Fáil Party as facts?</P>
      <P>The first fact I want to refer to is that in that by-election which preceded the general election by a few months, the Fianna Fáil standard bearer had this to say of the Fianna Fáil policy which Fianna Fáil were presenting to the people and which they asserted they wanted to give the people an opportunity of accepting at a general election:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> Emigration has reached frightening proportions.  Soaring prices are robbing the wage packet of its value.  Rates have increased enormously. In Fianna Fáil we have set a state of full employment as our goal.  We believe it can be achieved.  We are working out the details of a dynamic programme of investment which, in an expanding economy, will bring the nation to that goal.</P>
    <P>That was before the general election campaign started.  Fianna Fáil were laying the fuse which they wanted to ignite at the right time.  They had produced their proposal for full employment&mdash;the Lemass plan for 100,000 jobs in five years.  We were told in the by-election in Cork city that Fianna Fáil were eagerly awaiting the opportunity of putting that proposal before the people.</P>
    <P>In the same pamphlet, we read: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil plans the end of emigration.&rdquo; It continues:</P>
    <P>In contrast to the attitude of the present Coalition, Fianna Fáil has been preparing its plans for the day when the Party will again take up the reins of Government.  The Fianna Fáil plan proposes an increase over five years in the number of new jobs by 100,000.  This would result in full employment and the end of abnormal emigration.</P>
    <P>We were told Fianna Fáil had a dynamic plan which they wanted to put into operation and that they were awaiting the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Then we come along to the period of the general election.  Everyone knows that there were difficult days for the people of this country and that there were difficult days politically for the then Government in the year 1956. All of us know the measures which that Government were courageous enough to take in order to meet a crisis situation which had developed, not through any fault of the Government. Because of those measures, there was a dislocation in trade.  There was an increase in the unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> What sympathy did the Government get at that time from the then Deputy Lemass, deputy-Leader of the Opposition? What sympathy did the then Government get from people like Deputy Booth who were contesting the election on behalf of Fianna Fáil? Was there as much as one Fianna Fáil Deputy now in the House who stood by the Government in those days and appealed to the people to keep up their hearts and their confidence?</P>
    <P>There was one voice crying out to the people in those days.  He did it from the Government Benches and from the Opposition Benches.  It was the voice of Deputy J.A. Costello telling the people that there was no need to despair.  He put before the people in October, 1956, a programme for production which the Fianna Fáil Party are proud now to enhance and endorse.  He told the people that a temporary period of upset and dislocation had to be faced, if we were to preserve the national solvency.  What support did he get then from the Fianna Fáil benches?  How many Fianna Fáil Deputies did we hear talking about gloom and despair?</P>
    <P>Did we hear Deputy Lemass in those days asking the people to forget this talk of gloom, despair and despondency, to have confidence in the country and in its future?  I believe many Fianna Fáil Deputies are confusing the people's confidence in the country and the people's lack of confidence in the Government.  They are two different and distinct things.</P>
    <P>If the people have, as I believe they have, confidence in the future of the country and in the ability of the country to overcome any handicaps which now beset us, that confidence is due in great measure to the work of Deputy J.A. Costello in appealing to the country and to the youth of the country to show that confidence, whether he was in Government or in Opposition. I believe the people have that confidence in the country but they have not confidence in the Government. They have shown that at by-election after by-election.  In the two years and nine months this Government have been in office, in two out of three by-elections in the capital city, Fianna Fáil have suffered reverses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> The point I wanted to make was that, having prepared the ground, having the opportunity presented to them because of the difficulties faced by the inter-Party Government, Fianna Fáil took full advantage of it during the general election.  Every one of us remember how every dead wall in the country was plastered with Fianna Fáil posters saying: &ldquo;Beat the crisis.  Let us get cracking.  Wives, get your husbands out to work.  Unemployment is the test of Government policy.&rdquo;  In that atmosphere, we had the Taoiseach putting himself on record in a few speeches of which I propose to remind him.</P>
    <P>I take it that Deputy Booth will accept it that these are facts.  These are the words of his Taoiseach as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 23rd February, 1957, speaking in his own constituency of Dublin South (Central). That report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>He said that the rise in unemployment during the past few months was indisputable evidence that things are wrong with the country.  The policy of any Government should be judged by its effect on employment.  If it is putting more people into work, it is all right.  If it is putting them out of work, it is wrong.  Fianna Fáil has never refused to accept that test.</P>
    <P>I should like to pause there and ask the Taoiseach to ponder on the bit of wriggling being done in relation to unemployment figures today.  The report continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Its main economic aim was to bring about conditions in which Irish men and Irish women can get a livelihood through work in Ireland.  Full employment must be the objective of any worthwhile programme.</P>
    <P>Again, speaking in Drogheda, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 16th February, 1957, he had this to say:</P>
    <P>The measure of the worsening of the national situation is the increase in unemployment.  That is the real test of the soundness of the policy <Col N="1418" /> of any Government.  Unless the policy of the Government is successful in putting people to work, of giving a chance of getting work to all who are dependent on it for their livelihood, it is not good enough. The aim of any worthwhile policy must be full employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I remember the figures Deputy Booth gave but I propose to comment on figures given by the Taoiseach's Department on 11th of last month.  The general Fianna Fáil pamphlet for use all over the country, produced for the general election with a photograph of their former leader on the front page, had this as one of its main headings: &ldquo;All energies devoted to one aim: full employment. The whole energies of the Fianna Fáil Government will be devoted to the realisation of the objective of full employment.  This can be achieved only through a rapid and substantial increase of national resources and it is to this end that Fianna Fáil will apply its economic policy.&rdquo;  At the foot of the page there is this in bold, black letters: &ldquo;Unemployment can be cured&rdquo;.  On the next page, again in bold black letters: &ldquo;Action can start now.  Over 90,000 people are now out of work.  The Coalition says it can do nothing for them now.  Fianna Fáil believes that work must be provided at once.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the Fianna Fáil propaganda during the general election campaign.  I do not think anyone can doubt that they were saying fairly and squarely to the people: &ldquo;As far as this election is concerned, the big issue is the issue of employment and unemployment and we are coming before you as a Party offering full employment in Ireland.  We are coming before you as a Party offering to create 100,000 new jobs inside five years, if you put us into Government with a sufficient majority to stay there for five years.&rdquo;  Was that not the gist of the message conveyed by Fianna Fáil through the mouth of the Taoiseach to the electorate at the last election?  Let <Col N="1419" /> them now examine their consciences. Let them now tell about the 100,000 new jobs they were going to create if they were given a sufficient majority to stay in office for a period of five years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not been in five years yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the rate you are going, I do not think you will be in for five years.  However, the idea was something in the region of 15,000 to 25,000 new jobs a year.  Lest Deputy Booth should think I am in any way misrepresenting the facts or misinterpreting the message which Fianna Fáil wanted to give the electorate at the last general election, may I remind him that when the Minister for Defence was even more of a greenhorn in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party than he is today, he gave his interpretation of the results of the general election and he told us across the floor of the House why Fianna Fáil were put into office.  If Deputy Booth cares to consult the Dáil Debates of the 15th May, 1957, he will see that at columns 1283 and 1284, he had this to say:</P>
      <P>In my opinion, and in the opinion of any fair-minded person who even now goes back and looks over the speeches made in the election campaign, it is beyond all doubt that we were put in here as a Government to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation of mass unemployment and emigration brought about by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Again, in column 1288 of the Dáil Debates of the same day, the Minister for Defence said:</P>
      <P>The people who have been affected by that unemployment and resulting emigration have put their faith in Fianna Fáil to remedy this situation, in the full knowledge that there would probably be a period of comparative austerity before progress towards remedying the situation became apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have now been there for more than half of a full period in office and on the 11th of last month a question was put down by Deputy <Col N="1420" /> Lynch to the Taoiseach.  The information given to Deputy Lynch in reply to that question, regarding persons in insurable employment over the years 1956 to 1959, showed that as between 1956 and 1959 there were 40,000 fewer people in employment than before Fianna Fáil became the Government. Remember, this is the Government which is supported by Deputy Booth who pledged themselves in all their speeches and propaganda during the general election that they were the Party who would give full employment; they were the Party who were to end emigration and cure unemployment; they were the Party who were to create 100,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>We find that, half way through their period of office, their best boast so far as employment is concerned, is that they have succeeded in pushing out of employment 40,000 people who were in employment before the present Fianna Fáil Government came into office.  Is that anything to be proud of?  Will Deputy Booth deny that is a fact?</P>

      <P>I am trying to prove that Fianna Fáil are a disastrous failure, so far as employment is concerned.  On the 11th November, 1959, this question was addressed to the Taoiseach by Deputy T. Lynch.  I am quoting from Column 885 of Volume 177 of the Dáil Debates:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> Mr. T. Lynch asked the Taoiseach if he will state the total number of persons in whole-time employment in the State in each of the years 1956, 1957, 1958 and to the nearest available date in 1959.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says I am distorting the figures.  This was the reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary:</P>
    <P>Donnchadh Ó Briain: It is not possible to ascertain the total number of persons in whole-time employment in the State at any specific date.  Particulars of the numbers of persons in insurable employment are, however, available in the form of estimates based on insurance stamps sold, or issued to employer depositors. Thus the average number of stamps sold per week in a year provides an estimate of the average number of persons in insurable employment throughout that year.</P>
    <P>For the years ended 31st March from 1956 to 1959 the estimates of the weekly average number of persons in insurable employment were as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>A comparatively simple sum in arithmetic will show the Taoiseach that the gap as between 1956 and 1959 is a figure of 40,000 odd.  Does the Taoiseach still question the figure?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>That is precisely the statement the Taoiseach made in Limerick and, as he is prepared to take that statement as a test of his accuracy in this matter, let us deal with it.  The Taoiseach says that for nine months, six months in 1956 and three, I think, in 1957, when the inter-Party Government were in office, the numbers in employment fell by 50,000 in these months.  I think I am <Col N="1422" /> summarising the Taoiseach fairly.  Will the Taoiseach just look at his figures? On the figures he has given, even as between the 31st March, 1956, and the 31st March, 1957, the reduction was 15,500 whereas the figure of 50,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Taoiseach might at least do the House the courtesy of agreeing that they have some knowledge of procedure and some intelligence.  The Taoiseach gives us figures for insurance stamps sold.  He has not adverted to the fact, in his interjections here this evening, that the ceiling for insurance stamps was raised from £600 to £800 and that, according to his own Parliamentary Secretary in introducing the Bill which provided for that, there were 18,000 people being brought in.

      <P>I should like the Taoiseach to check the tots of the figures given yesterday and see if they relate only to unemployment insurance stamps.  However, I want to continue giving Deputy Booth some facts. Those are the facts in relation to unemployment figures as announced to this House by the Taoiseach's Department, that there were 40,000 fewer people in employment on the 31st March, 1959, than on the 31st March, 1956.  Remember that that is only on a par with information which his predecessor gave me in reply to a Parliamentary Question I asked on the 12th March, 1958.  On that occasion I asked the then Taoiseach to state the average number of persons in industrial and agricultural employment in the years 1956 and 1957.  The information given&mdash;admittedly the figures were estimated&mdash;showed, as between 1956 and 1957, there had been a drop of 24,000 in the figures for industrial and agricultural employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a similar question yesterday. I want to say that I take very grave <Col N="1424" /> exception to the manner in which the question was answered.  I asked a question exactly similar in every respect, bar one, to the one I asked on the 12th March, 1958, the only difference being that in the question on the 12th March, 1958, I had to relate the question to the years 1956-57 whereas in the question yesterday I asked for similar information to cover the years 1958 and 1959 to date.  While in March, 1958, the Taoiseach's Department were able to give an estimate of those engaged in industrial and agricultural employment, I was informed yesterday by the Parliamentary Secretary, answering for the Taoiseach, that those figures could not be given as far as industry was concerned and that he could only give me figures for those engaged in transportable goods industries.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach why he is not able to give the figures in 1959 which he was able to give in 1958.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not draw the distinction.  It is the Taoiseach himself who drew it in the reply to the question yesterday.  Perhaps if the Taoiseach would endeavour to make it his habit to read the questions put down to him and to read the answers given on his behalf, he might be able to follow things a little bit more clearly.  My complaint is this. On the 12th March last year I asked a question and I got an answer.  On the 9th December this year I asked a similar question but I was told I could not get an answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Taoiseach told me yesterday was this:</P>
      <P>Current statistics of the number of persons engaged in industry and agriculture are available only from the Quarterly Inquiry into industries producing transportable goods covered by the Census of Industrial Production and from the annual Agricultural Statistics Enumeration respectively.  These figures relate to all persons engaged in the activities concerned and not merely to employees only.  I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle...</P>
      <P>He then issued a tabular statement. That answer given yesterday was entirely different from an answer given to a similar question on the 12th March, 1958.  I would ask the Taoiseach to look into it.</P>
      <P>I doubt if it is necessary, even to satisfy Deputy Booth's appetite for facts, to emphasise by further quotation from Fianna Fáil election propaganda that the issue they were making in the last general election was the question of unemployment and, allied to that, the question of emigration and also the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy thinks that the cost of living was not in issue in the election?  Let me quote from the election address of the Minister for Health:</P>
      <P>To the electors of Dublin SouthEast. On March 5th you will have the chance to elect a Government. We trust that it will be a better Government than you have had since 1954.  In living memory trade has never been so bad, unemployment so rife and the necessities of life so dear.</P>
      <P>It winds up:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you do your part in this election to put a Fianna Fáil Government in office, we believe you can <Col N="1426" /> look forward with confidence to a revival of industry, an increase in employment and greater security for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might have said &ldquo;hear, hear!&rdquo; on the 5th March, 1957, but I doubt if he would find many people in his cumann to say &ldquo;hear, hear!&rdquo; today.  The facts are that the complaint was that the necessities of life were never so dear.  We have in the general election pamphlet, issued on behalf of Deputy Booth and other Fianna Fáil Deputies, a whole page devoted to telling the people how dear everything was.  They were told that they paid more for tea, beer, whiskey, tobacco, cigarettes, coal, turf and a host of other commodities. Was that not putting the cost of living in issue in the general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that we pledged ourselves to reduce the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <P>I shall undertake not to revise the script of what I said if the Deputy will do the same. Then we shall see who is right. Fianna Fáil put in issue in the general election the question of unemployment, emigration, and the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already dealt with the Fianna Fáil history as far as unemployment is concerned.  Having got back to office with an overall majority&mdash;as big a majority as any Government had since the State was established&mdash;having got from the people the power to put into operation any policy they wished, to implement, if they wanted to implement, their proposals for full employment and their plan to give the people of this country 100,000 new jobs&mdash; with all that power and no one to stop them, what have they done, apart from wasting the time of this House for nine months discussing the <Col N="1427" /> Fianna Fáil proposal to abolish P.R. and make the future safe for Fianna Fáil?  Apart from that, what have they done in their two and a half years of office?  They have pushed 40,000 people who were in jobs before they came into office out of their jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Then they were faced with a by-election in Dublin, North Central.  In the by-election we did not hear much of the 100,000 new jobs but we did hear, nine months after they got into office, that the Government had a policy for more work and that plans were being prepared. This is what they said: &ldquo;Next year the plans being prepared by the present Government will come to fruition and a great improvement may then be expected in the unemployment situation.  Even now the unemployment figure is several thousands less than at this time last year.&rdquo;  In November, 1957, when they were faced with this by-election Fianna Fáil did not quite concede defeat but they did concede that there would be some postponement of the 100,000 new jobs that were to be created.  Instead of being created in 1957 it was now going to be the next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then they had a by-election in South Galway and I had to search their literature very carefully to find out what they would say about the question of unemployment.  Now they had left 1957 and they were in 1958. In 1957 it was to be next year.  In 1958 it was only at the very back page of their election literature that they made any reference to the drive for more jobs.  The Minister for Lands may now wish to overlook the fact <Col N="1428" /> that the general election literature prepared for him and his colleagues said that there were over 90,000 people out of work, that the Government in office could do nothing for these people and that Fianna Fáil believed that work could be provided at once.  In the South Galway by-election there was only very little reference to the strive for jobs when it was said: &ldquo;The intensive drive of the Fianna Fáil Government is getting results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the results claimed was that the number out of work was fewer by several thousands than at the same time the previous year.  Notice how clever that is.  They say that the number of people out of work was fewer but there is no reference to the number of people in work.  This was in May 1958 and, according to the figures given by the Taoiseach's Department on the 11th of last month, there were approximately 36,000 people fewer in work in the year ended 31st March 1958 than in the year 31st March 1956. Deputy Booth, with his appetite for facts, can stand over the statement that the number of people out of work was fewer by several thousands but it would never strike him to ask about the number of people in work.  To him the statement that there are fewer people out of work means that there are more people in employment.  The fact is that it does not and on that occasion it meant there were 36,000 fewer people in employment when that by-election was held than there were in the year 1956.  I am sick and tired of hearing Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;the Minister for Lands was at it here a few minutes ago&mdash;painting the year 1956 as the black year in this country.</P>

      <P>Let us, first of all, comment on the fact that, in keeping with the phraseology of their Dublin North (Central) by-election speeches, of the plan being postponed until &ldquo;next year&rdquo;, as recently as 5th or 6th of the present month, the Taoiseach states in Limerick that next year could mark a great leap forward on the path to increased national prosperity.  Again, we are going over to next year.  Remember, this was the job that was to be tackled at once.  Fianna Fáil were to beat the crisis.  Fianna Fáil were to be allowed to get cracking.  Fianna Fáil told the people that &ldquo;action could start now.&rdquo; Fianna Fáil told the people that there was no reason for any delay, that the Coalition were all wrong in saying they could not do anything then. Fianna Fáil said that something must be done at once.  Now we find that it is postponed from 1957 to 1958; it is postponed from 1958 to 1959 and, in December, 1959, the Taoiseach again says &ldquo;next year&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>What about the increase in the numbers as a result of the 15,000 new jobs per annum estimated by the Taoiseach as being required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I go on, if the Minister has no objection?  I propose to quote words which may not be palatable to him.  The Taoiseach is reported as saying at Limerick:</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon may believe that what he asserted was a statistical fact, that the number of people in employment is 40,000 less than three years ago and said this proved the failure of the Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the Taoiseach asks: &ldquo;What are the facts?&rdquo; and he sets out what he, presumably, claims are four facts.  I want to controvert each of the four. <Col N="1431" /> The first fact, following the Taoiseach's rhetorical question, is:</P>
    <P>The three years of which Mr. Dillon spoke include the last months of the Coalition Government, the last half of 1956 and the first quarter of 1957&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I shall give him that fact.  He goes on:</P>
    <P>during which this country experienced a slump of unprecedented severity in production and employment. During the nine months' period when the Coalition were in control the numbers in employment fell by around 50,000.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Lands will look at his volume of the Dáil Debates for 11th November, 1959, not a month ago, he will see that that simply is not so, if the figures given by the Department of the Taoiseach in reply to a Parliamentary Question are correct, because the decrease as between 31st March, 1956, and 31st March, 1957, according to those figures, was 15,500.  Even making due allowance for the Taoiseach's exaggeration, that is a very far cry from 50,000.  The Taoiseach went on:</P>
    <P>That rapid decline in production and employment was arrested before the end of 1957.</P>
    <P>That was the Taoiseach's second fact. I want to ask him, if that is so, how is it that there was a further decrease in employment between 31st March, 1957, and 31st March, 1958, according to his own figures, of 21,200&mdash;an additional decrease of 21,200 persons, who were put out of employment under a Fianna Fáil Government in the year when the Taoiseach talks about the decline in production and employment being arrested?  He says then:</P>
    <P>In 1958 the long process of recovery was begun.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> Then he says:</P>
    <P>In this year, 1959, the recovery has been much more rapid.</P>
    <P>Again I invite the Minister for Lands to look at the figures as between 31st March, 1958, and 31st March, 1959. Employment, according to that reply, decreased by a further 4,500 persons. These are another 4,500 persons who were in jobs and who have been put out of jobs under a Fianna Fáil Government. So that the gap between 31st March, 1956, and 31st March, 1959. as at 31st March, 1959, had lengthened out to 41,200 people&mdash;41,200 fewer people in insurable employment than there were before Fianna Fáil became Government.  However, I imagine that even Deputy Booth has now had his fill of facts about unemployment.</P>

      <P>It might be as well to turn for a moment to the question of the cost of living.  I asked a Question yesterday to find out what increases had taken place in commodities included in the calculation of the cost-of-living index figure as between March, 1957, and the latest convenient date.  According to the answer given to me by the Department of the Taoiseach yesterday, there were 197 items included in the calculation for the cost-of-living index figure and, of those 197 items, 149 have increased in price since Fianna Fáil took office; there have been decreases in only 42 cases and in six cases there was no change.</P>
