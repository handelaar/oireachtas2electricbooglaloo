    <Title>Double Taxation Relief (Sea or Air Transport) (Union of South Africa) Order, 1959&mdash;Motion of Approval.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Sea or Air Transport) (Union of South Africa) Order, 1959</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid on the table of Dáil Éireann on the eleventh day of July, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This item and the next item relate to the implementation in Irish law of Agreements with other Governments for the avoidance of double taxation <Col N="1809" /> on income derived from the business of sea and air transport.  For convenience, I propose to deal with them together.</P>
    <P>An Agreement with the Government of the Union of South Africa for the avoidance of double taxation on income derived from the business of sea and air transport was signed on behalf of the Government by the Irish Ambassador at London on the 1st May, 1958.  On the 18th June, 1958, I signed on behalf of the Government an Agreement with the Swiss Federal Council concerning the taxation of enterprises operating ships or aircraft.</P>
    <P>These Agreements are not yet in force.  Before either Agreement can enter into force, each party must ensure that the necessary steps have been taken under the law of its own country to give effect to the Agreement.</P>
    <P>So far as concerns Ireland, it is necessary to comply with the provisions of Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1951, No. 15 of 1951.  That Section lays down that the Government must make an Order to confirm and give the force of law to any arrangement entered into with a foreign government to afford relief from double taxation on income derived from the business of sea or air transport.  The Section further provides that before the Government may make any such Order, a draft thereof must have been laid before this House and a Resolution passed by this House approving the Order in draft.</P>
    <P>Drafts of the Orders to give effect in Irish law to the Agreements with the Swiss Federal Council and the Government of the Union of South Africa were laid on the table of the House on the 11th July, 1959.  Deputies will find the text of each Agreement scheduled to the appropriate draft Order.</P>
    <P>I shall now refer briefly to the principal provisions of the two Agreements, which, although they differ in some respects by reason mainly of the different taxation systems obtaining in Switzerland and the Union of South Africa, are substantially the same in effect.</P>
    <P>The object of the agreements is set <Col N="1810" /> out in Article 11.  Essentially, it is to provide that Irish enterprises will be exempt from taxation in Switzerland and the Union of South Africa on income derived by these enterprises from the business of sea or air transport. Likewise, Swiss and South African enterprises will enjoy exemption in Ireland from taxation on income which they may derive from the business of sea or air transport.  I do not think that it is necessary for me here to enter into a more detailed examination of the provisions of this Article.</P>
    <P>Article I of both Agreements contains definitions, which are, I think, clear.  There is just one point to which I would like to draw attention.  In the case of corporations, the exemption is limited to those constituted under the laws of Ireland and managed and controlled in Ireland.  In other words, the benefits of the Agreements will flow only to bona fide Irish enterprises which have their head office and central administration in the State. Likewise, only bona fide Swiss and South African corporations will enjoy exemption from double taxation under the Agreements.</P>
    <P>Article III of both Agreements deals with their entry into force and their effective dates.  The Agreement with the Swiss Federal Council will have effect in respect of income arising on or after the 1st January, 1954: the Agreement with the South African Government will have effect in respect of income arising on or after the 1st July, 1951.</P>
    <P>Article IV of each Agreement provides that it may be terminated by either party on giving due notice to the other party.</P>
    <P>I think that it will be generally accepted that it is desirable in principle to encourage the development of air and sea services between Ireland and other countries by affording relief from double taxation to companies engaged in such business.  Agreements of this kind were concluded in 1955 with the Governments of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, and others are in negotiation. Furthermore, the comprehensive Double Income Tax Relief Conventions with Britain, the United States of <Col N="1811" /> America and Canada contain provisions for reciprocal exemption from double taxation on income derived from the business of sea and air transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extension of a principle that has been accepted by this House for some years.  I do not know whether there are any prospects&mdash;in fact, I doubt if there are &mdash;of these Conventions coming into operative effect, but, so far as the Act is concerned, the air and sea navigation must be taken together.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that the benefits of the Conventions would operate purely in respect of Irish companies. I do not think that is quite correct.  They apply to companies that are controlled in Ireland and there are companies that are controlled, for taxation purposes, in Ireland.  It is not necessary that it should be a purely Irish company for it to have such control. Of course, it is clear that the terms of the Order must follow the terms of the ordinary income tax law because it is a Convention to abolish double taxation.</P>
      <P>It will, in so far as Switzerland is concerned, possibly have some effect and to the extent that it will clear up the incidence of double taxation in a limited sphere, it is something all of us are glad to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Sweetman that anything that makes for the clarification of the mystical setup known as double taxation is to be commended from every point of view. In this instance, I would like to ask the Minister whether he is first making the machinery and hoping that later he will fit the trade into the machinery or whether the terms of this agreement will bring any immediate benefits to Irish trading enterprises.  Is the Minister merely negotiating the machinery in case that at a later stage it can be brought into action with mutual advantages to both sides or are any immediate benefits likely to follow from the negotiation of these two agreements?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I like to have things explained in terms that I understand. Am I right in believing that a company operating out of Switzerland, such as Aer Lingus, is hereafter exempt from any profits they may make on a passenger picked up in Switzerland and dropped outside of that country?  Similarly, is Swissair exempt from any profits made from a passenger picked up in this country and dropped outside Ireland?  If an Irish ship carries goods from Capetown, is it exempt from taxation in the Union of South Africa on the profits made from the carriage of those goods?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We are anxious to negotiate double income tax agreements with more countries than we have agreements with at the moment. We have such agreements with the United States of America, Britain, and Canada and I know that we are negotiating at least two others.  It depends, of course, on the circumstances of our trade and capital transfers between any two countries whether it is worthwhile but, in principle, we have no objection and, indeed, in principle, we welcome double taxation agreements with other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it is on this section or Section 3 that I want to raise a particular point.  I do not think it matters in either event.  The Minister and I had some discussion on Second Reading and the Minister was courteous enough to write me a letter afterwards, a letter with which I totally disagree and, being as I am, I said so.  The Minister wrote me a further letter but I still disagree totally and entirely with the legal view put forward by him.  However, I do not think it matters very much because the Minister, as I understand, has the matter of administration laid down and got an admission that, whatever the view of the law is, what I want to ensure is to be carried out in practice.</P>
      <P>In my view, as the law stands&mdash; the Minister disagrees with me but I still think my view is correct&mdash;there is nothing in any statute to prevent the Industrial Credit Company entering into commitments beyond the extension of capital and powers to borrow given in these two sections of the Bill.  I think that is a bad thing in a statute, but, whether it is bad or not, theoretically, it does not matter in practice if it is laid down as a matter of administrative principle that the total commitments of the company, actual and contingent, are not to exceed the limit set out in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accounts of the Industrial Credit Company are available once a year and the Minister was good enough to send me a copy of the last accounts.  I think they were up to 31st October of last year.  I should now like the Minister&mdash;and I gave notice that I would ask him on this section&mdash;what was the amount on the last convenient date, shall we say, 30th June last, of the liabilities of the company, contingent under guarantee, and the amount of the commitments of the Company, set out in the same way as was set out in <Col N="1816" /> the balance sheet of 31st October last?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the point which I raised on the Second Stage of this Bill, and which the Minister then undertook to examine.  That was the question as to what is the amount of the guarantee which it is being alleged the Industrial Credit Company gave to the Dutch shipbuilding enterprise?  Various figures have been mentioned when this matter was discussed among groups throughout the city.  On the last day, I sought to get some information from the Minister as to what extent the public purse was being committed by that guarantee. My question is not just a vexatious inquiry.  The purpose of it is to ascertain to what extent the company has pledged the nation's credit to help this enterprise.</P>
      <P>I wish it every possible success, but I hold that the Dáil as the guardian of the people's money ought to know to what extent that money is being pledged for the development of this enterprise.  If the Dáil and the Government can openly, both through Parliament and through the Press, announce the amount of guarantees they have given to, for example, the Avoca copper mines, and publicly declare the amount so guaranteed, I know of no reason why there should be any secrecy about informing the Dáil, and the public generally, about the amount of money guaranteed to the Cork shipbuilding enterprise.  I see no reason why there should be any concealment of the amount of the guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the project is a good one and it is being helped by the Industrial Credit Company, it is all to the credit of the Industrial Credit Company that they have so helped an enterprise which promises to be a prosperous and economically rewarding undertaking. For the life of me, I cannot see what advantage is gained by witholding the information and I hope, having looked into the matter, the Minister will now tell us what is the amount of the guarantee.  If there is none, well and good.  Let us say so.  If there is, I think the Minister ought to tell the community to what extent their credit <Col N="1817" /> has been pledged in order to further this enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify the point raised by Deputy Sweetman?  I did not see the letter which the Minister wrote to Deputy Sweetman and I was not quite satisfied when discussing this Bill last week on Second Reading that the amount of moneys under guarantee were taken into consideration in assessing the total limit of £15,000,000.  Is that correct? Secondly, I would ask the Minister, with reference to the point mentioned by Deputy Norton, is there any limit to the sum which the Industrial Credit Company can advance to any one undertaking?  I expressed the view on the Second Stage that very large advances, like that given to the Avoca mines, should be by way of State guarantee and not come under the aegis of the Industrial Credit Company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be discourteous to the Minister but I should like to be clear about this.  On the 31st October last the amount due on guarantee was £366,000.  Are we to understand that has been reduced in the interim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it has been reduced to £150,000.  I think some of that, if <Col N="1818" /> not all, was paid in in the mean time. What Deputy Sweetman wrote to me about was that he felt that the Company was not legally bound to keep within the limits provided by legislation. I do not know about that point but, at any rate, I got a very definite statement from them and it is their procedure to keep within the limits and they have no intention of departing from that procedure.</P>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Norton was, of course, the old point.  First of all, I should perhaps say in the case of the copper mines, it was not money from the Industrial Credit Company. Any State guarantee must be published and must, in fact, be approved by the House.  That is a different matter because the amount in that case must be stated, but we are dealing here with the Industrial Credit Company and as I pointed out on the Second Stage of the Bill I regard the Industrial Credit Company as an ordinary credit company.</P>
      <P>I am sure that if we had private banks here or even joint stock banks that were prepared to do this business of, first of all, promoting and floating companies and lending money to companies and taking shares in companies, on a satisfactory basis so that no new concern worth while could claim that they were unable to get credit, this legislation would not have been brought in.  It was brought in to set up a company to do that type of business which it was felt by the Dáil was not being done satisfactorily up to that time.  It was regarded as a credit company in that sense.  Any person looking for credit to a bank or to a credit company is as a rule&mdash; some of them may not mind&mdash;very anxious to have their business kept confidential and they would object, I am sure, to having information given publicly of the amounts subscribed by the Credit Company by way of shares, by way of loan or by way of guarantee. I feel we must, therefore, regard this company as a credit company and we must regard its transactions as confidential and not to be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I have any more to say.  I am not accusing Deputy Norton of raising this in a vexatious <Col N="1819" /> way but it is a different form of approach and I think I have to hold, as far as I am concerned, that it is a credit company and therefore its transactions must be treated as confidential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an astonishing situation into which we are now drifting.  I always understood that the Industrial Credit Company was originally established as an underwriting company to underwrite capital issues where otherwise underwriting facilities would not be available and to underwrite such issues as it might seem quite clear would take a long time to market.  I think it is so and that the Industrial Credit Company caried in its portfolio a large part of the capital of the Cement Company.  I can recall an occasion upon which they were urged, in order to make capital available for underwriting work, to liquidate some of their existing holdings which the passage of time had made saleable and which the company had gone on carrying in their portfolio. That was done, and ownership was transferred to the public on the sale of the securities and the resultant capital used for further underwriting operations.</P>
      <P>I may misunderstand the Minister and if I do I should like to be corrected. This Bill significantly increases the capital of the company and significantly raises the power of the company to raise or borrow money by means of debenture or otherwise, and extends the limit of guarantee by the Minister from £5,000,000 to £15,000,000.  In the light of these developments, is it seriously suggested that Dáil Éireann, which provides all the money, should be told their credit is to be drawn upon almost indefinitely and they must not ask for whom, or by whom?  That does not seem to me to make sense at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures, as far as we can get them, show, if you look at the Industrial Credit Company's accounts for the period ending 31st October, 1958, the commitments in respect of undertakings by the company to provide financial assistance to industrial concerns amounted at that date to <Col N="1820" /> £2.56 million.  I understand from the Minister that the corresponding figure on the 30th April, 1959, is £7.26 million.  Are we to infer from that, or does the Minister say he is not prepared to tell us, that the eventuality has transpired, which was at one time thought unlikely, that the Verolme interests, having announced their intention to invest substantially in Cork harbour shipbuilding installations if the Dutch Government would allow the export of capital, have now discovered that the Dutch Government will not allow the export of any capital and that in fact what is happening is that the Verolme interests are investing our capital in a shipyard at Cork?  Is that the situation?  I am getting some help from the Deputy Lord Mayor of Cork who says that is not the situation Would it not be much simpler if some authority were to speak with authority and tell us what the situation is?</P>
    <P>Manifestly, the Minister must see that once this matter was raised on the Second Stage of the Bill and was further raised here, at some stage information must be made available to the public.  Or does the Minister agree with that?  Does he seriously say that we can proceed on the basis that nobody will know what the financing of the project in Cork is?  I cannot imagine, and I certainly dissent emphatically from the proposition, that there is to be unlimited lending powers and powers of guarantee which in fact, if not in theory, must ultimately be underwritten by the Exchequer for which this House is ultimately responsible without this House having the right at any stage to get any information as to the transaction involved.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, ask the Minister categorically two questions: Does the figure £7.26 million which he gives us as the correct figure for the 30th April 1959, in respect of commitments in respect of undertakings by the Industrial Credit Company to provide financial assistance to industrial concerns include whatever capital may be required for the Cork dockyard project? Does the Minister now inform the <Col N="1821" /> House that hereafter information about large capital transactions of this character, financed from the resources of the Industrial Credit Company, are not to be made available to Dáil Éireann but are to be regarded as confidential and unascertainable by any authority or committee of this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Minister has not denied that the Industrial Credit Company, and ultimately the State, are accepting liability in respect of the Cork shipbuilding project is clear evidence that, in fact, liability has been assumed by the Industrial Credit Company.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why transactions with the people's money, with the money of the State, are being enshrouded in such secrecy.  Nor can I understand why it is desirable to invest this whole transaction with such mystery because that can only do an immense amount of harm.  It is an extraordinary situation that Deputies can ascertain how every penny of State money is expended by the Government in their far-flung activities right through the economic field and right through the whole mechanism of Governmental expenditure, but cannot ascertain what may happen, or what happened, in respect of moneys where the Industrial Credit Company give a guarantee and which they may be required to fulfil at a later stage.  That guarantee may have to be fulfilled by the introduction of an Estimate or legislation in this House to provide for the payment of the sum so guaranteed in the event of the guaranteed enterprise not being a success.</P>
      <P>I dissent entirely from the proposition that where a company is established by means of a guarantee from the Industrial Credit Company, that transaction, involving the people's money, should be kept a secret from the Dáil and that the people should be kept in ignorance of the extent to which their credit has been pledged in respect of that guarantee because, as I said, if the company which gets the guarantee defaults, this House will have the responsibility of levying taxation on the people to make good the guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The analogy of a private bank has <Col N="1822" /> nothing whatever to do with this business, in my opinion.  Governmental expenditure, except in respect of £6,000 for the Secret Service, has always been the subject of question and answer in the Dáil and we were always able to get full information.  Now a new institution is being vested with powers which, according to the Minister, entitle it to traffic in the people's money and which will give no account whatever to the Dáil, or the people, of the manner in which the people's money and credit are being pledged.  I dissent from that proposition entirely. If a body like the St. Patrick's Copper Mines in Avoca can go to the Government for something in the vicinity of £1 million or £1½ million and that fact is publicly proclaimed, I see no reason why a foreign shipbuilding enterprise which comes here to engage in, no doubt, profitable activities and finds it necessary to approach the Irish people for money&mdash;because that is what they are doing although the approach is made to the Industrial Credit Company&mdash;should not be glad to say publicly that the Irish people have taken on this guarantee.</P>
    <P>What is the need for secrecy?  If our people are good and kind enough to guarantee the money why is the fact not acknowledged?  Our people do not, I am sure, want it concealed, and why should the beneficiaries seek any concealment of the fact that they were treated with this impressive financial generosity by our people, acting through the Industrial Credit Company? It is clear from the Minister's attitude that he is not going to give the information and I, therefore, want to put one question to him.  Will the Minister deny the statements which are in circulation in this city and elsewhere, that the Industrial Credit Company has guaranteed £5 million to the Dutch shipbuilding enterprise at Cork?  Will the Minister deny that? If it is denied, well and good, but are we then to assume that no guarantee whatever has been given to the Dutch enterprise?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as anxious as previous speakers to know what guarantee was given by the Industrial Credit Company in respect of the Cork <Col N="1823" /> dockyard, but I disagree entirely with the suggestion that the business of the Industrial Credit Company should be open to discussion by way of question and answer in this House.  It would be an extremely bad development if a concern borrowing money from the Industrial Credit Company should have its affairs discussed in this House.</P>
      <P>I hold the view that the Industrial Credit Company should not in effect undertake business of this type and that where a major loan involving £1 million, £2 million or £3 million is to be undertaken, or given, the proper procedure is that it should be given by way of State guarantee and the Minister should come to the House for approval of the sum involved.  I do not think that the Industrial Credit Company's affairs should be discussed, nor do I think the Minister should be obliged to give information as to the sum involved.  In saying that I may say I am as curious as anybody else as to what is involved.  It is disturbing that these rumours or suggestions are circulating in the country that the sum involved runs to the figure of £4 million or £5 million.  The way to tackle it is not to open up the affairs of the Industrial Credit Company to discussion, but to change the procedure.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask a question on that point.  The former trade loans section of the Department of Industry and Commerce was closed down about two years ago and its functions transferred to the Industrial Credit Company. Was it possible before that section was closed down to get information regarding loans made under the Trade Loans Guarantee Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; by quarterly statements laid on the Table of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that by transferring the functions of the trade loans section of the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;the transactions of which had to be made known to the House&mdash;to the Industrial Credit Company, we immediately closed up a source of information to the House.  That is wrong procedure. <Col N="1824" /> It would have been far better to deal with the type of loans which the trade loans section formerly undertook, by way of State guarantee in the same way as the Avoca Copper Mines loan&mdash; a substantial loan&mdash;was handled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In the discussion I had with the Minister in correspondence on the legal position the Minister in the last letter said to me:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The amount of £2,932,052, while not perhaps available within the existing resources of the country on 31st October last, was well within the statutory limitations on the loan and share capital of the company.</P>
      <P>That was so.  The Minister has now told us that the comparative figure now is £7,410,000 and that, as far as I can see, was, in the Minister's own words, not within the statutory limitation. The sum of £7.41 million was not within the statutory limitations until this Bill was passed.  If that is so, if I am correct in that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The company had liberty to raise £5 million by way of capital and £5 million by way of loan so they had £10 million at their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They had power to raise £5 million by way of capital. They already had raised £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure about that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of subtraction.  If I am wrong in saying that £7.41 million was in excess of the <Col N="1825" /> statutory limitations with what had gone already, as I understand the situation it is that one must take the amount of the guarantees and the amount of the commitments and add that amount of £7.41 million to what was already there and, by adding it to what was already there, I think you exceed the statutory limit.  I find it a bit difficult to understand what is being done on the 30th April because you cannot take all the figures as available on the 31st October as being exactly transferable to the 30th April.  On the 31st October last, £2 million of capital had been issued.  A sum of £1,800,000 of bank loan had been obtained.  That comes to £3,800,000.  If you add £3,800,000 to £7,400,000 you exceed the £10,000,000 which the Minister suggests was available as to £5 million capital and £5 million loan.</P>
      <P>On the face of it, it would seem that the commitments and guarantees were in excess of the statutory limitations on the 31st October last.  It may be that sometimes things are done in anticipation of legislation which should not technically be done but they are done with the consent of the Minister concerned so as to enable certain plans to mature before they are finally passed by this House.  That has objections, too, but that course would be far less objectionable than any deliberate excess of the statutory limitations.</P>
      <P>Apart from that technical aspect of it, I want to put the matter back where it was when we were increasing the capital of the Industrial Credit Company on the last occasion.  I think that was the occasion but certainly there was an occasion when we deliberately changed over from the trade loan basis to the Industrial Credit Company basis.  We were most specifically assured here at that time that the reason it was being done was because the system of trade loan examination, of trade loan committees, and so on, was a cumbersome system and that it took too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told also at that time that it involved a good deal of overlapping and duplication.  Deputy Norton can, from his experience, correct me if I am wrong.  An application was <Col N="1826" /> examined first by a trade loan committee. Then the report of that trade loan committee was vetted by the Department of Industry and Commerce and then, having been vetted by the trade loan committee and the Department of Industry and Commerce, if it got through that net, it came to the Department of Finance and was vetted by the staff there.</P>
    <P>The whole case made to us was that these three vettings constituted a cumbersome system, that it was undesirable and that it should be cut away.  There was never any suggestion under any circumstances that the large type of case would be covered up&mdash;I use the words &ldquo;covered up&rdquo; without any unpleasant intent&mdash;by the new procedure. I shall go further.  I have not had an opportunity of checking it but I think the Minister for Finance can quite easily check it up through his advisers. I think when the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or perhaps the Minister for Finance, came into this House and got express approval for the Avoca Copper Mines Guarantee it was on the stated basis by him that it was undesirable to utilise legislation as it was there for big cases of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is not absolutely certain but it was the most specific reason in the incorporation of a specific order and statutory commission in respect of the Avoca Copper Mines.  The rumours we hear in relation to the Verolme project far exceed the amount specified in the Avoca Copper Mines.  If a member of the Government, and particularly the present Taoiseach, considers it desirable to come to the House and to state in respect of the Avoca Copper Mines that the House and the country should be told the amount involved in that case, and have an opportunity of passing judgment on it, why have the <Col N="1827" /> Government now changed their mind in relation to the other project?</P>
      <P>Is it not the obvious solution that a limitation should be laid down in this House that no guarantee or no commitment of the people's money in any single case will be taken without express authority of the Dáil, perhaps by some type of Tabling Order?  Nobody wants to fiddle about in respect of trifling cases but when we are dealing with cases, say, of more than £250,000 the House and the country have the right to know how its funds are being pledged in cases of that size.  If the House and the country are not told in respect of cases of that size then I am afraid there will be an atmosphere that is unhealthy in the extreme.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister specifically to give the House the reason why the procedure has now been changed from what his colleague, the present Taoiseach, said before was desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This company was formed originally as an operating company but at the same time it had power to give loans and did in fact give loans from the beginning.  Therefore, the character of this company has not been changed very much as a result of any amending legislation. Its annual accounts are published, as Deputies are aware.  They are presented to the Dáil.  They show the total investments, loans, commitments, liabilities, and so on.  On the last occasion when we were speaking here I undertook to discuss with the company whether it would be possible to make these headings more informative than they are.  That is as much as I could undertake to do now.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of Parliamentary control, raised by Deputy Norton, Parliamentary control was exercised in passing the Bill which gave the Industrial Credit Company powers to do certain things.  That was done under the authority of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Parliament ever appreciated that loans of this magnitude would be made when it gave that authority.  I for one did not appreciate it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Was Parliament acquainted with the fact that it was likely that a £5 million guarantee would be given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the general principle underlying the industrial credit legislation and the powers that were given under it. Parliamentary control was exercised in giving this company discretion to make loans and to underwrite the shares of companies, and so on.  There is no generosity exercised by the company in any way.  The company exercises its judgment or discretion as to whether they would be justified in taking shares in a company, guaranteeing a loan to a company or making a loan to a company.  It is all done on a business basis and the company has actually succeeded in paying its way in carrying out its duties.</P>
      <P>As regards this company in Cork, I do not intend to deny or affirm that anything has been done for this company because I am long enough in politics to know that an astute politician like Deputy Norton would get all the information he wants by getting denials from me up to a certain level.  What he wants the information for, I do not know.  Deputy Norton says that withholding information from the public will do harm but surely the Deputy is not so naïve as to think that his conjectures and insinuations will not do harm.  Surely raising a matter like this and suggesting this company is getting large amounts and putting nothing in itself, and so on, will not do very much good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I made no mention about what they put in.  I do not know what they put in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not do much good for any cause.  I tried to keep to the principle of the case and to leave out individual cases.  I have tried to adhere to the principle that we must regard this as a credit company, that we must regard its transactions as confidential and that therefore we cannot get any information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question has been raised today which was not raised before, that perhaps there should have been a limit <Col N="1829" /> imposed so that the company would not have discretion to go above a certain amount.  That is a new proposal. There might be some justification for that and it is a matter that could be considered.  In any case, it will not, naturally, influence anything done in the past and if they have given a guarantee to any company, that will stand whatever legislation we may bring in of that type to put a limit on any loan or guarantee they might give in the future.</P>
    <P>As regards trade loans, as I explained last year when bringing in the Industrial Credit Bill there were trade loans under consideration in the Department and the Department proposed to continue to deal with those loans until they saw them through.  I am not sure if they have all been seen through but when everything is handed over to the Industrial Credit Company, I may have somebody asking me why such and such a trade loan was granted.  However, there may be certain transactions still going on in the Department of Industry and Commerce when this business is handed over to the company.  They do not intend to guarantee a loan but they make a loan, which is a simple matter.</P>
    <P>A point was raised by Deputy Sweetman in regard to the total assets at the disposal of the company and the total of its loans and guarantees. It had £15 million actually at its disposal. They were entitled under the legislation to raise £5 million by way of share capital, £5 million by way of guarantee from the Minister for Finance and £5 million by way of debenture, which is £15 million altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, I am taking it this way.  I can say this definitely: they were told by me they would get any money they needed as far as I was <Col N="1830" /> concerned and they could interpret that to mean I would guarantee up to £5 million, if they needed it.  They had that definite guarantee, and against that £15 million they had committed themselves to a total of £10.2 million, as pointed out by Deputy Sweetman. I think the company's board is very conscious of the limit to which they can go in regard to the total capital they are enabled to raise and the total guarantee they are entitled to call upon.  They are very conscious of the fact that they must not exceed that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount will be £25 million because there was £5 million by way of debenture before.  That is merged into the £15 million.  The total after this Bill goes through will be £10 million by way of capital and £5 million by way of loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, on the face of it, appears to be increasing the capital from £5 million to £10 million and it appears, on the face of it, to be increasing the existing borrowing power of £5 million on debenture to £15 million and leaving the £5 million guarantee.  That would make £30 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is £10 million and £15 million.  At the present time if they were to raise debentures, they would not be guaranteed.  Their power to raise debentures is gone in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made myself clear.  We are quite clear that the share capital is £5 million and it will be increased to £10 million.  The Minister states there is at present power to raise £5 million by debentures and power for the company to raise a separate £5 million by guarantee from the Minister for Finance. Is that correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That £10,000,000 becomes £15,000,000?  Why?  Because Section (d) is an extension, is it not, for the debenture part of it and does not change?  Perhaps, I should wait to discuss this technically under Section 3 but it is easier to clear the whole lot now.  Where is the phraseology in regard to the additional power?  The Minister says that the company had to raise £5,000,000 under guarantee by him.  That does not seem to be here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a guarantee in connection with employment either in the building stage or in the permanent stage?  In view of the expenditure of this money is the Company giving any guarantee in connection with the number temporarily or permanently employed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question.  I think the procedure is this. If a company is about to start business, it makes its case to the Industrial Credit Company.  It states its prospects and the employment it proposes to give and so on.  I do not think there would be a guarantee in regard to the employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should get those guarantees here in this House, particularly when there is such a large sum of money involved.  I think that the guarantees in connection with the employment of our people whom we <Col N="1832" /> are anxious to stop from emigrating should be given in this House and not through any private body.  The people should know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is of considerable importance.  It seems to me now that if this Bill is approved and the Minister's statements are not challenged, we shall be told later that we approved of this mechanism whereby the Industrial Credit Company can give private guarantees committing the people and the Government and that we consented to a situation of that kind.  I, for one, am not going to consent to it.  Where the people's money is involved and where there is a liability on the people ultimately to pay that guarantee into which the Industrial Credit Company enters on their behalf, then the public and the public representatives in the Dáil are entitled to know for what amount of money their credit has been pledged.</P>
      <P>I cannot for the life of me understand the secrecy about the business at all.  Previously, we had the Trade Loans Guarantee Act under which trade loans guarantees could be given. The trade loan guarantees and the amount of guarantee so given were publicised by a quarterly statement which was circulated to the Dáil and laid on the Table of the House.  The existence of it was proclaimed in the White Paper.  Deputies could look at these statements from time to time and see the amount of money so guaranteed. In addition to that, statements were published indicating the amount of these guarantees that had been repaid from time to time.  Of course, on top of that, whenever the person or firm so guaranteed defaulted, the Minister had to come to this House with a Supplementary Estimate and say that that investment was bad news and that the guarantee would have to be fulfilled.  The House was asked to pass a Supplementary Estimate in order to make good the amount lost in the guarantees so given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, for reasons of expedition and efficiency the trade loan guarantees procedure has been eliminated. Instead, the Industrial Credit Company <Col N="1833" /> is dealing with the type of guarantee for which the Trade Loans Guarantee Act was originally established with this difference&mdash;that once you go to the Industrial Credit Company for a guarantee, you go there in secrecy.  Nothing whatever is known about the conditions under which the guarantee is given, the amount of the guarantee or the period of the guarantee.</P>
    <P>That is now offered to us in substitution of a method whereby the people, through their representatives in Parliament, could know precisely the amount of money which they were committed to make good in the event of default by the firm or undertaking so guaranteed. I cannot understand why it is a correct and proper procedure for the Avoca copper mines, for example&mdash;I just mention that because it occurs to my mind&mdash;to make an application for a guarantee from the State, have that application publicly announced and have the amount of the guarantee publicly declared.  Yet that firm could carry on its activities in the ordinary way but when you come to this other undertaking&mdash;this Bill concerns the method by which the people's money is being committed and pledged&mdash;the shipbuilding undertaking&mdash;it might be any other kind of undertaking&mdash;complete secrecy is observed.</P>
    <P>There is no public proclamation of the amount they seek.  There is no indication as to the extent of the guarantee they are giving themselves as collateral security for what is being offered to them.  There is no indication as to the duration of the guarantee or any other conditions in connection with safeguarding the public guarantee and the implied public commitment. Why is there one kind of treatment for one firm&mdash;it is assumed that the Avoca copper mines can transact their business satisfactorily and efficiently with all the publicity&mdash;while in the case of this company it is assumed that it would wreck the whole company to declare the amount of the guarantee?</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has made a weak case for this new discriminatory procedure under which applications dealt with by the Industrial Credit Company will be surrounded by secrecy whilst, in the case I have mentioned, <Col N="1834" /> the floodlight of publicity was turned on the activities of the firm.  In the case of the Avoca copper mines, I think the Minister at the time said that this Company had gone to an Insurance Company; that the Insurance Company was prepared to make an advance to them of the amount necessary to tide them over whatever difficulties they then foresaw but that the Insurance Company itself wanted the State to stand in and back their advance.  To that extent, it was a kind of second guarantee but why should one firm be able to get this private secretive kind of treatment, whereas in the other cases the affairs of the companies concerned are subjected to the floodlight of publicity?</P>
    <P>The Minister made no case for the scheme of secrecy over which he is now prepared to stand.  It is quite possible for a situation to arise in which the people will never know of the extent of the guarantees given by the Industrial Credit Company but it is fantastic that in a small country like this we could create a piece of machinery which can pledge the people's credit in one company for approximately £5,000,000 and the representatives of the people in the Dáil will not be told whether there is any pledge, what is the amount of the pledge and the conditions under which the pledge has been given.  That is not democratic control of the people's money and I, for one, am not prepared to endorse it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be considered desirable to encourage this industry.  The repair and building of ships has been a great tradition in Cork harbour.  I played some part in encouraging the promoters of this company in its early stages.  I have no personal interest whatever in it, apart from that association with those who are coming here to promote a very welcome enterprise for our harbour and the country.  As it is a commercial proposition, depending on, I presume, the contracts they may get for the repair of ships and for the building of new ships, I do not see that it serves any purpose to demand any guarantee as to the actual labour content, beyond estimations, which are always desirable <Col N="1835" /> in these cases, in the course of the negotiations.</P>
      <P>There is not much point in bringing in an enterprise if it is not to have a substantial labour content in its operations. It is undesirable that these points should be raised at this stage. I know of cases where enterprises were actually driven away by queries and statements of that kind.  The principal point, at any rate, is that a start has been made, that a floating crane and a wharfside crane of a type not in Cork harbour before, have been erected; that some preliminary works have been undertaken and that a financial umbrella cover to enable that to go ahead has been, I think, mutually agreed upon.  I do not know that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacCarthy and Deputy Corry can fight out amongst themselves the desirability of raising, at this stage, guarantees as to the content of employment.  I am concerned much more with the principle and I am not very much concerned with the details of any agreement that may have been entered into between the Industrial Credit Company, the Government and the Verolme interests, but I think there is a very important principle at stake, that is, the ultimate financial control by Dáil Eireann of the resources of the Irish Exchequer. That is the point I am concerned about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is now Taoiseach, felt it his duty in relation to the private company of the Avoca Copper Mines to come to this House for specific authority to provide a substantial loan to that company.  It was something in the <Col N="1836" /> order of £4 million.  Was that not the amount involved?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>One and one quarter million pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One and one quarter million pounds, and he felt that that sum was of a character that imposed on him a duty to come to Dáil Eireann and get specific authority for it.  I want to go a step further.  If this procedure is to be acknowledged, I think the whole financial control of Dáil Eireann can be short-circuited.  Only a couple of days ago, we were dealing with the Air Navigation Bill in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Taoiseach, applied to the House for authority to raise the capital of Aerlinte to £10 million in contemplation of an outlay of approximately £6 million in respect of jet aircraft.</P>
      <P>As far as I understand, the Minister for Finance contends that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce had not wished to come and defend that proposition before Dáil Eireann, all he need have done was to get an individual to float a company to operate transatlantic air services and then send that individual to the Industrial Credit Company who would have guaranteed him&mdash;in the poetic words of Deputy MacCarthy&mdash;by an umbrella and would have said to him: &ldquo;Go away and buy the jet aircraft and if you have not got the money, we will provide it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely that is not a desirable development? The danger of all these procedures is that one drifts slowly step by step into a position that was never contemplated in the initial stages.  The Minister for Finance now says that the Industrial Credit Company was first established as an underwriting company but it had borrowing powers. My distinct recollection&mdash;and I have a pretty clear recollection of it&mdash;was that that matter was very comprehensively reviewed about 1949 and 1950.  Certainly, the view of the Department of Finance at that time was that the Industrial Credit Company was primarily an underwriting company.  I have a distinct recollection <Col N="1837" /> of the Industrial Credit Company being pressed at that time to realise a large volume of securities which they had and which were not negotiable at first but which in the course of time became negotiable.  They were disposed of on the Stock Exchange and the resources were put back into the Industrial Credit Company and used to back subsequent underwriting enterprises. My recollection was that at that time the lending powers of the Industrial Credit Company were practically moribund and were not used.</P>
    <P>Subsequently a development arose in which the lending powers were revived and used on a very limited scale.  As I understood it, the revival was designed to permit of the Industrial Credit Company assisting small private companies who were not in a position to float share issues and thus avail of the underwriting facilities of the Industrial Credit Company, and those powers began to be used.</P>
    <P>Now we have reached a stage in which the Industrial Credit Company feels entitled, under its general authority, to avail of Deputy MacCarthy's agreeable euphemism and that is to raise an umbrella.  But we have reached the stage at which Dáil Éireann can be told, not by the Minister for Finance but by Deputy MacCarthy, that there is an umbrella raised but if the Opposition asks the Minister for Finance what is the nature of the umbrella, the answer is: &ldquo;That is a secret and you should not ask; it is inimical to the project that you should ask.&rdquo;  Why is it inimical to a project in Cork that that query should be asked when it was not in the least inimical when it was asked in relation to the Avoca Copper Mines undertaking?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the project is in its initial stages and still in the course of negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, now, the mystery grows thicker and thicker.  I am told by the Minister for Finance that the commitments in respect of undertakings by the Industrial Credit Company to provide financial assistance to industrial concerns is now £7.26 millions. <Col N="1838" /> Deputy MacCarthy tells me that no agreement has been made at all.  Deputy Corry implies that an agreement has been made and he wants to know is there a condition in it imposing an obligation on the borrowing firm to provide a certain content of Irish employment in the enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy ever hear of anything being wrong with Deputy Corry's tongue that he could not talk for himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely when Deputy Corry talks, he expects somebody to listen to him?  In any case, we have now three different stories which seem to me to make a complete farce of our whole procedure.  I want to say emphatically that if the effect of this Bill is as I believe it to be, to provide a means for the Minister for Finance and the Government to avoid submitting to Dáil Éireann, for approval, undertakings which deeply involve the Exchequer, I strenuously object to the provisions of this Bill and wish to be recorded as doing so.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister the same question as Deputy Norton asked.  If the procedure in respect of the Avoca Copper Mines was proper&mdash;and that was the procedure adopted by the Minister's Government&mdash;why does he seek to adopt an entirely different and secret procedure in regard to the Cork enterprise?</P>
      <P>The third question I want to ask him is this: If he feels inhibited from giving the House any specific figure in regard to the guarantees made available to this project in Cork, is he free to tell the House what relation exists, what proportion exists, between the investment of this firm's own capital in this enterprise and the amount of the guarantee or advance made by the Irish Government to this enterprise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fourthly, is he in a position to say to us at this stage that, whatever advances the Irish Government may make to this enterprise, at no stage will a situation exist in which it will present itself to the public as a private enterprise, when in fact the bulk of the capital is money provided from public <Col N="1839" /> funds, through the medium of the Industrial Credit Company?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that a lot of water has gone under the bridge already.  I have in mind the establishment here of something called an Industrial Development Authority.  As I said here before, I know of two industries in my constituency, one of which went to the trouble of finding out why the export of their goods or the market for their goods abroad, suddenly ceased, and then came back here, started to put their industry in proper order and applied to this Industrial Development Authority for the usual grant that is supposed to accompany these things, and for a loan. I admit the employment would not be very great, but in a country town, it meant a lot.  If there were something between 35 and 40 to be guaranteed employment in the industry, that is a lot in a country town where there is a fairly big circle of unemployed.  That guarantee was given, but the grant was refused and the loan was refused, and I was refused the right of a Deputy to bring that matter up here for discussion, because in the case of the Industrial Development Authority nobody here was responsible for it.  I had the same experience some five or six months ago, in connection with another industry in the town of Fermoy.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be getting away from the section.  This provides for an increase in the capital of the Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, this is a departure from it.  I see no use in taking the argument that something is being done now that was not done before.  The Industrial Development Authority is not responsible to this House, democratically elected, for anything they do.  They can do it or refuse to do it and nobody can get any information about it, as they are in what I may call a closed cell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am deeply concerned about this matter, as it is in my constituency. I know the amount of employment which has been given fairly constantly there since Irish Shipping took over. <Col N="1840" /> I am deeply concerned, as are all Deputies, with stemming the tide of emigration.  As far as my responsibility goes, and backed by the confidence of my people for the past 32 years, I have no hesitation in regard to any guarantee that can be given, so long as I know that the result of that guarantee will be that so many hundred Irish people will be employed at home, who otherwise would have to go to a foreign country.  That should be the underlying principle of any money expended here.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the employment which will be given.  If any firm came along to apply for an amount like £5,000,000, surely they told somebody something as to the amount of permanent employment they would give for that money.  I take it that would be the underlying principle which would concern any people and any Government, as to the manner in which the money was to be expended. It is all very well for Deputy MacCarthy, who represents a different constituency.  I know a big firm which came in.  I also know there were 50 people employed there who are not employed today&mdash;they were dismissed last week.  I am deeply concerned about this as far as employment is concerned.  That is why I am anxious to know what statement was made in regard to first, the employment to be given in the construction of the dock and, secondly, the permanent employment to be given afterwards.</P>
    <P>I know it is a big thing and can mean a lot to the people if it succeeds, but I remember other things also.  I saw the old dock built and I saw the employment given there in the building of it.  I remember, when I came into this House as a young fellow, the guarantees that were asked in regard to employment in it.  If any Deputy cares to go to the trouble of going back to the records for 1927, 1928 and 1929, he will find that something like 55 per cent. of the wages was to be subsidised by the Government. Those are things to be looked at.  I saw that dockyard afterwards sold for scrap and a gentleman here in Dublin making at least £30,000 or £40,000 out of it.</P>

      <P>This is a dockyard being started again in the same spot and I am deeply concerned about it, from the point of view of employment of my people locally in their own country.  I should like to hear something from the Minister about the number to be employed in this.  Is there any estimate of the number?  I remember an estimate given here by the present Taoiseach a few months ago, when making a statement here, I think on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce or something of that description.  That was an estimate of something around 1,800.  This will be a big thing for the future of the country.  It will probably mean that 1,800 families will be kept at home. I would be prepared to go to any lengths to have that, but I should like to know, in the open, where we stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacCarthy mentioned that this was just an ordinary commercial transaction.  I suggest the whole kernel of the discussion is that it is not an ordinary commercial transaction.  This is what has been termed an umbrella guarantee so that, in the event of the promoter of the dockyard venture, Mr. Verolme, not being able to take funds out of Holland, the Industrial Credit Company would supply the deficit.  That is not the type of transaction I visualised that the Industrial Credit Company&mdash; at least as I understood its functions in the past&mdash;should undertake.  If assistance to Avoca and the Dundalk Engineering Company&mdash;two projects which come to mind&mdash;was discussed and approved here, the same procedure should have been followed in connection with the Cork Dockyard project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in the uncomfortable position of being asked to pass this Bill, substantially increasing the capital and the borrowing power of the Industrial Credit Company, not knowing in the future for what purpose these moneys will be expended.  In effect, an additional guarantee or subvention or assistance in one form or another could <Col N="1842" /> be given to the very same project in Cork.  It is quite possible that if the company were started with a capital of £1 million, the Industrial Credit Company, of its own volition, could give another £2 million.  It is also possible that they might not be called on to give any money to it, if the necessary funds can be got out of Holland, but they have given this umbrella guarantee and I take it that the Minister stands over it.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister has there been any contact between the Minister for Finance and the Industrial Credit Company in respect of the Cork Dockyard transaction.  Has this umbrella guarantee been given completely on the authority of the directors of the Industrial Credit Company without any advice, encouragement or suggestions emanating either from the Minister's Department or the Department of Industry and Commerce?</P>

I have no reason to believe that this is anything but an ordinary commercial transaction. What that commercial transaction may be and how much they intend to lend, I do not know, but we should not assume it is not an ordinary commercial transaction.  They are an independent body.  They do not seek <Col N="1843" /> advice and I do not think they take advice from a Minister either.  I have not tried them but I do not believe they would.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Sweetman's point about the amount of money available to the company now and what will be available if the Bill is passed, the position at the moment is that they can raise £5 million in shares, £5 million in loans guaranteed by the Minister for Finance and £5 million in debentures not guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  That is £15 million.  When this Bill goes through, they will be in a position to raise £10 million in shares, £15 million both in debentures not guaranteed by the Minister for Finance, loans guaranteed by the Minister for Finance and &mdash;a new item&mdash;loans given to the company by the Minister for Finance. There is no power for the Minister to give loans at the moment, but he can do so, if this Bill is passed.  That makes a total of £25 million.</P>
      <P>The Avoca Mines have been mentioned.  There was, of course, a difference in procedure.  The reason the Avoca Mines loan came before the Dáil was that a State guarantee was given.  Under the Act a State guarantee must be covered by a resolution of the Dáil.  I do not know whether the Avoca Mines ever applied to the Industrial Credit Company or, if they applied, whether they were refused or not.  At any rate, the procedure adopted by them was to get a State guarantee and that had to be brought before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial development depends on many factors, but a very important one is capital.  The commercial banks here have always held that they were not the proper medium through which capital should be subscribed by way of shares to companies or through <Col N="1844" /> which long term loans should be made. In fact, last year, they agreed to make a loan to the Industrial Credit Company to carry on that particular type of business in which they did not interest themselves.  It only goes to show that there is a need for an institution of this kind to deal with the financing of public companies, whether by way of share capital or loan.</P>
    <P>This company was set up many years ago.  There is no change whatever in either principle or policy in this amending Bill.  Whatever policy was pursued before is the policy being pursued now, and whatever powers they had to make loans without reference to the Minister are there still. They were there, as a matter of fact, when Deputy Norton was Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1954 to 1957 and he never raised the slightest objection.</P>

And he should know.  Of course the Industrial Credit Company do not seek formal sanction in relation to these projects.</P>

But, when the Minister gets up here and says quite categorically, as he did a moment ago, that he did not know what the Industrial Credit Company were doing in that respect, and that no Minister for Finance would have known it, I want to say quite categorically that, from my knowledge of the manner in which the Department of Finance, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Industrial Credit Company operated during the three years in which I was Minister for Finance, the Minister is not telling the House or the country the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that I regard it, and always will regard it, as the duty of the Industrial Credit Company, when they are dealing with a sum of £5,000,000, to <Col N="1848" /> have in such circumstances consultation with the Government, whether it be a Government of which I am a member or the Government of which the Minister is a member.  It should always be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in that last outburst has been guilty of the most contemptible misrepresentation. It is hard to believe that it was accidental. It is hard to believe that it was made in the heat of the moment.  The Minister is deliberately attempting to misrepresent the attitude of certain Deputies here.  So far as I am concerned, I am looking at this matter not from the standpoint of the enterprise concerned.  I wish it well.  I wish every other such enterprise well.  It is just an accident that this happens to be a shipbuilding firm.  It could be any other kind of firm.  It may in future be some other kind of firm.</P>
      <P>The net point at issue here is that, while the Minister says certain Deputies are making &lsquo;penny&rsquo; points, if the information available in this city is correct the people's credit is being committed to the extent of £5,000,000. while the Minister may not notice any difference between one penny and £5,000,000, the fact of the matter is that the people may ultimately be called upon to make good the full extent of the guarantee.  A number of enterprises in this country were previously guaranteed under legislation and the people had to make good the money by taxation.  They may have to do the same here, or at some future date with some other enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net point is that, if the people's credit is being pledged to the extent of £5,000,000, as is being alleged, in connection with this enterprise, then we ought to know from the Government &mdash;Parliament ought to know&mdash;to what extent and under what conditions the people's credit is being pledged.  Nobody wants to harm this enterprise.  The Minister wants now to make this an issue between Deputies and the enterprise.  That is a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts.  The issue is between the Deputies and the Minister and the Minister's method of administration. We are entitled in this House, as representatives <Col N="1849" /> of the people, to know to what extent and under what conditions the people's credit is being pledged, in relation to this enterprise, just as we shall be entitled to know in respect of future enterprises which will, presumably, be treated in the same secretive way.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with the Industrial Credit Company taking pride in whatever guarantee they have prudently given.  So far as the enterprise is concerned, it ought to be pleased that there was an Irish finance house willing to give such a guarantee, a guarantee which apparently it could not get from any bank in the Netherlands. But they can get it here.  If we give it, we are entitled to say that these facilities are available to people, not merely to one but to all, and we ought to blazon that forth as an attraction to induce people to establish industries here.  But Parliament should at all times be told and the consent of Parliament should at all times be secured. Parliament should at all times be told, even if it only means acquainting Parliament of what is being done.  There should be no question of cloaking what the Industrial Credit Company is doing.</P>

      <P>Very well&mdash;to the Dr. James Ryan tactics.  But I am quite inured to them.  They roll off me like water off a duck's back.  They do not make the slightest effect on me.  The Minister has advanced a truly astonishing proposition; that is, that where the <Col N="1850" /> Industrial Credit Company proposes an individual loan of £5,000,000 and has borrowed the entire amount from the Minister for Finance, he would regard it as entirely improper for the Industrial Credit Company to discuss with him the purpose for which they propose to lend that £5,000,000.  Now, is that a reasonable proposition?  Can any Deputy in his right mind endorse the proposition that we should set up under statute a company which has the right to go to the Minister for Finance, borrow £5,000,000 from him and, if asked by the Minister to what purpose they propose to apply this, reply: &ldquo;We shall not tell you.  You have no business to inquire.&rdquo;  If that is the situation, the administration of the Department of Finance has gone mad and, of course, it is not the situation and we all know it is not the situation.  The ridiculous part of it is that the Minister is prepared to get up and say that it is the situation and we are all precluded by the rules of order of this House from appropriately describing that statement that he has made to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly, the House should not be bluffed, bullied or insulted by the Minister for Finance into receding from the position that the ultimate control of public finance should remain with Dáil Éireann.  I refuse to be blackmailed by allegations that I am concerned to hinder industrial development in this country into receding from the position that this House should retain in its hands the ultimate control of public finance. Therefore, I consider myself not only entitled, but in duty bound, to press on the Minister two queries: (1) If there has been a commitment to provide financial assistance to this industrial concern in Cork, has there been any corresponding commitment by the promoters to invest a corresponding sum in this enterprise?  I think we are entitled to know that and we ought to be told.  (2) We were informed by the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce that, at a certain stage in the preliminary negotiations, the promoters of this enterprise told him that a situation might arise that their abundant supplies of capital would <Col N="1851" /> not be available owing to the Dutch Government refusing permission to export it from the Netherlands and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce in Ireland replied to the promoters that, in that event, he would guarantee that the capital would be made available even though the Dutch authorities refused to change their attitude.</P>
    <P>I think we here are entitled to inquire how is it possible that the Dutch Government who, I understand, at present control one of the hard currencies of the world, find any difficulty in releasing £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 for an industrial enterprise of this kind when, in their daily transactions, hundreds of millions must be passing in the course of international trade.  I find it extremely difficult to believe that the Dutch Government could produce any valid justification for withholding investment of such a sum abroad, bearing in mind that in this country, so far as I know, if anyone wanted to invest £2,000,000, £3,000,000, £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 abroad in the morning, he is perfectly free to do so, and it is fantastic to compare our financial resources with the resources of the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>It may be that if we desired to invest so large a sum in certain continental countries or in the United States of America, permission would have to be got from the Department of Finance but, as between here and Great Britain such a transfer could be made without let or hindrance or between ourselves and, I believe, any member of the Sterling Payments Union.  It is very hard to believe that the Dutch Government would have any valid difficulty in making it possible for a Dutch national to transfer a relatively insignificant capital sum of that kind, bearing in mind the total capital investments of the Netherlands population.  I wonder if any representations were made by us to the Netherlands Government or if that was considered an appropriate procedure in this situation.</P>
    <P>I think it is reasonable to ask the Minister these questions.  I have not the slightest doubt that it is not only <Col N="1852" /> reasonable but urgently necessary to insist that, in our view, commitments of a substantial character&mdash;I accept the figure mentioned by Deputy Sweetman although I do not suppose that any of us would cavil if the Minister wished to vary the sum slightly upwards or downwards from £250,000; but sums in excess of that&mdash;should be reported to Dáil Éireann at some stage.  Secondly, I think the Minister, if he experiences a difficulty in stating what specific sum is comprised in what Deputy MacCarthy describes as the umbrella, at least should be able to tell us what relation there is between the investment of the promoters of this enterprise and the amount made available to them by the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I would suggest to the Minister that he would abandon the hope that by insolent abuse he will deter any responsible Deputy in this House from saying and continuing to say what he considers it to be his duty to say here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word on my own behalf.  My name was not mentioned by the Minister but I think I can say that, while disagreeing with the proposition that the business of the Industrial Credit Company should be made public, I certainly was as critical as any of the other Deputies who spoke about the method by which this Cork dockyard project was to be financed.  I personally would not wish that any criticisms which I made, and which were intended to be in a constructive, if critical, vein, might be construed as either an attack on the Government or in any way desiring to hinder what I hope will be, and what we all hope will be, a very successful project, not only for Cork, but for the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's statement that this is a normal commercial transaction.  Any transaction involving what has been termed an umbrella guarantee, that may run into several <Col N="1853" /> million pounds, was never, as I understand it, envisaged when the Industrial Credit Company was originally set up and when its status and powers were amended by subsequent legislation, including the Bill which is before us today. I think that is a most unusual transaction and I persist in and repeat my view that that transaction should have been handled by way of State guarantee or under some similar procedure whereby it could be discussed in the House and approval given in the way that we approve Money Bills in the House.</P>
    <P>I am deeply disturbed by the attitude which the Minister has taken in this whole matter and I would like to put on record my own personal protest at the conclusions he has apparently drawn from the criticisms I have expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say only one thing.  I do not care what the Minister says about me.  In politics, one has to acquire a thick skin.  What he did say implied that I criticised the chairman and other directors of the Industrial Credit Company.  I want to say categorically that the Minister is telling an untruth when he states that the chairman was ever deterred, or interfered with, in the carrying out of his duties.</P>

      <P>That is what the Minister said a couple of minutes ago. I want to make it quite clear and beyond question that the chairman was never interfered with.  I also want to make it quite clear that it is fantastic nonsense to suggest that when the discussions were going on, prior to the preparation of this Bill, the Industrial Credit Company would not disclose to the Department of Finance and to the Department of Industry and Commerce the projects, and the approximate amount of those projects, which made this Bill necessary.  That is not suggesting in any way that there was any interference by the Minister or the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the affairs and functions of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not so allege, but I do state categorically that it is the duty of the <Col N="1854" /> Minister and his advisers, and I am sure it was a duty that was fulfilled, that when the House was to be asked to finance a number of projects, as far as I can see, to the amount of £20 million, the Industrial Development Authority gave to the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce an outline of the projects for which that money was necessary.  If they did not, both the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Commerce should and ought to have asked for it before they came in here with such a proposal.  I am positive that they did ask for it and that if the Minister looks at his files, he will see the information there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to have any misunderstandings about the relationship between the Departments, the Ministers and the Industrial Credit Company.  Either I have misunderstood what the Deputy said or he has misunderstood what I said.  The Deputy, on a former occasion, complimented me on two of the directors of that Board.  It is a rather good board, well able to do its own business. It is a good board, put there in order that it could transact its business in a purely commercial way.</P>
      <P>What I did say was that I had never asked them what they were going to do about any certain proposition.  I never asked them or tried to influence them in any way or give them any advice and I said that I did not think they would take advice, if I offered it.  I know the Departments are in the same position.  They have never given advice, nor were they ever asked for it.  Whatever the Board have done in the past, they have done without coming to us. I do not deny that if I asked for information about what has been done, I would get it, but I have not asked for it.  The Department may have that information but I have never asked for it, and even if I did have the information, I would feel it wrong to give it to the House.  I do not think that I need go back on the reasons for that.  I have often stated them in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appealed to Deputy Dillon, when I was speaking before, to consider <Col N="1855" /> whether, in making an attack on the Government, he was going to injure other people.  He called that corner-boy tactics.  A Deputy who cannot give any other answer in debate lowers himself by calling me a corner-boy merely because I asked him to remember that by attacking the Government he might injure people in the way in which he attacked the Government in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have that effect in the giving of more money to the company, but it could not be said otherwise that this Bill was in any way a change of policy or principle. The principle and the policy underlying this Industrial Credit Company have been the same from the beginning, and there was no change in the time of the Coalition Governments or in our time but the amount of money going to them has been increasing all the time.  It is wrong to give the impression that there is any change of principle or policy in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated that I think it would be wrong to make this transaction public.  If we were to give way in this case, it is quite obvious that any set of Deputies could come along in a few months' time and raise the question of another company and insist on the information being given. There would be no limit to the demand for information and it would grow until the whole thing became <Col N="1856" /> public.  I think it would be a great drawback and deterrent to those having dealings with a credit company, if they thought that these transactions might be made public at any time.</P>

      <P>Is that not the whole difference between us?  Is that not why we are saying to you that when we get into transactions of these dimensions, the right procedure is the Avoca Mines procedure?  We want to advance £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 to a private company for a specific purpose and thus isolate such a transaction from the ordinary day-to-day dealings of the Industrial Credit Company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get back to a calm atmosphere if I can.  This Bill, if you like, makes effective a change in policy and the Bill itself is the change in policy.  The policy was there, clearly and specifically laid down by the Minister's colleague, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Taoiseach.  It was on that policy that the Trade Loan Guarantee procedure was dropped.  The policy was clearly expressed by the present Taoiseach, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, that in respect of a transaction of the size of the Avoca Mines transaction it was proper to come to this House and not to deal with it through the ordinary channels.  That is the whole case I am making in respect of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The trade loan procedure was dropped because it was too cumbersome, on the policy then laid down by the present Taoiseach, and it was fair enough to drop the cumbersome trade loan procedure on the policy laid down that big cases, such as the Avoca Mines case, were going to come to this House. It was on that basis that the trade loan procedure was dropped and that the Avoca Mines was written into the State Guarantees Bill.  That was fair enough.  One might have had argument from time to time as to what was a big case, to use the present Taoiseach's words.  That was obviously a matter of argument, a matter of opinion.  There could be two opinions but my whole objection to this Bill is that the policy has been changed and now, because of the manner in which this Bill is phrased&mdash;not because of the amounts but because of the manner&mdash;and the way the transaction is to be carried out, we are moving away from the policy that was there before.  The policy that was there before was that the Industrial Credit Company dealt with the small cases and it was Trade Loan Guarantees which dealt with bigger ones, though they very often also dealt with small cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the other way around, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Some big trade loan guarantees came up from time to time. The policy has also been taken by this <Col N="1858" /> House, over the years, that in relation to certain dealings with State moneys it was necessary, in the formation of all of these State-sponsored bodies, to get specific legislation for them rather than rely on the powers contained in the Companies Act.  Now the situation is that we are not to have the process involved in the State Guarantees Act, that we are not to have the process involved in the Trade Loan Guarantees Act, and that we are to have everything done under those two Acts heretofore done by the Industrial Credit Company without anyone ever being told. Is that not a fact?  I think that is a bad procedure.</P>
      <P>I entirely agree, as I said dozens of times, that up to the point of negotiation it may be undesirable to give such information but, when a point of definition comes, when there are very substantial sums of public money involved, I think the Taoiseach was entirely right, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, in saying that he was coming to the House in the case of the Avoca Copper Mines because it was desirable that a transaction of that size should be disclosed to the House. Mind you, in the case of the Avoca Copper Mines it could have been done under the existing law without coming to the House, but he was right to come to the House.  All that I ask, all that my colleagues ask, is that the same policy would be continued and, if it is not being continued, specific reasons should be given to satisfy us and the public as to why it is not being continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we get from the Minister this explanation?  He will not tell us whether this company is getting a guarantee, or whether they are putting any money in themselves, and he will not deny that the company got a guarantee for £5,000,000.  Will he answer this one question: who is responsible for seeking secrecy in connection with this matter?  Is it the case that the Industrial Credit Company do not want to disclose to anybody, including Parliament, that they pledged £5,000,000 of the nation's credit, or is a firm coming in here&mdash; this firm today and there may be others from time to time&mdash;that can make a request to the Industrial Credit <Col N="1859" /> Company saying: &ldquo;Please guarantee us for £1,000,000 or £5,000,000 but do not let your Parliament know and do not, under any circumstances, tell your people that you are guaranteeing us the money?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is that the principle for which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are standing, that the potential industrialist, no matter from what country in the world he comes, can say to the Industrial Credit Company: &ldquo;Guarantee me for £1,000,000 or £5,000,000 and do not disclose that to your Parliament, to your people, or to the Minister for Finance for the time being, if he asks you anything about it&rdquo;?  Is that to be Ministerial policy for the future?  If that is represented to be Parliamentary control over State funds and State moneys it is indistinguishable from the kind of things that are done where no Parliament functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest there is a third reason to which Deputy Norton has not adverted, and which it is in the power of the Minister himself to remedy.  I think the Minister has got himself into this mess.  He has got himself into this tangle of apparent secrecy because he himself has adopted the wrong procedure.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the Minister's view that you cannot ask the Industrial Credit Company, under its new functions of being the virtual universal distributor of industrial credit, to reveal all the details of each individual transaction it undertakes, but the Minister says now that if he gives Parliament the information and the facts about one isolated large transaction, that would become a precedent and, on that precedent, he will be pressed to tell us ultimately about all the transactions, down to the very smallest in which the Industrial Credit Company engages, and that will manifestly make the operations of the Industrial Credit Company impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe if the Minister would adopt Deputy Sweetman's suggestion and say: &ldquo;I have given a direction to the Industrial Credit Company that they are not to give guarantees or enter into transactions in excess of a certain sum <Col N="1860" /> without specific authority from me&rdquo; a great deal of the difficulty that has arisen would be overcome, especially if he went on to say that: &ldquo;In respect of enterprises requiring large sums, I propose to adopt the procedure adumbrated by Deputy Lemass when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of the Avoca mines&mdash;that is, where the State is asked to guarantee or provide a sum in excess of a certain figure, I shall come to Dáil Éireann and through the appropriate procedure ask their specific authority for a guarantee of these dimensions.&rdquo; Then there will be no grumble.  I believe that there may not have been any specific or urgent request from the promoter, nor any stipulation by the Board of the Industrial Credit Company to maintain secrecy.  I think the Minister has created the difficulty for himself because he says: &ldquo;If I do not maintain secrecy in this case which I have allowed to be handled by the Industrial Credit Company, where is the limit to be drawn?  Every transaction will be investigated by Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest if the third course is the correct one he has the remedy in his own hands.  I do not believe anybody here is concerned to be unreasonable or to say to him: &ldquo;Here we are at the end of our Parliamentary session.  You cannot take steps to remedy that here and now.&rdquo;  If the Minister said that he accepted the view that we ought to have some limit on confidence, that he proposed to separate this transaction from all others and, in the ordinary fashion, proposed to apply the same procedure to it as was applied to the Avoca mines business, the House, having differentiated this from all other transactions, and that he would give the House certain limited information and when he brought forward legislation on the Avoca mines lines in the autumn he would give any further information the House wanted, I believe everybody would be quite content. I do not think anybody here claims, or pretends to insist, that the House should investigate closely every individual transaction of the Industrial Credit Company no matter what its size or circumstances.</P>
    <Col N="1861" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The positive proof of that is that the House never discussed any advances under the Trades Loans (Guarantee) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and never wanted to.  I think that probably the Minister has got himself into this tangle.  If that is the situation he has a remedy which is perfectly simple and which will allay everybody's anxieties and restore the agreed situation to which, as far as I know, everybody in all parts of the House has been an assenting Party. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that without getting cross with anybody and, in so far as he can, insulting anybody, he should consider a reasonable <i>via media</i> which would remove all our difficulties and restore an atmosphere of calm instead of the atmosphere of considerable acrimony which he has sought to engender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not be confused about the Avoca mines.  The Avoca mines got a loan from a certain finance company on condition that the State would guarantee it.  Under the law, the Dáil had to be told about that; there was no deliberate change between one case and the other.  Under the law, the case we are discussing now need not have been discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is wrong because I believe they could have operated under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act and they could have been given the money there.  The then Tánaiste made it clear that that was so at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but the agreement between the mine company and the insurance company concerned was for a State guarantee.  That is how it came to me.  Having considered it, I said I was prepared to give that, but I said it meant it would have to be scheduled under the State Guarantees Act and that meant a resolution in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But otherwise the Minister could have given it under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act instead of giving it under the State Guarantees Act, without coming to the Dáil.</P>

    <Col N="1862" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but I do not agree with Deputy Sweetman that larger loans were given under the State Guarantees Act than were given by the Industrial Credit Company&mdash; that is in connection with another thing.  I think if Deputies looked back over the amount of money given by way of trade loans over the last four or five years they would see it was extremely small&mdash;I think about £200,000 over five years or something small anyway.  So far as I know I understand fairly large loans were given over the years by the Industrial Credit Company.  However, that is only giving my opinion as against the Deputy's and it has no great significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to get the record right&mdash;I did not think these were in loans.  I think the bigger loans given by the Industrial Credit Company were given by way of underwriting capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so but that is only my impression and it is of no great importance.  I want to make one other point against this. Suppose I were driven to this&mdash;which, I may say, I am not&mdash;I would put a clause into this Bill, or a Bill next Autumn, to the effect that details of any loan or guarantee over £1 million, say, would be eventually laid on the Table of the House.  First, when it is laid on the Table does it not really mean that the 147 Members of the Dáil have to go through the same consideration as the six or seven sitting on the Board as to whether it should be given or not?  I do not see the object of that, unless the Dáil will have the option, at least, of discussing the matter and saying it should or should not be given.  We shall have some Deputies saying it should be given and some saying it should not and you will have the same sort of discussion as you would have by a board of directors as to whether the loan should be given or not.  No doubt that would be very detrimental to the proposition concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, if I were dealing with it, is it not obvious that a person might come along in six months' time and <Col N="1863" /> want £50,000 for a very desirable proposition? He wants to go to the Industrial Credit Company but his friend says to him: &ldquo;Do not go; that will be made public in six months' time.&rdquo;  He will say: &ldquo;No, not when it is not more than £1 million.&rdquo;  Then the friend will say: &ldquo;The Minister had to give in on that limit of £1 million and to the next Parliament he will have to give in to a limit of £800,000 or £500,000.  It will all be published; there is no doubt about that.&rdquo;  I am sure that would be a consideration with applicants in the future&mdash;the fact that we had decided to make this thing public at all.  The only cure, as far as I can see, is to exclude them altogether and say the company will not lend more than a certain figure and have it done another way.  That, probably, would be a method of doing it but to me the rule suggested for them is a very bad one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that not come hard to us from the present Minister for Finance?  We fought him for three days in this House to persuade him that retrospective action should not be allowed in fiduciary matters.  Surely we are the last people to whom the Minister should say a situation might arise in which people would have got ground for saying: &ldquo;In a year, he will go back on the transaction.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that in regard to new applicants.  Somebody will say to new applicants: &ldquo;Beware; it will have to be published some time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It never could happen that a transaction consummated with the Minister for Industry and Commerce or with anybody else on certain terms could have these terms unilaterally changed by resolution of this Parliament.  That would be unthinkable.  Certainly on this side of the House, we have indicated that principle most energetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall go a long way with the Minister in saying that the confidential character of the transactions with the Industrial Credit Company should be sacrosanct.  That is why I think it is necessary to say to the Dáil: &ldquo;You are giving this Board of Directors wide <Col N="1864" /> discretion but the understanding is that they will not go beyond a certain point, be it £250,000 or £300,000.&rdquo; If something arises where in respect of which a very large sum is required, then the Government will approach the Dáil and place the facts before us. I should be prepared to say that if people require so large a sum, they must not ask for that degree of confidence.  If Imperial Chemical Industries want to raise £5 million or £10 million, they must publish a prospectus and, unless they give the fullest possible information, they are liable to prosecution.</P>
    <P>I remember one old gentleman whose family were ship owners in England&mdash;he had the most respectable antecedents&mdash;who wanted to get a couple of millions from the people of England and, because he did not give every jot and tittle of information in his prospectus, he got six months in jail.  Is that not so?  If people want large sums of money from the public, either by way of subscription or through the conduit pipe of Parliament, it is not unreasonable to ask them to lay all the facts before the public and, on the merit of those facts, to seek public finance.</P>
    <P>That is the essential difference which I have often laboured in this House, between a public company which can see its way to approaching the public for finance, either by way of subscription to shares or Government loan, and the position of a small family company which does not feel free to open up its confidential affairs to the public and to float stock.  I have often argued with the Minister for Finance that provision should be made for such a company. I think, by analogy, the Industrial Credit Company should have discretion within a certain limit to meet the financial requirements of industrial enterprises in this country, but that where those requirements exceed a certain sum, then the particular company should be required to provide the same information to the public, as any public company, in Great Britain or Ireland or anywhere else which is making an offer of shares, is required to make.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Finance is <Col N="1865" /> unconsciously adumbrating a very revolutionary and dangerous principle. He says that if we require the board of this company to submit for approval to Dáil Éireann any transaction in excess of £1 million, to take a round figure, what would happen is that there would be the same kind of discussion among the 147 Deputies here as that which took place between the seven members of the board.  If you follow that to its logical conclusion, you might as well wind up Dáil Éireann altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the board, one or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not comment on the source of that suggestion.  I was going to pursue the point that by analogy, the decisions of the Government are reviewed in Dáil Éireann, and the difference between our system of government and the authoritarian systems of government is that we have a Parliament and they have not.  If we are to follow the Minister's thought to its logical conclusion, there is not any need for Parliament at all.  Backed by the wisdom of a distinguished Civil Service, the Government could take all the decisions for us, and we will bow our heads in respectful assent and, in the knowledge of the wise advice the Government have, abdicate our claim to make our voices heard.  That is not a course of conduct which I am prepared to recommend to the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not presumption on our part to suggest that where transactions in public money reach a certain size, it is reasonable for this Dáil to claim the right to review the decision of a board of directors or of the Government.  I am not asking the Minister to bring any decision of this board of directors before Dáil Éireann.  I see his difficulty. He says: &ldquo;If I bring one, I may ultimately be required to bring them all.&rdquo; Therefore I say to him: Do not bring them, but do not authorise this board to operate any transactions of these dimensions.  Leave to this board transactions of moderate dimensions in respect of which we are prepared to make a global delegation of our rights, that is to say, we will give a global sum of money on the understanding that <Col N="1866" /> they do not deal with individual cases in excess of a certain limit and we leave them a discretion within that global sum.  If you want to advance large sums to individual companies or to guarantee large sums to individual companies, come to Dáil Éireann under another procedure and impose upon a company which seeks that larger accommodation exactly the same obligation as they would be required by company law to discharge if they sought that accommodation by way of the issue of shares to the public.</P>

      <P>Would there be any objection in practice to requiring the Industrial Credit Company, where transactions of a very substantial or unusual character are involved, to consult with the Minister?  I should be adverse to putting down any maximum figure, say, £250,000, because there might be some worthwhile development for which an advance of £300,000 was required.  It is very hard to have a line of demarcation in regard to sums of money.  There might be a principle, if not written into the Bill, at least implied, that, where very substantial sums of money are involved or guarantees of an unusual character carrying certain contingencies, the board would be required to consult with the Minister to decide whether, in fact, it was competent or desirable that it should undertake that type of business, with the Minister the deciding factor in the case.  If he decided it was the type of business they should underwrite, the scheme would be proceeded with and if not, he would proceed by State guarantee or otherwise to find the finance.</P>

      <P>The Minister says if he gives way in this instance, he will have to bring all such cases, irrespective of the amount of guarantee, to the House and that in the House then, the 146 Deputies will subject the application to the same process as it was subjected to by the Industrial Credit Company.  That is the case made by the Minister against giving way at all in this matter.  May I invite his attention to what has happened under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts?  Trade loan guarantees <Col N="1867" /> have been given from time to time and an announcement of the fact that they have been given is laid on the Table of the House.  Nobody has ever come here with a motion to disapprove of them.  In 30 years' membership of the Dáil.  I do not remember anybody questioning the giving of a guarantee.  It has been taken as automatic, the assumption being that the application has been pretty well processed and that the people have been informed through their public representatives and through the papers on the Table of the House, which are open to the Press, that the guarantee has been given in the name of the people.  I do not mind saying that if in these circumstances there had been resort to that procedure, there would be much less complaint, and indeed there might be no complaint whatever about the guarantee which is stated to have been given in this case.</P>
      <P>The mistake the Minister is making, in my view, the difficult position which he is seeking to defend, is that a body set up in the public's name, paid out of the public purse by taxes paid by the people, claims the right to say to the people and to the representatives of Parliament: &ldquo;We shall not tell you to what extent we have committed you in the form of guarantees.&rdquo; Everybody here wants to promote industrial development whether it be shipbuilding, mining or any other field of activity.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister does a great disservice to the unity of outlook on that issue by alleging that some people are interested in sabotaging industrial development, as he did today.  We are all interested in promoting industrial development.  If an announcement had been made publicly that this guarantee of £5 million had been given by the Industrial Credit Company, certainly, speaking for myself, I would have accepted the view that the Industrial Credit Company must have satisfied themselves before they committed themselves to a guarantee of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt if the matter would have been discussed in the Dáil but I would not see any reason why, as in the case of the Avoca Mines, it should not be <Col N="1868" /> discussed in the Dáil.  If the people come here either with a fragmentary sum of money or no money and say to the Irish taxpayer and the Irish Exchequer: &ldquo;Give us £5 million to start a certain undertaking&rdquo;, it is not unreasonable to say that, if they are operating on the public cheque-book, Parliament ought to know the circumstances under which the guarantee is given and the conditions under which it is given.  If they have private money, let them do what they like so long as they comply with legislative requirements. If they want to borrow money from private banks or private lending institutions let them do that and have all the secrecy they like.  But if they say: &ldquo;Write us a cheque for £5 million or guarantee us at the banks for £5 million&rdquo;, it is not unreasonable in a democratic State that that matter should be reported to Parliament.  I do not mind small amounts but, where the amount is large, as apparently it is in this instance, then Parliament ought to be asked to approve.</P>
    <P>There are two advantages.  The first is that it ensures that the Industrial Credit Company will thoroughly process the application because it is liable to public examination and the second is that it compels the other people seeking the loan or the guarantee to act responsibly in a matter of this kind and permits the Minister for Industry and Commerce to compel them to act responsibly because he can tell them: &ldquo;This must be debated by Parliament and it must be of the kind that Parliament is likely to approve.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are entitled to some protection against the <i>entrepreneur</i> who is willing to industrialise this country to the last Irish pound and who has nothing to lose himself.  I do not believe, in this instance, that the matter would even have been challenged in the House if there had been a public declaration that the guarantee was given.  Everybody would want the application to be processed.  However, when the Minister sets up the protocol that you cannot even tell that the guarantee has been given, or the amount, then I think the Minister has rightly drawn fire.  I imagine that if Fianna Fáil Deputies were sitting on <Col N="1869" /> the Opposition benches it is the point of view they would put from these benches.</P>
    <P>All we are asking in this matter is that the people and the people's representatives should be told publicly the extent to which their credit is being pledged and the conditions under which their credit is being pledged.  If they are told that, I do not think they will quarrel about it unless credit has been pledged for an undertaking which is of very doubtful origin and of very doubtful direction.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (a), page 2, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;cannot&rdquo; in line 23 down to and including &ldquo;areas&rdquo; in line 24 and substitute &ldquo;can be established or developed outside the undeveloped areas (but excluding the County Borough of Dublin, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and the County of Dublin)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is clear. I am encouraged to put it down because the Minister mentioned in the discussion on the Second Stage that this Bill is in fact a re-enactment of the Industrial Grants Act, 1956.  Section 2 (1) (a) makes the terms under which a potential industrialist can establish an industry outside the undeveloped areas more difficult than they were under the Industrial Grants Act.  The <Col N="1871" /> industrialist, in addition to complying with the normal conditions for the grant, has to prove that the undertaking cannot be established or developed in the undeveloped areas and furthermore that the undertaking is of exceptional national importance.</P>
    <P>In the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, the conditions in Section 2 (1) were as follows:</P>
    <P>Whenever the Authority are of opinion that the manufacturer of a particular commodity to a substantial extent in the State would be in the interests of the national economy and would be likely&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to provide employment on a substantial scale, or</P>
    <P>(b) to make available in the State substantial quantities of the commodity, or</P>
    <P>(c) to provide an opportunity for developing an export trade,</P>
    <P>the Authority, if satisfied that financial assistance is necessary to ensure the establishment of an industrial undertaking to manufacture the commodity to a substantial extent and that the undertaking will be of a reasonably permanent nature and will be carried on efficiently, may, on such terms as they think proper, make grants towards the cost of the acquisition, construction and adaptation of the buildings and other works required for the purpose of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>It goes on to provide for a maximum sum of £50,000 or two-thirds of the cost of the building, whichever is the lesser.  The conditions now being provided are more onerous and take away from the advantages of the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, rather than give an additional advantage to those areas outside the undeveloped areas. Furthermore, if we intend to give assistance to areas outside the undeveloped areas, whatever form that assistance takes, it should be confined to that part of the country outside the city and county of Dublin and the borough of Dun Laoghaire.  It is a fairly accurate description to say that the country is divided into the undeveloped <Col N="1872" /> areas, which areas covered by the existing Undeveloped Areas Acts, the undeveloped areas, which I regard as being the area outside the undeveloped areas, and the developed areas, which I regard as the city and county of Dublin and the area in that vicinity.</P>
    <P>If you apply the same privileges to the entire area outside the undeveloped areas, it will follow logically that manufacturers wishing to set up an industry will tend to come to Dublin where they have tended to come over the years in which industrial development has proceeded.  I think I am correct in saying that over the past 25 or 30 years some two-thirds of the industrial development which has taken place in the State has taken place in or near the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>From time to time every public man has paid lip-service to the policy of decentralisation, and every one of us at one time or another has inveighed against the growing size of Dublin.  If we are ever to take any practical steps to induce industry to set up away from the City of Dublin, with its many advantages, some special inducement to industrialists to set up industries in the area outside Dublin will have to be included in this Bill or, to put it in another way, potential industrialists will have to be discouraged from setting up their plants near Dublin.  Is it in order, Sir, to discuss amendments Nos. 1 and 2 together?</P>

      <P>As regards the words &ldquo;exceptional national importance&rdquo;, that is a condition which was not included in the 1956 Industrial Grants Act.  I suggest that may lead to difficulties of interpretation.  If an industrialist wished to set up a plant to employ a modest number of people, 25, 30, or 50, it could be turned down on the ground that it was not of exceptional national importance.  That condition, which is difficult to interpret, should be excluded altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept these two amendments.  I think <Col N="1873" /> Deputy Russell has already made himself familiar with the terms of the White Paper setting out the programme for economic expansion.  I am not suggesting that he has to accept everything that is set forth in that document but paragraph 106 of the White Paper reads:</P>
      <P>...the improved facilities which the Industrial Credit Company will be in a position to offer following the increase in the Company's resources should, in general, meet adequately the requirements of industrial promoters. Accordingly it is the intention that grants under the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, will in future be made only in exceptional circumstances and for projects of exceptional importance.</P>
      <P>As I said during the course of the Second Stage of the Bill, we should not allow ourselves to drift into the acceptance of the idea that the giving of grants is a <i>sine qua non</i> for further industrial development.  It is generally accepted amongst industrialists that one of the greatest difficulties they encounter in setting up new industries or in extending existing ones is the possible lack of capital.  I also said that the difference between receiving a grant of, say, £20,000 as against a loan of £20,000 for the capitalisation of any industry is not in the long run a deterrent to the undertaking or the expansion of such a industry.  The Industrial Credit Co. has been given increased funds and it has been stated that no sound industrial project will fail for want of the necessary capital assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the first section is concerned, the Deputy seeks to delete the words &ldquo;cannot be established or developed in the undeveloped areas&rdquo; and to include the words &ldquo;can be established or developed outside the undeveloped areas (but excluding the County Borough of Dublin, the Borough of Dun Laoghaire and the County of Dublin)&rdquo;.  As the Deputy and the House know, the scope for further industrial expansion to meet home needs is becoming increasingly diminished.  If we are to achieve further such expansion, it will be on the lines of getting a market for which we <Col N="1874" /> have had hitherto to import the commodity or, alternatively, to produce a commodity that will be capable of export at the quality and at a price which will be competitive.  If our purpose is to achieve greater export to create a situation whereby if we have the means of producing a commodity and if the only means of producing it for exporting it competitively would be to produce it in the proximity of Dublin, Dun Laoghaire or in the County of Dublin, I think it would be unsound that we should preclude such a possibility deliberately by legislation.</P>
    <P>In order to be competitive, one of the primary factors in the manufacture of such a commodity is accessibility to a port of export.  It may be that some undertaking will come to light which it would be impracticable, for one reason or another, to establish in any part of the areas outside the scheduled undeveloped areas other than in the proximity of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I share the feeling which Deputy Russell has about the growth of the City of Dublin.  It is easy for me since I am not a Dublin man myself.  I believe that we have to do all in our power, but within reasonable bounds, to ensure that, in so far as the growth of industry or the expansion of population can take place, it should be in areas outside Dublin.  Having regard to the needs of the day when, in order to achieve more industrial production, more employment and, again, in order to help balance our foreign payments and our home income, I think it would be in the long run unwise if we tied our hands to the extent that we should preclude such a possibility by deliberately writing it into our Statutes.</P>
    <P>What I have said applies generally to the situation against which Deputy Russell wants to provide.  I should also like to say that to exclude the words &ldquo;cannot be established or developed in the undeveloped areas&rdquo; would be a serious departure from the policy that has been well established and accepted in this House and throughout the country&mdash;that we should endeavour, in so far as we can, to give preference to the undeveloped areas over and above the rest of the country in the matter of giving grants and assistance <Col N="1875" /> in the setting up of industries and in the creation otherwise of employment.</P>
    <P>I might agree in general with the division that the Deputy created in the country of undeveloped areas, underdeveloped areas and developed areas. There are, perhaps, people in County Dublin who would claim that their area would qualify for inclusion even in the extreme category, the undeveloped category, suggested by Deputy Russell.</P>
    <P>As he knows, Dublin is a small area and one need only go, perhaps, west or south west&mdash;at any rate 10 miles, 12 miles, or certainly less than 15 miles&mdash; and get outside the restrictive scope of the amendments he suggests.  Therefore, it might be impracticable from that point of view, apart altogether from the other considerations I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>As far as the use of the words &ldquo;products of exceptional national interests&rdquo; are concerned, I think the difficulty which he envisages is hardly likely to arise because &ldquo;products of exceptional national interests&rdquo; will naturally include projects for the manufacture of goods which we have not been manufacturing hitherto and will also include projects for the manufacture of exportable goods.  I believe that other areas in the country, apart from Dublin, and particularly Limerick, with which Deputy Russell, naturally, is particularly concerned, will be equally qualified to come within the existing definition as the bigger ports such as Dublin and Cork.  In general, I think that the provisions contained in the original section are not only consistent with the ideals set out in the White Paper but are also consistent with what I think should be sound national policy in the long run.  I, therefore, do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to agree in principle with what I propose through the media of my amendments, particularly in regard to the ever-growing size of Dublin but he does not propose to do anything about it.  The whole principle that some part of the country must be assisted at a disadvantage to other parts of the country has already been accepted in the original <Col N="1876" /> Undeveloped Areas Act.  The mere fact that an arbitrary line has been drawn which includes mainly, I understand, the old congested areas, together with certain areas like West Cork and parts of Kerry, does at least set the precedent which the Minister's predecessor accepted.  It is a fact that special consideration was needed for these areas.</P>
      <P>I am, however, trying to make the case that special consideration is also required for areas outside the undeveloped areas because, taking the case of Limerick in which I am particularly interested as the Minister said, it is between the devil and the deep blue sea as regards the attractions, in the first instance, of the undeveloped areas and, in the second, of Dublin, the centre of the biggest area of population in the country with its other advantages such as nearness to the British market, its shipping and transport facilities and other inducements to manufacturers to come to Dublin.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned when I spoke a few minutes ago, that argument is reinforced by the fact that the vast amount of industrial development up to date has taken place in Dublin, and unless we give some inducements to areas outside the undeveloped areas and away from Dublin, I cannot in any way see that they can ever induce industrialists to set up in places like Limerick and similar centres.</P>
      <P>In any event, the more I read this amending Bill the more convinced I am that it is disadvantageous in its terms compared with the Industrial Grants Act and that instead of improving the position of centres outside the undeveloped areas, it is disimproving them.  It is making the conditions much more onerous than the Industrial Grants Act which, as far as it went, I thought was quite a good Act except that the grants it gave were confined purely to buildings.  I suggested on previous occasions that if that provision were extended to include machinery and equipment, it would be a very good step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if the Minister does not accept the amendment, there is nothing more I can do about it, but I should <Col N="1877" /> like to express my regret that he has not thought it worth while to accept these amendments which I suggest would tend to take away some of the disadvantages the Minister is creating under a Bill allegedly intended to improve areas, like Limerick, outside the undeveloped areas.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, there is no obligation on me or anyone else to accept the White Paper on Economic Expansion, but I want to know if any legislation coming in, that is allied to this programme, would be automatically accepted by the Minister.  I presume he can speak only for himself, and that any suggestion of deviating from that will not be accepted by the Minister.  The Minister referred to this programme and said he was just carrying out the Government's programme. Does that mean this automatically wipes out any amendments that might mean any departure from that programme to a minor degree? The word &ldquo;national&rdquo; is not used in the White Paper, for instance; the phrase used is &ldquo;exceptional importance.&rdquo; I take it that we can still put down amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1878" /> In subsection (3), page 3, line 15, to delete &ldquo;one-third&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one-half&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be to increase the grant covering the cost of machinery and equipment from one-third to one-half of the cost involved. As I understand this section&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash;it is intended to grant two-thirds of the cost of land, construction and adaptation of the building and other works, and one third of the cost of providing machinery and equipment and the total of the two is not to exceed £250,000.  Is that correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>So, if that is the case, it does not much matter what proportion you provide for building or equipment as long as the total does not exceed £250,000.  The reason I make that argument is that, as I said on the previous amendment, I think that as big a grant as possible should be given towards the total cost of machinery and equipment, which, after all, is the thing which creates wealth and provides employment.  It is not the buildings which do so.  I would suggest that the grant for this should be increased, even if the other grant were to be decreased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that under the Industrial Grants Act, no grants were available for equipment and machinery.  The grant was limited to building, site development, etc., up to a maximum of £50,000.  This Act extends the grants to cover machinery and equipment as well, but it was desirable, and I think it should be insisted upon, that so far as we can maintain a differential between the Undeveloped Areas Act and the Industrial Grants Act, it should be maintained.  The Undeveloped Areas Act provides for a maximum grant of the total cost of building and one-half the cost of machinery and equipment.  The Industrial Grants Act, when this Bill is passed, will provide for two-thirds of the cost of land, construction and adaptation of buildings and one-third of the cost of machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> I think it is desirable that we should maintain that differential in favour of the undeveloped areas.  The Deputy will have observed that the overall maximum in connection with any one venture has been increased from £50,000 to £250,000, which is, I think, a very attractive inducement.  I feel sure that in the administration of the grants, Foras Tionscal will not be unduly restrictive with regard to the overall amount, if it is proved that machinery and equipment might form a very high part of the total cost.  The fact is, they are restricted to one-third but I do not know whether they could adjust the one-third as between the rest of the content of the grant.  In any case, I would suggest that the facilities, as they are provided for in this Act, are very reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>What does that mean? How do they adjust their approach, if they are not to adjust their conclusions? Perhaps I misinterpreted the Minister, but I understood him to say that in a specific case, if it appeared to Foras Tionscal that the machinery content of the undertaking was unduly large, they might be induced to increase the figure of one-third for the machinery.  The Minister gave me that hope, that there was room for manoeuvring, if the machinery cost was very high in proportion to the cost of building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of machinery costing an unduly high proportion of the total cost of the project, it is not impossible that the grant-giving authority could adjust their approach to the project to suit such conditions. I am not suggesting they should raise the one-third limit, but I think they have within the section a reasonable latitude to treat such cases as generously as they can.  As the Deputy knows, applicants for grants will not qualify in all cases for the maximum amount, so I think within the limits of <Col N="1880" /> the section there is scope for favourable treatment to be given in connection with machinery <i>vis-a-vis</i> the overall amount of the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that I am any clearer about the position.  What I gather is that An Foras Tionscal can alter their approach, but not beyond one-third.  If you have a project where the buildings cost £50,000 and the machinery and equipment costs £150,000, that is obviously an exceptional case.  In a case like that, where the machinery and equipment are of such enormous value, some extra grant above the one-third should be given&mdash; even if it means reducing the grant for the building.  Fifty per cent. on both would be a better solution than is set out here.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it is an improvement on the Industrial Grants Act.  In fact, I said so when speaking a few minutes ago.  From my own knowledge of industry&mdash;and I know the Minister would not disagree with me&mdash;the cost of modern machinery is far in excess of quite a substantial building.  A substantial factory building now could be put up for £20,000, but machinery for any type of light or medium industry could run into £50,000, £60,000 or £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I might explain it better by taking the example which the Deputy has just given&mdash;£50,000 being the cost of the buildings and £150,000 the cost of the machinery.  In those circumstances, the maximum grant would be two-thirds of the cost of the buildings, that is, about £33,000; and the maximum grant in the case of machinery would be £50,000; making a total of about £80,000.  It may be that An Foras Tionscal would not be disposed to give two-thirds of the cost of the buildings, nor the full one-third of the cost of the machinery; but while reducing what they propose to give for the buildings below the two-thirds, they might be inclined, having regard to the cost of machinery, to bring the grant for machinery as near the maximum one-third as possible.  I do not know if I have made that clear to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the example he has given, assuming <Col N="1881" /> that £50,000 is the cost of buildings, then £33,000 would be the maximum grant.  In any case An Foras Tionscal might say that £10,000 would be sufficient for that.  Now, £150,000 is the cost of machinery; £50,000 would be the maximum grant; and if they were inclined to say that £20,000 would be sufficient under ordinary circumstances as a grant towards the machinery, they might under exceptional circumstances be inclined to raise that £20,000 to nearer the one-third limit.  That is the degree of flexibility I think they would have under the section, in the exceptional case to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1) to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c) make grants for the purpose of providing electric current at half the lowest rate obtaining in the State.</P>
      <P>I hold that these moneys will not be used unless there is industrialisation and unless industry is a success.  I submit that if we are to waste moneys in this country on social welfare it is high time to cry halt.  I see this as a way out of helping the undeveloped areas.  If you are prepared to give to us with one hand and not get back anything in return, you can give it with the other hand and get something back.</P>
      <P>This Bill was intended originally to develop the undeveloped areas, but it has been amended now by the Minister because he realises it has not achieved the purpose for which it was originally set out.  The moneys will not be used unless the industry is a success.  This amendment will encourage industry to be a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as it stands, as Deputy Coogan has suggested, is an amendment of the <Col N="1882" /> original Undeveloped Areas Act to meet a situation that had in fact arisen and certain other situations that might arise.  There was in the undeveloped areas an undertaking projected in which the cost of bringing the electricity to the project was, compared with the cost of the project itself, exorbitant; and the promoters, having regard to the colossal capital outlay they would have to incur in the provision of electricity, thought twice about going ahead with the project.</P>
      <P>This section as it stands is intended to meet such cases where the cost of provision and installation of electricity in the first instance, that is the capital cost, would be out of proportion and may be a deterrent to the proposers of the project.  I think it is wise in general that such assistance should be given initially and irrevocably and should not be given by way of continuing subsidy out of the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The remarks I make now will apply also, perhaps, equally well to the other amendment the Deputy has tabled.  A continuing subsidy of such a nature might well make for complacency and possible inefficiency on the part of the firm itself.  Therefore, the form of capital assistance in the first instance is certainly very desirable and, in the circumstances, it should be sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but I do not think that the cost of electricity is so exorbitant as to mean the difference between the success or failure of an industry, once the initial assistance by way of grant for buildings and equipment has been given or, where the need arises, for the capital outlay involved in bringing electricity to the plant in the first instance.  It would be unwise and undesirable that a continuing subsidy in the nature suggested by the Deputy should be given.</P>

It is quite understandable that that definition should have appeared in a Bill headed &ldquo;The Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Bill,&rdquo; but surely the consideration hitherto has been to call legislation of this kind &ldquo;the Undeveloped Areas Act and amending Acts&rdquo;?  The last place you expect to find an amending Act of the Undeveloped Areas Act is in an entirely new and apparently unrelated Bill called the Industrial Grants Act. Is there any precedent for that?  I never heard of a group of legislation where there is reference to the Principal Act in which the Title of one of the subsidiary Acts is entirely different from that of the Principal Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we are amending amendment 6, which the Minister says is rendered necessary by the change in the Title of the Bill.  If you look at section 6, you will find in sub-section (2) a reference to the Principal Act. You will have a new section in section 6, if this is adopted, but that would be read with sub-section (2):&mdash;</P>
      <P>The aggregate amount of grants under section 12 of the Principal Act and section 3 of the Act of 1956 shall not exceed ten million pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that section was first drafted, the Title of this Bill was the Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Bill.  When you look at section 1 for the interpretations, you are told that the &ldquo;Principal Act&rdquo;<Col N="1885" /> means the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.  That is all fully understandable. Now we are about to change the Title.  This will be the Industrial Grants Act.  When you look at sub-section (2) of section 6, you find it remains unaltered.  It now reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The aggregate amount of grants under section 12 of the Principal Act and section 12 of the Act of 1956 shall not exceed ten million pounds.</P>
    <P>But look back to the interpretations in section 1 and you find that what is now called the Industrial Grants Bill, 1959, provides that &ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo; means the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.  I have never heard of that happening before in my experience in the House.  I wonder is it consonant with sound practice?  I do not know.  Is there any precedent?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  As I said at the outset, I adverted to the point myself, but having regard to the fact that this section provides a blanket provision for the maximum amount of grants to cover the Undeveloped Areas Act and the old Industrial Grants Act, there is some justification for the wording and the section as it is.  If the Deputy will refer to the Schedule, he will see that the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, is repealed.  Therefore, it would be impracticable to refer to the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, if it has, in fact, been repealed or will be under this Bill, if it passes.  I grant that is not a very convincing justification, but having regard to the fact that the Title was changed after the Second Reading, the tidiest and most expeditious way of providing for the change in the Title and the consequent amendments is the way we have provided for.  I do not know if there has been a precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's unfailing courtesy disarms criticism.  Nevertheless, I feel a duty to record what I would be tempted to describe in more trenchant terms in other company.  I am afraid that this dilemma derives from an expedient which I must mildly deprecate.  The plain truth is that it was Deputy Norton who introduced the Industrial Grants Act in the inter-Party Government.  That provided a <Col N="1886" /> scheme under which industrial grants could be made available on a separate scale outside the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
      <P>What happened was that when the present Government came to the conclusion that Deputy Norton's plan should be further extended, the awkward dilemma arose: &ldquo;Does this suggest we are adopting Deputy Norton's policy and the policy of the inter-Party Government?&rdquo; The only way of repudiating that blasphemous suggestion is that we shall repeal Deputy Norton's Act triumphantly. We will provide grants in all the areas outside the undeveloped areas, but we will call it the Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Act and the Schedule will repeal Deputy Norton's Act.</P>
      <P>Now we have got ourselves in the glorious mess that the text of the Bill makes it essential to go back to the Title of Deputy Norton's Act, and observe the uproarious situation we are now in.  We are introducing an Industrial Grants Bill and the Schedule of this Bill declares that we repeal the Industrial Grants Act.  All I shall content myself with saying to the Minister until I feel that his hide has grown tougher than it can reasonably be expected to have become in his present office is&mdash;tut, tut!</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment to amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In the seventh line, after &ldquo;pounds&rdquo;, to add: &ldquo;of which six million pounds shall be reserved for the purposes of the Principal Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the Minister's proposed alteration of the Title of the Bill, I should like him to consider this position: if he were to translate himself back to practice at the Bar, without Parliamentary knowledge and experience, and he was called upon to draft something under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, and anything appertaining thereto, I do not think he would lay his hands very conveniently on this Grants Bill which purports to amend the Act of 1952. Would he consider his consternation if the defence were to file pleadings against him under certain provisions of the Industrial Grants Act, as it will be, and which never sprang to his mind as an extension of the Undeveloped Areas Act of 1952 at all?  That may be only a minor point, but nevertheless some confusion is bound to result.</P>
      <P>Apart from the reasons already advanced by Deputy Dillon for an alteration of this Title, there is another reason founded on the desire to avoid the accusation that the principle of the Undeveloped Areas Act of 1952 is being disturbed or altered in any way. If the Minister wants this Bill today he would do well to consider the rather confused situation which obtains with regard to the amendment he has moved and which he says is a necessary consequence of the alteration of the title after the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment asks that after the word &ldquo;pounds&rdquo; there will be added the words &ldquo;of which six million pounds shall be reserved for the purposes of the principal Act.&rdquo;  Under Section 3 of the Undeveloped Areas Act of 1952, the areas set out for the purpose of benefit under that Act are the Counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and Kerry; the former rural districts of Ballyvaughan, Ennistymon, Kilrush, Scariff, Tulla and Killadysert; and the former rural districts of Bantry, Castletown, Schull and Skibbereen, in the County of Cork, plus any other area which may be <Col N="1888" /> added by order.  I understand Ennis was so added some time ago.</P>
    <P>Now I would not be adamant on the £6,000,000 provided that some specific sum is reserved for the purposes of the Principal Act.  The Minister visited Roscommon recently&mdash;on the 16th of this month to be exact.  As reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of July 17th, talking about the Bill we are now discussing, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>There had been some confused thinking about the purpose of the new Bill.  In the first place it contained no new principle.  The Industrial Grants Act, which is replaced, was passed by the last Government and extended the availability of grants for industrial undertakings to the rest of the country outside the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>Be it remembered that the Industrial Grants Act passed by the last Government did not interfere in any way with the scope and working of the Undeveloped Areas Act of 1952.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it did not repeal in any way the existing Undeveloped Areas Acts, but, on the contrary, it increased the overall amount of moneys available for grants, and made better provision for installation of electric power where the E.S.B. would find that the capital cost of making electricity available to an undertaking in these areas was not economic.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of &ldquo;Grant Facilities&rdquo; the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it continued the preferential grant facilities for industrialisation in the West.</P>
    <P>On my reading of this Bill&mdash;I raised this point on Second Reading&mdash;there is nothing to stop the authority, the Board, the Government, the Minister, or anybody concerned, from making the whole of this £10,000,000 available to people who satisfy them&mdash;the method of satisfaction is one which I query&mdash;that they could place their industries anywhere near the larger centres of population, such as Dublin, Cork and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> In this amendment I want to preserve the principle of preferential treatment for the areas already set out in the Principal Act by reserving a specific sum for those areas.  On the same day, 16th of this month, that the Minister gave utterance to what I have already quoted at a luncheon in Roscommon celebrating the opening of a new factory, the Bishop of Elphin, Most Rev. Dr. Hanley, also spoke.  He took the view that this amending Bill is taking away whatever advantages there were before:</P>
    <P>If the flight from the West is to be arrested this disadvantage must at least be neutralised.</P>
    <P>He was talking of the disadvantage of setting up factories in the West.</P>
    <P>With a view to securing this objective the Undeveloped Areas Act was passed in 1952, but apparently it did not go far enough.  It is, therefore, a matter of grave concern to hear that it is about to be amended in such a way that it will be of no benefit to the West.</P>
    <P>I might say that not one line of that appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i>, the Government organ.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let us hope,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;that instead of the amendment contemplated another will be substituted which will provide further attractions sufficient to neutralise the disadvantage under which we labour, and, at the same time, achieve the objective of the Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me say at once that I had tabled this amendment before I read that. Let me say, secondly, that no part of the diocese of Elphin is in my constituency. It is to ensure the preservation of the preferential treatment which the Minister told the people of Roscommon will be preserved that I am asking that £6,000,000 of the £10,000,000 be reserved for the purposes of the Principal Act.  I would be prepared, as an earnest of the Minister's goodwill and of the Government's goodwill, to accept a lesser figure by way of reservation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To take Deputy Dillon's point first, the Deputy will <Col N="1890" /> remember I announced on Second Reading that I thought the Title, Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Bill, inappropriate since grants would be made available under it to parts of the country outside the undeveloped areas scheduled.  I thought for that reason it would be advisable to amend the title. From the point of view of draftsmanship it might be tidier perhaps to leave the title as it is.  I do not know what was behind the original title.  As the Deputy knows, I only came into the Department long after it had been drafted.  I doubt if there was any intention of changing the title for the sake of registering disapproval of something that had been done by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Lindsay's amendment, the section provides an overall upper limit to funds available for grants under the Undeveloped Areas Act and under the Industrial Grants Act.  There is, it is true, no subdivision as between the limit for the one Act as against the other.  The existing limits, as the House knows, were £4,000,000 under the Undeveloped Areas Act and £2,000,000 under the Industrial Grants Act.  I think I could allay any fears Deputy Lindsay may have if I refer him to the expenditure under the Undeveloped Areas Act since its introduction. Between expenditure and amounts of grants approved but not yet paid over, the total sum is £2,293,490 and that would represent something less than an average of £500,000 a year for each of the six years or so that the Undeveloped Areas Act has been in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the amount of industrialisation in the western undeveloped areas will increase.  I hope it does but I doubt if it will increase to an extent that it would prevent the overall limit of £10,000,000 being applied fairly between the two areas or that the increase in grants given to the areas outside the undeveloped areas would increase either in that fashion. It is anticipated that the £10,000,000 will cover whatever payments by way of grants will have to be made up to the 31st December, 1963, which is the date up to which this Bill will continue <Col N="1891" /> to be law if it is passed.  I do not think there is any danger that any projects within the undeveloped areas will suffer by reason of lack of funds in that period and if, in fact, the fund is exhausted within that period the Government, I am sure, will come back to the House and seek more moneys for grant purposes in the undeveloped areas.  I think I remember Deputy Norton, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, having to come before the House for a similar purpose and there was no opposition then from our side as, I am sure, there would be no opposition if the situation had been reversed.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, there is every reason why Deputy Lindsay's fears should be allayed.  I think there would be no danger of grants in relation to one area or the other, and certainly in relation to the undeveloped areas, suffering by reason of exhaustion of funds before December, 1963, and, even in that event, I think adequate provision can be made for it.</P>
    <P>I would urge that the drafting amendment, even though, perhaps, it offends Deputy Dillon's sense of draftsmanship, be accepted as being reasonable and, certainly, reasonably capable of interpretation even in the event envisaged by Deputy Lindsay.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not concede that the position might be this, as a result of this Bill?  Assume for one moment that there are people outside this country and in the country willing to invest money and to set up industries, provided they do not have to go into the congested areas.  Assume they see now that it is possible for them to operate in Dublin or within easy reach of it, and that they come in such numbers&mdash;I would like to see them come&mdash;and with projects of such a size, that they could satisfy the Board, pursuant to the provisions of Section 2, that they are going to the right places, the whole of the £10,000,000 could be exhausted in that way, leaving the areas scheduled in the Principal Act entirely out of consideration. Is it not possible?  It may not be probable but is is not possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not deny <Col N="1892" /> that it is possible but it is hardly likely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like it to be probable and I am sure the Minister would, also, but, in that event, does not the Minister think that there should be some sum reserved?  I want to put in this way&mdash;there could be industrialists coming in who would like to come nearer to Dublin or Cork or to some shipping centre.  They might not like to go to Galway but could be persuaded to go to Galway by being given greater facility from the Board.  It is for that reason that a sum should be set aside for the areas mentioned in the Principal Act, that the Board could use its influence and even bring pressure to bear on a prospective investor to go to the area that it was designed to serve and to benefit under the Principal Act.  That is my reasoning. I think the Minister has conceded that my fear is a genuine one in this respect, that it is only a transitory period until the West will be probably abandoned, not necessarily by the Government but by prospective investtors who can take advantage of this piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well known that when people enquire about grant or loan facilities available for the establishment of industries, they are generally directed to the undeveloped areas in the first instance.  It is made very clear to them that, should they go to the undeveloped areas, the amount available by way of grant is more favourable than would be the case if they started their industries elsewhere.  That differential will continue. The amount of the grant under the Undeveloped Areas Act, contained in this Bill, is full cost of buildings and development of sites, half cost of machinery.  Under the Industrial Grants Act, it is two-thirds of the cost of building and one-third of the cost of machinery.  There is that differential and that preference in favour of the undeveloped areas but I want to assure the Deputy, in the first instance, that in so far as An Foras Tionscal will operate, they will see that the funds will not be gobbled up by people who do not desire to go to the undeveloped areas.  Secondly, I <Col N="1893" /> should like to assure him that, as far as I am concerned, if I saw a trend developing that there was a danger, by reason of there being no upper limit in respect of each of the Acts specified in legislation, I would come back to the House and seek such protection as he suggests, but I do not think the situation is likely to arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could protect himself now by accepting this amendment, even if he included a lesser figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this additional point of view.  After this Bill leaves this House, its administration becomes a matter for Foras Tionscal and we cease to have a daily contact with what is happening.  We cannot escape from the expressed declaration of the Taoiseach on the Second Stage of this Bill that the effect of this amending Bill, in his own words, is to draw the people out of the undeveloped areas to the industries rather than to encourage the industries to go into the undeveloped areas to the people.  Those are his own words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay makes the case, that being faced with that declaration, that if that tendency predominates and that you have available £10,000,000, £7,000,000 of which is going to industrial projects outside the undeveloped areas, before things have reached that stage the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be forced to come back to Dáil Eireann and tell the House that all the money available for areas outside the undeveloped areas is gone, and that he must have more money. Whereupon it would be open to the House to say: &ldquo;Have you abandoned the undeveloped areas altogether?  We gave you £6,000,000 for the undeveloped areas and £4,000,000 for the others.  You are now back in the Dáil saying that you have oceans of money for the undeveloped areas, because nobody is applying for it, but you have run out of money for industrial projects in the outside areas which confirms us in the belief that the new policy of drawing the people out of the undeveloped areas to Dublin, Cork, <Col N="1894" /> Limerick and Waterford is in full career.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the Dáil has lost all realisation of what we are doing.  I look at the Fianna Fáil Deputy from Sligo smiling blandly there and I remember the hoots of joy with which he greeted the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I am completely vindicated.  Fianna Fáil has now got back the votes and it does not matter any longer.  Did the Deputy not hear the Taoiseach say that the purpose of the Bill is to draw the people out of the undeveloped areas to the industries in other areas?</P>

      <P>We now have Fianna Fáil Deputies divided into three schools of thought and the <i>obiter dicta</i> of the present Taoiseach are being parsed and <Col N="1895" /> defined to get their real meaning. Deputy Killilea says that the words were never spoken at all.  Deputy Gilbride says that they were spoken but that he did not mean what he said. The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that the words were spoken but that what the Taoiseach meant was that one of the effects of this legislation might be to draw the people out of the undeveloped areas.  Out of all this, one thing is certain and that is that the official record of this House says that the Taoiseach expressed the opinion that the result of this Bill, when operated, could be to draw the people out of the Gaeltacht to industries situated in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
      <P>I understand that our objective and the purpose of Dáil Éireann is to encourage industry to be located near the homes of the people in the congested areas in the west of Ireland.  Does the Deputy realise now that such is not going to be the case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that Deputy Dillon has been converted to the Undeveloped Areas Act of 1952. When that Act was going through this House, he described it as Fianna Fáil slush money.  That Act has not been in operation for five years and the Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us that the amount spent under it is about £2,000,000.  The Government, in their wisdom, see that they have not been able to attract people to invest in the undeveloped areas and, as a result, the ceiling of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 which was fixed in the Act has not been reached and all the money has not been spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government now sees that it might be possible to bring some big industries into the country, industries that would not be prepared to go into the undeveloped areas, so they have brought in this Bill to attract those industries into the country.  Is there anything in the world wrong with that? If we cannot get people to invest in <Col N="1896" /> the undeveloped areas I see nothing wrong in trying to get people to set up industries in some other part of the country so that the people of the west will have to go there.  There is no need for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to have to apologise for that. The Taoiseach said that this Bill could have that effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if Deputy Gilbride knew, until he stood up, that he had become converted to the fact that the purpose of this Bill is that we should lead the people out of the West of Ireland to find employment in other areas, that we should abandon the idea of trying to establish industries in the West of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There was nothing to prevent the Minister from increasing the grants under the Industrial Grants Act if, at the same time, he increased the grants available under the Undeveloped Areas Act, and kept the two systems of grants at the same level in order to induce people to go to the undeveloped areas.  The differential between the grants available outside and inside the undeveloped areas has been substantially reduced.  There is no use in Deputy Gilbride shaking his head.  That is the fact, and it is that fact which will operate to draw people out of the undeveloped areas into the cities and towns of the Eastern counties of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilbride says they were there for the last six years and people did not avail of them.  As a matter of fact, I think there were several grants in Sligo, but let the people go, he says.  He is throwing his hat at it.  I have already declared my interest in this matter as it affects my constituency.  This Bill is an advantage to my constituency but it is going to be a very real disadvantage to the congested areas in the West of Ireland.  It is wrong for this House to proceed to the enactment of this measure without a full realisation of what it is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1897" /> The principal value of Deputy Lindsay's amendment, in the light of what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said, is that the amendment would impose a duty on the Minister to come back to this House if, as I believe will be the case, the bulk of the grants hereafter bespoken will be in respect of enterprises outside the undeveloped areas.  If that is the case, I think it would be a good thing to put the Minister in a position to come back to the Dáil and tell the Dáil about it.  That purpose would be effected by Deputy Lindsay's amendment, which I hope the Minister will accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purposes of the record arising here from the discussion on this amendment, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Taoiseach's interjection in the debate on Second Reading, I might state that this is the position as shown in Volume 176, No. 5, Column 740 of the Official Report for Tuesday, 7th July.  At that Column Deputy Corish is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think it would be a far better thing to encourage the people from the undeveloped areas to come to other parts of Ireland where industries can be established and established properly.  I have nothing to say against people from Mayo and Galway coming to other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: Did I understand the Taoiseach to nod his assent to that proposition?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach: One of the effects of this Bill will be to do that.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does Deputy Killilea still deny that the Taoiseach said it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Taoiseach was in course of operating a very well-known, ancient, political device, a silent nod of assent which he did not wish to have recorded in the Official Report?  I invited him to give <Col N="1898" /> verbal expression to his silent nod, which he very reluctantly did.</P>

      <P>I have seen a copy of the letter.  It was sent in reply to a telephone enquiry by the Deputy about posting times at Merrion Row and Lower Baggot Street Sub-Post Offices and at a pillar box in Lower Baggot Street.  The understanding of the telephone conversation was that the Deputy wished to know the latest time for posting at each of the three points specified which would ensure first delivery next morning throughout Counties Kildare and Meath and in Ireland and England generally.  Only the night mail despatch from Dublin meets this requirement for all those places and the posting times for connexion with that despatch were accordingly given in the letter to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The statements made by me when replying to the recent Debate on the Posts and Telegraphs Estimate were correct and are not inconsistent with the answer given to the Deputy's broad enquiry of January last.  In parts of Co. Kildare the morning delivery comprises not merely the previous night's despatch but also correspondence from that morning's Day Mail despatch from Dublin.  In these places letters are delivered in the morning which have been posted in Dublin City and Suburban letter boxes up to the latest collection times (varying between 8 p.m. and 10.30 p.m.) on the previous night, or which have been posted up to 4.45 a.m. at the G.P.O. and St. Andrew St. or up to 5 a.m. at Pearse St. that same morning.</P>

      <Col N="1911" /> The appointment of Deputy Bartley to be a member of the Government is a necessary preliminary to the changes in the Government which I foreshadowed when the appointment of the present members of the Government was before the House, and again on the Second Reading of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 1959. Deputies will be aware that the assignment of Departments to members of the Government is a prerogative of the Taoiseach.  I may say, however, for the information of the House, that if this motion is approved, I propose to terminate the assignment of the Department of Lands and Fisheries to Deputy Erskine Childers and to assign that Department to Deputy Michael Moran, now Minister for the Gaeltacht.  I intend to ask the present Minister for Lands and Fisheries, Deputy Erskine Childers; to take charge of the new Department of Transport and Power when the Ministers and Secretaries Bill comes into operation.  Deputy Bartley will be assigned the Department of the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>I want to put some specific questions to the Minister on this Resolution in view of the fact that he proposes to advance £200,000 to a company to be set up for the purposes of the cultivation of bogland, the growing of grass thereon and the conversion of that grass into grass meal.  The first <Col N="1914" /> question is: are the results of any experiments in the growing of grass on blanket bog, other than those in operation by Peatlands, Glenamoy, available to him?  The second question is: are those results such as afford complete satisfaction with the growth of grass as such?  And the third question is: is he satisfied that the substance of the grass so grown is suitable for conversion into grass meal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been prior experiments on bog of a similar nature to the bog which it is now proposed to develop.  These experiments were satisfactory in relation both to the quality and the quantity of the grass grown.  As well as that, the information available to the committee set up to examine whether or not this proposal should be revived had available to it expert evidence to the effect that the quality of the grass would be suitable for the purpose of the grass meal project.  I am satisfied that, as a result of the information at my disposal, the project is a suitable one.</P>

      <P>I wonder are the terms of this Resolution wide enough to permit whatever body is set up to administer this business to use their resources for the consumption of this grass <i>in situ</i> in the form of silage or by the feeding of livestock if it proves, as I believe it will prove, to be ridiculously and fantastically uneconomic to convert this material into grass meal. I think the Minister will find on inquiry, and I think it is right to put it on record, that when the Minister first became Parliamentary Secretary in the year 1951 he was charged with responsibility for the undeveloped areas and I wrote to him and warned him then that somebody would try to foist this fraud over upon him.  I urged him to get adequate advice which would forewarn him of his peril.  Since then the inter-Party Government established a peatland research station at Glenamoy.</P>

      <P>Very well.  Since then the Peatlands Research Station has been operating in Glenamoy for the last four years, despite the fact that it was formally opened only last week. During the four years it has been in operation some evidence has emerged that it is not impossible that one might be able to use an area of blanket bog of this kind for the maintenance of livestock by preserving the surplus grass economically&mdash;not by drying it and converting it into grassmeal but by ensiling it and allowing it to be consumed <i>in situ.</i>  If anything is to be salvaged out of this, it is possible that salvage might be effected in that way. All I am concerned to ensure is that, if there is £200,000 of public money to be poured into this business, we should have some prospect of recovering some of it if and when the grassmeal project collapses, as it most certainly will.</P>

There is a possibility there of economic operation and, if it does not cover it, I suggest to the Minister that he should take steps to make that operation available to whatever body operates this scheme and widen the Money Resolution sufficiently now to make that possible.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Section, a company is set up with power to purchase lands.  If my memory is correct, at the time of the handing over to the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture of some of the lands in Bangor Erris, which were in the possession of the former Min Fhéir Company, the owners were not paid for that land. At least, the land was acquired and, simply because the owners' title was not absolutely up to date, the owners were not paid at the time of the handing over to the two Departments I have named.  The point I want to bring to the Minister's notice is that in those areas it is the very poorest and smallest farmers whose land is acquired.  Even though it is only mountain or blanket bog would the Minister take steps to ensure that the new company will pay the owners or help them to clear up the title in the same way as the 1956 Forestry Act allows the Forestry Division to do?  It creates very grave injustice when land is taken over and used by a company if the former owners are told that it is their fault that they are not paid, that their title is not up to date and that nothing can be done.</P>

      <P>The intention is to give the new company freedom to select the most suitable site for their purposes.  As the Deputy knows, they already selected a site which they thought was most suitable.  There are certain other lands and the peatlands scheme is being carried on there.  It is not proposed to interfere with that.  It is hoped that, if not in the immediate <Col N="1920" /> vicinity, in the near vicinity, there will be land available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that the use of the geographical term &ldquo;Bangor Erris&rdquo; is misleading because Bangor Erris is a village at least eight miles away from the site of the present operations and where the former operations of Min Fhéir were conducted.  In relation to Deputy Blowick's complaint, there are owners of land acquired by Bórd na Móna in the Bangor Erris immediate vicinity who have not been paid for their land and that may not apply to the land at Glenamoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister to say that he will investigate the difficulty of people whose land has been acquired by Bórd na Móna and try to find a way out of it.  I want to make a suggestion now.  The Minister has said here that, in reviewing all the arguments, pro and con, in relation to this proposal the Government's mind is being profoundly influenced by the social aspects of this proposal and that, even if conviction were carried to his mind that its economics were not wholly sound, the social advantage to be served would still persuade him to persist in this enterprise. Very well.</P>
      <P>Accepting that declaration, I want to make now a constructive proposal. You are going to have a board of directors, I understand, of local people. If this is largely a social development in this area for the benefit of people who otherwise could not get employment and who are in poor circumstances, is not it reasonable to suggest that the local directors will act in an honorary capacity?  Would there not be something positively indecent in erecting a board of directors for what is notoriously a social service and then announcing that they are all to receive individually as fees an annual income for the rest of their days?  There must be some limit to the indecency of individuals in association with a project of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1921" /> If it is a social service they should no more consider accepting remuneration for it than would a member of a board of guardians or the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  I suggest to the Minister that he should be able to find some responsible citizens who will be prepared to act in a voluntary, honorary capacity and that if he cannot appoint somebody like that he should appoint a board of two or three civil servants who will do their duties perfectly and with a deeper regard for the public purse than anybody else is likely to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In general it has been accepted that the payment of members of public boards by way of some small remuneration is justifiable to the extent that the Minister to whom that board is responsible will feel that he has some control over the activities of such members in order to ensure that they devote themselves to the purpose for which the board is set up.  That seems to be the idea behind the payment of members of such boards who are paid small annual remuneration or fees. Having stated that, I shall have regard, in the setting up of this board, to what the Deputy has suggested and I can assure him that the type of board which will be set up will be the best possible to ensure the carrying out the purposes of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Board may be of a voluntary character?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to consider this aspect of the matter on the general principle of the setting up of these companies because of something that came to my notice some little time ago.  There is, as the Minister knows, in certain memoranda and articles of association a provision that the directors of a company cannot contract with the company.  Sometimes that stipulation is waived in relation to private companies.  I want to put a query to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, not specifically in relation to this company but in order to be within the rules of order, that there should be some such stipulation in State companies with, perhaps, the overriding provision, that in the event <Col N="1922" /> of its being essential for a director of one of these companies to contract directly or indirectly with the company, not merely would notice be given to the company, but also to the Minister, of that director's interests.</P>
      <P>It would be highly undesirable, and the Minister will understand that I am arguing in this case for the purpose of arguing the principle, that any director of any State-sponsored company could be in the situation of being personally interested in the purchase of, say, machinery for the company of which he is a director without the full disclosure of that person's connection with the firm from which purchases are made being made to the Minister concerned.  I do not suggest that there will not be occasions on which Director A may be associated with Firm X and perhaps Firm X tenders for work. It may be the best tender but before that tender is accepted by the Board of a State company the Minister, who is the real boss, should be informed and there should be the fullest disclosure.</P>
      <P>The memorandum of articles of association of this company should have that provision.  If that provision is not there then the honorarium by way of fee which the Minister is fixing, and which he fixes as being a reasonable figure in his judgment, may not be the real honorarium.  It is vital in my view, as I said in relation to another Bill, that where a State-sponsored company gets a subsidy from the Minister, the Minister should be told what benefit the directors may get out of mat subsidy. It would be entirely illusory if the Minister were to fix the fee of a director at £X whereas, in fact, the fee was really £X plus Y because the person concerned was getting a commission in respect of the company's purchases. In a case like that the law is that there should be a full disclosure to the company.  In the case of a State-sponsored company it should be a disclosure not to the company alone but to the responsible Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that when this company is formed the Minister will be answerable to the House for the expenditure by the company on his direction and for purchases made by the company and the source from <Col N="1923" /> which the purchases are made?  Do I take it that that information will be available to Deputies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the provision in the Bill setting up Córas Tráchtála as a statutory body requiring members of the board to disclose any activities they may have in connection with the board's operations.  That provision could be made to apply with equal effect to the members of this proposed board by asking them, in their letter of appointment, to disclose any activities they might have.  The fulfilment of that condition can be assured by close scrutiny of the annual returns.</P>
      <P>As far as Deputy Lindsay's point is concerned, the Bill requires the company to make annual returns, and I do not think there is any facility there beyond those which obtain in other State companies to inquire too closely into the activities of the company.  It will be open to the Minister to require from the company any additional information over and above what is disclosed in the annual report of the company to him.  I think the Deputy can be assured that the activities of the company will be watched closely from that point of view.  If there is any danger of anything happening such as the Deputy has in view it will be brought to light.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a point made by the Minister in reply to Deputy Sweetman or Deputy Dillon. The reason he gave for paying salaries or directors' fees was that it gave the Minister more control over the individuals concerned in that, if they were paid in such a way, they would have to perform a certain task.  Is the Minister aware that in some of the State-sponsored bodies provision has been written in whereby a director must resign if directed to do so by the Minister? If a provision of that nature were included in this Bill, would it not be another reason for the directors not taking salaries, or taking salaries of a purely nominal value?  We are discussing this as a social matter because there are no commercial arguments in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose at the end of <Col N="1924" /> a year after a considerable amount of this money had been spent and, after this close scrutiny promised by the Minister, it is discovered that a large amount of money has gone directly to a director, or to a corporate body of which he is a member, what will the Minister do then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose that in the course of the first year it becomes apparent, from this close scrutiny which the Minister promises, that a considerable amount of goods had been purchased from a firm owned by a director, or from a body of which a director is also a member, what does the Minister do, once the abuse has been noted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In these matters one has to depend on the honour and integrity of the members of the Board. The Minister is not likely to appoint a person in whom he cannot have trust but, as I indicated to Deputy Sweetman, there should be in the letter of appointment a request asking for disclosure of any interest on the part of a director to be appointed.  Beyond that I do not think it would be possible to anticipate any mal-practice that might occur.  That is common to all countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the existing law provides the answer, provided the Minister applies it.  The Minister can put in the memoranda and articles of association a provision that a director of a company may not engage, either directly in contracts with the company. or indirectly through an associate without disclosure, (a) to the company and (b) to the Minister.  Then, if he does it, he is guilty of a criminal offence against the company law and criminal proceedings could be taken against him.  Otherwise, in general parlance, the position would be that he would get away with the swag and the Minister could sack him but, if it is put in the articles and memoranda of association, it is a matter beyond question of criminal company law, and nobody is going to break that lightly.</P>

      <P>If £35,000 does that, they must anticipate employing a very small number of men.  The Minister mentioned a minimum of 75 and a maximum of 150, but whether he intended that to apply at the end of five years I do not know.  Could he give us some idea of what number will be employed up to the end of this five year period.  If the answer is anything more than a handful of men I suggest that the £35,000&mdash;the difference between capital outlay for acquisition of factory buildings, etc., and £200,000 &mdash;will only be adequate to employ a small number of men over that period. Twenty men employed at £5 a week <Col N="1926" /> for five years will cost £25,000, and surely they are going to employ more than an average of 20 men a week?</P>

      <P>It is a <i>fait accompli</i> now.  Deputy Dillon has made my point.  By putting down this Money Resolution the Government has, in effect, negatived the amendment.  I suggest that the Minister could consider <Col N="1929" /> eliminating the word &ldquo;major&rdquo;.  I know from personal experience how difficult it is to interpret these words once they are written into an Act.  I am aware of a small number of what I would not describe as &ldquo;major tourist resorts&rdquo; but which nevertheless are growing resorts and resorts which might benefit from assistance under this Bill.  Taking out the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; does not in any way stop An Bord Fáilte from refusing grants to centres which they might regard as not worthy of consideration or too small for their purpose.  It does not affect the purpose of the Bill if the word is deleted but it could affect it, if it is left in.</P>

      <P>When we consider the amount of money put into tourism and compare it with what is being injected into agriculture I think the amount for tourism, which is considered to be our second greatest money-spinner, is too low and that we should not be tied to that amount over ten years.  I come from an area affected by tourism, where we have major resorts, and I find that we have undeveloped raw material in our wonderful scenery.  In tying ourselves to that amount of money over ten years we are not playing fair with tourism.</P>

      <P>Deputy Russell will appreciate that the Tourist Board may come to the assistance of small resorts in any case out of annually voted money.  The purpose of introducing the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; was to ensure that some worthwhile projects will result from making grants available.  In reply to Deputy Coogan, the £1,000,000 is not intended to cover the entire cost of resort development envisaged in the Bill.  The intention is that the local authority or local development group would be required to raise a substantial portion of the money.  This £1,000,000 will be used only by way of subvention of whatever moneys are raised locally.  I think that principle cannot be departed from.  There is an obligation on local authorities to provide <Col N="1930" /> in such cases a substantial proportion of the funds to be expended.</P>
      <P>To revert to Deputy Russell&mdash;under the original Tourist Act there is a provision whereby An Bord Failte assists in the formation of local development companies and may secure or guarantee loans for local development purposes that may be raised by the company.</P>

      <P>I take it that when the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and in conjunction with the Government generally, desired to provide this money he was equally desirous that it would be spent after allocation.  I want to impress on the Minister the necessity for taking such steps as are necessary in order to see that the development of national tourist resorts and holiday accommodation will be accomplished. My reason for that is that some local authorities, notoriously in my own County Mayo, have not expended one penny of tourist grants of this kind that came their way.  In a county where the provision of good motor roads and adequate signposting are important from the point of view of access to sea, lake, mountain and places of historical interest it should be part of a plan where co-operation with Bord Failte is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>We have failed to take advantage of the grants&mdash;not very generous ones but nevertheless our fair share in County Mayo, I take it&mdash;owing to the intractability of local officials who will not co-operate in the promotion of the plans unless they get five per cent of the amount of the grant&mdash;and this from people on inclusive salary rates.</P>

      <P>That is true.  That road is excellent and has been tremendously improved as has the road from Mulranny.  But there was, for instance, a grant of £500 for Cushla pier and another grant for the improvement of the Atlantic Drive in Achill. I do not know whether the Minister knows it or not but it is very scenic and equally dangerous.  There was an unspecified grant for that and none of it was spent because the local authority officials refused to operate the scheme unless five per cent of the grant was forthcoming.  I think the Minister should interest himself in that matter with the Board and even consult the Minister for Local Government so as to ensure that local authorities co-operate fully with An Bord Failte in the administration of these grants.  The salaries of such people are adequate.  Also they are inclusive and it requires very little additional attention to operate such schemes.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that very often grants of this kind, particularly tourist road grants, are confined to a certain area.  It is notorious that the bulk of the Tourist Board grant of £55,000 for County Mayo is being spent in the Clew Bay area.  That may be attractive for Frenchmen during the deep sea angling for a few weeks of the year, but there are other places in North Mayo and South Mayo which are just as attractive and important from the point of view of the development of our tourist trade.</P>

      <P>The position at present is that there is no limit in the law as to the amount the Company can borrow with the Minister's guarantee. That was, I think, an error in the drafting of the 1936 Act, and the purpose of this section is to put in a limit to provide that the borrowings cannot exceed £5,000,000 without fresh legislation.  In fact, the Company's borrowings at present are about £3½ million, which they have borrowed from their bankers with the Government's guarantee.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is asking me can the Company succeed in borrowing money without the Government's guarantee.  I cannot see circumstances arise under which they might do that, except perhaps that they might enter into a hire purchase arrangement in respect of aircraft or something of that kind.  What we are limiting in this Bill is the amount of their share capital and the amount they can raise on guaranteed borrowings.  I would not like offhand to say they could not borrow otherwise.  I think it is unlikely they would, but I could conceive that possibly they might arrive at some stage where they might wish to finance the purchase of equipment by a hire purchase arrangement, which, presumably, would be tantamount to borrowing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is this.  In relation to a State company, no matter what its assets may be, it is unthinkable that any borrowings by a State company would not be honoured, in the last resort, if necessary, by the Exchequer, provided it was a borrowing made within the law and the powers of the Company.  As long as the Exchequer has to stand in as the last resort to make good for the sake of the honour of the State&mdash;and it would be the honour of the State&mdash;I feel very strongly that there must be some limit put by his House on that liability.  The share capital has been authorised and that is out of the way. The Minister for Finance cannot guarrantee any more than £5,000,000, but there should be some other limit for the purpose of retaining the control, both of the Government and the House, over what the House might ultimately be called upon to make good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we deal with the amendment I should like to say on the section that I put forward on Second Reading certain views that I hold strongly.  I understood the Minister to say that he had consulted with all interests and that all interests had assured him that they were well satisfied with his arrangements.  I alleged then, as I allege now, that this was a fishmongers' Bill and that it was gravely inimical to the interests of the fishermen.  Indeed, I thought it was a wholly mistaken Bill.  The Minister rebutted that by saying that everybody was in favour of it.  I want to inform the House now that everybody does not quite seem to be in favour of it.</P>
      <P>The Sea Fisheries Act of 1952 withholds from the Minister the right to grant a licence to a vessel of over 35 feet in length for sea fishing unless the vessel is owned by Irish fishermen, or a company incorporated under the Companies Act, the whole of the share capital of which is held by Irish citizens.  The purpose of this section is to permit and require the Minister to issue licences to such vessels if they are owned by a company registered in Ireland, and that is designed to accommodate holding companies. The Atlantic Fishery Industries Limited, Killybegs, is such a company. There are six directors, each holding 25 shares&mdash;two Swedes, three West Germans and one Irishman.  Now I understand that the bulk of the capital to be invested is being provided by a Swedish gentleman of the name of Venner-Gren, to whom the Minister referred in the course of the Second Reading debate; he spoke of Mr. Venner-Gren intending to bequeath his assets to eleemosynary purposes for education and certain other trusts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Minister to read his files.  I do not suppose he will read them now since he is going off to another Ministry.  The fact is&mdash;Deputy Sweetman will confirm this&mdash;we operated a pilot plant in order to find out the know-how of fishmeal processing. There were then protracted conferences. It was agreed that you will never get herring fishing going on a satisfactory basis if you are not in a position to offer the fishermen a minimum price so that they will be for ever delivered from the threat of having to jettison <Col N="1938" /> surplus catches.  I applied to Deputy Sweetman, the Minister for Finance, to build a fishmeal factory which would put me in a position to say to the fishermen on the Donegal coast: &ldquo;You need never jettison a herring again.&rdquo;  I got that authority and, just as I got it, this group&mdash;a German group&mdash;turned up and announced that they would be prepared to engage in this enterprise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman took the view, and I agreed with him, that, if we can get a group of independent businessmen to build factories for the purpose we had in mind, there was no reason why we should use our resources when these resources might be required in Baltimore, Kinsale or Dunmore if we failed to get a group of independent businessmen to erect fishmeal factories there.</P>
      <P>This factory was planned and designed to be operated as a provision for fishermen, to guarantee them against the possibility of having to jettison surplus fish.  Now we are getting into a position in which this infernal factory is being made the alibi for permitting what are, in effect, foreign trawlers to land fish into our market. This company, which has built this fishmeal plant at Killybegs, has received a grant of £70,000 from the Government.  The factory is now completed. A very peculiar thing has happened. When I was Minister for Fisheries there was always this chronic problem that, when you landed a certain volume of herring, it was very easy to run into a surplus and, when you got a surplus, you could not dispose of it.  Of course, I will not say that with typical Fianna Fáil luck, no sooner did they come into office than the herring disappeared out of the North Sea and contemporaneously they turned up on our shores.</P>

      <P>My main thesis is based on the document I sent to the Deputy.  It is written with very great care in order to give him and other <Col N="1940" /> Deputies the maximum opportunity of seeing how this very complex fish market situation is developing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the complexity of the fish market but there is one overriding principle, that we have maintained a high price structure in this country on one ground and one ground only and that was because there was a social element in it, that it provided a guaranteed profitable market for boat-owning fishermen and their crews.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now entering on a dialectic which is going to land us up with a series of middle-water trawlers, owned by commercial concerns, landing fish into our market where the price structure is maintained at an artificial level for the benefit of boat-owning fishermen.  When the trawlers come into our market what will happen is that they will ultimately land fish in such quantity that they will destroy the domestic market for boat-owning fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the fundamental difference between us.  I think I know whereof I speak.  I was closely and intimately associated with this whole business for a long time.  He is embarking upon a dialectic the inevitable end of which is that the boat-owning fishermen will disappear from our shores and the tragedy for <Col N="1941" /> me is that, once that happens, it is an irreversible process.  I admit that the consumer in this country may derive a certain price advantage from this development but he will lose in the quality of the fish which will be available to him and, what I think is much more important, he will lose a great volume of dignified and solvent employment for between 1,000 and 2,000 families in the West, North West and South West of Ireland, where there is no conceivable possibility of providing any alternative form of employment. We are faced with the lamentable fact that this Government seems to have made up its mind that the right policy for the congested areas in the West of Ireland is to knock down the cliffs and let in the sea and push the people out.  I think that is all wrong.  I think it is a complete illusion.  It is this horrible doctrine enunciated by Mr. Cahan, who was here recently from the O.E.E.C., that what matters is efficiency and high money-earning power.  It is an illusion and, for this country a disastrous illusion, because, in that climate of competition, nothing can happen to us in international competition but that we should go to the wall.  If we refuse that competition and elect for our own kind of life, certain economic consequences may be inevitable but we preserve something worth retaining.</P>
      <P>If we embark upon this other frantic scramble to try to constitute ourselves a competitor with the black country of England and the Ruhr of Germany, we simply become a poor, neglected slum. We do not belong in that camp.  We are prepared to accept the kind of life that this country can afford its people. We have probably, in my judgment, one of the best kinds of life to be had in Europe or, indeed, in the world. It does not appeal to everybody.  It manifestly does not appeal to Mr. Cahan but, at least, it gives us sufficient resources to pay our part of Mr. Cahan's wages and we have not defaulted in any of our international obligations to pay.  I see no prospect of our ever having to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seriously apprehend that, if we throw away what we have got, and <Col N="1942" /> substitute trawlers for boat-owning fishermen and aspire to the day when those who are at present boat-owning fishermen go to sea as hired men in deep-sea or middle-sea trawlers in the employment even of so charitable a person as Mr. Venner-Gren, we make an irreversible decision which hereafter we shall have bitter cause to regret.</P>
    <P>I think Section 4 is a thoroughly bad section and it is necessary that the facts relating to it should be fully known.  I know that marketing conditions have materially changed but I think it is well to remember that we have three trawlers, or had three trawlers, operated by Bórd Iascaigh Mhara.  I do not know what has become of them.  I think they are being used for training now.  But, what was our experience operating these three middle-water trawlers&mdash;and they were operating, not into Killybegs but, at the end, into Dublin?  In one year, in any case, we had a loss in excess of £11,000.  I know they were very bad trawlers in that they were in a miserable state of repair but I do not think they ever made a profit in any year of their operation.</P>
    <P>I am told that middle water trawlers of this kind, that is to say, boats that are neither inshore fishermen's boats nor steam trawlers suitable for going to the Greenland coast, have been heavily subsidised in Great Britain but consistently at a loss.  In the six years up to 1947, 400 such middle water trawlers had been scrapped in Britain and I believe the reason for it is that the fishing grounds acceptable to middle-water trawlers are largely fished out.</P>
    <P>I have not read the Minister's most recent circulation with sufficient care to ascertain whether he has adjusted his estimate of the available market for fish products in Great Britain which, on one occasion, I think he described as being in the order of £33,000,000.  These figures are very often illusory, particularly when you come to examine that figure and discover that, of it, £12,000,000 represents imports of whale oil.</P>
    <P>Our interest in imports of whale oil into Britain is relatively remote.  It is used for a certain type of lubrication. <Col N="1943" /> These purely economic considerations are not for me to discuss in opposing Section 4 of this Bill.  The reason I oppose it is because I am perfectly certain that it marks the emergence of a dialectic which is going to lead to the extinction of the boat-owning fishermen along our coasts.  I despair of the situation if the present Minister is to be succeeded by Deputy Moran. If that happens anything can happen but our only hope is that we shall get them out before irretrievable damage is done to this form of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert at the beginning of the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Subsection (1) of section 9 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of &lsquo;the prescribed number (not less than thirty-five) of&rsquo; for &lsquo;thirty-five&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to control the operation of vessels which are described as being not less than 35 feet in length.  The amendment makes it unnecessary to license vessels of our own which are under that length.  It is a purely drafting amendment and makes it possible to avoid unnecessary licensing.  If a number of trawlers of this kind were interfering with the inshore fishermen we would put into operation an order stipulating that the owners of those vessels must go out to certain fishing areas, that they must dispose of their fish for export or that they must dispose of their fish by selling them to certain canneries.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 4, as amended, put and declared carried.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure Deputy Dillon that I am not acting in the capacity of a hypocrite in regard to this matter.  I want to assure him and the House that the controlling power left in my hands, or the hands of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, will be widely used.  There is absolutely no intention of allowing our inshore fishermen to disappear in favour of middle water trawlers.  The whole purpose of these amendments is to take advantage of a likely market, the possibility of export and in order to establish canneries and fish meal plants in which private promoters are willing to provide some part of the capital.  In this way we can have diversified fishing.</P>
      <P>It is most unlikely that, in the course of the next two or three years, the number of trawlers thus operating would take away the opportunities of the inshore fishermen in helping to provide fish for these canneries.  I have great hope of success in having three of these canneries established.  One has been built at Dunmore East and another is in construction at Kinsale. The third, I understand, is to be built by the Atlantic Fishing Company in Killyhegs.  These plants will be able to exploit the market for sprat, which have never been fished for in our waters.</P>
      <P>My intentions are strictly honourable in this regard and I would ask Deputy Dillon to accept that.  He may suggest that something may go wrong but he ought to accept my word that my intentions are honourable as regards the retention of the inshore fishermen and the giving to them of an opportunity to provide fish for the market.  I hope the Deputy will not accuse me of bad faith.</P>

      <P>Long experience has taught me that one must never judge one's fellow-man.  That is the prerogative of God Almighty, who created us all.  I do not purport to be capable of judging the innermost mind of the Minister for Lands.  All I can do, and all members of this House can do, is to state honestly what I or they believe to be true.  I have had long experience of the Department of Fisheries. I have been approached by <Col N="1945" /> people who wanted to do what the Minister now proposes to license them to do.  I carefully examined these proposals and I am quite satisfied that I could have unloaded off my back all responsibility to wealthy companies who were prepared to come in here and guarantee a supply of fish at a price substantially lower than that operating here at the present time.  With the entire approval of the Government of which I was a member I rejected that approach on the grounds that it was our settled policy to preserve the market for inshore fishermen and, mind you, preserving that market for inshore fishermen is a pretty thankless task because the Minister in office spends most of his time being kicked around by a lot of these people in the iniquitous practice that has grown up of being asked why he is not doing more for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And, as Deputy Sweetman says, while they are pretty consistently voting for Fianna Fáil but, nevertheless, with the knowledge I have of conditions obtaining in those areas I am sure mine was the right policy and our Government had the right policy.  I do not charge the Minister with bad faith.  We want more than token proof of that, if anyone bandies that charge lightly about. However, I do think that sometimes he sins against the Light in, for the purposes of expediency, doing what he believes is wrong in principle.  I do not make that allegation in this context but I do say he is falling into error in believing that good intentions are a substitute for good policy.  He forgets that the way to Hell is paved with good intentions and, with the best intentions in the world, he is embarking on a dialectic which is going to bring catastrophic results to a section <Col N="1946" /> of the community very dear to me and to anybody who understands the social pattern of the Gaeltacht and the western seaboard.  What depresses me in connection with this business is that it is one of the things that, in my view, is irreversible.  If you destroy the pattern of living and employment associated with inshore fisheries, it can never be reconstructed again and we shall have lost something that, in my view, is of incalculable value to our society.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances of the time being, this Government has a large majority to make its will prevail, and an ultimate judgment cannot be made between their policy and our policy except by the event that, perhaps the results of the elections that are now coming to hand may expedite the eminently desirable advent of a general election in which it is not unlikely that the people of this country will choose a new Government which can correct, in time, the errors into which the Minister&mdash;perhaps with the best intentions&mdash;is none the less certainly falling.</P>
