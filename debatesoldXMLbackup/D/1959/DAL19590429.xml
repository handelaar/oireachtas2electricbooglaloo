      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to a similar question from Deputy Desmond which is reported in the Dáil Debates for the 2nd December, 1958 (Vol. 171 No. 10, cols. 1259 and 1260).</P>
      <P>Since that reply was given, the income limit for insurability of non-manual workers has been raised by the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1958, from £600 to £800 a year, but the services available to insured persons and the conditions under which they are made available remain as they were.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity, a Cheann Chomhairle, to inform the House that the general statement on eligibility for health services circulated with the Official Report of the reply to Deputy Desmond's question has had to be revised because of the changes made by the Health and Mental Treatment (Amendment) Act, 1958, as respects the eligibility of non-insured persons for some health services. With your permission, a copy of the revised statement will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">AN ROINN SLÁINTE</P>
      <P Just="Center">Health Services.</P>
      <P>A summary of the health services available for various classes of the population is set out below.  These services are provided by local health authorities.  Inquiries about entitlement to them or about their operation should be addressed to the Secretary of the County Council or, in the case of persons resident in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Waterford, to the City Manager.  If, by reason of special local arrangements, the person mentioned is not dealing with the particular service, he will forward the inquiry to the proper person.</P>
      <P>A person who thinks he is eligible for any of the services and wishes to use them should apply in good time to the local authority as, in some cases, late applications will not be considered.</P>
      <P>There is no compulsion on any person to avail himself of any of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1239" /> (1)  Services for the lower income group.</P>
    <P>Persons in the lower income group (that is, broadly speaking those who are unable to provide the services from their own resources) and their dependants, are elegible, without charge, for:&mdash;</P>
    <P>the general medical services provided by dispensary doctors, together with any medicines, appliances etc. which may be necessary; maternity care service and infant welfare service (for infants up to six weeks old);</P>
    <P>hospital and specialist services:</P>
    <P>a supply of milk for expectant and nursing mothers and for children under five years of age (available at the discretion of the local health authority);</P>
    <P>a maternity cash grant of £4 for each confinement;</P>
    <P>essential dental, ear and eye services (where provided by the local health authority).</P>
    <P>(Note: General Medical Services Cards are issued by local health authorities to persons in the lower income group, for presentation whenever the services of the dispensary doctor are needed.  Persons who consider that they come within the lower income group may apply to the local authority for one of these cards).</P>
    <P>(2)  Services for the middle income group.</P>
    <P>The middle income group includes such of the persons in the following categories as are not in the lower income group, and their dependants:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  persons currently, or until recently, insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, (as amended);</P>
    <P>(b)  adult persons whose yearly means are less than £800;</P>
    <P>(c)  adult persons whose yearly means are, in the opinion of the local health authority, derived wholly or mainly from farming, <Col N="1240" /> the rateable valuation of the farm or farms (including the buildings thereon) being £50 or less.</P>
    <P>In calculating yearly means for the purposes of (b) and (c) above, the means of the husband and wife and of any unmarried sons, daughters, stepsons and stepdaughters living in the household are taken into account.  The first £100 of the yearly means of a son, daughter, stepson or stepdaughter are, however, disregarded, subject to a limit of £300 in any family.  &ldquo;Yearly means&rdquo; includes an estimated value of investments, property, etc., in addition to income in cash.</P>
    <P>Persons in the middle income group are entitled to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>a free maternity care service and infant welfare service (for infants up to six weeks old);</P>
    <P>hospital services as in-patients&mdash; free for maternity patients and for patients suffering from tuberculosis and certain other infectious diseases, and at a charge not exceeding 10/- a day covering all the hospital services in other cases;</P>
    <P>specialist services as out-patients &mdash;free for maternity patients and for tuberculosis patients, and at a charge of 7s. 6d. for an X-ray examination and 2s. 6d. for any other specialist service in other cases.</P>
    <P>(3)  Services for persons outside these groups.</P>
    <P>Other persons (and their dependants) who, in the opinion of the local health authority, would be unable without undue hardship to provide the services needed for themselves or their dependants may be given maternity services, hospital services and specialist services.  The maternity services for these are free, but charges are leviable for hospital and specialist services not related to maternity or infectious diseases.</P>
    <P>(4)  Services for children.</P>
    <P>Apart from any services to which they may be entitled as dependants of persons in the groups mentioned <Col N="1241" /> above, there is available for pupils of national schools a free school health examination service, with free hospital and specialist services and dental, ear and eye services for defects discovered at such examinations. A child welfare clinic service for children under six years old is available free of charge in some urban areas.  Free dental, ear and eye services are available for children in respect of these defects discovered at these clinics.</P>
    <P>(5)  Choice of hospital or home.</P>
    <P>If a patient, eligible for hospital services (other than for infectious diseases) prefers to make a choice, from a list approved by the Minister, of a hospital, nursing home or maternity home instead of availing of the hospital service provided by the health authority, that authority will, subject to certain conditions, contribute to such hospital or home towards his or her maintenance there.  In such cases the person concerned will be liable for charges by the hospital or home over and above the contribution paid by the local authority.</P>
    <P>(6)  Tuberculosis and Other Infectious Diseases.</P>
    <P>In addition to the hospital services mentioned above, services are provided for discovering if persons are suffering from tuberculosis and certain other infectious diseases.  These services are provided free to any person using the health authority's scheme.  Facilities for B.C.G. vaccination against tuberculosis, immunisation against diphtheria, and similar measures of protection are also provided free by the health authority.  There is no means test for any of the foregoing infectious diseases services.  Cash allowances are payable while persons undergoing treatment for tuberculosis or certain other infectious diseases are not able to provide for themselves or their dependants, where hardship would result if allowances were not paid.</P>
    <P>(7)  Disabled Persons (Maintenance) Allowances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> A Disabled Persons (Maintenance) Allowance is payable to a chronically disabled person over sixteen years of age who cannot maintain himself and whose near relatives cannot maintain him, provided that his disability has lasted or may be expected to last for at least one year from its onset and that he is not maintained in an institution.  The maximum allowance payable is £1 per week. There is no provision under this scheme for allowances for dependants of such persons.</P>

      <P>I have received a letter on this subject from the Clerk to the Buncrana Urban District Council.  I am aware that delays in customs clearance at Bridgend Frontier Post have occurred at peak traffic periods. Speedy clearance at this point presents special difficulties for the reason that the heavy flow of incoming traffic at such times cannot be accommodated in multiple lanes on the narrow roadway.  I fully appreciate the importance of maximum expedition in clearance and various measures, including augmentation of the local customs staff, are being taken towards <Col N="1243" /> this end.  I am satisfied that the methods of inspection in this area are not more strict than is essential for reasonably effective customs control.</P>

      <P>As was announced in the <Col N="1244" /> official statement issued on the matter on the 3rd February, 1959, the party visiting the United States of America in response to the invitation received from President Eisenhower comprised the President and his wife, the Minister for External Affairs and his wife and the two Aides-de-Camp to the President.</P>
      <P>Full accounts in respect of the expenses to be borne by Irish public funds have not yet been received. From the information at present available it is estimated that these expenses, including the cost of travel, will amount to about £11,000, of which £8,000 approximately, inclusive of special representation and other expenses arising out of the President's visit borne by the Embassy and other Offices in U.S.A., is appropriate to the Vote for External Affairs.  When full accounts are available it is my intention to introduce a supplementary estimate for the portion of the total expenditure that is appropriate to the Vote for the President's Establishment. I am not in a position at present to reply to the Deputy's query as to the cost per person.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he had discussions in New York recently, at the reception for the President, with Mr. Sobolev, Russian Ambassador to the United Nations; if he will state the nature of such discussions, and what reference was made to this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to say I had no opportunity of having a discussion with any of the Ambassadors at the reception in New York, as I had to leave early with the President to attend another function.</P>
      <P>On many other occasions, however, I have taken advantage of receptions and other functions to press our point of view with the diplomats of many nations, including Russia, regarding problems in which we are interested and suggestions for their solution.</P>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's request for a statement on the matter I may say that, apart from our right to speak publicly in the Assembly, one of the advantages of our being a member of the United Nations is that we can meet representatives of all the member nations.  We can thus play our part quietly in the diplomatic field in eliminating the &ldquo;shoot don't argue&rdquo; mentality. We are among the delegations in the Assembly who are trying to create the climate necessary for the development of policies which must be discussed and agreed upon by the major powers if disputes are to be settled on the basis of law and justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The booklet containing the suggestions I put forward for consideration in the United Nations in 1957 is available in the bookshops, and those I <Col N="1249" /> made last year will be available in the course of a week or so.  Those who want to know the truth as to where Ireland stands in the United Nations can read it for themselves in these booklets, and their constructive criticism and suggestions will be more than welcome.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish to say that the loyal and hardworking Delegation in the United Nations which I had the honour to lead in the last two years is recognised in that Assembly as a Delegation which has a useful contribution to make, and makes it effectively. That contribution is a contribution to the cause of true peace, made in the certainty that if we cannot overcome the disastrous but understandable fears, hatreds and resentments which block the way to discussion and agreements on the establishment and enforcement of the rule of law, the third world war is inescapable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's anxiety regarding the danger of a continuance of nuclear weapons tests.</P>
      <P>We supported the resolution in the United Nations which expressed the hope that the Geneva Conference on the discontinuance of nuclear tests would reach early agreement on the suspension of tests under effective international control.  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, the Political Committee of the United Nations Assembly passed a clause in a resolution tabled by us recognising the danger of a wider dissemination of nuclear weapons.  This clause was passed by thirty-seven votes to nil with forty-four abstentions.</P>
      <P>We secured this result not only by approaching the &ldquo;uncommitted small nations&rdquo; to which the Deputy refers, but by frequent and prolonged discussions with delegates from every group represented in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may rest assured that we will continue our efforts to promote agreement among the nations:</P>
      <P>(a)  for the effectively controlled abolition of all nuclear tests which add to radio activity dangerous to the health of the human race;</P>
      <P>(b)  for the non-dissemination of nuclear weapons by nuclear powers;</P>
      <P>(c)  for an agreement that the non-nuclear powers should not manufacture or possess nuclear weapons;</P>
      <P>(d)  for the cessation of the manufacture of nuclear material for weapons and for the ultimate disposal of the stocks of such material for peaceful purposes as part of a general agreement on balanced disarmament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned last night I referred to the fact that Deputies had mentioned the Suez Canal crisis as having an effect on the monetary crisis that arose here towards the end of 1956 and I said that I had some observations to make on that point. First of all, according to the 1957 record of the International Monetary Fund the effect of the Suez Canal closure on Western Europe was not severe.  Industrial activity was not significantly affected by lack of fuel or raw materials.  I am taking that as referring generally to Western Europe and to come down to our own <Col N="1258" /> country I think there are no grounds for holding that the closure had a more adverse effect on Ireland than on other Western European countries.</P>
      <P>At no time was there a serious shortage of oil supplies or any limitation of raw materials of industry.  Imports of kerosene increased by 22 per cent. in quantity during the period October, 1956 to March, 1957 as compared with the period October, 1955 to March, 1956.  I might mention that I am taking the six months following the Suez crisis when I take October, 1956 and March, 1957 and during those six months the import of kerosene was 22 per cent. higher actually than in the six months I have compared with it.  Imports of motor spirit, other than aviation spirit, fell by only six per cent. and imports of fuel, gas and diesel oils fell by less than one per cent.</P>
      <P>The effect of the crisis on industrial production can, therefore, have been only very slight.  The depressed level of industrial production in October, 1956 to March, 1957 was mainly due to factors other than the Suez crisis, principally, the effect of the measures taken early in 1956 to redress the serious balance of payments position. The automobile assembly industry was probably most affected by the crisis because of the effect of petrol rationing on consumer demand but even in this industry the effect of the special import levies was greater.  This is shown by the fact that in the six months, April to September, 1956, prior to the closure of the Canal, the number of new private motor cars registered and licensed for the first time had fallen by almost 50 per cent. compared with the corresponding period of 1955, due principally to the operation of the special import levy imposed in March, 1956.  The Suez crisis had some impact on import prices, which increased by about six per cent. between September, 1956 and March, 1957.  The wholesale price index rose by less than four per cent. in this period and the consumer price index remained stable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the 1956-57 depression was not due to <Col N="1259" /> and, in fact, was hardly aggravated by the Suez crisis.  It was due to the imposition of import levies in March, 1956.  I am not disputing the necessity for the imposition of those levies. Something had to be done to deal with the serious position in our balance of payments.  Whether that was the best method of dealing with it or not I am not going to discuss at the moment. As to what was the cause of the imbalance can be examined at another time.  My only object in making these remarks at this stage is to have the Suez crisis removed from the picture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes, another time.  I said in my Budget speech that unemployment had been reduced over the past 12 months and that emigration had been reduced, and that statement is true.  The last return, for April 18th&mdash;the last return Deputies have got; at least, the last I have come across&mdash;shows a reduction of over 5,000 since the same date in 1958 and a reduction of 10,000 since the same date in 1957.  At the same time there is a decrease in employment.  That was also the case, I may say, when the Coalition Government were in power and were boasting during 1955/56 about the big reduction they were making in unemployment.  During those years, also, the figure for employment was going down.  So, if the last Government had any reason to make a claim that they were doing well by reducing unemployment during those years, 1955 and 1956, we have at least the same claim.  In fact, this figure of employment has been reducing over the last 10 years.  In fact, if Deputies would examine again Table 12 they will find that during the last 10 years employment has been going down, except for one year.  The only year in which there was an improvement was 1954 and that, I think we can justly claim, was due to the result of three years of wise Government by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am coming to that.  I was thinking that some less informed Deputy on the other side would make a remark like that.  I am <Col N="1261" /> coming to the point that these figures are taken in March each year.  So, they were taken in March, 1954, in or about the time the Governments were changing over and it would be a remarkable thing indeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh yes.  Another point arises from the fact that these figures are taken early in the year.  I was informed this morning, semi-officially or unofficially, that these figures are usually based on a March return but, whether it is March or June, the point I am making here will be almost equally effective.  It is difficult to explain, I admit&mdash;nobody has given a very good explanation of the point &mdash;that you could have unemployment going down and at the same time <Col N="1262" /> employment going down and the only obvious explanation is that emigration makes up for the difference.  At the same time, we are claiming that emigration went down last year and I will deal with that in a moment but I may be asked how do I explain that. The only explanation I can give is that these figures for employment are taken early in the year; the improvement in emigration took place, largely, towards the end of the year and if we are right in claiming that emigration has gone down in 1958, then we must definitely expect to see an improvement in employment in the 1959 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that that is contrary to what the Minister and Deputy Sweetman think?  Surely employment figures are taken as an average over the whole year and are related to the number of insurance stamps sold?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I believe they are taken early in the year.  I do not know why, but that is what I have been told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit daft to do that because peak unemployment occurs at the beginning of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if I am asked a Parliamentary Question I can answer that more fully.  I just casually asked for information this morning.  It may be assumed, I think, that the figures are taken early in the year.  That being so, and if emigration improved considerably during the year, we must expect an improvement in the employment figures for 1959, assuming they also are taken early in the year. I think we shall have to leave the matter at that for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not got the final quarter sales of national health insurance stamps. Apparently they were not ready the other day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe they are out now, and they are up on last year. With regard to emigration, there is a certain amount of confusion.  In fact there is a certain amount of suspicion, <Col N="1263" /> if you like, because sometimes in the House here or outside it Government speakers may say that emigration is decreasing.  There are no statistics of emigration and the Office of Central Statistics will not give a figure except after the census.  They know exactly then how many people have left the country.  They compute the births and deaths.  It is, therefore, only a matter of simple arithmetic to find out how many left in the intercensal period. When the Taoiseach replies to a Parliamentary Question here he cannot give statistics for emigration in the interim.  He just conveys to the person seeking information what he gets from the Statistics Office.  Apart from that, every year we get details of the number of people leaving the country by air and sea.  There is no check on those who cross the Border and that is, if you like, a defect.</P>
      <P>We also get the number of people coming in and, by deducting the number coming in from the number going out, we get a rough estimate of emigration.  It is not an exact figure, but it is one from which one can gather the trend.  If the figure is growing smaller and smaller, then the position with regard to emigration is favourable from our point of view.  If the figure is getting higher and higher we know it is unfavourable.  On that basis, the latest figure we have is for the twelve months ending February 1958; the figure is 59,000.  For the twelve months ending February, 1959, the figure is 33,000.  Now these figures are by no means reliable to the last thousand, but the position would appear to be that 26,000 fewer people emigrated last year as against the year before.  That is all we can say about emigration.  Summing up then, as between employment, unemployment and emigration, if the figures we have are correct&mdash;we know they are correct with regard to unemployment&mdash;then we must definitely expect to have a better figure for employment in 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took note of a few points made by Deputy Cosgrave.  The Deputy is wrong in saying that the decrease in the export of whiskey is due to taxation. I know that is what the distillers say <Col N="1264" /> but I do not think they could prove the point.  I do not blame the distillers for making that point as strongly as they can&mdash;perhaps they believe it&mdash; and it is a good point to make when they come along annually looking for a reduction in the tax.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the tax on newsprint, among them Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy J.A. Costello. Deputy Costello said he objected to it in principle.  He objected to the levy being coverted into a revenue tax.  I have not been convinced that this tax should be removed.  It was imposed in the first instance to curb imports of paper and generally to keep imports down.  We are not yet clear&mdash;I have made that perfectly plain&mdash;of the danger of an adverse balance.  A good case, therefore, would have to be made for the removal of any tax put on for the specific purpose of curbing imports. It is true the tax was imposed in the first instance as a levy.  It is now a revenue tax.  Irrespective of whether it is a levy or a revenue tax a case would have to be made for its removal which would outweigh or counterbalance the reason why it was imposed in the beginning.  The tax is only five per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>An awful lot of newsprint is misused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite right.  I may say I was not approached by the proprietors of the daily papers in this matter.  This does not apply to managers.  I was approached by some of the provincial papers.  I am sure the reason I was not approached is because the proprietors could not make a proposal to reduce the price of their respective papers and they therefore did not come along to look for a reduction in the tax.  If the proprietors made a case that they were going to reduce the price of their papers one would have to listen to them.  If the tax is removed it is obvious one of two things will happen; the money saved will be spent on more paper and interfere thereby with our balance of trade.  I think our newspapers are quite big enough as they are; it is hard enough to go <Col N="1265" /> through them as they are without having them made any bigger. Alternatively, the money will go into the profits of the newspaper people. I do not know what those profits are like.  I assume they are all right. Unless the danger of an adverse balance is removed we could not possibly consider removing the tax on newspapers.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies have quoted a poster that was supposed to have been issued by Fianna Fáil in the last election.  I do not remember seeing the poster myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could hardly miss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Wives get your husbands back to work.&rdquo;  Now that poster may have been issued but I do not think Deputies opposite should waste time arguing the point because, when they do, really what they are saying in essence is that there were so many wives with husbands out of work they were able to give Fianna Fáil a big majority.  Opposition Deputies maintain that that slogan put Fianna Fáil back in office.  I have already given the inference to be drawn from that argument.  We should be realistic in these matters.  The poster, if it was issued, may have influenced some votes, but it cannot have been a really big item in deciding the result of the election.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies referred to the livestock census issued shortly before this debate.  Naturally Deputies are interested in that census.  What is the result of that census?  The result is that over the last two years cattle have increased by 30,000 odd; sheep by 539,000 and pigs by 52,000.  That is not bad for the two-year period.  The trend is in the right direction especially when one remembers that the big increase in cattle is in in-calf heifers and that means a much bigger number of cattle in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one adverse feature.  That is, that compared to last year pigs are down; in other words pigs went up the first year, went down the second year and on the whole they are higher <Col N="1266" /> than they were two years ago.  On balance we are better off now than we were taking over from the last Government. I notice that where we have got an increase in livestock, tillage, or in production in agriculture it is claimed by some of the Deputies on the opposite side as being due to the good management of Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture that all these benefits are coming to us.  If they take the credit for all these things they ought to take the blame as well.  If pigs went down last year let Deputy Dillon take the blame; alternatively we will take the credit or the blame as the case may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer especially to Deputy Russell's remarks. Many Deputies were troubled about the great expenditure, saying nothing was being done to reduce it.  As Deputy Sweetman has just said about the increase in livestock, the reduction in expenditure is also a very slow process and I am doubtful if expenditure will come down.  When people talk about reducing taxation there are two ways of looking at it.  We did reduce taxation this year by way of a reduction of income tax and entertainment tax.  In spite of that our income may be higher on the year. Whether Deputies would call that reduced taxation or increased taxation, I do not know, but if we can cut down the incidence of taxation and <Col N="1267" /> at the same time get in more money I think we have achieved our purpose in reducing taxation.</P>
      <P>It must be obvious that you cannot give out more to old age pensioners and other people without increasing taxation, without increasing the income, as it were.  Deputy Russell referred to the statement I made in the 1957 Budget in which I proposed certain specific savings and one of them was on the Civil Service.  I said I intended to make a saving of £250,000 in 1957-58 on the remuneration of civil servants.  In fact the saving was a little more than £250,000 when it was totted up at the end of the financial year.  That could not be repeated the following year because civil servants got an increase in salary which amounted to something in the region of £750,000.  I have no figures yet for the last financial year as to the cost of the Civil Service. I referred again last year to proposals for the reorganisation of the Civil Service.  That is being done with two objectives.  We believe that if this reorganisation is carried out&mdash;and as I said in my Budget it is now being considered by the staff organisations from whom we expect help in the matter&mdash;we expect to get a more efficient Civil Service and a more satisfied Civil Service and I hope eventually some economy, but of course it is very hard to get the economies when you have to face an increase in salaries every three or four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Minister to say that I quoted his own words in 1957, that £17 million for the Civil Service was far too high? I did not refer to individual salaries which I know in some cases are too low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy quoted my own statement in that connection. I did feel and still feel it is too high for this country.  The difficulty of reducing it is a very big one but it is not being lost sight of. However, let us consider current State expenditure in, say, 1948-49 as against what is estimated for the coming year. <Col N="1268" /> The reason I am taking those years is that I want to make a defence not only for this Government but for the previous Government, too.  It is a twelve-year period from the 1st April, 1948, to 31st March, 1960.  For six of those years we will have been in control by 1960 and for the other six years the Deputies on the Opposition side were in control.  Taking these twelve years I want to refer to certain items: social welfare, health, education and agriculture.  I do not think any Deputy would say we should cut down on social services.  Even Deputies who are talking about expenditure being too high advocated we should go a bit further in that direction.  The same applies to health.  Every remark made here on health at any time is always to the effect that people are not getting the health services they should get or have to pay too much for it.  Therefore, I do not know if we can make any economy there.  In regard to education we all agree we should spend all we can on it.  Ex-this year by a very substantial amount, something over £1 million, but nobody has objected to that.  In relation to agriculture, everybody talks about giving more to agriculture.</P>
      <P>Let us take these four items over the twelve years from 1948-49 until 1959-60, the estimate for which we have just completed.  Social Welfare will be up by £15.3 million; Health will be up by £6.5 million; Education will be up by £7.4 million; and Agriculture by £6.3 million.  Another item I shall put in which nobody seems enthusiastic about is the service of debt.  We cannot help that; it must be paid; and that is £20.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the gross or the net figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest plus sinking fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not take account of interest coming back into the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. it is the gross. The total current expenditure in 1948-49 was £71.59 million and <Col N="1269" /> the estimate of the total current expenditure for 1959-60 is £127.57 million.  That is a difference of £56 million and if you take these five items out, Social Welfare, Health, Education, Agriculture and debt, our expenditure is actually the same this coming year as it was in 1948-49.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that you cannot give more for old age pensions or education without spending more.  Expenditure goes up, that is the unfortunate fact.  It is fairly obvious that as between four Governments, two from this side of the House and two from the other side, that between all of them the increases have been under these five headings. If you leave these aside expenditure on the other headings has remained constant.  As a matter of fact taxation is a bit less because the income from the Post Office is now £5.6 million higher than it was at that time.  If you do not regard that as taxation then taxation is lower than it was at that time.  Of course, if you like you could regard that as taxation because the Post Office is a Government service and you can regard what you pay for stamps, for a telegram or for your telephone as a tax if you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main object of this Budget is to promote production so as to increase employment and raise the standard of living.  I am satisfied that the reduction in the standard rate of Income Tax, following many other concessions over the past five or six years to industry and also the large increase in the aids to agriculture, will have a significant effect in building up our economy. To give this fillip to our economy I am taking a risk in estimating for £2½ million to be found either from over-estimation of expenditure or under-estimation of income. There is no doubt that a Minister for Finance always takes a risk and, as I have already pointed out, the risk is not justified in nearly every case.  The only thing, however, that can be charged against me is that I am taking a bigger risk this year than I did last year in taking £2½ million <Col N="1270" /> as a sum in expenditure to be covered by errors one way or the other.</P>
    <P>I have taken this risk after due deliberation because I believe we have now got out of the depression.  We descended into that depression in 1956 and it continued into 1957 but now our economy is ascending out of it.  If I am right this Budget will be balanced and that fact in itself will help the ascent.  If this Budget is balanced our economy will have improved considerably.  I only hope that my optimism will be realised and I presume that I can say that every Member of this House will share with me the hope that we will see in this year an improvement in our economy.</P>

    <P>De ghlan-mhéid an Mheastacháin, caithfear beagnach £4,300,000 nó 64% ar phá, liúntais agus cothabháil na mBuan-Oglaigh.  Tá an tsuim sin riartha ar roinnt Fho-Mhírcheann. Mar is gnáth, rinneadh amach an Meastachán ar fhoras na Bunaíochta Síochána, dar líon anois 1,336 oifigeach agus 11,892 fhear, maraon le laghduithe i leith na n-uimhreacha is dealraitheach a bheidh an líon féin i rith na bliana faoi bhun na Bunaíochta.  Is amhlaidh mar atá go bhfuil soláthar á dhéanamh sa Mheastachán do 1,174 oifigeach, trí daltai is daichead agus 8,000 fear.  An líon atá beartaithe do na fir, tá sé cúig chéad níos mó ná an líon dá ndearnadh soláthar anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Ba mhian liom moladh a thabhairt d'Óglaigh na hÉireann mar gheall ar a meanmnacht árd agus feabhas a dtréineála an bhliain seo gabh tharainn. Tá glactha le scéim nua ath-eagraíochta agus, dá barr sin, déanfar iomlánú, don chéad uair, ar na BuanÓglaigh, an Cúltaca Céad-Líne agus An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  Creidim go mbeidh de thoradh air sin Fórsa Cosanta níos fearr a chur ar fáil don tír.  Ba mhaith an ní é, dá ndéanfadh iadsin uile atá i riocht chuige, anáil a chur faoi dhaoine ina measc an Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil a neartú&mdash;Fórsa a bhfuil am agus dúthracht caite go fial ag a chomhaltaí leis an ard-chaighdeán éifeachtúlachta atá acu faoi láthair a bhaint amach.  Iarraim, freisin, go gcuideofaí leis an gCosaint Shibhialta i ngach slí is féidir.  Ní raibh ach toradh cuíosach ar an earcaíocht ina comhair a bhí ann cheana.  In áiteanna áirithe bhí an toradh go maith ar fad ach in áiteanna eile ba chúis mhór díomá é.  Cláraíodh tuairim is trí mhíle, seacht gcéad fear agus bean san eagraíocht agus tá teagasc faighte ag dhá mhíle agus cúig chéad díobh sin. Má tá aon dul chun cinn le déanmh sa Chosaint Shibhialta, caithfidh na daoine go léir breis suime agus dúthrachta a chur inti.  Ba mhian liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na <Col N="1273" /> daoine atá san eagraíocht cheana agus, fós, leis na cumainn chabhairdheontacha atá ann faoi láthair, mar gheall ar a dtacaíocht san obair.</P>
    <P>The gross Estimate for 1959-60 is £6,914,686, and the net Estimate, after the deduction of Appropriations-in-Aid, is £6,723,900&mdash;an increase of £355,840 on the original Estimate for 1958-59 as increased by a transfer of £165,500 from the Vote for Remuneration in connection with the pay increases which were granted last year and reduced by an amount of £6,000 transferred to the Vote concerned with Rates on Government Property.</P>
    <P>Of the net Estimate, almost £4,300,000, or 64 per cent. of the total, is required for the pay, allowances and maintenance of the Permanent Defence Force.  The sum in question is spread over a number of sub-heads, some of which I shall be referring to specifically later in my statement.  As usual, the Estimate has been framed on the basis of the Peace Establishment, which is now 1,336 officers and 11,892 men, with deductions in respect of the numbers by which actual strength during the year is likely to be below the Establishment.  In effect, the Estimate provides for 1,174 officers, 43 cadets and 8,000 men.  The proposed strength of men is 500 over the number for which provision was made last year. The experience of the last twelve months showed that it is impossible for the Army to carry out the necessary degree of advanced training and, at the same time, be ready at short notice to provide personnel for normal duties while the strength of men remains as low as 7,500.</P>
    <P>Before commencing to deal with the details of the Estimate, I should like first to pay tribute to the entire Defence Forces for the high standards of morale and training maintained in the past year.  A proof of these high standards was given by the fifty officers, representative of all Corps, who went to the Lebanon to operate with the United Nations Observer Group.  They received the highest praise for their efficiency and co-operation. The Commanding General of the United Nations Group, in expressing thanks for the excellent way <Col N="1274" /> in which they carried out their duty, said that they had given loyal and valuable service to the United Nations and added &ldquo;The Irish officers have made a great contribution to the success of this mission.  It has been a privilege and honour for me to have had them under my command.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During the past year, a general scheme of reorganisation of the Defence Forces was approved.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide a peace-time organisation which would enable the country to put into the field, on mobilisation, an initial force of a number of Brigades with the necessary ancillary services&mdash;the maximum force which we estimate could be raised in peace-time.  It is proposed to implement that new organisation later this year, and this will bring about for the first time the complete integration of the Permanent Defence Force, the First Line Reserve and An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  This integration has been made possible by the splendid spirit, enthusiasm and discipline shown by An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  That Force is to be complimented on its progress.  It is a voluntary body whose members have given generously of their time and effort in order to reach the present high standard of efficiency.  I believe that the result of this integration will be to give the country an improved Defence Force.  It is obviously desirable that An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil should be as numerically strong as possible.  It provides an opportunity of rendering national service which should appeal to every young man, and all additions to its ranks, as well as all assistance which Deputies and others in a position to exercise influence can give in strengthening it, will be heartily welcomed.</P>
    <P>In addition to its other duties, the Naval Service has continued quietly and efficiently throughout the year to provide fishing protection to the full extent of its resources.  It was particularly active recently when, as a result of the appearance of an unusually large number of foreign fishing vessels in the herring fishing grounds off the South-East Coast, two corvettes had to maintain a constant patrol in <Col N="1275" /> the area, and carried out five arrests of foreign vessels by which infringements of fishing laws were deemed to have been committed.</P>
    <P>As part of its training programme, the Army is currently running a number of schemes for the training and education of boys.  The primary purpose is the provision of technical personnel for the Forces.  It is also a valuable contribution to general vocational educational training in the country.  I should mention particularly the Apprentice School at Naas, which caters for the progressive training for three years of approximately 55 boys a year.  The scheme, which has as its objective the training of the boys in various trades, has been in operation for the past three years and the first intake of boys will pass out this year and will be posted to units where the boys will continue to practise their trades.  This scheme is recognised by the Trade Unions.  There are also the older schemes at Baldonnel, where boys and adults are trained in trades associated with the maintenance of aircraft, and the Army School of Music where about 25 boys are taken in every year to be trained as musicians. As well, there is in operation in the Signals Depot at the Curragh a progressive scheme whereby about 25 men a year are trained in trades connected with radio and radar.  I mention all these schemes particularly, because they merit the attention of parents and vocational education authorities.</P>
    <P>The latest recruiting campaign, which opened last October, has proved to be the most successful since 1952, the average monthly intake being almost 300.  Already, as a result of the campaign, more than 1,400 men have been enlisted in the Permanent Force.</P>
    <P>The School of Equitation is at present going through a period of transition. In recent years, we have not had the success in international riding competitions to which we were at one time accustomed and that, naturally enough, has been the cause of some disappointment and heartsearching.  A good deal of the criticism has been <Col N="1276" /> rather unfair.  The international standard of equitation has undoubtedly become much higher than in the days when it was taken as a matter of course that Irish horses and riders should sweep the field.  Conditions have also changed in other respects; for instance, in competitions there is now an emphasis on the time factor which did not exist before the war. We can, indeed, feel nothing but admiration for the young officers who since the war have had so many successes despite the fact that, on the whole, they had little or no riding experience until they joined the Army, and we must also sympathise with them in having to take part in competitions under the strain of knowing that so much is expected of them and that, if they fail, criticism rather than understanding is likely to be their lot.</P>
    <P>However, it is most desirable, from the point of view of advertising Irish horses abroad and also from the point of view of prestige, that every effort should be made to get back to our former standards, if that can be done, and steps towards that end are being taken.  We have at the School a number of officers, including some in training, who are regarded as very good, and we also have some horses of whom great things are expected in due course.  Furthermore, we hope to purchase some more horses&mdash;they are not as easy to come by as may be thought&mdash;which would be capable in a short time of being introduced to international competitions and which would bridge the gap until the other horses to which I have referred are ready.  Increased provision is, therefore, made in Subhead N for the purchase of horses this year.  We propose to take part this year only in four international competitions&mdash; those at Dublin, London, Ostend and Rotterdam&mdash;as well as at eleven local horse shows, and to devote the present year otherwise to efforts to reach again the eminence which was once our pride.</P>
    <P>The Recruiting campaign for civil defence since its inception late in 1956 has been no more than reasonably satisfactory.  In some areas the response has been very good, and in <Col N="1277" /> others it has been most disappointing. About 3,700 men and women have enrolled in the organisation and upwards of 2,500 of these have undergone instruction locally by instructors who were trained in the Department's Civil Defence School, Phoenix Park. There exists no more than the bare nucleus of a civil defence organisation in most areas and in some areas even that nucleus is not available.  If any progress is to be achieved a much greater effort on the part of the people as a whole is called for.  The unsatisfactory response in so many areas is attributable to the attitude of two main groups of people.  The first is composed of those who consider the problem entirely remote from this island with its history of neutrality. This is indeed a dangerous line of thought.  Even if this country should never be attacked directly it would be exposed to the potential dangers of radioactive fallout from nuclear devices falling outside the country.</P>
    <P>The second group is made up of those who maintain that it is beyond our powers to do anything really worth while to save human lives or reduce the damage to property in the event of attack by nuclear weapons.  The best answer to that, of course, is that the major powers who possess those weapons and who are therefore most aware of the extent of the awful havoc which can be wrought by them are in the forefront of those who are building up civil defence organisations.</P>
    <P>Civil defence is now an integral part of national defence in this country and it will continue so for so long as the world situation as a whole makes it quite clear that it is necessary.  A determined drive towards the establishment of an efficient civil defence organisation for this country within the next couple of years is being made by my Department within the limits of the available resources.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that some 2,000 volunteers from the three existing voluntary first aid societies will enrol in civil defence.  These volunteers together with any other suitable persons who may wish to join will form the nucleus of the Casualty and Ambulance Service of the Civil Defence <Col N="1278" /> Organisation.  A course has already been held by the Department in An Scoil Chosanta Sibhialta, Phoenix Park, for the completion of training of instructors for this Service.  Those who attended were members of the Irish Red Cross Society, the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the Order of Knights of Malta and they were nominated by their societies through their local authorities.  Two further courses for this Service have been arranged for the near future.  I would like to pay a special tribute to all the societies concerned for the co-operation which they have offered to me in this most important matter and which gives great hope for the future organisation of this Service.  I would like to make it clear that the voluntary service which the members of these organisations are giving in the local Civil Defence Services is in addition to the service which they are giving to their own organisations.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely necessary for me to stress again the urgent necessity for the existence throughout the State of an efficient civil defence organisation.  Towards this end I will continue to ensure that my Department does its utmost, but the success or otherwise of the objective will depend mainly on the people themselves, on whom the ultimate survival of the nation may well rest.  As in the case of An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil, therefore, I would appeal to all members of this House to use their influence and their energies towards inducing responsible individuals or associations to cooperate with their local authorities for the establishment of an efficient Civil Defence Service.</P>
    <P>In addressing myself to the details of the Estimate, it will no doubt be convenient for Deputies if I follow the usual practice of speaking first about the Subheads which show an appreciable increase and then about those which have decreased noticeably, and of commenting in each case upon the reasons.  I may say by way of introduction, however, that while the net increase of almost £356,000 is a very big one, about which nobody can be unconcerned, the higher rates of pay and allowances which came into operation last year, and the cost of <Col N="1279" /> the additional 500 men make up a very considerable portion of that increased figure.  There has been, in a number of other ways, very drastic pruning&mdash;in some instances, much more drastic than I am altogether happy about&mdash;in an effort to keep expenditure within bounds.</P>
    <P>There are a number of Subheads showing increases which I may take together because the increases are entirely or almost entirely attributable to one or both of the factors which I have mentioned already&mdash;increased rates of pay and allowances and the proposed increase in the strength of men from 7,500 to 8,000.  The Sub-heads in question are Subhead A&mdash; Pay of Officers, Cadets, N.C.O.s and Privates; Subhead B&mdash;Marriage Allowance; Subhead K&mdash;Provisions and Allowances in lieu, and Subhead Y2&mdash; the Reserve Defence Force.  In Sub-head A&mdash;Pay&mdash;the increase is £215,731 and it is entirely attributable to the two factors of which I have spoken.  In Subhead B&mdash;Marriage Allowance&mdash;there is an increase of £17,161.</P>
    <P>This arises partly from increases in the marriage allowance rates which came into force last year and partly from the fact that, with a larger Army, more men become eligible for admission to the married establishment. In Subhead K&mdash;Provisions and Allowances in Lieu&mdash;the increase is £66,337 which arises, firstly, from the increased cost of foodstuffs for those who are rationed and increased rates of ration allowance for those who are not and, secondly, from the proposed increase of 500 men.  The increase of £17,375 in Subhead Y2&mdash;the Reserve &mdash;arises entirely from increased pay and the cost of rations for An Foras Cosanta Áitiúil.  Actually, for the F.C.A. itself, the increase is somewhat more than £20,000, but the provisions for the First Line Reserve of Officers and Men are a little smaller than last year, as the strengths are lower.  First Line Reserve strengths are somewhat variable depending on the extent to which in any one year, transfers from the Permanent Force are greater or lesser than the casualties in the Reserve itself. <Col N="1280" /> I should, perhaps, draw Deputies' attention to the fact that, despite its title, Subhead A does not contain the entire provision for the pay of the Permanent Force.  Subhead E provides for the pay of the officers of the Medical Corps while Subhead P2 relates, <i>inter alia,</i> to the pay of the members of the Naval Service.  This is something which it is intended to tidy up in due course.</P>
    <P>Subhead C&mdash;Pay of Civilians attached to Units&mdash;shows an increase of £24,833.  In conjunction with that Subhead, I may also take Subhead S &mdash;Barrack Maintenance and New Works&mdash;in which there is a slight decrease of £1,497.</P>
    <P>The increase in Subhead C is caused entirely by pay increases. There is a reduction of 33 in the proposed average number of employees with the Corps of Engineers. Last year, an increase of 30 over the previous year's number was provided for, in order that necessary new works and maintenance might be carried out. This year, considerations of economy compel us to revert to a slightly smaller number.  Most of the work planned for this year is once more concerned with improving living conditions for the troops.</P>
    <P>Because of difficulties regarding the purchase of a site, it was not possible to start work during 1958-59 on the housing scheme for married soldiers at Collins Barracks, Cork.  The purchase was, however, effected recently, and I expect that work will commence at an early date.  This year, it is proposed to complete the new gymnasium at the Curragh, the new dining hall and cookhouse at Custume Barracks, Athlone, the modernisation of sanitary and ablution facilities in the married quarters at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, and a number of other works.  The new Catholic Church at the Curragh, the erection of which is under the supervision of the Office of Public Works, should also be completed this year.</P>
    <P>The increase in Subhead J&mdash;Mechanical Transport&mdash;of £9,770 arises from the urgent necessity to replace vehicles which are no longer serviceable, <Col N="1281" /> and that of £72,984 in Subhead M&mdash;Clothing and Equipment&mdash;results from the necessity to purchase increased stocks, as reserves are, to all intents and purposes, exhausted.  As well, larger numbers of men will now require to be clothed and equipped.</P>
    <P>The next increase to which I may refer is that of £12,368 in Subhead P &mdash;Defensive Equipment.  As I said last year, we have not yet built up full mobilisational stocks, but are nevertheless moderately well equipped with light conventional weapons, so that this year again I am seeking only a relatively small sum for defensive equipment.  It mainly covers commitments by way of instalment payments on long-term contracts and in the matter of maintenance.</P>
    <P>The amount of £130,341 for which provision is made under Subhead P.1 &mdash;Civil Defence&mdash;is £78,774 greater than the sum provided for in the Estimates for 1958/59.  This increase is mainly attributable to the proposed expansion of civil defence training to centres throughout the country for which no civil defence measures have been organised up to the present and to the provision of uniforms for an anticipated intake of further volunteers. The principal items making up the sum of £130,341 are Grants to Local Authorities who have statutory responsibilities for the organisation of civil defence services, and the purchase and maintenance of equipment and stores.</P>
    <P>Grants to local authorities account for £37,806 an increase of £12,739 over last year.  These grants include contributions towards the cost of civil defence administration by local authorities, towards the cost of uniforms for volunteers, and towards the servicing, storage and maintenance of equipment issued to local authorities. The provision of £109,235 for the purchase and maintenance of equipment and stores represents an increase of £82,035 as compared with last year's provision.  This increase is due mainly to the purchase of equipment for the additional centres to which it is proposed to expand civil defence training and to which I <Col N="1282" /> referred earlier.  Training equipment is supplied free by the State.</P>
    <P>Subhead R&mdash;Fuel, Light and Water &mdash;shows an increase of £8,300.  This again arises from increased costs as well as continuing increase in the use of electricity as a result of the improvement of amenities in different ways.</P>
    <P>Provision is made under Subhead X3 for payment of the sum of £17,950 to Cumann Croise Deirge na hÉireann by way of Grant-in-Aid. This is an increase of £2,500 over the provision for 1958-59 and is due to the necessity for greater financial assistance in connection with the financing of the Society's normal activities.  The provision also includes a sum of £5,000, the same as last year, for the maintenance of the group of White Russian refugees from North China which the society agreed to receive to look after.  During the year the society continued to care for the Hungarian refugees in Knockalisheen Camp until arrangements were completed for their resettling elsewhere. The camp was closed on the 15th December, 1958, and handed back to my Department on the 2nd February, 1959.  I should like to avail of this opportunity of paying a well-deserved tribute to the society for its work on behalf of the refugees and to the Army personnel who rendered assistance in that connection.  The society is to be highly recommended for its activities and deserves every help and encouragement.</P>
    <P>The last increase which it is necessary for me to mention is that in Subhead AA&mdash;Expenses in Connection with the Offences Against the State Acts.  The Estimate was, of course, prepared some time ago, and it is hoped that very little of the money provided in this subhead will be needed this year.</P>
    <P>I think that little need be said about the subheads which show decreases. The most substantial decreases are in Subhead O&mdash;General Stores&mdash;£14,749, and Subhead P2&mdash;Naval Services&mdash; £19,175.  As in the case of all the other subheads which show decreases, the proposed savings represent a pruning effort&mdash;and a very drastic <Col N="1283" /> pruning in some instances&mdash;in order to compensate to some extent for the unavoidable increases elsewhere in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Appropriations-in-Aid also show a nett decrease of £18,904.  The main individual items which bring about that decrease are the revenue from lands and premises, and the sale of surplus lands, which between them show a reduction of £21,940.  Against that, there is a new item&mdash;£11,730 in respect of refunds to be made to the Department by local authorities in respect of Civil Defence uniforms issued to them.  As regards the drop in revenue from lands, I may explain that surplus lands at Tallaght were disposed of during the past year, and deposits on the purchase price were received.  The sale transaction will be completed at an early date.  Some tenanted lands at Billeragh, Co. Cork, were transferred to the Land Commission with a view to the tenants being admitted to the benefits of the Land Purchase Acts.  Arrangements are also being made for the sale of the State's interest in certain lands at Bere Island to the tenants of the lands or their next-of-kin.</P>
    <P>That substantially covers everything of importance or interest in the Estimate. I shall, of course, be glad to give any further information that may be required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister pay tribute to the very high standard of the Defence Forces generally in relation to their conduct, discipline and general behaviour. I am pleased, as I am sure every member of the House is pleased, to learn about the report the Minister has received from the Commanding General of the United Nations Group, paying tribute to the excellence and the quality of the officers who went to the Lebanon.  We can all be proud of the way in which they carried out their duty and I should be glad if the Minister would convey to the officers concerned the appreciation of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I want to appeal to our people to assist the Department of Defence and the Government in <Col N="1284" /> building up our civil defence force and to train in all aspects of civil defence for the protection of our people in case of emergency.  As the Minister has very properly pointed out, even though we might not be directly attacked, we could suffer from fallout as a result of attacks on other countries.  If our people were properly prepared and trained and knew what to do in the event of such a catastrophe many lives and much suffering would be saved.  Therefore, I want to add my voice to that of the Minister, who is speaking in this case for the Government and the people as a whole, and in their best interests.</P>
    <P>I shall not comment on the Minister's approach to the problem of defence but the Minister should say what his policy and that of the Government is in the matter of defence.  When the first inter-Party Government was formed, in 1948, the then Minister for Defence and the Government took the view that the proper line to take was to plan for a period of peace of at least ten years. I should like to remind the Minister that when we took that decision there was a very violent attack made upon that policy.  It will be agreed by all and sundry now that our approach to the problem was the correct one and I should like to know from the Minister what his view is to-day and whether he is continuing that policy. An additional 500 to the Army strength does not mean any great change.  I should like the Minister to refer to that.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the amalgamation of the permanent Force, the Reserve and the F.C.A. is a very important step forward.  I am glad to note that by co-operation and goodwill a marriage, if I may use the word, has successfully taken place between these two and they are now working in complete harmony.  Of course they did work in harmony before, but they were not as integrated as they will be under the new system.  I commend the Minister on this.  It is the right line to take.  I suggest the Minister should give us his views on his intentions in relation to the question of promotion for Reserve Officers in the Junior Ranks.  He should say <Col N="1285" /> also what ranks he intends to establish in the F.C.A.  Will he keep it at a certain level?  Human nature being what it is, an extra bar is a great help even though it does not mean very much in the way of financial improvement.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told us whether he is planning for peace or for an emergency.  I shall not attempt to prophesy, but it is quite clear that the world is in a very dangerous and disturbed state.  Possibly we shall get some indication as to what information is available on the situation when we come to discuss the Vote for the Department of External Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told us what he intends to do with our Naval Service.  He has not said whether he intends expanding that Service, whether he intends attaching an air arm to it by way of helicopter service, or something like that.  It would be a good thing to have some arm that could act speedily and quickly in the protection of our territorial waters and the prevention of smuggling.  The Minister should have given us a little more detail about the type of vessels used.  At one time the possibility of getting a speedier and faster type of boat was under consideration, a boat which would serve our purposes better and would not be too costly to maintain. We cannot afford a very elaborate Navy.  I want to take this opportunity now of paying tribute to the high standard maintained.  I commend the excellent conduct of the officers and men.  I am informed they do their work very courteously, but at the same time very efficiently and very firmly.</P>
    <P>The training scheme for apprentices is an excellent one.  It is valuable to have boys trained in the various crafts and trades which form such an important part of our Defence Forces at all times.  The school at Naas caters for 55 boys.  I am sure that is not sufficient to meet all the demands made on the Minister for admission and I appeal to the Minister to extend the school as far as possible.  It is important that parents and those responsible for the wellbeing of our boys should make use of this school. <Col N="1286" /> I do not know that the recruiting campaign can be described as very successful.  An inflow of 300 in a month is not very much particularly at a time when there is considerable unemployment and a high rate of emigration.  If the conditions and pay were satisfactory one would expect a much higher rate of inflow.  It may be that the Minister and the recruiting teams were very selective and expected a very high standard, physically, mentally, and educationally.  It may be that we have got material of a very high quality.  I trust that is so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Equitation School and what is known as the Army Jumping Team, results have been rather disappointing for some years past.  There has been, of course, a radical change in the whole system of jumping competitions and, as the Minister has pointed out, we were not ready for that.  It must be remembered also that the present teams are composed of boys who never straddled a horse until they went into the riding school after getting their commissions.  One could not expect them to become experts overnight. In view of all the facts, these boys have given a very good account of themselves.  It must also be remembered that the horses were not the best.  I am glad the Minister has decided now to get the best.  I am glad that he intends to take in some trained horses.  He will want to watch his step, however, when he goes into that territory.  It can be very saucy and very costly.  I take it sound judgment will be exercised.  Naturally, we should send out the best that can be got and then train all the younger horses and bring them up to that standard.  We can do it.</P>
    <P>It is no longer true that the Irish half-bred hunter is in the field at all as far as jumping is concerned.  Race horses are wanted now and the time factor is entering into practically every international competition.  In the jumping competitions of the past it was the security of the horse and pilot that counted, not the speed. Now apparently we must have speed in everything.  There is no longer any question as to whether the horse is capable of carrying a child of nine <Col N="1287" /> or a veteran of 90 and it is no longer the first quality of the horse that he should be an armchair ride.  We have departed from that nationally and internationally and it is now the time factor that enters into competitions.</P>
    <P>What I want to emphasise is that the Minister should exercise patience with the young jumping team and with the young Army officers just out of the Cadet School.  We should emphasise to them that all he wants from them is that they should do their best.  If they are not at home on a horse, after a few weeks in the Equitation School, they should say that and they should be told that it is not something for which they should be rebuked.  If the young Army officer likes it, then he should be allowed to go on and he should be told that he is to do his best.</P>
    <P>The reduction in some items of expenditure is to be welcomed but I do realise that the increased pay of the officers, N.C.O.s and men of the Army is still too low and that the cost of living and the value of money have hit them very hard.  Indeed, they have been particularly hard hit.  When you find the Minister having to put up a very substantial sum by way of an increase of allowances in lieu of rations it shows exactly what is happening in our economy.  However, the Minister has to produce that money and they have to get it.</P>
    <P>The increase under sub-head J for mechanical transport is one which the Minister should examine very carefully. There is always the risk that when you get new lorries, new cars or new transport of any description the boys are inclined to see how fast these things can go.  That is only human but I think there should be very strict enforcement of the regulations governing the use of these cars and the use of petrol in them.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that the new church at the Curragh Camp is almost completed and the other buildings in Custume Barracks and at Cork are being proceeded with.  They have been outstanding for a long time.  The more amenities available to our Defence Force the better Force you <Col N="1288" /> will have and the more contented the men will be.  A contented, disciplined and happy Defence Force is very important.  It is difficult for men to live in confined quarters and it is not easy to make everything run smoothly. The Minister and the Government can make things very comfortable if they so desire.</P>
    <P>I want to join with the Minister in thanking the Red Cross for the work of the past year or two and, in particular, notwithstanding all the criticism, I want to thank them for their handling of Knockalisheen camp.  It was not an easy problem.  It was more difficult than any of us could foresee owing to difficulties of language and temperament but I am glad to say that in my opinion the Red Cross and the Army officers there did good jobs of work.  I am glad that the refugees have been otherwise settled.  I know that there has been criticism about this, that and the other.  It is very easy to criticise but when you ask the person making the criticism what he would do in the same circumstances there is very little answer such person could give that would be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I notice that some of the lands at Tallaght have been sold and some transferred to the Land Commission so that the tenants can become tenants under the Land Act.  I do not see that there has been any help given to Deputy Corry in regard to the land at Kilworth.</P>

I should like to conclude upon the opening statement of the Minister that he is content with the standard of the officers and men of the Defence Forces of this country.  I appeal, with him, to all the young men and women to join the F.C.A. and the Civil Defence Force so that they may become acquainted with all the things that are to be known about Civil Defence, for their own safety and for <Col N="1289" /> the safety of the men and women of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a few matters in the Vote.  One is in regard to the references of the previous speaker to the major policy of the Minister and his failure to state what he thought the future would be with regard to the army.  I should like to say that I think General MacEoin was lucky to be able to base his calculation on a period of ten years at least.  He would be a great prophet who could take such a chance at the moment.  I do not think that the numbers should be allowed to drop too low.  If that happened it would not be good for the morale of those remaining in the army.  It is not possible to build up the nucleus of a force on too depleted an army.  For that reason I am glad that, even though the increase is not appreciable, it is a good trend and I would appeal to the Minister to increase further the numbers in order that there may be a greater improvement in the force and so that a general uplifting of the standard will be more easily accomplished.</P>
      <P>I wish mainly to refer to the F.C.A. There was a time when the numbers were very much greater than they are now, particularly after the emergency. Most Deputies on this estimate were then advocating better conditions for the F.C.A. and considerable improvement has since been effected.  However, there are many things which could yet be done, possibly without any great expenditure, to improve the status of the F.C.A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have repeatedly advocated on the vote that the battledress uniform should be discarded for something more in keeping with that of the regular soldier.  A peace-time force, particularly a force like the F.C.A. which requires a certain amount of attraction, should have a more attractive and better-cut uniform.  The F.C.A. is not a costly force to maintain and if its services were required by our Army they would be found to be a most useful adjunct to the regular forces, in fact just as good.  When I was an officer in the F.C.A. myself I never <Col N="1290" /> could get any reasonable explanation as to why the F.C.A. were issued with what was sometimes a rather clumsily tailored battle dress.  It was not very attractive.  It never looked smart on parade and I appeal for a change in that.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I should like to refer in regard to the F.C.A.&mdash; and it applies to the Civil Defence Force too&mdash;is that they do not always get full co-operation from employers in the matter of being absent on courses and, strange to say, the State as an employer is the most difficult to overcome.  Many of those who opt for particular periods to attend courses, which is an essential part of their training, find great difficulty in getting leave of absence from their employers at a particular time.  It is not easy for every employer to let his employees off whenever they wish, but there should be some give and take in this respect.  The same applies to some extent to the personnel of the Civil Defence Force.  If employees got encouragement and the proper incentive from their employers the number of personnel could be considerably increased.  I do not think any great impetus has been given as yet to the recruiting campaign or the effort to enlist the services of the people generally in the Civil Defence Force, but if such were undertaken in a more vigorous manner the necessary assistance and co-operation would be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin has referred to the Army Equitation School.  Everybody has something to say these days about the Army jumping team.  Very often we talk about something in regard to which we do not know much, but, on the face of it, we are all entitled to criticise from results, and it is obvious that for some time past the jumping team has not achieved as much as it did in the past.  It is heartening to hear from the Minister that the necessary steps have been taken to remedy that defect and I have no doubt that what he has mentioned will eventually lead to our having a team of which we can again be proud and which will put the bloodstock of this country in the forefront of the world.</P>
    <P>One of the factors which has led to <Col N="1291" /> a deterioration in the standard of the jumping team is that there was not sufficient provision made for the future team.  It seems to me and to many others that we have clung to the old stock too long.  We had many good horses but we did not provide for the future by having sufficient younger stock to replace the older stock when the time came.  The same applies to the personnel in the Equitation School. We have not riders sufficiently trained to replace the older personnel.  If a little more money had been expended at the right time in training new riders and horses there would be no gap to be bridged, and it would not be necessary now for us to buy fully trained horses to bridge the gap that exists at the moment.</P>
    <P>These horses going out to sporting events and agricultural shows throughout the country during the year are to some extent the means by which the general standard of the Army horses is judged.  For that reason it is important that a fair showing be made even at the local shows held in our own country.  For some time past that has not been the case and sending out horses to local shows at times has only tended to make known to the public generally the low standard to which our jumping team has descended.</P>
    <P>The only other item to which I should like to refer is the question which has already been mentioned, the part which the Army must play in the protection of our fishing.  There is a great deal of criticism in that respect but people seldom stop to think of the cost of the various things involved in providing the all-out protection required.  However, there are a few things which could be done without too much expense in the improvement of fishery protection.  I often wondered why we did not tie in better with the Department of Fisheries in the matter of training personnel.  There is a shortage in the fishing industry of properly trained personnel, particularly skippers.  People take charge of boats and it is a matter for serious thought whether a good deal of the accidents which have occurred in the fishing industry are not attributable to the fact that people are not properly trained. <Col N="1292" /> Efforts have been made by the Fishery Branch to train navigators in maritime schools.  I think we could combine with the protection we have under the Minister for Defence the training of personnel who would eventually be absorbed into the fishing industry.  By that means we would be able to overcome the heavy cost of providing more adequate protection than we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>A good many people are of the opinion, as expressed by Deputy MacEoin, that the Army should employ helicopters or some sort of plane for protection purposes.  That might be worth consideration.  I do not know what the Minister's views are on that.  Even if a small effort in that direction were made, in co-operation with the boats we have, I believe it would certainly improve our present protection system.  I do not think the difficulty is so great as we sometimes are led to believe.  There are times when those engaged in the fishing industry feel they are not getting the necessary protection from the protection vessels.  I would appeal to the Minister to devise, in collaboration with his colleague in Fisheries, a system which will at least be more adequate than the present system.  We might progressively reach a stage where we could have better protection for the coast generally.  It has a bad effect on those engaged in the industry and having a good deal of money invested in it to feel, rightly or wrongly, they are not getting the protection required.  Any expansion of the existing protection should be coordinated with the Army in the matter of training personnel to be absorbed in the industry.</P>
    <P>We are all satisfied that the standard of the Army is very creditable and satisfactory and is worthy of the tribute paid by the Minister.  I feel if the Army is allowed drop to a smaller number it will be impossible to maintain the high standard necessary and that we might even reach a stage where it would cease to be a suitable nucleus of an effective force to be expanded, in conjunction with the F.C.A., in times of emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I want to make is to ask the Minister if it is possible to provide even one helicopter for rescue work, particularly along the west coast.  The two previous speakers mentioned helicopters from the point of view of protection for fisheries.  That would be excellent if it could be done.  But at present one of the most urgent necessities along the west and south coasts is that at least one helicopter should be available, stationed in Limerick or Galway &mdash;preferably in Galway&mdash;for rescue work.</P>
      <P>We had an unfortunate occurrence inside the last two years where quite a number of people lost their lives in a boating disaster in Clew Bay.  I am convinced&mdash;and many people who have given the matter thought are also convinced&mdash;that at least some of these lives could have been saved if there had been a helicopter there.  The Minister will probably tell us that the provision of a helicopter would be costly.  Nevertheless we should not measure such things by the actual cost. If it could be used for fishery protection also, all the better; but I would strongly urge my other point as being much more important and urgent.</P>
      <P>The helicopter is something that has come to stay.  It is something that the Army, presumably, will be getting some day.  The Minister should take his courage in his hands and purchase at least one for the purpose I am speaking of.  With a coastline such as ours and while we have people who must make their livelihood on fishing, we will have disasters.  Sudden storms blow up and things go wrong in spite of the best care.  The whole of the west coast at some time or other has suffered, to a greater or lesser degree, disasters involving loss of life.  Something quick and speedy like a helicopter would have saved life in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> Secondly, I wish to join with Deputy MacEoin in paying tribute to the Red Cross, particularly for the way they have handled the refugee problem in Knockalisheen and elsewhere. There has been criticism, but I think a good deal of that was thoughtless.  While it was very easy for some people to criticise the members of the Red Cross and the Army for their handling of what I hold to be a difficult job of work, it was remarkable that in all the criticism there was no suggestion of any improved method to replace the methods they had adopted.  It is only right to pay tribute to these people for a job of work excellently done.</P>

Cuirim fáilte roimh an iarracht a bhí á dhéanamh agus a bhí ar siúl i rith á bliana chun an Ghaeilge a aithbheochaint i measc muintir an Airm.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Sílim gurb é an rud is tábhachtaí maidir le cosaint na tíre fá láthair ná cosaint sibhialta.  Is é an t-athrú is mó atá roimh an tír agus an domhan ná contúirt hydrogen explosion.  Tá an chontúirt sin ann i rith cogaidh agus nuair nac bhfuil cogadh ar siúl.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil eitealáin ag eitilt ón domhain thoir comhgharach don tír seo go dtí iarthar na hEorpa agus is féidir leo pléascáin hydrogen d'iompair. Dá dtarlódh tionóisc do cheann do na heitealáin seo, d'fhéadfeadh pléascadh an-mhór titim amach is aice na tíre seo ar fad.  Dá bhrí sin, ba cheart dúinn ullmhú chun ár muintir a chosaint sa chás sin, i gcás tionóisc in aimsir síochána nó i gcás cogaidh.

    <P>Tá cupla ni beag le rá agam.  Is an chéad cheann ná gur cheart creidiúint a thabhairt d'iarrthóirí, cuir i gcás don Státseirbhís, nó i Roinn Poist agus Telegrafa, má bhíonn seirbhís acu sin sna Fórsaí Cosanta.  B'é sin an tslí tar éis an chogaidh dheiridh.  Thug gach Roinn an Rialtais agus gach comhairle contae crediúint d'iarrthóirí mar sin, gach rud eile cothrom, do dhaoine go raibh seirbhís acu san Airm. Sílim go bhfuilimid ag imeacht ón scéal sin; sílim ná fuil an chreidiuint chéanna dá thabairt do na daoine a thug seirbhís sna Fórsaí Náisiúnta.  Is gá an chreidiúint sin a thabhairt san aimsir láthreach níos mó ná mar a bhí sé san am sin toisc go bhfuair cuid mhaith he na daoine a bhí san Airm postanna eagsúla ar fud na tíre ansin. Tarlaíonn sé gur imigh chuid de na saighdiurí a bhí san Arm thar lear tar éis an chogaidh agus anois tá cuid acu tar éis teacht ar ais agus ní tugtar aon chreidiuint, nó, pé scéal é, is beag suim a cuirtear sa seirbhís a thug siad don tír le linn an chogaidh.</P>
    <P>Aontaím leis na daoine adúirt gur ceart don Aire féachaint chuige go dtabharfaí cosaint chomh fada agus is féidir, do thionscal na hiascaireachta. Sílim an chéad céim is tabhtachtaí chun an fheidhm sin a bhaint amach ná an teorainn trí mhile do leathnú go sé míle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the Minister in feeling pleased at the increase in recruiting.  We cannot sufficiently stress the importance of the role played by the F.C.A. While they are a voluntary force, they have been put on a footing to enable them to protect us in any emergency that may arise.  I am not suggesting that they would equal the strength we require but they would form the nucleus at least.  An important consideration also is the good effect of membership on the discipline and deportment of those in the ranks of F.C.A. even in civilian life.  Greater <Col N="1297" /> recognition should be given to voluntary organisations than has been the case.  I would suggest that when appointments are being made by Departments or local bodies, all things being equal, a candidate who has been a member of one of these organisations should be considered.  That recognition could help to increase the number of recruits to Defence organisations.</P>
      <P>I notice that there is an increase of £10,000 in the provision for expenditure under the Offences Against the State Act.  I hope this money will not be needed and will not be spent.</P>
      <P>Once again, I notice that the Minister has not referred to the question of the provision of helicopters. The important rôle that helicopters can play has been emphasised here over and over again.  They could play a very important part in defending the fishery limits against infringement by foreign trawlers.  By their use, boats could be recognised approaching the coast considerably earlier than is at present possible. Naturally, boats that violate the limits can go outside the limits again very quickly.  I hope the Minister is not losing sight of the important role that helicopters can play in that respect.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he intends to do something in respect of the Army Jumping Team.  There is a figure of £3,700 for the purchase of horses.  I would not say that he would get much for that expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a decrease of £6,000 this year in the provision for jumping teams going to shows.  That money should be devoted to improving the standard of our jumping teams, which play a very important rôle in fields afar in raising our flag when, possibly, other Ministers may lower it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see Army instructors visiting the schools and giving instruction in physical culture and ordinary foot drill.  There is great need for such instruction.  One has only to look at the slovenly way that young men now walk the streets to realise the need for <Col N="1298" /> such instruction, apart from the question of the discipline that is so desirable.  It might also encourage recruitment to the Army.</P>
    <P>As another incentive to recruitment, there should be more Army parades in provincial centres and visits from the Army bands.  It is not an easy thing to transport the No. 1 Army Band around the country but the people are entitled to hear them now and again. I should also like to see the Army figuring in the boxing sphere.  In the past, members of the Army have more than justified themselves in the boxing ring.</P>
    <P>As a member of a voluntary organisation, I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the point I have made about encouraging such organisations by giving them recognition and, also, the matter I have mentioned of Army instructors visiting schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my tribute to the officers of the Defence Forces who have served abroad during the last year.  I was particularly glad because I was the only Deputy who referred to that matter on the Estimate last year and I expressed the hope at that time that the Minister would keep in mind the possibility that officers might be called on by the United Nations to undertake duties as observers outside this country.  Since that time there have been further developments which impinge on the whole question of the Defence Estimate and Army policy generally.  I refer to the possibility of this country being invited or requested to send troops abroad for police duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a speech at the Council of Europe, in Strasbourg, in January, our representative, the Minister for Education, spoke on the question of the Berlin crisis.  He suggested that one possible solution might be the taking over of Berlin by an international force, so that the troops of Iron Curtain countries and the West might be withdrawn from Berlin in the hope of some ultimate solution.  If such a situation did arise, our troops would be very acceptable and I also foresee that in very many countries of the world our troops would be acceptable <Col N="1299" /> where troops from other countries might not be.  But the situation is that at the moment we have no troops available at short notice for any such duties.</P>
    <P>I would feel that the time has come to review the needs of the Army and its whole purpose.  I cannot see any danger of foreign occupation of this country any more.  During the last war, we were still in a very valuable strategic position so far as Great Britain was concerned, both as the western flank of Great Britain and as an outpost of British defences on the Atlantic.  That situation no longer obtains and I cannot see that Ireland has any further significance so far as general Western European defence is concerned.  With modern aircraft and modern naval vessels, our few hundred miles to the West really mean nothing at all.  Consequently, to regard the Army as being primarily a force to protect our shores against invasion is quite out of date.</P>
    <P>When I say that I do not mean that the Army has no further function.  I should hope that with modern developments we could, with very little reorganisation, form a strong striking force.  Perhaps I should not stress its strength so much as its efficiency.  We should play down its professed role as a training cadre for the raising of a larger force in times of emergency. What I have in mind would be something along the lines of a special unit which could be called for historical reasons the &ldquo;Active Service Unit&rdquo;&mdash; a mixed unit of infantry and other corps which would be prepared for active service anywhere at short notice. That is quite impossible at the moment because we are working on a peace time establishment which is low but, even then, the actual units are far below their establishment strength so that they are not, as they stand, effective fighting units.  I should much prefer to see a small number of units and at least one composite force&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;ready for action at short notice.  I should say that the main purpose of such a unit would be to place itself at the disposal of the United Nations whenever required.  At <Col N="1300" /> the same time if it were required at home it would be available for any emergency, such as action in aid of the civil power.</P>
    <P>I have had experience of trying to provide men from a war strength battalion at short notice.  It was extremely difficult, quite apart from the altering of duties to which the unit was already committed.  The formation of the type of unit I suggest would to my mind be an added attraction so far as recruiting is concerned.  Posting to such a unit could be restricted to men who had attained the very highest technical qualifications.  I would hope that in a moment of generosity there might even be a slight increase in pay for men who qualify for service in this special unit.  They would, of course, carry some identification, some shoulder flash.  I would hope that there would be a fairly constant turnover of men in such a unit so that when a man had become fully trained he could be posted to this special unit and stay with it for a year to two.  If, then, it was found advisable to post him back to an ordinary line unit again he could still, so long as he retained his qualifications, retain his distinctive shoulder flash and his additional pay.  It is not just a matter, of course, of paying a man a little bit extra.  It is a matter of giving a man a real incentive, and the best incentive is the knowledge that he has been better trained and has achieved a higher standard than anyone else.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have quite a number of infantry battalions.  I am not quite sure what the number is, but it is either seven or eight.  All these are very much under strength.  All are tied to barracks.  Each battalion is fully occupied maintaining and running its own quarters.  These units are not mobile in any real sense.  As the years go on, they become more and more static.  This affects morale and also affects the physique of the men.  I know that morale generally is very high but I am disappointed that the physique is as low as it is.  Our troops do not immediately strike one as being fighting fit.  They are healthy, they are well looked after, but to my mind they look soft.  That is not the way they should <Col N="1301" /> be.  They are too much engaged on barrack duties&mdash;fatigues, guard duties and so on.  Being quartered too long in city barracks they get soft.  They are bound to.</P>
    <P>We are maintaining far too many barracks in Dublin.  I have said that before.  I say it again now, and I shall keep on saying it until something is done.  In view of the fact that we have not even half as many troops stationed in Dublin now as we had during the war years, it is absurd that the number of barracks should be exactly the same to-day as it was then.  When you multiply barracks, you multiply barrack units.  Even if we have to maintain a certain number of barracks&mdash;I would hope that it would not be necessary&mdash;we could, I think, avoid some of the difficulties if a higher proportion of barrack duties were handed over to a separate unit of maintenance men.</P>
    <P>I have had experience&mdash;I am sure most Deputies have had the same experience&mdash;of ex-soldiers coming to me looking for employment in civilian life on the conclusion of a long engagement. Many of these men would prefer to stay in the Army, but they have reached the retiring age.  When a man has given as much of his life as that to the Army, he can never really settle down as a civilian.  Soldiering is in his blood and he is only happy in that environment.  It is a pity that the services of such men are lost.  They could be used perfectly adequately to carry out interior barrack duties, such as barrack orderlies, orderly room runners, fatigue men and so on, because it is these duties which gobble up the strength of any army unit living in barracks.  If that suggestion can be implemented it will mean that a platoon or company commander will know that he has so many men he can place on parade at short notice.</P>
    <P>Here, again, I speak with some experience.  I know the frustration of having a company with a nominal strength of 180 only to produce 25 men on parade at any one time because so many were on guard, so many resting off guard, so many doing fatigues and duties of one sort or another that one's strength was quite frittered away and <Col N="1302" /> one could never train or exercise one's men as a unit.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider these two suggestions: first, the formation of a mixed unit of infantry and other arms to be given some special title and kept in a constant state of preparedness at all times and, secondly, the relieving of ordinary troops of barrack duties by a reduction in the number of barracks and by the employment of those who have reached retiring age on some sort of special enlistment, if necessary, on interior barrack duties.</P>
    <P>I spoke last year about coastal defence artillery.  When the coastal forts were taken over, more than the actual guns were involved at the time. There was the question of regaining complete control of our own defences, excluding Great Britain from any share, either active or passive.  Even before the last war, fixed coastal artillery was absolutely finished.  Fixed defences of any sort had become completely out of date.  The incredible thing is that the Germans, who demonstrated that fact in their break through of the fixed defences of France and the Low Countries, fell into the same trap and tried to defend the European coastline with fixed coastal defences.  They were proved to be no use whatever even when used on a vast scale.  They were a slight embarrassment but very little more.</P>
    <P>We still keep these enormous guns and huge installations and have to maintain them and train men to use these weapons which can never again be used in war.  Nobody will ever be obliging enough to present themselves as a target to these guns.  I would ask the Minister to consider the closing down of these establishments and the melting down of the guns.  It would be far better to abandon them than to spend any further money on them.</P>
    <P>The only other arm to become obsolete is anti-aircraft artillery.  There again, the modern aircraft has become supersonic and against these aircraft there is no defence by anti-aircraft artillery.  You still have some medium anti-aircraft artillery and I say, with any authority I have, that it is absolutely useless and that it is a waste <Col N="1303" /> of time and money to exercise men on equipment which will never have a target&mdash;never, never again.  There must be some protection for ground troops against low-flying aircraft but that can be looked after by light anti-aircraft artillery and small arms.  Anti-aircraft artillery, as a discouragement to high-flying targets, is absolutely finished.</P>
    <P>On the question of Army pay, perhaps the Minister would clarify the question of the pay of the legal officers. I know that the professional pay of several officers was raised by the Minister and there seems to be some slight increase in the total amount provided although there has been no increase in the number of officers.  I do not know if that is due to an increase in the rates of pay but I do know that, while other professional officers have received increases, the legal officers were not included.  I hope that matter will be remedied before very long.  It will not cost much money but it is unjust that the legal officers, who carry so much responsibility in the administration of justice in the Forces, should be treated in such a discriminatory manner.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the remarks already made by General MacEoin and others on the question of the officers of the Reserve, First Line.  It is intolerable that officers who retired from the Regular Army and were put back on the Reserve at the end of the emergency with the rank of lieutenant should still be holding that rank.  It is very discouraging for them and it makes a Reserve Officer feel that he is not wanted and that he is only being kept on for charity and that the Department and the Minister would be just as pleased to see him retire. The amount involved is very small.  I have discussed the matter with some of the officers themselves and I have spoken to some senior serving officers of the Regular Forces.  I would pay particular attention to the senior officers and their views and say they are horrified at the situation that has been allowed to develop.  They have spoken of the improvement to Army morale generally which would <Col N="1304" /> be the case if there was automatic promotion of Reserve lieutenants to the rank of captain after a certain period.  I gather that this is the case in the F.C.A. and I see no reason why it should not be the case in the First Line Reserve.  I hope that even at this late stage the Minister will have a change of mind.</P>
    <P>I notice that in the Estimate itself there is considerable provision for Army lands.  The question of Army lands is always a difficult one with War Departments probably because they have had the experience of having to pay dearly for lands they require and they tend to hold on to any they can get.  Under Subhead T and also under Subhead I, the amount set out is £19,194.  That includes maintenance, wages and other matters. I am delighted to hear that the lands at Tallaght have gone.  They proved to be a most expensive investment.  I was speaking to a neighbouring farmer whose lands had been flooded for years owing to the bad drainage at Tallaght.  Efforts were made almost every year by spending small sums to deal with the situation but last year a very large sum had to be spent to save the adjoining farm from going under water every winter.  I do not think that any provision has been made for maintenance in this year's Estimate but the amount needed to put the matter right last year was very considerable indeed.  I hope that this expenditure can be greatly reduced in future.</P>
    <P>I am still unsure of our conception of the Naval Service.  The main job of the Naval Service now, and indeed its only job, is fishery protection.  I cannot see that the maintenance of a complete Naval Service is necessary to operate three or four fishery protection vessels.  Naval warfare is out as far as we are concerned.  We will never be able to provide vessels which can protect us against nuclear-powered submarines off our coast whether they come from the United States or Russia. These are not defence vessels in any normal sense of the word and I feel that the whole concept of our Naval Service is too top-heavy and cumbersome having regard to the present situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> I hope there is some scheme which we might introduce to improve the amount of protection given to our fisheries.  I am not sure that helicopters can provide the answer.</P>
    <P>They might be able to do some spotting from the air and identify ships which were infringing our territorial waters but I do not see how a helicopter could actually arrest a ship, a fishing boat or any other craft. However, they might be a help and I agree with Deputies who have already spoken on this point and who have stated they believe helicopters are an essential part of our defence force, not only for this purpose but also for rescue work.  The trouble is that a helicopter at present has a very limited range.  If you had a helicopter at Galway which was required to operate off the coast of Kerry, it would be getting very nearly outside its range by the time it reached the scene where it was required.  But there might be a way of having some mobile ground crew that could be sent by road to service a helicopter which had transported itself to the scene of the trouble and which could then be put into action on whatever work might be needed to be done.</P>
    <P>Apart from the work of picking up people, which is possible only under certain circumstances, we all feel the lack of suitable aircraft for rescue operations when an aircraft or a ship is in trouble.  We always have to rely on the aircraft of the British Coastal Command to carry out any large-scale or long distance reconnaissance operations over the Atlantic.  So far as I know we have only a very few twin-engined aircraft in the Air Corps and those are De Havilland Doves, aircraft of the small civilian type which I would imagine would be highly unsuitable for going out over the Atlantic in very bad weather.  It is essential that we should look into this matter and see if some more suitable aircraft could be provided for carrying out search work, not only inshore but well out into the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>I agree with the speakers, including the Minister, who have stressed the virtues of civil defence.  I also share the Minister's disappointment that recruiting <Col N="1306" /> has not been as high as expected. However, the danger here is that bad public relations have made the people apathetic.  I agree with the Minister's conception of the problem but until we can convince people that something significant can be done about civil defence we cannot expect recruits.  The actual amount of money we are spending is enormous.  Under Subhead P. 1, there is provision for £130,000 and in the administration section, the Office of the Minister, there is provision for a further £27,000, which means a total provision of £157,000, in round figures, for civil defence.  Most people would wonder where that money will go and whether it is worth spending in that way.  That is why I feel that, until we have proper public relations, that apathy will continue and we will be supplying material and equipment, and getting a small number of volunteers almost breaking their hearts working for civil defence with very little to show for it in the end.</P>
    <P>I do hope some authoritative statement will be made as to what is the policy on civil defence.  Is it possible that we could have any civil defence without enormous underground shelters? If it is possible to survive a very heavy fall-out without having underground shelters we should know about it.  Most people feel we are only fiddling with the problem at the moment. I would hope technical people would help the Minister to get this point over to members of the public so as to bring the necessary flow of recruits.</P>
    <P>In general, I still believe that the amount spent on the civil side of the administration of the defence forces is very large indeed.  Last year I commented on the soldiers' pay section.  I do not want anyone to think I have any particular hatred of the soldiers' pay section.  I have not, but it is a section which is the most easy to pick on. Last year there was provision for 92 civil servants in the Department of Defence to pay the defence forces. That has now gone up to 99 people at a total cost of £52,893.  I cannot understand what we are paying all these people for because the greater part of the work is done by serving officers <Col N="1307" /> who hand out the money and by serving soldiers who complete the pay rolls which are handed in for checking.  In order to pay out a total amount of under £2 million we have to pay 99 civil servants £52,893.  That does not make sense to me.</P>

      <P>I know these officers pay the marriage allowances, ration allowances and everything else but may I say, as a business man, having to pay all sorts of different rates, apprentice rates to first-year apprentices, second year apprentices, having to make deductions for over-alls, pay extra for overtime, make deductions in income tax, deductions for voluntary health insurance, deductions for voluntary life insurance, and so on, all that can be done for a staff of 200 or 300 by one man working half-time; yet we have to employ 99 civil servants at £52,000 per annum to check Army pay.  I know the official view is that they are very well employed.</P>

      <P>I am so sorry.  I must congratulate the Minister.  However, perhaps it is by reason of my protestations. If I protest a little bit more I may get the figure down further.  I shall not say my highest hopes would be realised if I could get it down to 85 by next year, but I am glad to see it has come down slightly.  I wonder, seeing that that reduction was made, if it was necessary all along.  I still insist&mdash;and I do not mind how many explanations are given&mdash;that it is a most uneconomic way of paying the defence forces.  I know that is the way it has been done and always will be done unless more people realise <Col N="1308" /> what a fantastically expensive and wasteful way it is.</P>
      <P>I am glad there is this move towards integration of the F.C.A. with the regular Army.  This will help in making the regular Army a more efficient force.  Any distinction between the F.C.A. and the regular Army is bad and I do hope all the Minister's plans will be as successful as he hopes they will be and I believe they will be.  At the same time I hope more time will be given to physical training in the F.C.A. as well as in the regular Army.  There is a wonderful chance of linking up the F.C.A. with local organisations, athletic clubs, football clubs, and so on.  The standard of physical training in the Army has always been very high.  We have always had first-rate physical instructors. I always feel that they must be terribly disappointed that they get so little chance of doing actual physical training with the men.  I was hoping that we would have far more physical training instructors than we have at the moment and that a number of them would be detailed exclusively to give physical training instruction to units of the F.C.A.</P>
      <P>As far as the Army generally is concerned, I feel there is still need of improved public relations.  I do not wish this to be taken as a reflection in any way on the public relations officers or Press officers detailed specifically for that purpose.  I think we need much more than that.  We need their services, but we need more if the Army is to be properly appreciated.  I know there is a reluctance to allow Army men to be used at civilian functions, and to allow the participation of army teams and army equipment.  That, I think, is a pity.  The Signal Corps have radio equipment which could be extremely useful at various civilian functions; and it would be very good propaganda that the ordinary man in the street should be able to see army signallers working with good equipment and doing a job of work in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same would apply to army aircraft. There always seems to be some hesitation about allowing army aircraft to appear at flying displays.  That is a pity.  It is as if we were half ashamed <Col N="1309" /> of having an Air Corps at all and not having supersonic jets.  The standard of training of our pilots is second to none.  I have seen them fly the most incredible old planes during the war and doing the most incredible things in them.  They are the most brilliant pilots, and I think they have shown that whenever they go abroad on courses.  They can do magnificent flying and I would hope that they would be allowed to do that at civilian aircraft displays.</P>
    <P>Even the Engineer Corps could be allowed, maybe, to give demonstrations of bridging or simply to carry out some training by putting an emergency bridge across an obstacle which could also be used, as a temporary measure, by civilians for a certain purpose.  In general, I think that the Army should be brought closer to the people.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to more Army parades.  I would not be at all happy about more Army parades.  The Army does not show itself off properly on parades.  I do not mean for a moment that it does not look smart on parades. But an Army should be seen doing its job and parading around the streets is not its job.  There is the annual parade in Dublin, and in certain other centres, too, on Easter Sunday.  That appears to me to be a very regrettable coincidence.  It is perfectly understandable to have some commemoration of the Rising of 1916.  But to confuse the Rising with the premier Feast of the Church is, to my mind, most regrettable.  To have on Easter Day, as one of the main celebrations, an Army parade, just worries and upsets me.  It does not seem right.  It is not the sort of thing we should be doing on Easter Sunday morning.  I think it is bad for the Army too. Granted you may say they have had Mass beforehand; well and good, but it has spoiled Easter Day for them, too; it has spoiled their whole concept of what Easter Day should be.  That there should be a display of troops under arms on that day is something which, I think, should be avoided.</P>
    <P>We should try to keep the Rising separate from the Church holiday by every means we can.  I would much prefer, rather than have any parade at <Col N="1310" /> all, that we should have an Army Week, when Army barracks and establishments would be thrown open to the public, who would be invited in to see actual equipment being used, who would be able to climb in and out of armoured cars, tanks, small tracked carrier vehicles and so on and would be able to see weapons being used&mdash;small arms and so on&mdash;on a range.  That could quite easily be done; it would be far better propaganda and would build up a much closer relationship between the Army and the public.</P>
    <P>I hope I shall not be thought too destructive.  I am far too proud of the Army to wish to say anything against it.  But I feel that very often it has not had a fair chance of justifying itself in the way it can and should. The morale of the force could be maintained and improved if its main functions were made more clear and if it were put on a basis where it was doing real work all the time.  Nothing is more damaging to morale than hanging around barracks and doing fatigues.  It is a fallacy to believe that men will rebel against unduly hard conditions.  Once they know there is some point to it, they will stand up to almost anything.  If they are subjected to really tough training while barrack service is done by older soldiers, when they come out of barracks they will throw out their chests and start spinning stories about the fantastic things they have done, about swimming a mile and half with full pack and surviving.</P>
    <P>I do not mind those fancy stories; at least it shows that a man is proud of his job.  As long as it is reasonable, the more proud men will be to be serving the Army.  That is what we should have.  I think we can do it; in fact, I am sure we can do it.  I should like to repeat that I foresee we shall be asked at some time&mdash;and possibly shortly&mdash;to provide a force of troops to serve overseas.  I would ask the Minister please to see that such a force would be available if and when it is called for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Booth on the very comprehensive review of the Minister's <Col N="1311" /> Estimate.  He has covered all sections of the Estimate and has made comments which I am sure will find a ready response in the mind of the Minister and his Department.  But how the Deputy can reconcile the hardening off of troops&mdash;beyond the fact that during the emergency years they were sent to the country to do some forced marches&mdash;within the framework of the Estimate and provide for barrack services to be done by the older type of soldier, I do not know.  I agree that it is certainly disappointing and frustrating for soldiers to find that the ordinary chores of Army life fall to be done by them pretty often.  Everybody would wish that more of their time might be given to this process of developing their physique more from the point of view of hardening them off. But, taking them by and large, the country can feel a justifiable pride in the bearing of the Army at all stages.</P>
      <P>In that respect the F.C.A. have made no small contribution.  I think the conception of the present Army as the groundwork on which we might expand if it ever became necessary is the proper conception.  The Army personnel, highly trained as it is, would act as it did in the years from 1940 on, as a cadre of instructors providing military instruction for the civilian units that were then raised.  Magnificent work was done on that occasion and I believe the framework on which we are building at present follows the same lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the integration of the F.C.A. with the Army is to take place. That is very desirable and should result in benefit to both.  It will give the F.C.A. an opportunity of handling weapons which up to this they have not had.  Considering our history in relation to the present I think we should, and shall always have, a Defence Force which is highly mobile and which can be used effectively to resist anybody impairing or attempting to impair our freedom.  We must visualise a Defence Force within the country which knows the country intimately and can make use of its natural defence features.  I think our fences <Col N="1312" /> would prove very effective traps and obstacles to the highly mobile type of warfare associated now with other countries.</P>
    <P>There is one point which may be worth considering in regard to F.C.A. personnel.  The important thing is that they attend training regularly and I have often wondered how that can be secured.  I feel if we could get the weekly training parades attended it would be the best step we could take. I wonder if it would be feasible to offer the F.C.A. personnel, say at Christmastime, half the gratuity which would normally be payable if they did their full training period in the summer camps or on wholetime training courses.  I think if the personnel qualified, by a certain percentage of attendance which was considered desirable and effective, say at Christmas, for half the gratuity, it would maintain the standard of attendance locally and the personnel would benefit to a greater extent from the instruction given by the local officers in that way.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Civil Defence has not so far justified itself and one wonders what can be done in the county council areas outside large centres to impress on those who have time to spare the necessity for more trained civilian forces.  During the former emergency we got, through cooperation by the public at that time and through the local efforts of the Garda authorities, a body then known as the L.S.F. I wonder if the present officers appointed to various county councils could work on somewhat the same lines with the Garda authorities so that at least a skeleton force could be found in each area on which we might base our hopes for a greater force later on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth mentioned heavy equipment, but beyond the fact that we would like to train our Army elements in the use of such equipment and that it would give variety in instruction, so far as the opportunity for using such equipment in this country is concerned, considering our resources, such opportunity would be very limited.  We need not spend much money on such equipment. Deputy Booth also referred to the <Col N="1313" /> equipment we have.  We were very glad to have it and it is no harm to continue using it provided we do not have to spend money on it.</P>
    <P>He mentioned An Slua Mhuirí and the naval forces generally and their use as a protection for fisheries.  These forces do valuable work in that respect and I do not know what the fisheries would do without such protection along our coastline.  But these services also fulfil a very necessary role in our national life and there is no reason why a country such as ours that already has a sea-going tradition should not try to build up that tradition. If we do not have the necessary boats in the Service we cannot give young men the necessary training.  This is something any island nation should have and even if the Naval Service is small it fulfils a useful function, so long as it is up to the mark in efficiency.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I think the Minister and all branches of the Army are to be congratulated.  It is to be hoped that this integration will take place and that both the Army and the F.C.A. will benefit from it and that the Minister's hopes in that respect will be realised.</P>

      <P>DE BHRÍ go ndearna Dáil Éireann, ar an 29ú lá d'Eanáir, 1959, an Bille um an Tríú Leasú ar an mBunreacht, 1958, a rith agus a chur chun Seanad Éireann, agus gur dhiúltaigh Seanad Éireann dó ar an 19ú lá de Mhárta, 1959,</P>
      <P>Go gcinneann Dáil Éireann ANOIS AR AN ÁBHAR SIN leis seo, de bhun ailt 1 d'Airteagal 23 den Bhunreacht, go measfar an Bille um an Tríú Leasú ar an mBunreacht, 1958, mar a ritheadh ag Dáil Éireann é, a bheith rite ag dhá Theach an Oireachtais.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> I move:&mdash;</P>
    <P>THAT WHEREAS the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, was, on the 29th day of January, 1959, passed by Dáil Éireann and sent to Seanad Éireann, and was on the 19th Day of March, 1959, rejected by Seanad Éireann,</P>
    <P>NOW THEREFORE Dáil Éireann, pursuant to section 1 of Article 23 of the Constitution, hereby resolves that the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, as passed by Dáil Éireann, be deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Fé mar atá léirithe sa rún sin, cuireadh an Bille seo chun an tSeanaid ar an 29ú Eanáir, arna rith ag an Dáil é.  Bhí sé faoi dhíospóireacht sa Seanad ar feadh tréimhse fada, agus ina dhiaidh sin diúltaíodh dó.  Mar sin, de réir Airteagail 23 den Bhunreacht, tig leis an Dáil, más mian leis an Dáil, rún a rith faoina measfar go bhfuil an Bille rite ag dhá Theach an Oireachtais.  Sin é an fáth go bhfuil an rún seo á thairiscint.</P>
    <P>Má ritear an rún, féadfar, ansin, de réir Airteagail 46 den Bhunreacht, an Bille a chur ós comhair an phobail chun breith an phobail a fháil air. Sílim gur ceart é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Nuair bhí an Bille á phlé againn anseo léiríodh tuairimí an Rialtais, agus níl aon athrú ar na tuairimí sin de bharr na díospóireachta a bhí anseo nó sa Seanad.  Táimid ar aon aigne go rachaidh sé chun leas na tíre an t-athrú seo a dhéanamh sa modh toghcháin agus, mar sin, molaim an rún don Dáil.</P>
    <P>As I have said, as set out in the terms of the motion, this Bill for the amendment of the Constitution was sent to the Seanad on the 29th January, having been passed by Dáil Éireann.  It was discussed in the Seanad.  First of all, the Seanad agreed to the principle of the Bill on Second Reading.  Then it was altered considerably in the discussion in Committee and, finally, the altered Bill was rejected in Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> Now, according to Article 23 of the Bunreacht, when a Bill has been rejected in the Seanad or has not been considered and sent back to the Dáil, if a resolution is passed to that effect, Dáil Éireann can cause it to be deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a case in which, I think, it is right that such a resolution should be passed.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been discussed over a period, roughly, of six months, in the country, in the Press, here in Dáil Éireann and in Seanad Éireann, and nothing that has transpired during that period has changed the attitude of any member of the Government with regard to the desirability of altering the present method of election and putting in its stead a system of single-member constituencies and the nontransferable vote.</P>
    <P>This is a measure which intimately affects the Dáil more than the Seanad. Of course, the Seanad has its duties and its functions but, fundamentally, the Bill affects the Dáil more intimately, inasmuch as it affects the manner in which the elections to the Dáil are to be held, and, accordingly, I think the Dáil is entitled, not merely in accordance with the terms of the Bunreacht, but in the nature of things, to pass this resolution so that the people may pass judgment upon the Bill.</P>
    <P>If this motion is passed, the matter can be put without any further delay, as quickly as may be, to the people for their judgment.  I know there is an amendment but, to me, the amendment seems merely putting the matter on the long finger.  During the discussions, libraries have been ransacked and all the information available&mdash;and there is a good deal of it available&mdash;on this particular matter, has been gathered for use here.  The people have now had an opportunity of informing themselves on the merits of the question, and I think, therefore, that it is time that the people be given the opportunity of definitely deciding.</P>

    <P>bhfuil an Bille um an Tríú Leasú ar an mBunreacht, 1958, tar éis beach taíocht thromchúiseach leanúnach a tharraingt i nDáil Éireann gur dhiúltaigh Seanad Éireann dó, agus gur cúis imní agus easaontais i measc an phobail é,</P>
    <P>Go gcinneann Dáil Éireann ANOIS AR AN ÁBHAR SIN leis seo gan beart de bhun ailt 1 d'Airteagal 23 den Bhunreacht a dhéanamh go dtí go bhfaighfear tuarascáil ó Chomhchoiste de Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann, a cheapfar chun scrúdú a dhéanamh ar iarmairtí sóisialacha, polaiticiúla agus eacnamaíocha na n-athruithe sa chóras togcháin atá beartaithe sa Bhille um an Tríú Leasú ar an mBunreacht, 1958&mdash;an tuarascáil a bheith le tabhairt ag an gComhchoiste tráth nach déanaí ná an 29ú lá de Lúnasa, 1959.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I move:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after the figures &ldquo;1958&rdquo; in line 2 and substitute therefor the words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;has given rise to serious and sustained criticism in Dáil Éireann, has been rejected in Seanad Éireann, and has caused disquiet and division among the people,</P>
    <P>NOW THEREFORE Dáil Éireann hereby resolves to postpone action under section 1 of Article 23 of the Constitution until a report shall have been received from a Joint Committee of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, appointed to examine the social, political and economic implications of the changes in the electoral system proposed in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958&mdash;the Joint Committee to report not later than the 29th day of August, 1959.</P>
    <P>If the amendment is accepted, the resolution would read as follows:</P>
    <P>THAT WHEREAS the Third Amendment of the Constitution <Col N="1318" /> Bill, 1958, has given rise to serious and sustained criticism in Dáil Éireann, has been rejected in Seanad Éireann and has caused disquiet and division among the people,</P>

    <P>The Taoiseach, in moving his motion, has merely characterised this amendment as intended to put the matter on the long finger and, therefore, it is to be assumed from that that he suggests that there is no merit in the amendment and that it ought not to be passed.  I think that is a fair interpretation of the Taoiseach's cryptic observations, short as they were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would direct the attention of Deputies to the fact that this amendment is carefully framed so as to enable the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill to be referred to the people under the referendum within the time limited for that purpose by the Constitution. There is, therefore, and there can be, no question whatever of putting this amendment down merely for delay or to put it on the long finger, as the Taoiseach has suggested.  Had that been our object, we could have contented ourselves with speaking on and voting against his own motion or putting down an amendment of a different character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole purpose of this motion is to carry out in a different way the object we had from the very beginning of the debate on this issue, namely, that there should be a certain pause of fairly long duration during which <Col N="1319" /> the electorate would have time to consider this very important matter and time within which to become fully informed so that they could ultimately make an intelligent decision on the issue.  No issue of such paramount importance has come before the people for very many years&mdash;no issue so important as the issue contained in the proposals now before the House. From the start I have felt that it was urgently necessary that the people, who are being called upon to exercise one of the most democratic pieces of machinery that could be conceived, should have every opportunity of being fully informed and of knowing what they are doing.</P>
    <P>From the start we have pressed for an inquiry into this matter.  We have pressed for a full discussion.  We have pressed for all the arguments for and against to be put forward, thoroughly examined and, the implications of the proposals having been investigated, the results of such investigation made available to an intelligent electorate. I cannot help coming to the conclusion, after the protracted debate on this matter in both the Dáil and Seanad, that the one thing the sponsors of these proposals are most afraid of is that the issue should be brought before the electorate at a time when the electorate would have had an opportunity of informing themselves of what was afoot and making an intelligent decision thereon.</P>
    <P>From the start of this debate, when we were arguing this matter, pleading for time and asking for an inquiry, the cry was heard from the far side of the House: &ldquo;You are standing between us and the people.&rdquo;  That was supposed to be a politically popular cry; we were preventing the people from making a decision, a decision which they were &ldquo;leppin' and rarin&rdquo;' to take in favour of the proposals.  All we fought for during all those weary weeks was that we should bring before the people all the information available to us and put it at their disposal to enable them to appreciate what they were being asked to do and to realise the important implications for them and for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> The Taoiseach has said that anything that has happened since has not changed the minds of the Government. It would, indeed, be a most startling revolution in the history of Ireland to date if the Fianna Fáil Party changed their minds on this or any other matter. We did not expect they would.  It is, however, relevant to consider&mdash;it has been noted in the country&mdash;that every Party is against these proposals and the only Party in favour of them is the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>When these proposals were first put forward, they came suddenly and unexpectedly.  At the outset the people were not very interested.  They wondered what was afoot perhaps. They were inclined to take the attitude: &ldquo;What is it all about?  What does it matter to us what kind of system we have?&rdquo;  We fought.  We succeeded in gaining time to bring home to the people the full implications of these proposals.  I think it is only right now that I should record on behalf of my Party and on my own behalf the great debt that the people owe to the Seanad for having given an additional breathing space to enable this matter to be more fully discussed. The debates in this House and in the Seanad were on a very high level and have done something to enhance the reputation of our Parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <P>When we came to consider these proposals first I thought that it could hardly be that Fianna Fáil were introducing them merely to gain Party political advantage.  In the past, an old colleague of mine&mdash;the Taoiseach knew him very well: the late Professor O'Sullivan&mdash;used to hit the desk and say: &ldquo;They can do anything&rdquo; when we were inclined to take the view that Fianna Fáil could not, or would not, do something.  With that experience in front of me, I still felt that Fianna Fáil would not go down to such real depths at a time when they are on the downgrade despite the high place they achieved after the last general election.  I still felt that they would not try to mould the future in such a way as would give them a stranglehold on the political life of this country for many years to come. <Col N="1321" /> Cynics held a different view, even at the start.  My own private opinion was that it was just the Taoiseach letting another bee out of his bonnet; he hated Coalitions; he hated anything that defeated his Party; there was something wrong in anything that defeated Fianna Fáil; there was something wrong in our national life when Fianna Fáil were defeated.  That was my innocent approach.  I ought to have known better.</P>
    <P>Now that we have heard the Taoiseach over the weekend it is abundantly clear (1) that the Taoiseach wants to convince the public that these proposals are necessary for the national well-being, and (2) he equates the national well-being with the well-being of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>I quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of April 27th, the day before yesterday.  Speaking at a convention in Monaghan, this is what the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The referendum is more important than a general election.</P>
      <P>He goes on to say he hated making any changes in the Constitution, and</P>
      <P>&ldquo;would not have proposed this change only it was fundamentally necessary for the nation's well-being.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I could understand that as an exercise in political flapdoodle because a political Party always tries to persuade a gullible electorate that whatever they do is for the national wellbeing.  It was an easy sort of &ldquo;flap&rdquo; and one to be expected from the Taoiseach from the point of view of his eminence as Prime Minister of this country; what he is doing is in the national wellbeing.  But he did not content himself with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to say that it was &ldquo;because Fianna Fáil could not count on obtaining an over-all majority at any future election under the present electoral system that they had decided to change the system under which their <Col N="1322" /> members should be elected in the future&rdquo;.  He let the cat out of the bag there; the reason they decided on this change was because Fianna Fáil would never again get an over-all majority.  Now we know precisely why these proposals are made and why they are being promulgated and pressed before the people.  I further emphasise what I said, that the Taoiseach apparently regards as the national well-being that Fianna Fáil should have an overall majority.</P>
    <P>His Deputy, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, made an eloquent speech in this House yesterday in which he said that he was longing to see this Parliament a deliberative assembly.  Can anybody imagine that if the proposal now being put forward were, by any misfortune, carried by the people this Parliament would rise above anything but an instrument for regularising decisions made by the Government in the council chamber in Government buildings?  The whole proposal is to get an over-all majority for the Fianna Fáil Party as against one small Opposition.  The whole proposal is to get what I described in the town of Fermoy as a political monstrosity, to get one big Party that will be able to do what it likes for a period of four or five years and to have an Opposition composed of what the Taoiseach already has described as a mixum-gatherum.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has already been made in the course of the debate that there must be only two Parties and that the Labour Party, the Farmers, Clann na Talmhan and Clann na Poblachta must get together and see somehow how they can form one Party.  Then we would have what I have already described as a political monstrosity as an Opposition and as a proposed alternative Government.  It is in order that the people should have an opportunity of considering these matters and fully realising what is afoot that we have put down this motion to give a further breathing space and to have an examination of this matter from its political, social and national aspects.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said that the libraries of Europe were searched for <Col N="1323" /> arguments for this debate.  I have said that again and again and I think the Taoiseach was quoting me when he said that.  The Minister for Health discovered some Frenchman&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he was a Swiss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>All right then, a Swiss. He apparently wrote in French because the Minister was so delighted that we had ransacked the libraries of Europe for arguments after the proposals were brought in.  The Minister for Health apparently knew sufficient French to know the French title because he quoted that but then he proceeded to give us the view of some Englishman on what the other man had said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not get away with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought myself that it was the last straw when the Minister for Health had to do that to build up a case for this proposal.  I make this comment about the Taoiseach saying that the libraries of Europe were ransacked for arguments against the proposals: they could have ransacked the same libraries and got the same arguments, the same facts and drawn the same conclusions in the year 1937. This is a matter on which the Irish public should be intelligently informed &mdash;that all these arguments and documents and facts were available from the libraries of Europe in 1937 with one exception, the sole exception of the gentleman discovered by the Minister for Health.  I think the people are entitled to know why, when the Taoiseach took this strong stand in 1937 saying that not merely was he going to enshrine the principles of proportional representation in the Constitution but to copperfasten a particular system to the exclusion of all others, the libraries of Europe were not availed of then.</P>
      <P>I quote what the Taoiseach said then:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The system we have is a good one.  It has worked well.  The people ought to be very grateful for the fact that we had this system.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> Now he wants this country to vote in favour of those new proposals without the country having sufficient time and opportunity to consider the very drastic implications of these proposals. No wonder the people of the country are becoming cynical when the Taoiseach has said that the reason Fianna Fáil want this is that they want an over-all majority.</P>
    <P>He says this, having heard the arguments in this House and in the Seanad and unimpressed by the fact that, as week followed week and month followed month, there was in this country a tremendous upsurge of interest in this matter.  We have not known, since the establishment of this State, such a great amount of interest in any proposal once the people were aroused to the importance of what was afoot and the implications that would follow. We have had study groups, symposia and debates of every kind, class and description in universities and other bodies.  That is a manifestation of public interest that is very welcome particularly when, before these proposals were brought before the people, we had to complain of general apathy and disillusionment.  I can say that these proposals have had the merit of arousing the people to their duty and to an interest in public affairs.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to recall that, at not a single one of these groups, as far as I am aware, was there a vote in favour of the proposals of the Government. At this stage, when the people are taking an intelligent interest in this matter, and looking for guidance, perhaps the Taoiseach will grant a few months' grace which would enable the matter to be gone into more fully? We should also recall the fact that there should be a tribute paid to those Senator professors who, after the discussion in the Seanad, issued a public statement calling for the establishment of a Proportional Representation Commission. While, perhaps, it would not be possible to agree entirely with the terms of that resolution, we can certainly agree in principle with what it seeks, that there should be an inquiry in this matter, that there might be some question of defects in the present <Col N="1325" /> system and that there might be a better system that we could use.</P>
    <P>The motion that we have put down is in line with the principles of that recommendation and we heartily endorse the principle of what they suggest without being bound by the machinery they suggest.  I should have mentioned before that it is now abundantly clear that this was merely a political move to get an over-all majority for Fianna Fáil, but he said: &ldquo;No.  It is because Fianna Fáil cannot get it that these proposals are being put forward.&rdquo;  I do not know how the Taoiseach slipped up on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>I fancy if he is replying to this debate, or if not on some future occasion, he will read into that statement what nobody on earth except himself could possibly read into it and will probably say that what he meant was that Fine Gael should get an overall majority and not Fianna Fáil.  At all events he was borne out by the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, because he said that once the Taoiseach goes from his position in public life as Taoiseach there will arise splinter parties.  He practically said, if he did not say it in so many words, that Fianna Fáil is going to splinter or split up.  I have not got his exact words but he said there were going to be splinter Parties.  Fine Gael will not splinter; Labour will not splinter and Clann na Talmhan will not splinter.  The only Party that will splinter is Fianna Fáil.  Therefore, the Tánaiste said we must have these proposals brought into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>At least we have it clear now that that is what is implied and what was said.  I do not think it was said with tremendous force but it was suggested this was all a political manoeuvre.  We know now that it is, and at least the people will know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving all that aside I want to deal with this matter from a serious point <Col N="1326" /> of view.  So far as I can measure the feeling of the people, they are displaying a tremendous concern and they want to know what this is all about. Many of them are interested from an intellectual point of view.  Some of them, at the start of this debate, were inclined to the view that we are all engaged in some exercise in political dialecticism or some sort of consideration of political machinery.  They know now it is going to affect themselves and they want to know how.  One of the suggestions I am making is to put the question to each individual voter and ask him to inquire: how does this affect me?  I do not think the people are concerned with the question as to whether Fianna Fáil will get an overall majority in the future or not but there is an uneasy feeling arising, if it has not been given clear expression amongst the people, that they are being deprived of something which is intangible but which is nevertheless of great value.  They had the right to vote in a certain way through the years, that is, those who have been sufficiently old to vote in numerous general elections, those who are sufficiently young who have voted only in the last few elections and those who will vote in future elections and in the referendum.</P>
    <P>These people have the feeling that there was something in the vote as it existed under the principle of P.R.  It is all very well to say that they had only one vote, but they could exercise a preference.  They had a feeling, and rightly so, that when they voted 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, they were doing something which they liked to do, and that is being taken away from them. They were enabled, where there was a three-seat constituency and certainly where there was a four or five-seat constituency to make a selection as between candidates of different Parties but over and above that they were enabled to make a selection out of their own political Party to which they had allegiance.  Everybody knows that where there is a four or five-seat constituency part of the manoeuvre during the general election was that each party put a man up from different parts of the area.  One man was elected <Col N="1327" /> in order to have another man elected. Votes were collected from various parts of the constituency and the voter had the feeling that when he was voting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on, he was exercising a preference as between Parties and as between individuals in Parties.  It is coming home to the people that they are being deprived of that something that is valuable.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go through all the arguments that have been advanced here, in the Seanad and elsewhere, as to the relative merits of the different types of P.R. or the British system, but I do press upon Deputies that there is a kind of conviction that there is an effort to rush the Bill.  I have already pointed out in the course of many of the speeches I have made that once a decision is taken on this very grave issue it will be one that will remain for good or for ill for many years as the electoral system in this country.  Neither the Dáil nor the Seanad nor the people have the right &mdash;if they have the right they ought not to exercise it&mdash;to take what I have already described as a leap in the dark instead of making the fullest inquiries into what is proposed and what the effect will be if these proposals are carried into effect.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talks about the national well-being.  I urge upon him that it is his duty and the duty of his colleagues to see that the people are fully informed so that they may give an intelligent decision, knowing the implications, knowing what will happen in the future if they vote either &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; and knowing they will affect very seriously generations to come in a way we cannot yet foresee.</P>
    <P>Such importance do I attach to the argument that we are not able to say what will be the effects of this proposal that I repeat what I have said so often: conditions in this country are entirely different from what they are in England, South Africa, Australia and Canada where the British system is in operation.  Ransack the libraries of Europe if you like, quote Swiss professors, as the Minister for Health might be disposed <Col N="1328" /> to do in the newspapers from time to time, but the outstanding feature of this is that nobody knows what the effects will be on the future of the country.</P>

      <P>We know the conditions are entirely different in Ireland and I have already quoted what they are.  The British have this system over the years.  They know how it works and they know it works for two reasons: (1) because of the peculiar history of the country industrially and politically; (2) because they have a long tradition behind them.  We have had no experience, since the establishment of this State, of the working of this system.  But I do know that there are no such pockets of population scattered around the country to which can be attached the label of any political Party, whether it be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or anything else.  Again I emphasise my belief that nobody knows what will happen with this; there may be some very frightening results from it.  It may very well be that the consequences of these proposals, if ever unfortunately put into operation, would have tremendous results for the country.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat what I said in concluding on a previous occasion.  There was no public demand for these proposals. They were unexpectedly promulgated by the Taoiseach at a Press interview.  He and his Government, over the years which they have been in office, have set up commission after commission to enquire into this, that, and the other thing&mdash;some of major importance and some of relatively minor importance&mdash;but in a matter of this kind, where the people are asked, and where it is obviously intended that they should be pressed, to make a decision without adequate information and merely on political considerations, there is no question of an enquiry being set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We asked for that on the Second Reading of this Bill and it was declined.  We were told when we were discussing this matter in the Dáil&mdash;<Col N="1329" /> and I suppose the Seanad were told the same&mdash;that we were wasting time, that we were preventing the people from giving a decision and that we were standing between the Government and the people.  As long as we could here in the Dáil, we did that and did it in the interest of the people.  I believe the people are grateful for it because our democratic institutions of Dáil and Seanad have secured far greater respect from the people than they had before the debate on these proposals. The people are interested now; there is genuine interest throughout the country. They are still puzzled and in some respects perplexed.  Some have indicated their predilections for this present system and some for a change; and when those who were in favour of the change had matters pointed out to them, they said &ldquo;We had not thought of that&rdquo;, and they changed their minds in favour of the present system.</P>
    <P>It is because we know that there is quite a substantial body of people in the country who have an inquiring mind, who want to know the truth and exercise an intelligent interest in this matter, that we want more time.  Without in any way preventing the Government from getting this Bill passed into law within the constitutional time, there should be this further inquiry in order to give further information to the people who want it.  I believe that the effect of this debate here will be for the good of the people as a whole. I believe that even amongst some of the followers of Fianna Fáil throughout the country there is a feeling that the issues involved in these proposals transcend political considerations.</P>

      <P>That is the way Fianna Fáil have approached it from the beginning of this until the Taoiseach let the cat out of the bag when he said that Fianna Fáil could not get a majority.  The Irish people know <Col N="1330" /> very well what they are at.  They know perfectly well the real motives behind this.  While the Taoiseach may try to equate the national well-being with the political well-being of the Fianna Fáil Party, he and his Party may very well get a surprise.  I have no doubt now what the real purpose behind this Bill is.  I have every doubt that it will be achieved, even if these proposals are brought into operation.  The Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;I shall not put it any further than that&mdash;are not as near the apex of political power as they were two years ago.  There is a little downward curve along which they are slipping.</P>

There is a general election in four or five years' time and God only knows what type of Government or Parliament we will get; and I am gravely concerned with the fact that the result of this matter will be the end of political democracy and democratic freedom in Ireland.</P>

      <P>It was nonsense to say that the introduction of the single vote system would ensure that Fianna Fáil would remain perpetually in office. As had been demonstrated in other countries with the same electoral system, no Party could stay in office for any length of time unless it had a practicable and workable policy. This would also lead to a good Opposition with a workable alternative policy.  That contrasted sharply with the wild promises of the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;I must be careful&mdash;did not address himself to the terms of his amendment.  We are asked here to resolve that a joint committee <Col N="1333" /> of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann should be set up to consider the social, political and economic implications of the changes in the electorate system proposed in the amendment. I did not hear Deputy Costello indicate what were the social implications of these changes nor what were the economic implications.  There are political implications, the implication that if the changes are made the people will be able to have some assurance that as the result of a general election there will be a responsible Government here.</P>
      <P>One would have thought that having been at pains to put down a reasoned, if unreasonable, amendment, the Leader of the Opposition would have addressed himself to the grounds upon which he was seeking to have this Joint Committee set up.  He might have told us how the Joint Committee would work and how different it would be in its deliberations from the deliberations which have taken place here in Dáil Éireann and in the Seanad over a very prolonged period.</P>
      <P>This proposal to amend the Constitution is not being sprung on people.  The Bill was introduced in Dáil Éireann on the 12th November last year.  It got its First Reading and was permitted to be printed by the will of the majority of this House against the wishes of the Opposition who opposed the First Reading in order that they might prevent the people from learning what amendment the Government proposed to the people should be made in the Constitution. We succeeded in having the Bill printed and putting our proposals to the people despite that opposition and 167 or 168 days have elapsed since that time.  During the greater part of that period, the proposed amendment of the Constitution was debated here at length.  It was carried by a very large majority of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It then went to the Seanad and the Second Reading of the Bill was carried there.  The principle that the Constitution should be amended in that way was accepted by the Seanad and it was only on the Fifth Stage of the <Col N="1334" /> Bill that, by the narrowest majority, the Seanad rejected the Bill in the form in which it had been sent to the Seanad by this House.</P>

      <P>It is very regrettable that even today Seanad Eireann should try to stand between the Irish people and their right to consider a proposal to amend the Constitution. Because that is what is involved here.</P>
      <P>The Constitution Amendment Bill has been debated as I have indicated at great length.  The Leader of the Opposition sneeringly referred to the fact that a great deal of research had been engaged in by members on both sides of the House as to the political implications of the existing method of electing this House and the basis upon which this House will be elected if the Constitution amendment is passed.  What is this Committee which they propose to set up going to do other than to re-ransack the libraries of Europe in order that the six academic politicians who have taken upon themselves, as I said elsewhere, the role of prophet, might further educate themselves as to the implications of what it is proposed to do?  At the end of that time what benefit would the nation or the people have derived from this further exercise of research on the part of the six University representatives, some of whom claim that we should bring in foreign experts, if you please, a Frenchman, a German, and even a member of the English House of Lords, to tell the Irish people how they should elect their own Parliament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> I would have thought that that sort of slavish abnegation of the responsibilities of Irish citizenship would long ago have disappeared from our public life.

Is that one of the grounds of the opposition to the change&mdash;I think it is&mdash;that it makes it easier for a Party to secure an overall majority and, therefore, as I have said, to govern with authority, to govern with a certain degree of security, to carry out a policy over a period of years which can be effectively realised? If that is one of the grounds upon which the Fine Gael Opposition object to the proposed amendment and wish to hold it up from consideration and decision by the people, I gather then that the Leader of the Opposition and the Fine Gael Party do not want ever to secure an overall majority.  Are we to take it that that is the situation now in Irish public life, that the Party which, in 1927, were urging the people to vote for them and against coalitions, the Party which have been pretending that they have been the sole alternative, the real, effective alternative, to Fianna Fáil, have now thrown up the sponge and that they do not want to secure an overall majority, that they do not want ever to be in a position to form a Government consisting of their own Party, that they wish to be dependent all the time upon a number of smaller Parties in the Dáil who, at the time of election, can go out and ask people to vote for them, for a policy which would be diametrically opposite to that which Fine Gael have been associated with in the past and probably with which they would be associated in the future?  Is the conclusion which the people have to draw from the position which has been taken up by the Fine Gael Party in relation to the motion that, despite all the bright young men they are supposed to have around them, the bright young things on their back benches, they despair now of ever being able again to form a Fine Gael Government in <Col N="1338" /> this country?  If so, then they are bankrupt of hope and, of course, they are bankrupt of hope because they are bankrupt of policy.</P>
      <P>Again, in the course of his speech the Leader of the Opposition had a few sneers to offer in relation to &ldquo;mixum gatherum Oppositions&rdquo;.  He was suggesting that we were anxious that there should be some sort of coalition Opposition.  The last thing that we want to see in this country is a coalition Opposition or a coalition Government because we cannot have the sort of stable, authoritative, effective Government which this country wants if you are not going to have a united Party as the alternative to a united Government.</P>
      <P>I must remember to refer to Deputy Costello as the Leader of the Opposition or Deputy O'Higgins will be getting up protesting.  It is rather strange to find the Leader of the Opposition, who has been twice Taoiseach in a Coalition Government, finding fault with a coalition Opposition.  It is quite illogical.  We are logical because we say: &ldquo;A plague on coalitions, no matter what side of the House they are on.  A plague on coalitions.  A plague on Governments which are composed of the representatives of several contending Parties, because such Governments can never be united&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have had several samples of that.  We had it notably in the period from 1948 to 1951, when a number of completely incompatible Parties, with policies which were quite inconsistent with each other, formed a Government in order to put Fianna Fáil out and, within three or four days after three years had elapsed, exploded because of internal stress and dissention.</P>
      <P>We had the same sort of thing happening, and we know it happened, in the year 1957 when, without daring to face the Dáil on the Estimates which were going to be put before it, without daring to have a debate on the Vote on Account, the last Coalition split.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that we can progress in this country if we are going to be governed in that sort of way, and the <Col N="1339" /> purpose of the amendment which we are asking to be permitted to submit to the people at the earliest possible moment is to secure an electoral system which, whatever other merits or demerits it may have, at least has this advantage, that it tends to repose power in the hands of that section of the people which is most numerous and most united.  It cannot, of course, guarantee any Party in office because the last word under the Constitution lies with the people, and if the Party in power on the day of the general election is not able to render an account of its stewardship acceptable to the people, and if it has not a policy to put before the people which will be accepted by them, if its candidates and those who constitute its Government have not the trust of the people, then that Party will not come back.  It will be easier for the people, much easier for the people, to provide themselves with an alternative under the straight vote system than it has been shown to be under P.R.</P>
    <P>We have no desire to monopolise government in this country and, even if we had the desire, we could never make that desire effective.  There was a time when Cumann na nGaedheal outnumbered the Fianna Fáil Party in this House.  There was a time when a Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office in this House.  From 1927 to 1932 the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were in office.  We were in Opposition.  The situation changed in 1932.  Why did it change?  It changed because the people lost confidence in Cumann na nGaedheal.  It changed not because of the system of election but simply because the people had obviously lost confidence in Cumann na nGaedheal; they decided that Cumann na nGaedheal were not the sort of Party they wanted to have in charge of their affairs, and they decided to make a change.</P>
    <P>They confirmed that decision in 1933.  In 1937 they were undecided what to do.  In 1938, the year after, they again decided to give us an overall majority.  Then the war broke out and we continued through until 1948. In 1948 the people decided to make a <Col N="1340" /> change.  Why?  They decided to make a change because&mdash;let us face it frankly&mdash;of the degree of misrepresentation, scandal-mongering and character assassination which was indulged in by certain political Parties.  The people lost confidence in the Fianna Fáil Government because of that campaign. The same thing happened in 1954.  We were out.  We were out, not because of the system of election but because of the simple fact that we could not get the support of the majority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But we always had hopes that, one day or other, the people would turn to us again.  That is the difference between the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fine Gael Opposition. We had hope, and confidence, and courage.  We had confidence in ourselves and confidence in the people.</P>
      <P>What about the Fine Gael Opposition? The Fine Gael Opposition seems to be in the grip of a strange despair.  Despite all the brilliant talents they continually tell us they have in their ranks, they are not yet in a position to stand on their own legs in the political life of the country. They cannot go before the people and say: &ldquo;Here is our programme.  We are putting that programme through. We do not care whether Fianna Fáil is with us or against us.  We do not care whether Labour is with us or against us.  We do not care whether Clann na Talmhan is for us or not. This is the Fine Gael policy.  We are putting it to the people.  We know the people will give us a majority when they understand our policy.&rdquo;  That is not the position the Fine Gael Opposition has taken, and it marks the difference between that Party and ourselves. We are the Party with the courage and the confidence and the wisdom.  Why does Fine Gael not pluck up courage and not depend on the crumbs that fall from the tables of other political Parties?  Why do they not stand on their own feet and fight their battles on their own ground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> That is one thing Fine Gael will be able to do if the people&mdash;as they will&mdash;accept the Constitutional Amendment which we are proposing. But the whole thing rests with the people.  The vote will be theirs.  With the straight vote system, the power will be theirs.  They will be in a much better position to control their Government than they are under this system of P.R.  We will get away from this idea of Coalition Government in this country and we shall have single Parties.  We shall have a single Party united Opposition and a united Government. If the Government do not do their duty, then the people will turn to the united Opposition and give them a chance.</P>
    <P>In that way the people will have more control over the Government because they will be able to fix responsibility for the things which the Government does or the things the Government fails to do.  They will be able to fix responsibility for all those matters in which the Government may fail them.  It will not be possible for the Government to say: &ldquo;We would have done this if it had not been for some other Party inside the Government.&rdquo; That is the situation we want to bring about in this country.  We want to make the people the real masters and not have politicians deciding, after an election, who will hold office and what the policy will be.  We want the people to know in advance what the policy will be and who are likely to constitute the Government. That is the sole issue.</P>
    <P>Why should we defer a decision on this issue?  Why should we delay putting it to the people?  Why should we delay further?  This motion which is down here will not produce any change.  The proposal is to set up a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad.  The proposed amendment of the Constitution has been discussed here in open day, in open session, by a committee of the whole Dáil.  It has similarly been discussed in the Seanad. Does anybody think that, if a Joint Committee were set up, it would make any difference?  Does anybody think any further fact will be elicited in relation to the system of election <Col N="1342" /> which will change the vote of one single member of the Oireachtas, those members of the Oireachtas having already pledged themselves by their votes to certain views?</P>
    <P>The whole matter has been thrashed out here until it is threadbare.  There is no aspect of this problem about which every member of the Dáil and Seanad is not now well-informed and about which the people are not also well-informed.  What is the point, then, in our setting up this Joint Committee except to send the fool further &mdash;to try to withhold from the people their right to decide in this matter? Is not that the purpose of this motion? Why are the Opposition afraid? Deputy Costello says he will not prophesy but he has a feeling that the Constitutional amendment will be defeated. I think differently.  I am not a prophet either, but I am very much more confident than Deputy Costello is, because I want the issue to go to the people.  Apparently the Fine Gael Opposition, responsible for this motion, want to withhold it from the people.  For what purpose?  What use will it serve?  Why not let us put the issue to the people?  Whatever they decide, let us accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion as tabled by the Taoiseach is a Parliamentary way of saying that he has no intention of taking any notice of what happened in the Seanad.  In non-Parliamentary language, it could mean: &ldquo;I do not give a damn what you think.  I am going to go my way.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>This attitude of the Taoiseach and the Government should be considered by the people as a warning to them of the evils that are to come should they surrender the privileges they now hold under proportional representation at the coming Referendum.  The indecent haste with which the Taoiseach has seen fit to put forward this motion can be attributed only to the urgent desire that there should be no possible chance but that the Presidential Election and the referendum will take place on the same day, thereby taking advantage of <Col N="1343" /> the well-known name of de Valera to induce as many as possible to vote for the abolition of proportional representation, perhaps against their better judgment.</P>
      <P>This indecent haste, without even a suggestion of consideration of the view of the Seanad is, to my mind, the crowning blow to the prestige of the Seanad and to whatever respect it was held in throughout the country.  It can but confirm the opinion of the people that the Seanad as part of the Houses of the Oireachtas is of no use whatever and serves no purpose for the country.  If it is the desire of the Taoiseach that that impression should be created it is strange that he has not taken the step of abolishing the Seanad as he did before.</P>
      <P>By doing this the Government seek to hide the fact that all but the Party-elected Senators and Government nominees in the Seanad in open vote, have voted against the proposed change.  In fact, even one member of the Party that voted with the Government made it quite clear that she was voting against her own conscientious beliefs.  All of us realise that it was only a sense of gratitude to the Taoiseach for the nomination that induced her to vote as she did.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Labour line in connection with the motion and the amendment? I think the Labour Party at all times have indicated that they have been opposed to any change in the system of election.  They have indicated at all times that they believe that the proportional representation system has been the fairest and the best suited to this country.  Our speakers, during the debate on the original motion, enumerated various points in favour of proportional representation and the things that would result from any change.  We indicated that the larger Party in the country, <Col N="1344" /> if the straight vote system was adopted, would naturally get an advantage because of the fact that even with a majority of the votes being cast against them, when these votes were split up amongst the parties in Opposition, the largest Party would naturally get Government.  It would be possible in that way that a Party getting only 40 per cent. of the votes could quite possibly secure 90 per cent. of the seats in Parliament.</P>
    <P>I would commend to Deputies and the country in general that they should read carefully and study the series of six articles on proportional representation that appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> of recent date.  I would suggest that they are enlightened, unbiased and impartial&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>They indicate what has happened since 1918 to the present day.  There is sufficient in them to convince anybody but those who hold a vested interest in Fianna Fáil as to the advisability of retaining the proportional representation system.  I was aware that the moment I mentioned the <i>Irish Times</i> I would be attacked on the grounds that it is the organ of the Imperialist group in this country.  I admit that the <i>Irish Times</i> is the organ of a certain minority group, both religious and political, but I see no reason why anybody should suggest that because of their views, either religious or political, they cannot assess and analyse facts and figures as well as anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly Labour would also be accused of being biased.  We see no good in the direct vote system and are all in favour of proportional <Col N="1345" /> representation.  I would think it highly desirable that the views of a minority group or of minority groups should be sought as to the system of election to this Parliament so that the views of the minority should be truly heard.  I have no intention of quoting from the various articles because they need careful study but I would recommend them to each thinking Deputy.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote a point made in the first article in which it was said that the Proportional Representation Society submitted that certain things would result from a Government elected under the proportional representation system.  The points of advantage to be gained were set out as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That Parliament and other public bodies would reproduce the opinions of the electors in their true proportions;</P>
      <P>(2)  That under proportional representation the majority of the electors should rule and that all considerable minorities should be heard;</P>
      <P>(3)  Give electors wider freedom of choice of representatives;</P>
      <P>(4)  Give representatives greater independence from the financial and other pressures of small sections of communities;</P>
      <P>(5)  Ensure to parties representation by their ablest and most trusted members.</P>
      <P>Those are five laudable points.  Those are points which I suggest all of us should seek to establish and it is the view of people who have given consideration to this, not only in Ireland but in many countries of the world, that P.R. with the single transferable vote and the multiple constituency, is the method best fitted to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion of the Taoiseach is in direct contradiction to that.  It is an effort to say that the direct vote and the strong government that will result from it, leading to the suppression of minorities and the negation of democracy, is what we should adopt.  I do not propose to repeat any of the arguments I or my colleagues in the Labour group made on the original <Col N="1346" /> Bill when it was before the House. The Government has already made up its mind, irrespective of what I shall say this evening.  By the exercise of the majority they hold in this House they will make sure this motion is carried.  They intend that by no chance will the opportunity to have the clash of elections on the same day be missed.  They realise that it is to their Party's advantage that this should be done.</P>
    <P>I cannot refrain, however, from enumerating what to me are a few of the points the electorate should consider as being against the proposed change.  By restricting the electors to the single non-transferable vote the Government as the largest Party will have the advantage of the vote that will be split between the combined opposition in most constituencies.  The election will be contested by two or three candidates in opposition to the Government.  Unless by agreement, Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Poblachta or Clann na Talmhan agree not to contest certain constituencies, unless by the backdoor method of previous arrangements, the Government are almost assured of being returned in each area.  In this Bill it is proposed so to divide the present constituencies that it will be practically impossible for any minority groups to have sufficient numbers in any one area to return a candidate to the Dáil.  In this way the Government will ensure that any small Party attempting to have their voice heard here in furtherance of their policy will be denied the opportunity.</P>
    <P>It is being claimed by Fianna Fáil that the P.R. system is a British imposed one.  In the articles in the <i>Irish Times</i> which I mentioned it was made clear that the leaders of Sinn Féin, of the old Irish Party, of Labour and of the various other minority groups in the country at that time, having examined the proposed system, welcomed it and felt that it would give such good service to the country that the British Government was petitioned to permit its introduction in Sligo in a local government election for a specific purpose, so that minority groups would have the right of self-expression and a <Col N="1347" /> say in the conduct of their home affairs.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil also claim that P.R. leads to uncertain government.  They claim that Coalitions are almost inevitable under P.R. but the history of the changes of Government in Ireland since the foundation of the State as compared with Great Britain, lends no substance to that claim.  The real reason that Fianna Fáil forced elections at certain times even when they had clear majorities was because they saw there was a political advantage at the moment and the friends of that day could have been discarded in the sure knowledge that the quickness and speed of an election would give them the advantage they nearly always received.</P>
    <P>In the Labour Party we make it quite clear that we are opposed to this motion for the simple reason that we believe in the P.R. system of election until such time as a better system of expressing the rights and views of the people is shown to us.  We believe it is the fairest, the most democratic and the most understood system we could have.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health spoke in connection with a statement issued by certain university Senators.  I have seen that statement and it is a significant fact that these independent university Senators, elected by the votes of the educated graduates of the universities, who in no way can be called Party hacks of any Party in the Oireachtas, unanimously decided that before a change would take place at least consideration should be given to the effects on the economic, social and political life of the country in complete contrast to the indecent haste with which the Government are seeking to force this measure through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Without in any way pledging my Party I can make this statement, that while believing in P.R. until such time as a better system is shown to us, we in the Labour Party are quite willing to have a commission set up representative of all groups to examine and consider that subject and we shall give serious consideration to whatever findings <Col N="1348" /> they bring in.  In this way should the referendum be held following the findings of that Commission, the electorate will at least have the advantage of voting in the knowledge that they have the views of the people suitably qualified to examine the position before they elect representatives to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I always enjoy listening to the Minister for Health, I think, perhaps, it was a pity he should have been the principal speaker for the Government in relation to this motion because&mdash;he probably would be the first to admit it himself&mdash;he does not always put things in the least controversial manner.  As far as I am concerned&mdash;and I think I can talk for the Party which I represent when I say this&mdash;I would prefer to see both the Taoiseach's Motion and the Fine Gael amendment discussed in an atmosphere of calm and deliberation. It is necessary that all of us should recognise that in dealing with the proposed change in our election system, we are dealing with a matter which is grave and which will have very grave consequences on the people of this country for many a long year to come. It is precisely because we see the gravity of the issues involved that we on this side of the House feel that there should be some reasonable type of examination of the issues involved, and the possible consequences of them, before this question is submitted to the people, if it is to be submitted to the people at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can gather, the Fianna Fáil approach to this matter is that they made up their minds first that P.R. had to go, that having decided that P.R. was to go, they then decided it was time enough to think of what would replace it.  The only thing they can think of to replace it is the British system of election.  The arguments for and against the proposed change&mdash;as far as they are seen by members of this House and members of the Seanad&mdash;have been expressed and are on record.  But I think it is true to say that this question was introduced by the Taoiseach into the political arena on the plane of political controversy. The Taoiseach called on <Col N="1349" /> the members of his won political organisation to take off their coats and work for the abolition of P.R.  It is in the atmosphere of that call by the leader of the Government to his political supporters and to his active political organisation that this question was first introduced to this House for discussion.  Any question that is introduced in that kind of atmosphere, affecting as it does not merely the political Parties but the ordinary people of this country, must as a matter of course be considered by the political Parties in this House as a political question.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly natural that every formal political Party should have its views on this question proposed by the Government, but in so far as any independent view can be obtained from amongst the ranks of the members of this House&mdash;independent as distinct from Party political considerations&mdash;that view has also been expressed.  It is significant&mdash;and the significance of this should not be lost on the Government&mdash;that only two out of the nine or 10 Deputies who were elected to this House with independent status could be found who had a word to say in favour of the Government's proposal.  So that, in so far as this House by its composition was capable of expressing independent views on the Government's motion, those views have been overwhelmingly against the Government's proposal.</P>
    <P>We ask in this motion that there should be an opportunity of giving proper consideration and more detailed examination to these proposals.  We think it is only fair that the people, before they are called on to give a decision in a matter of such gravity as this, should be given the opportunity of that kind of detailed, calm consideration and examination.  After all, year in, year out, Government after Government in this country are setting up committees, commissions and tribunals of one sort or another to examine a variety of different topics and proposals. We have a Television Commission. We even have a Commission to examine the Seanad election system. We have a Liquor Bill Commission, a Youth Unemployment Commission, a <Col N="1350" /> Milk Costings Commission and a host of other commissions of that sort.</P>
    <P>We are not even asking the government to go that far and establish a commission or tribunal outside of the Oireachtas, but we are asking them to set up a select joint committee, consisting of members of the Seanad and the Dáil, to give this question proper examination.  We are suggesting to the Government that it is in the interest of Parliamentary democracy, and in the national interest, that the Government should not do what they have done&mdash; that they should not take a decision to smash our election system before deciding what they want to replace it. It is quite clear that was the approach of the Government to this question.</P>
    <P>As I read it in any event, the Press Conference given by the Taoiseach when this matter was first dragged into the light of day demonstrates that that was the approach of the Government to this question.  I want to quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of September 9th, 1958, in connection with this Press interview.  This report reads:</P>
    <P>Asked whether the direct representation would be along the lines of the system used in the British days, with representation to the Universities, including Trinity College, he said that the new method would be worked out after a decision was taken on P.R.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Taoiseach was in a position then to state that the decision would be taken on P.R. first and, having taken a decision on P.R., a decision would be taken as to what was the method to replace it.</P>
    <P>I assume that the decision he was referring to was the decision of the Government, because we are now in a position where the Government are to put the matter before the people for decision.  In putting the matter before the people for decision they are recommending the alternative; they are recommending that as an alternative to the Irish election system, the people should adopt the British election system.  But the quotation I have given &mdash;I take it it is an accurate one?&mdash; does show that as far as the Government <Col N="1351" /> and the Fianna Fáil Party were concerned, the approach was to set up the target first, knock it down and then decide what was to take its place.  I do not think that that gives us any evidence of proper or careful examination of the proposal which has been put before us now by the Government. It seems to me to be evidence of the will to destroy without an examination of what is to be re-erected instead.  It seems to me, too, that the Government, while willing to destroy the Irish election system, gave no adequate examination in regard to what was to take its place.  The best they could do was to turn their eyes across the Irish Sea and to recommend to the Irish people that they should jettison the Irish election system and replace it by the British system because they tell us that the Irish system was imposed on us by the British.  It sounds daft to me, but that is one of the arguments that Fianna Fáil have been urging on this: that we should get rid of the Irish system and replace it by the British system because the Irish system was imposed on us by the British.</P>
    <P>In the same Press interview, I think the Taoiseach must have had in his mind the necessity for the kind of calm consideration and approach to this decision that we on this side are urging on the Government, when he made it clear that it was not intended to confuse the issue by having any other issue before the people at the same time.</P>
    <P>In the same paper, the <i>Irish Times</i>, of 9th September, 1958, on the same page, the Taoiseach went on as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. de Valera said that the referendum would be held separately from any other issue, including the election of a President.</P>
    <P>Was it not quite clear that, at that stage if there was to be a decision taken on this question of the electoral system, that was not going to be confused with anything else, that the people would be given an opportunity of coming to their decision without the introduction of any other issue, <Col N="1352" /> including the election of a President?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's remarks in introducing his motion were not very lengthy.  They seemed to me, to some extent, to decry the work of the Seanad.  He argued that this proposal was one which more intimately affected the Dáil than the Seanad and he seemed to go on from that to convey that therefore the Dáil were entitled to pass this motion and have the matter put before the people.  Let us see how the Government looked at the obverse side of the coin.  There was a certain agitation for a change in the electoral system for the Seanad; there was no agitation for a change in the electoral system for the Dáil.  In the case of the Seanad the Government simply set up a commission and had that call for examination and change in the Seanad electoral system examined without referring the matter to the Seanad.  If the type of argument put forward this evening by the Taoiseach is valid, surely the proper course for him to adopt in connection with the Seanad commission would have been to say that this is a matter which affects the Seanad rather than the Dáil and should be dealt with by the Seanad?</P>
    <P>Let us remember that whatever powers the Seanad have&mdash;and my personal belief is that one flaw in connection with the Seanad that gives rise to a lot of the criticism we hear is that the Seanad have not sufficient powers &mdash;were given to the Seanad by the Irish people when they enacted the 1937 Constitution.  It is not good enough that the Taoiseach or anyone else should come into this House and, not merely try to ride roughshod over a decision of the Seanad but in doing that, try to ride roughshod over a decision of the Irish people as expressed in their enactment of the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>When this matter was discussed in the Dáil previously, there had been talk of allowing the people to come to a decision and the Taoiseach today described the Fine Gael amendment to this motion as only putting the matter on the long finger.  He expressed the view that the people have had an opportunity of informing themselves of <Col N="1353" /> the merits of the proposal.  Already I have said, and I repeat in this context, that so far as we are concerned we would like to see this matter being approached calmly and deliberately, and properly and thoroughly examined by the House, the Seanad and by the people, if it goes before the people for decision.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the introduction of this proposal by the Government in the atmosphere in which it was introduced will give the people an opportunity of approaching the matter calmly or coming to a considered judgment on it.  Each one of us knows that the entire strength of the Fianna Fáil party machine will be thrown into the fray against proportional representation. We know that all the wealth of the Fianna Fáil organisation will be thrown into the fray to abolish proportional representation; we know that all the power of the Fianna Fáil string of newspapers will be thrown into the fray in an endeavour to abolish proportional representation. We now know that all the influence of the Taoiseach himself and all the support he can command for his personal position in the affections of those who support him will be thrown on to the scales on the day on which this referendum will be held because it is quite clear that the Government have made up their mind to hold the Presidential election and the referendum on the same day.</P>
    <P>When you have a powerful and wealthy political organisation taking off their coats at the invitation of their leader to try to get the people to smash the existing election system, does anyone think the proposal will be calmly considered by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party?  Does anybody think there will be any deliberative approach to this question within the ranks of that Party and not only in the ranks of the Party but in the ranks of the Fianna Fáil organisation throughout the country?</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that when this matter was discussed at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis and when the rallying cry went out from the Taoiseach to his Fianna Fáil supporters to take off their coats and help in <Col N="1354" /> the fight to abolish proportional representation, so far as I am aware not a solitary voice was raised in opposition to him.  To me that is a very terrifying thing.  If Mr. Khrushchev held a meeting in Red Square in Moscow and put a proposal to alter fundamentally the Soviet Constitution, he could not have got any bigger majority in favour of it than the Taoiseach got among the Fianna Fáil supporters assembled in the Mansion House.  It would surprise me if at a meeting in Red Square, in Moscow, there would not be one voice raised in opposition to a radical proposal to alter fundamentally some aspect of the Soviet constitution but it can happen here in Ireland.  It can happen in the Fianna Fáil Party and we are told then that the people are getting their opportunity of informing themselves on the merits of their proposal.</P>
    <P>I wonder what discussion took place inside the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party that, within a matter of a month or two months, they were able to come to a unanimous decision on a radical change in our electoral system, that they were able to decide that they and theirs were entirely wrong in 1937 when they enshrined the principles of proportional representation as the electoral system in that Constitution. No doubt, the Taoiseach and other leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1937 exhorted their followers to take off their coats and work that the 1937 Constitution would be voted on and accepted by the people and now they are being asked to take off their coats in order to gut the 1937 Constitution and take out of it one of the fundamental matters which the Fianna Fáil Government at that time insisted should be enshrined in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, when he was speaking on this motion, asked if Fine Gael despaired of ever again forming a Fine Gael Government and he went on to make the case that when Fianna Fáil went out of office they did not go out of office because of the electoral system and that they had the hope that the people would come back to Fianna Fáil again.  That confidence does not seem to be there any longer. <Col N="1355" /> The Minister for External Affairs, for some reason or another, was put in charge of the internal affairs in connection with the debate on the Bill and took charge of the debate when the matter was first brought before the Dáil.  My recollection is&mdash;I do not pretend to quote him&mdash;that one of the arguments which he adduced in favour of the Fianna Fáil proposal to change over to the British electoral system was that if it was not put through the Dáil at this time there might never be another opportunity of doing it.  What was the implication in that argument&mdash; that Fianna Fáil now had an overall majority, that they might never again get an overall majority unless they were able to change the rules between this and the next general election?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the vast volume of confidence which the Minister for Health was exuding a few minutes ago?  If we are to accept the case made by the Minister for External Affairs as representing fairly the Government point of view, is it not the position that they concede that it is unlikely that Fianna Fáil will ever again get an overall majority from the people of Ireland unless they can change the electoral system?  Is there any doubt about that?  Was not that emphasised and underscored by the remarks of the Taoiseach, which were quoted here by the Leader of the Opposition and which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 27th of this month?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health gave a quotation from that speech.  I propose giving another:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said he hated making any changes in the Constitution and would not have proposed this change only that it was fundamentally necessary for the nation's well-being.  It was because Fianna Fáil could not count on obtaining an overall majority in any future election under the present electoral system that they had decided to allow the people to decide on what form members should be elected in future.  They considered that to be <Col N="1356" /> their duty to the country now that they were fortunate in having a majority in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I think that, in slightly different words, is precisely the same argument as was advanced here by the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, when he was seeking the way out of that speech by the Taoiseach, quoted another portion of the speech.  I think the particular quotation he gave was this one:</P>
    <P>It was nonsense to say that the introduction of the single-vote system would ensure that Fianna Fáil would remain perpetually in office.  As had been demonstrated in other countries with the same electoral system, no Party could stay in office for any length of time unless it had a practicable and workable policy over which it could stand. This would also lead to a good Opposition with a workable alternative policy that contrasted sharply with the wild promises of a coalition.</P>
    <P>I think, inadvertently, the Minister translated that into &ldquo;Opposition&rdquo;.  I know it was a slip on his part.</P>
    <P>It is not for the purpose of commenting on that that I am reading that quotation again but in order to show the kind of confusion that seems to have arisen in the ranks, not only of the Fianna Fáil Party, but the Fianna Fáil Cabinet, in presenting their arguments in connection with this change because, in the very next column of the same paper, we have the Minister for Finance quoted as saying at a Fianna Fáil convention in Aughrim:</P>
    <P>People were told that Fianna Fáil wanted to perpetuate themselves in office but the Fianna Fáil leaders were dropping a system that could put themselves in for the rest of their lives and taking a chance on a system that might put them out if the people wanted another form of Government.  Was that not democracy?</P>
    <P>In other words, the Taoiseach in one column is quite blunt in saying that <Col N="1357" /> they are recommending the change in the electoral system because Fianna Fáil could not count on obtaining an overall majority in any future election under the present electoral system and the Minister for Finance, in the next column, tells the people that Fianna Fáil were dropping a system which could put themselves in for the rest of their lives and taking a chance on a new system.</P>
    <P>The same type of confusion is evidenced in reports which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Thursday, the 9th of the present month, where we have the Minister for Health, speaking at a Fianna Fáil meeting in Dublin&mdash; the exact venue, apparently, is not disclosed&mdash;and the Minister for Lands speaking at a Fianna Fáil meeting in Tallaght.  The Minister for Health is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the principal arguments used against the reintroduction of the straight vote as the basis of their electoral system was that it would tend to give greater power to party bosses and party machines, said Mr. MacEntee, Minister for Health and Social Welfare, at a Fianna Fáil meeting in Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The quotation continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Quite the contrary was likely to result, he said.  P.R., in whatever form it was applied, was the system which tended to make for boss control. Under it constituencies were so large and the expense of contesting them so great that the average candidate must have substantial finances to fight them at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health was there making the case that there was nothing in the argument that the British system, which he calls the straight vote, gave power to Party bosses.  But in the next column, in the same paper, the Minister for Lands is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The great advantage of the single vote system lay in the fact that Party discipline, always essential in effective Government, would be maintained, but subject to the new condition established that <Col N="1358" /> the Deputy from each area should be sufficiently independent to be capable of invigorating his own Party.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There, you have two members of the same Party, sitting in the same Cabinet, going out over the same weekend to give their arguments as to why the British voting system should be adopted by us in preference to the Irish system.  We have the Minister for Health placing his argument on the basis that P.R. and not the British system gave power to Party bosses and we have the Minister for Lands basing his argument on the ground that Party discipline, always essential, would be maintained if the British system of election were adopted.</P>
    <P>In connection with the speech which I have quoted from the Minister for Health there is an argument which should be, I think, very close to his own heart.  If any member of the Government is to be let out loose to make the kind of argument that the Minister for Health made when he was speaking at this unknown venue in Dublin, I think the last person to do that should be the Minister for Health because, whenever this question of Party control being tightened arises, whenever any attention is directed to that particular question and that particular problem, everybody's eyes immediately turn to the constituency of Dublin South East and to the state of affairs that existed there on the occasion of the last General Election.</P>
    <P>It is public knowledge that up to the time of the last General Election, and for some years before it, the Fianna Fáil candidates in that constituency were the Minister for Health and his then colleague, Deputy Dr. Noel Browne.  It is common knowledge that the Fianna Fáil Party chose to continue the candidature of the Minister for Health but decided that they would not have alongside the Minister, standing as their candidate, Deputy Dr. Noel Browne.  What would the position have been under the British system in that particular state of affairs?  It was made clear that many supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, and presumably a number of members of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1359" /> organisation in that constituency, wanted Deputy Dr. Noel Browne, as their candidate.  What could they have done had the British system been in operation here?  Could they have invited Deputy Dr. Noel Browne to stand as an Independent candidate?  If they did that, their dilemma was a horrible one for they had to split the vote and, by splitting the vote, they gave the seat to someone else.</P>

      <P>Under the system of proportional representation we have here the Fianna Fáil supporters in that constituency who wanted Deputy Dr. Noel Browne to represent them in the Dáil were able to invite him to stand as an Independent candidate.  They were able to go over the heads of the Party political bosses who drummed him out as a candidate of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They were able to elect him to represent them in this present Dáil. That emphasises one of the vital differences between our present election system, proportional representation, and the British system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the system of proportional representation the elector who goes in to cast his vote is a genuine elector. He is not merely a voter.  He has a job to do.  As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, when speaking earlier on this motion, the elector under our present system has a choice not merely between political Parties but even between candidates in the same Party.  In every constituency throughout the country Fianna Fáil put forward two, three, or four candidates&mdash;whatever number is suitable to the particular conditions of the constituency&mdash; and every Fianna Fáil supporter <Col N="1360" /> throughout the country, whether or not he is actively inside the ranks of the organisation, is enabled to decide by his vote which, if any, of the Fianna Fail candidates will go into the Dáil to represent him.  He is an elector in the true sense of the word.  He is not merely a voter endorsing or rejecting a single candidate put up by his political Party.  What happened in the constituency of Dublin South East is an excellent example of what our present election system means as compared with the British system.</P>
    <P>I want to examine briefly now some of the other arguments which have been advanced by the Fianna Fail Party in recommendation of their proposals, proposals which have been rejected by the Seanad and are now back here for discussion again.  I have referred briefly to the argument used, and used seriously, by members of the Fianna Fail Party that the P.R. system was imposed on us by the British.  Leaving aside the fact that the only substitute which Fianna Fáil can find for it is the British system, it is necessary, I think, to record again the fact that the present election system was enshrined in two Irish Constitutions, and the second of those&mdash;the Constitution of 1937&mdash;was drafted by Fianna Fail and submitted by Fianna Fail to the people.</P>
    <P>The Government also argue that the present election system is complicated and confusing; people do not understand it; it is difficult for the ordinary Irish voter; he does not know what he is doing when he goes in to vote at an election.  Now, the Irish people are an intelligent people.  Proportional representation is an intelligent voting system and, as such, it is well suited to an intelligent electorate. But the Fianna Fáil Party newspaper pronounced its judgment on this question a considerable time ago, long before Fianna Fáil decided that the system was so good that it must be enshrined in the Constitution they were recommending to the people in 1937.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Press</i> of the 24th January, 1933, had this to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The English Press correspondents sympathise with us on having <Col N="1361" /> to work so complicated a system as proportional representation.  It is wasted sympathy, for the system is simple to understand and easy to carry out.  It is based on the excellent idea that we have a greater preference for some candidates than others.  Under proportional representation the voter not only has the pleasure of voting first for the candidates he likes most of all, but he also can vote for all the others in the order in which he likes them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We were told more than a quarter of a century ago by the Fianna Fáil Party newspaper that there was nothing difficult about proportional representation.  Every Deputy will admit that, by and large, the Irish people and the Irish electorate are reasonably intelligent.  When it was stated in 1933 that our present election system was simple to understand and easy to work it should not take a novitiate of a quarter of a century to discover that it was hard to understand and difficult to carry out.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Taoiseach and some other Fianna Fáil speakers have taken to referring to the British system which they are asking us to accept as a straightforward system.  The Minister for Health still continues to refer to it as the straight vote but the Taoiseach has gone a step further and refers to it as the straightforward system.  That is very clever politically because it tends to deflect the minds of the people from the fact that what the Government is recommending is the British system.  I do not say that because the X-vote system is a British system it is necessarily bad.  I do not want to be taken as saying that because a thing is British it is necessarily bad but it might embarrass certain elements in the Fianna Fáil Party that they should now be called upon to embrace the British system of election after having been told to burn everything British except their coal.</P>
    <P>It is clever politically to refer to the proposed system as the straightforward system.  It seems to imply that there is something devious or crooked about the present system.  I think it is worth while, if the Government is not going to accept the amendment tabled, that <Col N="1362" /> we should endeavour here and now to give some examples of this matter. There are two things involved in this referendum.  We are being asked to smash one system of election and to vote for another system and I want to see how straightforward the British system really is.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Irish electorate are intelligent and so they are.  Fianna Fáil argues that the British system is a simple one and that simplicity is a virtue.  Simplicity may be a virtue but we are not simpletons and I do not think it is necessary to legislate for simpletons when we are talking about the Irish electorate.  The mechanics of the British system may be quite simple but I think what is far more important is the question of whether the system is a fair one or not.  Surely it is not right that the test of the electoral system should be one of how simple it is. Surely it is far better that the yardstick which should be applied is how fair is it.</P>
    <P>Even the Minister for Health will admit, I do not think he could argue against it, that the British system may lead to and is likely to lead to minority government.  A Deputy elected under that system can be elected by a minority of the voters in any given constituency.  You can get a result where one candidate, representing one of the major political Parties gets 11,000 votes.  Another candidate representing another major political Party can get 10,000 votes and a candidate of a third Party can get 9,000 votes. Under the system which the Government is now asking us to adopt the person who secures 11,000 votes becomes the sole representative of that constituency although there were 19,000 votes cast against him.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, speaking at a Fianna Fáil convention in Sligo, on the 6th April said:</P>
    <P>The only thing that could be said against that system, which he called a straightforward system, was that a person could be elected without getting a majority.  Say that one person got 40 per cent. of the votes, another 35 per cent. and another 25 per cent.  The person who got the <Col N="1363" /> 40 per cent. of the votes would be elected even though the combined vote of the others was greater.  Why should they add the 35 per cent. and the 25 per cent. together when it is quite possible that the views of the persons casting these votes would be more opposed to each other fundamentally than to the person who got the 40 per cent.?  If the views of these people were taken it is quite possible that they would rather vote for the person who got the 40 per cent. of the votes.</P>
    <P>That is what we have been telling the Government for the past three or four months.  Under the present system the views of the people casting the 35 per cent. and the 25 per cent. of the votes are taken into account.  You have the people who go out first.  The No. 2 preference votes of these people is taken into account and, in a general election, you are able to ascertain with absolute accuracy what the people who voted for the person getting 25 per cent. of the votes thought of the other two candidates in the field.  The Taoiseach need have no doubt that, in that way, the views of the people as expressed in their second preferences will be counted and become effective.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil argue that the emphasis should be on effective Government rather than fair representation.  As I understand their argument they think the important thing is that you should have what they call effective government and I think what they mean is strong government and that that is of greater importance than the question of fair representation in Parliament.  I want to pose this query to the Deputies opposite: is it possible to have effective government if you do not have fair representation?  Is it possible for a government to be effective in the full and true meaning of that word if that Government is not backed by a fairly representative Parliament, a Parliament which fairly represents the people?</P>
    <P>Many better men than I shall ever be on both sides of this House fought and a number of them died so that we could have in this country of ours <Col N="1364" /> a Parliament which would fairly represent the Irish people, that we would have an Irish Parliament into which the Irish people could elect their representatives in a fair and equitable manner.  Before we achieved that we had a Government in Ireland, a strong government for 700 years. The only thing about it was that it was not an Irish Government elected by a fairly represented and representative Irish Parliament.</P>
    <P>We must look very closely at this argument about effective government and while we may feel embarrassed at producing an argument that appears to be emotional or sentimental I do not think we should disregard the sufferings and the sacrifices of those who went before us to establish an Irish Parliament that would be fairly representative of the Irish people and would give and Irish Government that would be drawn from the representatives of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Defence, using an argument with regard to votes wasted under the present system of election.  We should record and note the fact that under the British system of election every vote cast for a candidate who is not successful is a wasted vote and plays no part, good, bad or indifferent, in the affairs of the Parliament or in electing a government. It is possible under the British system of election for a person to go right through his adult life voting in election after election without his vote ever playing the smallest part in the affairs of Parliament or of the Government of that country.  In some of these constituencies where you have either a Labour or a Conservative seat you may have elections which are merely token elections, and the voter who votes for the candidate who does not succeed can go right through his adult life casting his vote and never having a person elected from his Party to represent him in Parliament.</P>
    <P>Under our system here by reason of the fact that you have more than one seat per constituency we ensure that does not happen and that in this country the minority views will be represented and expressed in Parliament. In the illustration I gave some minutes <Col N="1365" /> ago, of a contest where one candidate gets 11,000 votes, another 10,000 and another 9,000, is taken, I believe it is not possible for the person elected under those conditions to go inside Leinster House and fairly claim to represent all the people in his constituency. It is ludicrous to put up that kind of argument.</P>
    <P>Take this example.  You can have a situation where a Government, let us say a Fianna Fáil Government, go into an election with a wage-freezing policy and a standstill order behind them, and that will continue to be their policy.  You may have that policy opposed by the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, and there are three candidates in a single seat constituency. That may be the sole issue in the election: yet by dint of getting one vote more than any other candidate the Fianna Fáil candidate supporting a standstill wages order can go in as the representative of that constituency although there might be nearly twice as many votes cast against him and against that policy.</P>
    <P>That can happen under the British system which Fianna Fáil are asking us to adopt and every vote cast for the candidates who do not get in is a wasted vote.  Under the British system, the so-called straightforward system of voting, you also have the possibility, and I think the probability in the course of time, of safe seats arising. You have it everywhere you have that system of voting in operation.  You certainly have it in the North of Ireland and in Great Britain.  The development of the safe seats means that you will have a situation where perhaps over vast areas of territory there will be no election at all.  There will be no contest at all, election after election, and whole belts of country may be completely disfranchised as has occurred in the North.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have pointed out some of the other dangers of the change.  The Minister for Health seems to throw down a challenge that the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition should be dealt with on the basis of producing arguments that there would be economic, social and political questions involved.  I <Col N="1366" /> think he conceded that so far as the political questions were concerned, they were involved.  Other speakers have pointed out that six Senators representing the two universities, Dublin University and the National University, had, after an examination of this question, publicised their views.</P>
    <P>As an example of the type of consequence which it is suggested by this amendment should be examined by a Committee of the Dáil and Seanad it is worth while recording the various dangers they saw.  I wish to quote what these six Senators stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are convinced from our many investigations that the proposed change to the miscalled straight vote system would be disastrous on the following grounds:</P>
    <P>(1)  It would lead to an excessive Government majority with an Opposition almost as powerless as the present Opposition in the Six County Parliament.</P>
    <P>(2)  This would result in intolerant and dictatorial Government and might ultimately evoke as a reaction an organised extra-parliamentary Opposition.</P>
    <P>(3)  It would cause division and Party strife rather than a cooperative approach to our economic and national problems in the coming decade.</P>
    <P>(4)  The single seat constituency would inevitably narrow the voter's choice at elections and would greatly increase the power of political Parties as such.  This would undoubtedly lower the quality of Dáil representatives since unquestioning obedience to the Party leaders would then be the first demand made on any candidate.</P>
    <P>(5)  The proposed system sets the stage for class warfare between town and country and makes it possible for a majority to command 40 per cent in the urban constituencies and, getting little or no support in the rural areas, due to its deliberate anti-rural policy, to get a majority in Dáil Eireann.  Such a Party might have the support of as little as 25 per cent of the total electorate, and <Col N="1367" /> yet the miscalled straight vote system would enable it to impose its doctrines on the remaining 75 per cent of the population.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are five solid arguments produced after an examination by six individuals who, as Deputy Kyne said, could not by any stretch of the imagination be described as Party hacks.  University Senators elected by the University Graduates and drawn from different Universities are able to come together and pass that kind of judgment on the Government's proposal.  Surely the Government must feel that the time has come to think again about rushing headlong into a Referendum campaign at a cost of £80,000 or £100,000 to the people of this country?</P>
    <P>Those are some of the consequences which might result from the change the Government is proposing.  No one can see into the future and no one can be a prophet about this or any other matter of this sort.  But surely it will be recognised by everyone that the Leader of the Opposition is quite right when he condemns this move?  Because it is, in fact, inviting us to take a leap in the dark, to rush headlong into a change in our election system without knowing how it will work out.</P>
    <P>The University professors referred to the danger of lowering the standard of the type of Deputy elected if the change is brought about.  I have heard Fianna Fáil speakers&mdash;from the Tánaiste down, I think&mdash;recommending the Fianna Fáil proposal on the ground that it will give us a better type of Deputy.  I would give a lot to have been at the Fianna Fáil Party meeting when this change was urged on that particular ground.  I can imagine any Fianna Fáil Deputy you like to think of wandering into the Fianna Fáil Party Rooms and saying: &ldquo;Listen, boys, we had better get rid of P.R. so that we can get a better type of Deputy than we have in this room.&rdquo;  Even on that, I think it is purely a question of a leap in the dark; it is purely a question of guesswork.  My own guess is that you will probably have every Deputy who is in the Dáil at the <Col N="1368" /> moment contesting the next general election.  You will probably have many of them elected.  I do not believe that Fianna Fáil seriously contemplate that if they can get this change accepted by the people, they will drop any of the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; and replace them by a better type of Deputy.</P>
    <P>Are they serious in putting forward that argument?  If this change is accepted and if there is a particular type of development in this country, is it not very possible that you will limit your choice of candidate to two types: either the professional politician&mdash;the man who is in politics on a whole-time professional basis&mdash;or else the very wealthy man, the man who can afford to be in politics because he has the income or some source which would enable him to give his time to politics without having to concern himself with making a living?  Either of those developments is possible under the British system if it is accepted by the people here.  In any event, I do not see the validity of the type of argument which supposes that one Deputy, representing say 10,000 people, would be any better than three Deputies representing 30,000 people.</P>
    <P>I notice that those who spoke on this subject for the Fianna Fáil Party recently seem to have given up what the Leader of the Opposition described as the ransacking of libraries all over Europe to get arguments in favour of the change.  I notice they have given up referring to France, Germany, Italy and various other countries throughout the world.  It is about time they did that because it is important that we should remember we are dealing with Irish conditions, with an Irish electorate and with an Irish political system, and that many of the factors which apply to the larger European countries have no relevancy whatever to this country. Any politician of note in Ireland is as well known in Cork, Limerick or Galway as he is in Dublin.  You do not have the same growth of purely local or zonal Parties in this country as you have in the larger European countries and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that in Ireland&mdash;and I think one of the Fianna <Col N="1369" /> Fáil Ministers conceded it recently when speaking&mdash;we have not had the multiplicity of Parties which, it has been argued, is one of the outcomes of P.R.  There is a number of Parties here but there has not been any great multiplicity.  The principal Parties in this Assembly ever since it was established are still here: the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  By and large, that has been the pattern right down through the years ever since Fianna Fáil, as one of the major political Parties here, decided to come into the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fail have been basing their arguments principally, I think, on the fact that they dislike Coalition Governments, that P.R. has already resulted in Coalition Governments in this country and that each of those Coalition Governments replaced a Fianna Fáil Government.  I am not surprised that Fianna Fáil do not like Coalition Governments, but I think we have to go into the argument a little bit deeper than that.  I do not think it is necessary to argue on the merits or demerits of Coalition Governments at all.  As far as we on these benches are concerned, we are prepared to accept the Fianna Fáil challenge, no matter on what ground it is made. If they want to argue politically about the work and the achievements of the two inter-Party Governments in this country, we are prepared to meet them on that basis.</P>
    <P>I think we should go much deeper into the argument put up by Government speakers when they recommend the jettisoning of proportional representation because it leads to coalition governments.  Surely, if they think over that argument they will agree that it is essentially an arrogant, intolerant and entirely undemocratic type of argument.  I dislike Fianna Fáil Governments and, so far as I am concerned, I shall endeavour to persuade the people to share my dislike of them in the next general election but is not that a very far cry from saying that if I were in a position to do so I would be entitled to advise the people to legislate so as to make Fianna Fáil Governments impossible?  Yet, is not that what the present Government are <Col N="1370" /> doing?  Are they not saying we dislike coalition Governments and we are in a position now, because we have an over all majority, to steamroll a measure through the Dáil, to ride roughshod over the decision of the Seanad, to try to persuade the people to legislate&mdash;because that is what they are doing&mdash;to amend the Constitution so as to make coalition Governments more difficult if not impossible?</P>
    <P>Is there any democracy about that argument?  And is not that the principal argument that Fianna Fáil have produced in support of these proposals?  I hope there are some Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who will think over that argument and consider the full import and effect of it.  I am quite sure that it has not occurred to them that there is anything odd about the line of argument they have been pursuing but if they ponder on it they will find that there is a grave danger in that argument. They may find they are pursuing an argument which may some day boomerang very severely on their own Party.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil argued that proportional representation does not give stable government and that the British system does.  I think the validity of that argument can be called in question quite simply by looking at the records of Governments in this country since the State was established.  Those arguments are already on the records of the House and I do not want to repeat them at this hour.  I would urge, as did the Leader of the Opposition, that even now at the eleventh hour the Government should come to their senses. They should realise the gravity of the step they are taking and asking the people to take and they should consent even now to a proper examination of the proposal.  I am willing to wager anything I have that if any commission is established, even a commission drawn from this House and from the Seanad with a majority of Fianna Fáil members on it, you will not get any strong recommendation from any such body that these proposals should be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>Even if you did get a recommendation of that type would it not be <Col N="1371" /> worth while to get a thorough examination of the possible consequences in every field and in every direction of this radical and grave step which the Government are asking the people to take?  Is there any reason why the Government or any other Party in the House should hesitate to face an examination of that sort?  Why should they hesitate for a moment in bringing the results and the report of such an examination before the people?  It is not practical politics to expect the ordinary voters through the country to examine these matters for themselves. They have not the facilities nor have they the libraries of Europe at their command; they have not got the wealth of experience which would enable them to come to a clear and decisive judgment on these questions or even to understand fully what is involved in the Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Government should hesitate, if they believe in their case, if they believe the arguments are with them, if they believe that the arguments which they can adduce are so weighty as to carry influence outside of Party loyalties and considerations, to have a calm, considered and unprejudiced pronouncement on this matter.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by recommending to the Members opposite consideration of some advice given by the present Minister for Health some years ago when, I am sure, questions of the election system and P.R. were very far from his mind.  As reported in the Dublin <i>Evening Mail</i> of February 28th, 1949, when he was on the Opposition Benches here, under the heading, &ldquo;Mr. MacEntee on Public Morality&rdquo; under a sub-heading, &ldquo;Perverted Democracy&rdquo; the advice is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is natural, he continued, for a man to use his individual strength and resources to advance or protect what he regards as his own rights and possessions.  It is natural for the strong to use their strength to achieve their own purposes.  If, therefore, in a democracy the strong are called upon to renounce any resort to that force which is natural <Col N="1372" /> to them, then it is essential, in order that this renunciation may continue to be made willingly and permanently, that those who exercise power in the State in the name of the majority should act always with justice and fair play towards all sections of the people alike.</P>
    <P>If this condition is not observed then democracy will degenerate into tyranny exercised by a few in the name, but ultimately not with the consent, of the many.</P>
    <P>That is in fact what is happening in all those countries which have fallen under Communistic domination; countries where tyrants, by a perversion of democracy have created the very abomination of desolation, under which they deny their just due alike to God and man.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, we were to preserve our democratic system here it is imperative that those who exercise authority in the State should be balanced in their judgment and calm, considerate and unprejudiced in their public pronouncements.</P>
    <P>We appeal from these benches for the calm, considerate and balanced judgment of the Government, of the House and of the people on this question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker emphasised more than once that our people are an intelligent electorate.  If they are an intelligent electorate, as we on this side of the House agree that they are, why not give them an opportunity of deciding what to them is one of the most important issues that there can be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of election is enshrined in the Constitution.  A good deal of play has been made on that by Opposition speakers in so far as they tried to suggest that we considered P.R. such a perfect system that we enshrined it in the Constitution.  Deputies on the opposite side of the House know as well as we do that any electoral system that may be devised must be enshrined in the Constitution.  Otherwise, it would become the plaything of various political Parties and Governments who from time to time could make it an adaptable tool to suit their own needs. <Col N="1373" /> Any system must be enshrined in the Constitution so that the people will have the sole right to say whether or not they want a particular system. What we are doing now is merely giving the people an opportunity to decide whether they are satisfied with the present system or wish to adopt the system which we are putting before them.</P>
    <P>The people are a better tribunal, a better commission, than anything the Opposition have to propose.  The amendment proposes that this matter should be submitted to a commission who will tell the electorate what they should do.  If a small body is capable of giving a decision on such an important matter, surely the entire electorate are better qualified to do so.  We are simply giving the electorate the opportunity to decide.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition said here this evening that if the electoral system is changed now it can never be changed again.  There is a more serious issue than that.  If the system is not changed now, the possibility of changing it may never arise again.  If a number of Parties came into this House, a conglomeration of small Parties elected under P.R., owing their existence to P.R., none of them having an overall majority, no matter how corrupt the system may become under that conglomeration, they certainly will not abolish the system to which they owe their existence.  That is one of the main reasons why we are now in a position to give the people the right which is theirs, the right which is given to them under the Constitution, to make that decision now.</P>
    <P>The protracted debate in this House on this matter leads one to appreciate how impossible it would be to secure that opportunity for the people if the Party desiring to give the electorate the opportunity had not the necessary overall majority.  We are in a position now to see that the people get the right of deciding whether the existing system should be continued or not.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, we have an intelligent electorate.  If they are intelligent, they are competent to decide rather than leave the matter to a small commission selected from any section or interest <Col N="1374" /> of the people.  We are merely asking that the people be given that opportunity. So far, that opportunity has been denied them as far as it is humanly possible for the Opposition to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins alleges that P.R. is eminently suitable for this country. I do not know how anyone can claim that it is particularly suited to this country more than any other country. My opinion is that it is not suited to this country, that we have a tendency to create splinter Parties out of every little huff that may occur within a particular Party.  P.R. certainly tends to give support to that type of thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins gave the example of three candidates in a constituency, one of whom gets 11,000 votes, another 10,000 votes and the third 9,000 votes, the man who gets 11,000 being elected despite the fact that there were 19,000 votes cast against him.  They were not necessarily cast against him.  The Deputy has in mind a case where there are three candidates, two of them advocating diametrically opposed policies and coalescing after the election to form a Government, each of them putting his policy or programme, if he has any, in abeyance.  That sort of thing will not work under the straight vote system.  Why should it?  People will have to come together before an election and tell the people what their programme and policy is.  They will not be allowed to present themselves under various guises for the purpose of collecting votes and then coming together when the election is over.  That is what Deputy O'Higgins had in mind when he pointed out that a person can be elected with a minority of votes.  If we are to base our arguments on election monstrosities of that type, we could point out hundreds of them under the P.R. system, particularly in by-elections, as has been referred to here frequently.  The system which he describes would certainly not be anything worse than in a by-election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where a candidate can be elected with a minority of the votes, and has been frequently, under P.R.  That type of <Col N="1375" /> argument certainly does not hold water and will not sway anyone.  All Deputies have been elected under P.R. and the chances are that most of us will be elected under either system again.  Why should we do like the last speaker did&mdash;tell the electorate what they must do?  It is the people who tell us how they will have their representatives elected.  We are merely giving them the opportunity of doing that.  We came in here under the P.R. system.  If there is one thing that has been established during this protracted debate it is the fact that the straight vote system gives stability in Government.  While the P.R. system, on the admission of the Opposition, throws up Coalitions.</P>

      <P>Whether the number of constituencies increases or decreases is governed by population trends.  If the argument is that a representative with an over-all majority is not representative in the true sense in a House comprising 150 or 160 representatives, all elected with over-all majorities to represent their own <Col N="1377" /> constituencies, if that is the argument which will prevail in the Opposition campaign, I do not think we have anything to fear with regard to the result of the referendum.</P>

      <P>We are giving the people that opportunity.  I know the decision they will take, and nothing that has been said in this debate will in any way influence anybody in favour of what the Opposition maintains.  It is only natural that a particular section of the Opposition should be in favour of the continuation of P.R.  Fine Gael must have completely despaired of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for the Party system.  I have yet to meet a Party that would go out to the people and tell them that a Party system was a bad thing and ask them not to vote for Party candidates.  The ambition of every Party is to become sufficiently large to get control of Government. Every Party is delighted if it can double or treble its strength in an election.  We are told by the Opposition that the ideal is multiplicity of Parties until every faction and every fraction and every pressure group has representation here.  That is, according to the <Col N="1378" /> Opposition, the ideal type of Government; the more factions represented here the better the Government will be. That is a silly argument.  I do not profess like the last speaker to tell the people what is right and what is good for them.  We will leave it to the people to decide.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to cover all the ground that has been covered so often already. We have had reiteration of points and arguments flogged all over the House for weeks.  It all boils down to a simple argument in the end: the P.R. system favours multiplicity of Parties and consequently Coalition Government, which is synonymous with weak Government, and the straight vote system favours stability&mdash;stability being regarded by the Opposition as strong Government.  If the people decide in favour of P.R. then they want frequently recurring elections.  If they do that, they will decide in favour of a situation in which a small Party of two or three can overthrow the Government overnight.  On the other hand, do the people want Government which will continue in office for the full statutory period?</P>
    <P>That is the issue purely and simply. It does not in any way infringe on the democratic rights and liberties of the people.  It does not interfere in any way with the institutions of the State. The only thing it does is to ensure that we shall have strong government instead of the mixture of Parties we have had in the past.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we want to change this system because we were piqued over the two Coalition Governments. We were not piqued.  I remember when the second Coalition Government took office.  I said&mdash;I was speaking from those benches over there&mdash; that it was the best thing that had ever happened Fianna Fáil because the people never knew what was in the system until they tried it.  I was confident that, in a very short time, we would be back on the other side of the House with a bigger majority than we ever had in the past.  One did not have to be a prophet to see that.  One could easily see the impossibility of such a Government carrying on when one saw <Col N="1379" /> the incompatibility of the Parties which formed that Government.</P>
    <P>The electorate are being asked to continue a system which allows that sort of thing.  We have never seen Coalition Governments at their worst in this country.  It has always been the case of the largest Party in the House versus all the others.  That is the system we have had.  I think it was good enough but if we had a system where every Party in the House was prepared to coalesce, could you visualise what the situation would be then? What type of Opposition could you have then?  You would have absolutely none.</P>

There is no better manner of protecting democracy than by giving to the people a system of voting whereby they will be assured of reasonable stability in government.  I am not pretending that the straight system of voting guarantees stability on every occasion but we are certain that it is more likely to give stable Government than the present system.</P>

      <P>The only other allegation made, which does not stand up to argument, was that small Parties would not get a show under the straight vote system and that it would be difficult to bring a Party along. Sinn Féin developed a Party in 1918 under a straight vote system although Deputy Lynch has said that they did not get a fair majority.  Any Party can come along under the straight vote system, provided they are a genuine Party with a genuine programme.  We were accused of being &ldquo;huffed&rdquo; when we were put out by the Coalition.  We were not.</P>

      <P>We were satisfied on that occasion that it gave us a new lease of life in Fianna Fáil and that it would give the public time to see the defects of the Coaltion.  I remember a Party being defeated in this House and they did not take it too well.  I remember an occasion when a Party was defeated here and we almost had a second Germany.  Any Party seeking office here should be <Col N="1381" /> prepared to leave office when defeated and allow other people to take over. On one occasion a Party went at the telephone poles with cross-cuts and cut them down.  We are quite prepared to take a seat on the opposite side of the House any time the people think that we should be there, and I am quite confident that we could come back again.</P>
      <P>We are accused of working for the straight vote system because it suits our Party.  That is because we have faith in the future of our Party.  It is not because we despair of the future. We are asking that the people be given an opportunity to decide what the Deputies opposite say is an important issue.  It is the people who are to decide.  Let us not keep the issue unnecessarily from them any longer. Give them the opportunity to decide; they are the real tribunal to decide such an issue.</P>

      <P>If the speaker who has just concluded is so confident that the Fianna Fáil Party could put its record before the people at any time, surely there should be no occasion for the change that it is proposed to make. If they are so confident of their policies and have such confidence in their Party, they should be assured of remaining in Government for a long time.  This question arises from the fact that the Taoiseach, in the first instance, decided that he would change the system.  He then got his Party unanimously to agree that it was a wise and desirable thing to do despite the fact that for 40 years the people of this country have known no other system of election.</P>
      <P>We are now told that it is desirable that they should change it because the proposed change, which is now being called a straight vote, would give the people better service by representatives from the individual constituencies, by the Parliament to which they were elected under the system or the Government that will arise from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been accused of holding up this measure and a suggestion has also been advanced here that the people do not understand the P.R. system.  Now <Col N="1382" /> suddenly they have become wise, and in a short space of time will be able to understand the various changes that are to take place in the electoral system, and they will vote wisely in the future.  There was no demand of any kind for this change Nobody demanded it.  Various elections took place even since the Taoiseach and his Party left office in 1948 after a long spell in power.  We did not hear any mention whatsoever of the dangers then arising or the change that was to take place.  Much discussion has already taken place on the merits of P.R. as against the straight vote.  The question of representation of the people is being weighed against stability of Government.  Deputy Brennan said, a moment ago, that the electorate are intelligent and that, therefore, this matter can be left to them, at this stage.  Surely the electorate are entitled to be informed of the position by the Government Party and the representatives of the various Parties and to have the arguments put before them before we ask them to change the existing system.  It is not a question of doubting the intelligence of the electorate but of informing them on the merits and demerits of the two systems.</P>
    <P>Under the present system the number of Deputies in each constituency ranges more or less from three to five; even in the smallest constituency, it is possible for a substantial minority to secure representation in Parliament and elect a spokesman to speak for them here.  If Parliament means anything, if the people who rule have any rights, it is because they are ruling the country for the people, by the people and every substantial element in the country have a right to put their views here in this Parliament.</P>
    <P>Again, there is no necessity to take this argument into the realm of heat or passion.  There is no necessity to revert to what happened in the past. We have had almost 40 years of self-government and we should look at the system from the point of view: &ldquo;Is this system of Government which has been exercised since this State was established as good a system as, for instance, the system the northern counties have enjoyed since P.R. was taken from them in 1927?&rdquo;  Let us <Col N="1383" /> take the two ends of our country.  Has not the form of Government here been stable?  Has it not been just as stable as the Government in the Six Counties with the important difference here that minorities have been able to exercise their right of sending representatives here, whereas in the other part of the country a minority has not been able fully to exercise the rights it should have?</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes that a commission of inquiry be set up to weigh the arguments for and against. After a time we could obtain, and the people could be given, the considered opinion of that commission.  It is futile for anybody to say: &ldquo;Leave it to the people.&rdquo;  Members on this side of the House have been accused of not understanding the system by which they are elected here.  That was said when a previous stage of the Bill was before the House.  The suggestion was thrown across the House that Deputies themselves do not understand how they are elected, but, even if they do not, at least they were sent here by people who knew which Deputy or which Party they wanted to send here, and who knew the Government they wanted for the time being.</P>
    <P>Evidently on this question of the dislike of Coalitions, as Deputy M.J. O'Higgins pointed out the argument is &mdash;and I quote him&mdash;&ldquo;arrogant and undemocratic&rdquo;.  I have heard criticism, on another occasion, that under the single vote in the single member constituency the good Deputy or the good candidate will be elected.  I pose this question: if in the 150 constituencies, or the 147 or 140 constituencies, the good candidate beats the Party candidate where then are coalitions?  That stable government is necessary is an argument which I think has been overused in this House inasmuch as I do not agree that there have been unstable Governments here at any time.  Perhaps the Coalitions have not been liked&mdash; they are even called Coalitions, and we continue to call them Coalitions, but they are as entitled to be called Governments as any Government that has ruled in this country.  They were not Coalitions in the sense suggested <Col N="1384" /> by Deputies opposite.  They were the Government of the country, elected by the members of the House who, in turn, were elected by the people, and the people approved of that when the issue was put to them in 1954.  They endorsed that system and returned again an alternative Government to the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was before the Seanad and in this House before we had quite an amount of digression, but it is not fair to say that this taking apart and examination of the measure, and pointing out of what may happen, and the danger if the people should be persuaded to make this change, which have caused what I may call, fear or heat, is holding up the Bill here, and is keeping from the people something which they have a right to decide.  We all know that the people have the right to decide this issue.  Nobody disputes that, but the people are entitled to hear the pros and cons of any measure that is being presented to them by the Legislature.</P>
    <P>The various arguments put up in the House represented the views of the various Parties in it.  It might be said that in the Seanad some speakers put the Party viewpoint forward, but there was also the vocational viewpoint put forward in that House.  It is most important for the country to realise that at the present time those who could not be classed as politicians saw a danger in this measure, so far as the people were concerned.  They were not speaking as Party spokesmen.  They were representatives elected by the universities of this country, which are not dependent on the suffrage of the people in that sense.  They brought to bear on this measure the knowledge which they had gained from having studied the laws of the straight vote system operating abroad, and comparing them with the laws regulating the system in this country as they have operated up to the present.</P>
    <P>The criticism offered cannot be classed otherwise than as intelligent criticism.  It certainly cannot be classed as Party criticism, or criticism from the point of view of Party preference. Despite the fact that some people seem to think that the sooner we place this measure before the people the <Col N="1385" /> better it will be, there is a certain amount of uneasiness for the simple reason that the people are still confused. They are being asked to accept the straight vote system instead of the P.R. system.  Instead of putting it to them in that form, it would be fairer to say to them that they are being asked to decide whether they want to retain the system which they have had, and under which they have voted for so many years.  Practically everybody in this country, under the age of 61 or 62 years, has voted under no other system, and the young people who have become eligible to vote within the last ten or 15 years have been using the present system intelligently.  There is no doubt about that.  They have been using the system intelligently and the figures are there to show that the amount of illiteracy is negligible.  It is very much lower than in other countries which vote under the straight vote system.  Any Deputy who has contested a three-seat constituency, with one or two other candidates from his own Party, knows that the voters exercised the transfer of preference votes intelligently.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this is something which transcends politics.  It is something that will affect the lives of the people in this country, not alone in this generation, but in the next generation. I think any Deputy would be less than truthful if he did not answer the question: if the change were made and if you had a Dáil elected under the straight vote system, would that Dáil be likely to give freely back to the people the system they now have, if the people thought that the P.R. system would suit them better?  It is fallacious at the present time to say that the opportunity could never occur again.  The Fine Gael Party is being taunted that they must have no confidence in themselves, but surely it must be Fianna Fáil who have no confidence in themselves if they think they would not have the opportunity of introducing this change again, or bringing such a Bill before the House again?  It is they who have no confidence in themselves.</P>
    <P>The change in the system of voting would lead to the people being given <Col N="1386" /> only one choice.  I mentioned before, and I make no apology for mentioning it again, that I do not agree that the person elected with 40 per cent. of the votes in a constituency, or even less than that, could be said to be truly representative to speak for the people in his constituency.  There is no use in saying that the other 35 per cent. or 30 per cent. might be going left or going right because it is assumed that the individual with 40 per cent. of the votes is the middle of the road man.</P>
    <P>We believe that the proposed change will not give the people a better type of representative but will give them a less representative Deputy to plead their interests in the House, and we believe it will not give the people the improvement which the Fianna Fáil spokemen say it will.  It will not do anything to solve the problems which we have and, if anything, in its own way it will lead to more intolerance.</P>

      <P>Much play has been made about the Constitution and its sanctity.  We are told that every line of the 1937 Constitution is so sacred now that nobody can interfere with it, one way or another.  I am a long time in this House and I can remember the activities which surrounded the enactment of that Constitution in 1937.  Is there any Deputy on the opposite side who did not speak at every cross-roads possible, bawling, shouting and screaming about the terrible thing that Constitution would be and how it would ruin the country?  Is this not the same old thing over again and is it not the same old theme?  There is not a single Deputy on that side of the House who fought to prevent that Republican Constitution being brought in who will not be out at the cross-roads during the next seven weeks endeavouring to ensure that the people will keep the P.R. system of voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is not a decision on P.R. because no line in that Constitution could be changed without a direct appeal to the people of the country. It is the people who have to decide the matter and not the members of the Dáil.  I cannot see what objection or what dread the Deputies over on that side of the House have in regard to <Col N="1387" /> leaving the people to decide this question.  Everything that one could possibly think of was dragged into the debate.  We were told about a leading article in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  What is the leader writer in any paper?  He is only one man working for hire, nothing more and nothing less.  If he writes well enough he will help to sell the paper, therefore he has to write things which he thinks will most please.</P>
    <P>We had quotations here, quotation after quotation, from Deputy O'Higgins, of what this person said, what that person said and what the other person said.  Is Deputy J.A. Costello not entitled to change his mind?  Is Deputy Dillon, who said that P.R. was the production of a bunch of half lunatics, not entitled to change his mind now?  Will he not be going around during the next few weeks saying that this production of a bunch of half lunatics is something that should be retained for the safety of the Irish people?  Is that not what Deputy Costello, who condemned P.R. with bell, book and candle, is doing?</P>

      <P>I cannot see what objection Deputies have to the straight vote system.  If you wanted proportional representation properly carried out you would need to have a ten-seat constituency and not a three-seat constituency. If you want to have minorities properly represented, you will need to have the constituencies sufficiently large so that every minority can get in.  What is going to happen then?  Why were the constituencies cut down to three-seat constituencies? I remember in 1954 when our standing was at a very low ebb I had the honour of representing the only constituency in the Twenty-Six Counties which brought in an extra man to this House.  How was it done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> I remember when my colleague over there, Deputy Barry, headed the poll.  I remember Deputy P.J. O'Gorman coming along and cheering. He came over and said: &ldquo;We have done a wonderful thing.  We have dethroned the king&rdquo;&mdash;meaning that I had lost my position at the top of the poll.  I told him in very plain language: &ldquo;I am pleased, Paddy, at any time to change the top of the ladder for the two rungs nearest the top, if that means two places for my Party.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">

      <P>My job was to get two men in and I did it.  I was the only person in the Twenty-Six Counties who did it.  What happened afterwards? Deputy Moher beat Deputy P.J. O'Gorman by 19 votes and those 19 votes&mdash;which were third and fourth preference votes&mdash;decided what Government would be here for the next five years.  That is the way it works. Then you have the system of the straight vote being worked by every big Party to-day in any constituency. You will not see them coming down to Cobh and putting up two men for Fine Gael, or two men up for Fianna Fáil.  They go to one end of the constituency for one man and to the other end of the constituency for the other man.</P>

      <P>This is what has caused a lot of the annoyance which we find here.

I have been studying this matter for a long time and, in fact, at one time I examined my conscience because I found myself following the same viewpoint of Deputy Dillon and I decided that proportional representation had been brought in by a crowd of half lunatics.  The closer you examine it, the more you see that you are going to have far better representation under the straight vote system because the man who is elected in a single-seat constituency has got to work or otherwise he will go out, no matter what Party he belongs to.  No Deputy will tell me that if a candidate under the present system does not pull the bulk of the votes from within 15 to 20 miles radius of his own home, he will be elected.</P>
