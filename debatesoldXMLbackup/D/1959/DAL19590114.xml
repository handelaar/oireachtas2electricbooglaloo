    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state under what circumstances it is intended to hold the proposed referendum on the abolition of P.R. and the election for the Presidency on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (thar cheann on Taoisigh) Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (thar cheann on Taoisigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The period within which the poll at the referendum may be held is governed by the Referendum Act, 1942, by the date on which the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill will be passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and by such considerations as the fact that the new Register of Electors will come into operation on the 15th April and that, this year, Easter Sunday falls on the 29th March. Taking all these into account, if the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is not passed or deemed to have been passed until after the first week in March, polling could not be held earlier than about the end of May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The polling day for the Presidential election is determined by the provisions of the Constitution, of the Presidential Elections Act, 1937, and of the Order to be made under that Act by the Minister for Local Government.  If the ministerial Order were made on the earliest possible date, that is, on the 25th April, 1959, <Col N="442" /> it is likely, judging from what happened in 1952, that the latest date for receiving nominations would be fixed at or about the 16th May, 1959, and that the polling date would be fixed at or about the 10th June, 1959.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that circumstances could arise in which the two polls would fall to be taken about the same time.  In such circumstances, the interests of public convenience and of economy would obviously be served best by holding the two polls on the same day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, which boils down to the main point that the two elections need not be held on the same day&mdash;&ldquo;they may be held about the same time&rdquo; were the words used in the answer&mdash;and in view of the fact that the Taoiseach said it is most undesirable that these two very important issues should be confused, and in view of the Taoiseach's very recent decision to stand for election himself and his special position in the country, will he take steps to see that, no matter how close the two dates should be, the two elections are held on different dates, as they are two matters of particular importance?  The question of P.R. is of supreme importance and should not be confused with the question of the Presidential election which is not related to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I would prefer that these two were not held on the same day, although there can be separate ballot papers and there are only two questions to be answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It is not that it would be altogether undesirable that it should happen, but I myself would certainly have preferred to avoid it.  When <Col N="443" /> I was speaking in September about that, I did not anticipate that we were going to have the lengthy discussions here that we have had, but if circumstances are such as to bring these two pollings close together, the public convenience will have to be considered. The expense will also have to be considered, but the expense is the less important of the two.  I did not arrange the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say what is the urgency about the amendment of the Constitution, that it could not be held in 1960?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes, this year, 1959. It must take place this year.  Whether the Constitution (Amendment) Bill is passed or not, such revision must take place, in respect of the existing legal position.  Did I understand the Taoiseach's Parliamentary Secretary to say that there must be a period of approximately ten weeks between the passage of the Bill by both Houses of the Oireachtas, say, in the first week of March, and the holding of the referendum in the last week of May&mdash; approximately ten weeks?  Did I correctly understand the answer to that effect?</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply of 29th October, 1958 to a similar question by Deputy Rooney, it is not possible to state how many of the total insured population are actually in insurable employment at any particular date.  Particulars of the numbers of persons in insurable employment are, however, available in the form of estimates based on insurance stamps sold, or issued to employer depositors.  Thus the average number of stamps sold per week in a year provides an estimate of the average number of persons in insurable employment throughout that year.</P>
      <P>For the years ended 31st March from 1954 to 1958 the estimates of the average number of persons in insurable employment each week were as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> These estimates relate to financial years in order to eliminate any possible effect of the lack of coincidence between the period of employment and the purchase of the insurance stamps.</P>
    <P>Owing to the changes introduced by the Social Welfare Act 1952 it is not possible to produce comparable figures for earlier years.  It has, however, been estimated that for the calendar year 1951 the estimated average weekly number of persons at work insured under the National Health Insurance Acts was 498,900 and under the Unemployment Insurance Acts was 369,700.  The legislative changes also made it impossible to produce such estimates for the year 1952.</P>

      <P>As regards (a) of the Deputy's question, there are many cereals and cereal products which may or may not be used for human consumption.  It is not in general possible to distinguish the different uses of these products and the total amount spent on imported cereals for human consumption cannot therefore be given.  For the 12 months ended 31st October, 1958, it can, however, be stated that the total imports classified as cereals and cereal products [excluding seeds for sowing and feeding stuffs for animals (except unmilled cereals)] were valued at £4,802,464, of which £4,305,357 was in respect of cereals, unmilled (except seeds for sowing), £63,470 in respect of cereals milled, £291,527 in respect of cereal products and £142,110 in respect of cereal starches for use as food.  As regards (b), (c), (d) and (e) the furnishing of the available information would disclose particulars of the activities of an individual concern obtained under the Statistics Act, 1926, and this is prohibited by the provisions of the Act.</P>

The information which the Deputy seeks is contained in the agreement which I have executed with the oil interests concerned, copies of which are being laid on the table of the House to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licensee under the agreement is Ambassador Irish Oil, Limited, a company registered in Ireland.  The company is not at present engaged in the <Col N="451" /> business of oil production but Ambassador Oil Corporation, which is a company incorporated in the U.S.A. and which will be closely associated with the operations of the licensee, has oil producing properties in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska and North Dakota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, can the Minister say now, in connection with the agreement he has made with the American group, whether, if it is not possible to grant a licence to explore to an Irish group, it would be possible to have them associated with the American group so that legitimate Irish interests may participate in exploring for oil in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what the earnestness of the Irish group may be in that respect, the Minister is the dispenser of the licence.  If the Minister would make it clear to the American group that a legitimate Irish interest or interests should be permitted to participate in the search for oil here, it would, of course, have a profound effect on the results of any such negotiations between an Irish and American group.  Will the Minister endeavour at least to hold the door open for the participation of an Irish group or groups with the Americans in the exploration for oil here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the Deputy's question is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be useful to take this opportunity to warn against unjustifiable optimism concerning the possibility of discovering oil and natural gas deposits in Ireland.  We have fairly extensive rock formations of a kind associated elsewhere with oil deposits but the consensus of informed opinion is that the expectation of discovering oil here in quantities which can be exploited economically, must be regarded as slight.  Up to the present there has been no attempt to explore for oil in this country by geophysical methods or by drilling.  While, therefore, it would be unwise to exaggerate the prospects of discovering oil, nevertheless, new information is constantly becoming available concerning the geological conditions in which oil can be found, and it is to be hoped that the comprehensive programme of exploration which will be undertaken under the terms of the oil agreement <Col N="454" /> will lead to a definite conclusion one way or another.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to <Col N="455" /> take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>Verolme United Shipyards, an important Dutch shipbuilding concern, have taken over Cork Dockyard, Limited, Rushbrooke, which they propose to develop into a major ship-repairing and shipbuilding yard capable of handling vessels of large tonnages. The directorate of the company will be the concern of the promoters of the project.</P>
      <P>No amounts have been provided by the State directly.  The Industrial Credit Company, Limited, is the State sponsored body concerned with the financial arrangements relating to the project.  It is not the practice of the Industrial Credit Company to publish details of agreements made between them and individual industrial promoters. Deputies will, however, have seen the Press reports of Mr. Verolme's statement regarding his agreement with the credit company.</P>

Is the Minister further aware that there are rumours going around as to the very small amount of capital having been put up by any of these promoters and that is is desirable that these rumours should be dispelled by the facts being published, if, in fact, the position is that they have put up any finance?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether a patient who has been incapacitated by tuberculosis and has subsequently responded to treatment, but who is still handicapped as a direct result of his infection, as in chest cases with bronchitis with or without bronchiectasis, cor pulmonale, etc., and consequently is deemed unfit for work, qualifies for a continuance of the tuberculosis domiciliary allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to the cash allowance payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1952, by health authorities to persons suffering or suspected to be suffering from certain specified infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, who would otherwise be unable to maintain themselves and their dependents, if any, while undergoing treatment.  Section 44 of the Health Act, 1947, under which these regulations were made, empowers a health authority to pay the allowance only during the period when the beneficiary is undergoing treatment for a specified infectious disease to the satisfaction of the chief medical officer of the health authority.  Payment of the allowance ceases when the beneficiary is no longer regarded as being under treatment for active infectious disease and after a reasonable period of convalescence has been allowed by the chief medical officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of an infectious diseases maintenance allowance is to assist financially a person in necessitous circumstances, while he is undergoing <Col N="458" /> treatment for an infectious disease. As I have explained, however, the allowance is not payable indefinitely but if such a person on reaching the stage when he is no longer eligible, on medical grounds, for an infectious diseases maintenance allowance, is so handicapped as a result of his infection as to be unable to maintain himself, he may qualify for an allowance under the Disabled Persons (Maintenance Allowances) Regulations, 1954.</P>
    <P>Under the latter regulations a maintenance allowance, at a rate not exceeding £1 per week, may be paid to chronically disabled persons over 16 years of age who are unable to provide for their own maintenance and whose near relatives are unable to provide maintenance for them.</P>

      <P>The figures mentioned by the Deputy refer to global issues from the Exchequer to the Local Loans Fund which, together with the fund's other resources, were utilised to make issues to local authorities and for other purposes. They do not refer to issues from the Local Loans Fund which amounted to £4,739,000 for the period 1st April to 31st December, 1958, and to £8,608,000 for the period 1st April to 31st December, 1957.  The decline is due mainly to reduced borrowing by housing authorities.  As there are some 125 borrowing authorities (including corporations, county councils, urban district councils, harbour commissioners, public assistance authorities, etc.) and issues are made under different heads, it would not be possible without very considerable expenditure of time and labour to extract separate figures of issues to the different local bodies and I hope the Deputy will not press for these details.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will refer to my reply to a similar question on the 26th November last he will see that I indicated that it was probable that the Second Conference on the Law of the Sea to discuss this matter would be held in the coming summer.  This was the date adopted by the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations but the plenary meeting of the assembly adopted an amendment, which the Irish delegation opposed, to defer the second conference until the spring of 1960.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary for me to stress again the desirability that any extension of territorial seas or exclusive fishery limits should be achieved in the context of what is acceptable internationally rather than by unilateral action.  The system of drawing straight base lines from which to measure the breadth of those limits was, however, adopted at the Geneva Conference last year and reduced to a Convention now signed by 44 States.</P>
      <P>The system of straight base lines has been under active consideration with a view to its application to the Irish coast, and I propose to introduce a Bill to deal with the matter at the earliest practicable date.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported last night, I was speaking about the Taoiseach and the time &ldquo;when boyhood's fire was in his blood&rdquo; and when he made certain statements. What I was coming to at that time was, that there is nobody in this House or in the political history of the whole world who has changed his mind so often and so quickly as the Taoiseach.  He has done it all his life and he has done it again, as they used to say of Steve Donoghue.  I was saying <Col N="491" /> last night that the Taoiseach, then Mr. de Valera, said at Ennis in May, 1927: &ldquo;We will never&rdquo;; in May, 1927, at Tralee: &ldquo;We cannot&rdquo;; in May, 1927: &ldquo;We will never&rdquo;; in June: &ldquo;You will be down in your graves before you see me do it&rdquo;; on June 3rd: &ldquo;I will never&rdquo;; on June 5th at Galway: &ldquo;I will never&rdquo; and on August 11th, he did it.</P>
      <P>He repeated himself when he let us know in this House that he was not a candidate for the Presidency and now he is.  I do not think that anybody in the Fianna Fáil Party or anybody on the Government Benches could say to anybody over here: &ldquo;You said such and such a thing at such and such a time but you did&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall.  This measure is being discussed at length and the Taoiseach is impatient.  He said that early on in Question Time.  That was why he has to have the two things on the one day.  He was always impatient with opposition.</P>
      <P>We claim that the object of this legislation is to leave the government of this country as a legacy to the Fianna Fáil Party.  That has been proved to-day by the action taken by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  During the recent general election, there was never a word about this to the people: it was never made an issue.  In the course of this debate, the Taoiseach said that one of the main reasons for bringing in this measure is to ensure that there will be no small Parties in this House.  Their view is that there <Col N="492" /> should not be any small Party in this House.  The Taoiseach said that people are inclined to form small Parties and to promise anything.  He said there was a danger that small Parties would lead the country astray with promises.  The last election has shown that a large Party is a better hand at doing all that.  It is regrettable that though the Government have now been in office for two years, this House has so far produced nothing that could employ a man or stop a man from emigrating.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health, yesterday evening, in his gibing way, made great play with my having been defeated at the polls in Waterford.  I was defeated and I was defeated many times in regard to many things in Waterford, but I could take my beating there and when I won I could win gracefully.</P>
      <P>I avail of this opportunity to point out to the House the effects of P.R. in an election that took place not so long ago in this country.  Two candidates were comfortably elected in a three-seat constituency and two other candidates were left, one of whom had polled 5,489 votes on the first count and the other 5,971 votes.  It came to the last count.  Here was a man who had held this seat for a long time and his fate was in the balance.  He took it in a crying, a cringing and a weeping way.  The final result was that this man got 6,391 votes and his opponent got 6,273 votes.  The man to whom I am referring had plus 201: he won by 118 and, on the last count, he had plus 201 votes from the transfers of a Fine Gael candidate.  That man is the present Minister for Health and the election was the 1954 election.  I have been a long time in politics in Waterford and we have been able to take our defeats.  We will be able to take them again, if they come.  Furthermore, we will be able to take our victories, but we will not gibe at our opponents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another object, we are told, which the Taoiseach has in mind is a stronger Government.  The reason I oppose this section and the whole Bill is that we must oppose it at every turn.  We must say what we can say about it so that everything we say will be made known to the <Col N="493" /> people, because this is the only way we have to make it known to the people.  I had not time to elaborate on it last evening.  The people on the Opposition Benches are not the owners of three tied newspapers&mdash; three newspapers that can rewrite speeches that are made even in this House.  Therefore, it is important that what is to be said about this Bill by the members of the Opposition should be said in this House.</P>
    <P>P.R. is supposed to be no good, even though it was enshrined in the Constitution which we are now celebrating. We must examine the figures. As I said yesterday evening, I do not intend to go to Africa or Sweden or far-away countries for my examples. I shall rest nearer home.  I shall examine the results in various places and show how enormous blocs of voters were in fact disfranchised for years.  In 1924, in the southern counties of England, the Conservatives polled 1,500,000 votes and got 81 seats, while Liberals and Labour polled 922,000 votes, nearly 1,000,000 votes, and got only one seat.  There is your straight non-transferable vote.</P>
    <P>In the 1933 election in this country, Fianna Fáil and Labour together polled 770,000 votes and got 85 seats while Cumann na nGaedheal polled 615,000 votes and got 68 seats.  In the first place, it was a seat for every 9,070 of the population and in the second place, it was a seat for every 9,049.  Will anybody promoting this Bill produce as good an example of the operation of the straight vote?</P>
    <P>Did anybody in this House or in the country ever think that a Party here would actually be proposing in Dáil Éireann the introduction of the same system of election as they have in the Six Counties?  What I cannot understand about this Bill is the way the Fianna Fáil Party have actually walked out on it.  Even during the speech of the Minister for Health, there were only two members of the Fianna Fáil Party behind him and we over here had to demand a count.</P>
    <P>This is the most serious step taken in this country in my lifetime.  We have had a tried and safe way of electing a Dáil.  The Taoiseach who, <Col N="494" /> in my opinion, is the father and mother of this whole business, wants to have a change for the purpose I mentioned, in order to leave the government of this country as a legacy to the hierarchy of his Party. For the past eight or ten years, they had no knowledge of it, but the very moment he said he intended to put this legislation through, everybody over there said: &ldquo;That is all right.&rdquo; I have an idea that perhaps there are misgivings over there, that they do not like to see their mascot going away.  Of course, he has not gone yet.  He is only a candidate for the Presidency and &ldquo;the best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The system we have is a good system and a tried system and we are going to experiment with a system that has not been tried here since native government was set up.  I am convinced the people will reject this proposal when they are given the opportunity.  I am glad I can come here and have my say about it.  I am glad we have been given the opportunity of saying it and that we have won the opportunity of saying it.  I do hope that when this is put before the people to make their decision, the matter of the Presidential election will not cloud the issue.  I have an idea that may happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past day or so during this debate, a good deal has been said about and quoted from writings concerning the system of election in other countries.  The Governments of countries are formed and elected to meet the needs and aspirations of those countries and it would be well for us, when considering the effects of the methods of electing a Government and what Governments in various other countries have achieved, to pay attention to the fact that what may be good for another country in given <Col N="495" /> circumstances may not prove equally good for our own.</P>
      <P>We should realise that the aspirations and needs of our own country can best be judged by ourselves who are conversant with them and who have lived within the State.  I would suggest the ordinary individual in this country is better suited to give a view as to what is the best method of electing his Government and as to who should form that Government than many learned writers or professors viewing Ireland from outside and through foreign eyes.  I admit it would be very foolish not to take heed of or profit by the mistakes of others, but in doing so, we should not accept as gospel that because either a policy or a system has not proved adequate to the needs of another country it could not be adopted and adjusted to suit the needs of our own.</P>
      <P>I suggest it is useless trying to draw conclusions either from the system of government, or the method by which Governments are selected in a country, or countries, that have secured and enjoyed both political and economic security, while it is well known that we, after 37 years of Government, have not yet secured one or the other, but are still actively engaged in endeavouring to secure the unity of our country, both politically and economically. How could it possibly be suggested that the system of government which works so well in a different country could be made to suit the needs of a country aspiring as we do to complete freedom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an old saying that it is a bad time to change horses when you are crossing a stream.  I should imagine that in this time of economic difficulties, in this time of huge emigration, it is very bad policy to suggest to the people that they should divert their endeavours from the economic needs of the country and finding the economic solution thereof, to contemplation of what system of election we should now have.  Consideration and thought on that question should be left, I believe, to the time when this country is basking in the sunshine of prosperity and economic <Col N="496" /> well-being, and should not be undertaken at a period when each and every one is struggling, and struggling hard, to keep his head above water in the economic depression that is thrust upon us.</P>
    <P>The Government arguments for the abolition of P.R. and the promotion of single seat constituencies are based on a very simple point.  In the main, they say that single seat constituencies and election by the straight vote promotes stable government.  Stable government is necessary for the prosperity of the country and because of that, because of the fact that on two occasions the Fianna Fáil Government were put out by a combination of various other Parties, elected by the votes of the people, Fianna Fáil suggest that that should never be allowed to happen again, and that a Government, strong in power, strong in numbers must now be forced upon the people so that stable government will ensue.</P>
    <P>If it is carefully examined, the history of this State since 1922 does not bear out the suggestion that the Governments which have been formed ana which have governed during the period 1922 to 1959, have been anything other than strong Governments. We had the Cumann na nGaedheal Government from 1922 to 1932.  A Government that survived a civil war, that established a police force, that brought this country to a high standard of efficiency in all departments, had to be a strong Government.  In 1932 and right up to 1947&mdash;and they could have continued for a longer period&mdash;we had a Fianna Fáil Government continuously in office.</P>
    <P>These two Governments were elected under the form of voting known as P.R. but, notwithstanding that, they were enabled to continue in Government for longer periods, taking one election following another, than the British Governments of that time which were elected under the straight vote.  Even the present Government, elected just over a year ago under the P.R. system, is one of the strongest Governments, numerically speaking at any rate, this country could hope to enjoy, unless it is hoped, as I believe <Col N="497" /> it is, that under the straight vote, Fianna Fáil will be returned in such numbers that the Opposition will be merely a shadow, or an insignificant number of five or six Deputies.</P>
    <P>To my mind, if there is any argument to condemn the system of straight voting, it is the suggestion that stronger government, or stronger parliamentary overall majority than at present enjoyed by this Government, is needed in this country.  If it is the suggestion of Fianna Fáil that prosperity can follow only by depriving minority groups of their right of representation in Dáil Éireann, then I suggest that they are making an excellent case for dictatorship, that they are making an excellent case for the system of government as advocated behind the Iron Curtain, where your choice is either take what is put up to you or take no Government at all.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Deputies that the fact that P.R. is the guarantee of the rights of minorities is the reason why we in Dáil Éireann should vote against this proposal.  It is quite true that the ultimate decision will lie with the people, but we are well aware that the public can be fooled some of the time.  The public can be gulled by false promises; they can be fooled by election speeches; and it is only when the irrevocable has happened that they find they have cut a stick to beat themselves.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is very little use in pleading with the Government in power at present for a change in their proposals.  I am aware that it has been suggested by them that if constructive amendments were put to the Bill, they would receive consideration, but it has been made clear here in speeches that we fear to attempt to amend this Bill because of the fact that any honest attempt would be defeated by the overwhelming numbers of the opposite side, and would give countenance to the suggestion that this was a Bill which had some merit in it, and which, by some slight amendment, might be considered as being useful legislation; whereas in our hearts we know it is but an attempt to take advantage of the position in the country at the present <Col N="498" /> moment to change the system, to change even the Constitution, so that a particular Party may get into power and, when in power, remain there for an indefinite period.</P>
    <P>One of the evils of P.R.; as set out-by the Government, is that it promotes and encourages the formation of small groups; that these groups can join together and unite on a common programme to form a Government, and so put out of office one bigger Party which is smaller than the united groups together, such as happened in 1948 and later in 1954; but I wonder what is wrong with inter-Party Government?  What is wrong with Coalition Government?  Is inter-Party Government, Coalition Government, of itself, an evil?  Is it wrong that two or three interests, say, farming, workers and industrialists, should combine together, map out a programme in the national interest and agree to advance gradually towards their own individual objectives, while all the time subordinating the Party interests to the national good?  Is there anything wrong in that aspiration? Is there anything wrong in permitting groups of politicians to carry out that type of programme?</P>
    <P>I know it is suggested that human nature, prejudices and small hatreds will cause them to dissolve; the same can be said of many Governments formed even by a single Party.  Within the ranks, seeds of discontent can grow up, splinter groups can break away and Governments can fall.  It is notable that in many countries faced with the emergency of war, or faced with any national danger, the call usually goes out for the formation of a national Government, an appeal made to the better instincts of the politicians to drop their Party advancement and to unite in a common effort to face whatever danger is threatening.  That was particularly true of our neighbour, Great Britain, during the periods of two world wars.</P>
    <P>Why is it so wrong that the various groups who formed the inter-Party Government on the last two occasions, who combined in what they believed to be the common interest&mdash;that of keeping Fianna Fáil from a dictatorship&mdash;<Col N="499" /> should have united together to form a Government and to advance this country on lines in which they believed?  I think it was the Minister for Health who indicated yesterday that even assuming the referendum was passed, there was nothing to prevent Parties making arrangements between themselves as to what constituencies they should contest and thereby defeating the advantages claimed for straight voting.  The only difference, he said, was that they would have to announce this before the election.  If the advantages of straight voting can so simply be defeated by an arrangement between various Parties in advance, then the advantages appear to lose a lot of the good that is claimed for them.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that, irrespective of what way groups of people are elected to Parliament, provided the electors elect them in nearly equal groups of numbers, you can nearly always have inter-Party, or Coalition Governments.  I see no reason why the straight vote, in the period of time to come, may still not throw up to us an inter-Party Government, unless, of course, in the first instance, the Government elected under it will take care, by gerrymandering, that no such thing can happen.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the security and permanency of Governments where the straightforward vote is operating, but I have noticed a great reluctance on the part of the Government to give us as an instance the fact that our six northern counties are governed under that system of election and that it is under that system of election that a minority of our Nationalists are deprived of their rightful representation.  Are we being encouraged to follow that system? Does the Government agree with this system that can hold in subjection a group of Nationalists in the North and keep them to a minimum of representation in Parliament?</P>
    <P>Surely it is not proposed that the abolition of P.R. would deprive the minority groups of people in this country of any rights at all?  I believe that far from being inspired by any wish to improve Government <Col N="500" /> here, the Fianna Fáil Party looked upon the results of the last two inter-Party elections and decided that in future, with the likelihood of their leader.  Deputy de Valera, aspiring to higher office, and being deprived of that leadership and the certain glamour that has been woven around his name, and being the largest Party but having a smaller vote than the combined votes for the other Parties, by means of the single non-transferable vote, in the single-seat constituency, to get a strangle-hold in the next election and to use that period in office to make sure that practically all parliamentary opposition was wiped out.  Acting as they have done in the past, by putting Party before national interest, they are using their position now as a strong Government to force through this referendum with the support of their leader fighting a corresponding battle for the Presidential seat, and so making doubly sure that the spoils of office will remain with them in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take up the last speaker on the statement he made that Fianna Fáil were anxious to put the Party before the national interest.  The Deputy should have remembered, if he thought about it at all, that Fianna Fáil always put the national interest before the Party interest and that our history in this House has always been that the national interest was put before the Party interest.  At no time during the history of Fianna Fáil did we jeopardise the national interest by following a policy of expediency. One of the reasons we are introducing this Bill is that we are putting the national interest before the interest of our own Party and that we have had experience over the years of what instability meant to economic and political interests.  Because we have had that experience, we have decided to change our minds.  It is only a fool who would not change his mind in the light of greater experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had experience of an inter-party Government which completely collapsed in 1957; we saw the <Col N="501" /> economic interests of our nation brought to a low ebb as a result of inter-Party Government.  We have decided now to put national interests before the interests of our own Party and that is why we have introduced this measure.  If the nation is to prosper, the first thing we must do is bring about stability.  In doing that, we shall bring about progress and the confidence which breeds prosperity. That is one reason why we are making this stand and supporting this Bill.</P>
    <P>No member of the Opposition can prophesy that they will not form the Government in the next election.  To say that Fianna Fáil will be here for ever is &ldquo;codology&rdquo;.  No candidate can say before the election that he or she will head the poll, nor can any Party make such a prophecy.  Yet members of the Opposition have stated here that Fianna Fáil want a dictatorship. We do not; we only want to try to create a state of affairs which will bring economic stability and give employment to the people, create conditions in which we can improve our export trade and raise our standard of living in every way possible.  Everybody knows what happened in the inter-Party days.  I was in opposition then.  I shall take one example&mdash;the building trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I am not allowed to develop the point I wanted to make, I shall return to the point with which I began.  We in Fianna Fáil believe it is in the interests of the nation to make a change at this period. We succeeded in getting into office on this occasion and we want to make sure that stable Governments will exist in the future, no matter what Party is in power.  We want to ensure that at least they will have some programme to put forward before an election and that, if they do win, they will win the election on the programme they put before the people and on their economic and national policies.  No matter how the Opposition may try to distort our intentions, we are only trying to ensure that this country will make progress and be prosperous and that we will not have chaos again.  We want stability so that any Government elected here in the future will be able to carry out its policy and inspire confidence in the people as a whole.  We have a long way to go before we reach the prosperity I have often wished for. I see no chance of achieving it, unless we secure stability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that any thinking man who has the interests of the country at heart will say to himself: &ldquo;I am going to vote for stability and progress and in the interests of the country.&rdquo; I believe the people will <Col N="503" /> vote for the referendum that we in Fianna Fáil hope to put before them. We hope the people will adopt what we suggest and do what we believe is in the national interest.</P>

      <P>Let us not lose sight of the fact that one of the main purposes behind the introduction of this Bill is to divert the minds of the people from the fact that the hoardings of the city and of this country at large were plastered with placards by the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&ldquo;Women of Ireland: Vote Fianna Fáil and We Will Get Jobs for Your Husbands.&rdquo; Other placards said: &ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil.  Help Us to Beat the Crisis and Stop Emigration.&rdquo; Since Fianna Fáil came into office, the husbands of the women who voted for them on that undertaking are forgotten and 60,000 people per annum are emigrating.  All the brouhaha of the past month is ardently and eagerly fomented by the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The promises made do not arise on this sub-section.  I have already pointed out to Deputy Burke that it would be irrelevant to discuss the economic situation and if Deputy Burke was precluded from proceeding along those lines, I cannot see how Deputy Dillon may embark on such a discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We can turn then to stability.  There is a strange tendency in the world in which we live, that is, to take a word of generally accepted meaning and to start applying a special significance to it.  That practice is not peculiar to this country. In any normal society, if you asked <Col N="504" /> the people to judge a political system by the criterion of stability and you told them that in the previous 35 years, there had been only three prime ministers, the people would say: &ldquo;Well, that system must be one of the most stable political systems in the world, not to speak of Europe.&rdquo; But that is not what Fianna Fáil mean by stability.  What Fianna Fáil mean by an absence of stability is not that Fianna Fáil ever have been defeated but that de Valera has been defeated or could have been defeated under the system; and if that possibility was proved by the event to have existed, that in itself is self-evidence of the absence of stability, which the people have a duty to remedy at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>I do not know if Deputies recall that the more extreme and violent a Communist dictatorship becomes in the world, the more eager it is to describe itself as a democracy.  The Chinese are angry if anyone refers to the &ldquo;Chinese Government&rdquo;.  You must refer to it as the &ldquo;Democratic Government of the Chinese People&rdquo;. The West German Government is quite content to call itself the &ldquo;West German Government&rdquo;, but the East German Government must be referred to in all diplomatic correspondence as the &ldquo;Democratic Government of Eastern Germany&rdquo;.  We are reaching the stage in this country that the word &ldquo;stability&rdquo; means that whomsoever de Valera names shall be Taoiseach of Ireland, and if that criterion is not observed, then we have instability and, if necessary, revolutionary measures must be taken to change the situation.</P>
      <P>The great danger of a protracted discussion of this kind is that we shall lose sight of the fundamentals.  The fundamental purpose of the Government in introducing this measure, and in turning their three kept newspapers &mdash;the three &ldquo;Pravdas&rdquo; of Fianna Fáil &mdash;to the propaganda campaign, is to wipe out the Labour Party, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta and the Independents.  They say openly and avowedly that such people have no place in this Parliament and that we ought so to rig the situation so that they will not be able to get in here again.</P>

      <P>It is now impossible to get a Nationalist candidate to present himself in County Antrim.  According to Deputy Ó Briain's definition, that is evidence of the fact that there are no Nationalists in Antrim.  That is the mentality behind the Fianna Fáil plan here: get rid of the minorities.</P>
      <P>I want to seek to recall their own minds to their own history.  There was a time when the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs were themselves the leaders of a &ldquo;splinter&rdquo;. I remember 1927, and I remember the time when the attitude of the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs was that they would not come into Dáil Éireann.  They fought election after election on that issue, and then they changed their minds. Remember, at that time we had a Constitution which could be altered by Act of this Dáil.  If Mr. W.T. Cosgrave, the then President of the Executive Council, wanted to take up the position that the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs have taken up to-day, in one day, he could have passed an Act of Parliament in this country which would have slammed the door on the present Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that had been done, they would not have come in here.  They came in here because they said to their then supporters: &ldquo;Our present policy of maintaining the civil war situation is no longer practicable.&rdquo; If Deputy Cosgrave of that day had legislated to slam the door of Dáil Éireann in the face of what was then a minority, where would that minority have gone? Would they have gone the same road as they went before and simply said: &ldquo;If we will not be allowed to enter Parliament and take our part there, <Col N="506" /> there is nothing left to us but to carry on by the method we have tried to operate heretofore&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>It was the statesmanship; it was the wisdom; it was the forbearance; it was the democracy of the then President of the Executive Council that dragged them into Dáil Éireann, that taught them the elements of parliamentary procedure, that trained them to be one day capable of forming a Government.  I ask Deputies now: who did the greatest service to Ireland&mdash;the man who seeks to slam the doors of Dáil Éireann to-day in the face of minorities or the man who, commanding an absolute majority in this House, not only forced those doors open but dragged Fianna Fáil in through them? He was called by those Fianna Fáil Deputies, whom he drew into those benches, a traitor, a hangman and every foul expletive they could apply to him and he bore it all with patience.</P>
    <P>In the kind of democracy we mean on this side of the Iron Curtain, the real test of its genuineness is not the 99.9 per cent. vote.  It is: How solicitous is the Government representative of the majority for the rights of the minority?  By that test, the Government which brought Fianna Fáil into this House can claim a high testimonial from the kind of democracy that we in Ireland believe in, and even if they purchased that at a great price to themselves, they conferred on the country to which they were responsible an infinite benefit.</P>
    <P>I detest the things for which the Fianna Fáil Party stand.  I hate their addiction to corruption and their addiction to trampling on their opposition. I hate their skilled machine for jobbery.  But I would definitely sooner see them functioning here in this House as a Government or as an Opposition than wandering the hillsides in sporadic civil war.  I cheerfully pay the price of working here as a member of an Opposition in a minority rather than force them into the courses into which I am sincerely apprehensive their present policies may force others, if they persist in them.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies again to consider what the situation will be in this country if, by a radical change in our electoral system, we make it impossible <Col N="507" /> for the voice of organised labour to be heard in this House, if we make it impossible for those who represent Clann na Poblachta, for those who represent Clann na Talmhan, and for those who represent Sinn Féin to be heard in this House.  Is it not one of the keystones of our position, is it not one of the unanswerable alibis for the democracy of this State, which we may yet have to produce before the International Court at Strasbourg, that there are in fact in this House four seats held by Sinn Féin Deputies, who will not come in and take them because they prefer to claim for themselves rights which no democratic Government can concede to a minority and they therefore reject the opportunity given to them to come in here and participate in a Parliament to which they have been elected under the law?  Is that not one of the great props of our entire position in this delicate situation in which we are obliged to justify before the world our detaining in the Curragh 100 or 150 men without trial of any sort, kind or description?</P>

      <P>Because, Sir, it is the fact that the doors of Dáil Éireann are open to them that gives our Government the moral right to stand over that position.  But, if this Bill is passed and if the people vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum, these four men will not have seats in this House, will not be able to get them and will be in the position wherein they can say: &ldquo;We will not be let come into Parliament; the parliamentary system has been so rigged that it is impossible for a minority to get its voice heard in Parliament.&rdquo; And they can point to the speeches made by Ministers desiring to create a situation in which such representation is impossible.</P>
      <P>Now, it is quite true that the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party is always mindful of the fact that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;... There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men <Col N="508" /> judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. Everyone sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the State to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Volume 171, column 1525 of the Official Report.  Now, Sir, had it been left to the Taoiseach to make the case for this Bill, he was full of nothing but the most impeccable democratic principles.  But when the crude hand of the Minister for External Affairs was thrust into the fray, supported by the even cruder foot of the Minister for Health, it began to emerge that there was only room for two Parties in this country.  Then the new recruit sprang into the battle: and, then, we really knew what were the secret thoughts in the couloir of Fianna Fáil because, having admitted that they hoped to see the Labour Party gone, the Clann na Poblachta Party gone, Clann na Talmhan and the Independents eliminated, it was left to the Minister for Local Government to add: &ldquo;And when we get this through, Fine Gael has had it.&rdquo; And the wise old Prime Minister, the Machiavellian old operater said: &ldquo;Oh, my God! This has torn it.  Now you will have to publish something.  It does not matter what you publish.&rdquo; I can see the picture.  Deputy Blaney hurrying off to the skilful old operator, the Minister for Health: &ldquo;Tell me what to do, sir.&rdquo; And the Minister for Health saying: &ldquo;I have often had to do it before.  Do not worry.  The way you do it is this: you draft the letter and you bring it to the &lsquo;Old Man&rsquo;.  He is the best of them all.  He will yet it for you and, when that is done, you bring it back, but you do not write it.  You get your private secretary to write it and then, if you are proved a liar, the proof impinges on your private secretary.&rdquo;<Col N="509" /> The Minister's private secretary has told us that the Minister never said it.  That letter was published over a footnote to the effect that three independent Press representatives heard him say it.  I want to put another footnote: 20 members of the Fine Gael Party heard him say it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;For that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on.

      <P>And that distinguishes him from the Minister for Local Government.  Even though this debate has gone on for a considerable time, I venture to swear that in the eyes of most, the Taoiseach continues to look pious, honest, disinterested and, above <Col N="510" /> all, democratic and the prime apostle of what he means by stability.  I want to ask the House to remember, because I sometimes think that Deputies forget, the gravity of the work committed to our hands.  In the last analysis, the Ireland we know&mdash;that is, the conditions under which we live in Ireland&mdash;depends on us.  There are 147 of us and on what we do depends very largely the future of this country.</P>
      <P>I think there are too many people inside this House and outside it who forget that the price of individual liberty for everyone, from the humblest to the greatest citizen of this State, is the labour, the hard labour, of making parliamentary democracy work.  There is no disguising and there is no denying that there is no system of government more difficult to make work; and anybody who has occupied ministerial position and sat in the Front Bench while a Bill, or some other measure for which he was responsible, was being debated in all the tedium and all the exhaustion that can sometimes attend such proceedings in a parliamentary democracy, will realise how heavy a price is habitually paid in order to keep parliamentary democracy functioning in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is the system which guarantees the individual liberty of the harshest critic of Parliament as well as that of its most enthusiastic supporter and it is the system which preserves something which, once lost, is almost impossible to retrieve.  I do not think there is a country in the world at the present time which, having had what we have, lost it and has subsequently recovered it.  It is desperately easy to throw away, virtually impossible to recover, and I think it is fair to say its recovery must almost inevitably be attended by bloodshed, if the tyranny that supplants it is to be overthrown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember, its test, its hall mark and its essential quality&mdash;and I challenge any Deputy to deny this&mdash;is that parliamentary democracy is democracy only so long as the <Col N="511" /> Executive representative of the majority leans backwards to recognise the fundamental rights of minority. That is the test.  It would not matter if, under his system or any other system of voting, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael came in here with 130 supporters out of 147.  The real test of whether we were working a democratic system would be what was the position of the Opposition that confronted them; were they free; did the weight of the majority behind the Executive operate to destroy the fundamental liberties of the minority, however obscure?</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to think.  If you evolve under this referendum a system which will wipe all minorities out of this House and leave us with two monolithic blocks, what are the consequences here likely to be?  I ask them to remember that there are forces operating in the world in which we live to-day that did not operate 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 years ago and the fundamental purpose of those forces is to find muddy water either in this country or any other country in which they can profitably fish.</P>
    <P>Now, suppose you create in this country one, two, three, four or five minorities, united by only one common grievance, with nothing else in common between them but all labouring under the grievance that the doors of Parliament are closed against them, is it stretching the imagination too far to envisage the forces to which I refer, who seek for muddy water in which to fish, coming in and saying: &ldquo;Very well; there is a solution for your problem.  Here are four or five groups of people, all anxious to serve their country, all denied that chance. Agreed that there is wide difference of opinion between you as to how best to go about that service, but all desire to serve and all at least are united in one common grievance that the opportunity to serve in Parliament by the democratic method has been taken away.  There is a remedy for that and the remedy is a Popular Front and we will play our part in promoting such a front to break open the doors of Dáil Éireann for you.  Once there, let every man go his separate way, <Col N="512" /> but here the supreme purpose is to get back to Parliament.&rdquo; Is that something to be desired?</P>
    <P>I know there are critics at present of Parliament and consider the criticism that comes most readily to their lips&mdash;that there is no significant difference, according to them, between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  When they say that, what they mean is that neither Party of the bigger Parties in this House accept the materialistic philosophy and that, until there is a cleavage on that line, Parliament is not functioning properly in this country.  I reject that.  I suggest that one of the most precious things we have is that on certain fundamental principles there is no cleavage between any Party in this country&mdash;Deputy Browne's Party, Deputy Norton's Party, Deputy Blowick's Party, the Taoiseach's Party, or General Mulcahy's Party.  There are certain fundamentals that we all accept.  I think that is one of the glories of Dáil Éireann.  Am I unduly apprehensive if I see in this proposal of Fianna Fáil the possibility of creating a situation in which that position might be radically altered?  If we do that with our eyes open, we have done a great disservice to this State.</P>
    <P>Many people here are turning yearning eyes to England and saying: &ldquo;Look at the beautiful situation they have in England&rdquo;.  First, I want to emphasise that I do not think the system designed for British conditions or indeed the system designed for United States conditions necessarily suits Ireland and in our special circumstances I do not think either suits our conditions. Secondly, it is quite an illusory belief that the system obtaining in England has produced strong Governments of the Taoiseach's desire over the last century.  Over the last century, if you examine the historical record of the British House of Commons, you will find the Government represented there has for at least half, if not more than half the time, constituted a coalition.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the time there was a Liberal Government kept in office by the Irish vote and for part of the time there was a Tory Government put into office by the Irish vote and we put it in because it served the cause of <Col N="513" /> Ireland.  We were not interested in the internal domestic policies of Great Britain.  The Irish Party in the British House of Commons voted for whomever would serve Ireland and for long periods both the Tory Party and the Liberal Party held office in the British House of Commons as a result of the Irish vote, and without it they would not have constituted the Government at all.  They were, in fact, coalitions, and anything that this country got over those seven or eight decades was got from coalitions.  It is true that the Irish Party refused to participate in any of these British Governments because it was not their policy to do so, but the Governments would not have survived a day or an hour without their support.</P>
    <P>One needs to have a very close understanding of politics in the U.S.A. but, if anyone tells me that the Democratic Party of the U.S.A. is not one of the most astonishing coalitions that ever was put together, I refuse to believe him.  What there is in common between a democratic representative of the City of New York, the City of San Francisco or the City of Chicago and the democratic representative of Louisiana or Georgia, I fail to understand, but the coalition which operates is suited to the conditions obtaining in the U.S.A.  It would not operate in the conditions that obtain here but coalition it is.  Deputy Burke followed a certain line.  I should dearly love an opportunity to follow him in studying the records of coalitions and strong Fianna Fáil Government, but the terms of order preclude me.</P>
    <P>I want to ask this question: What has this proposal that we are now considering done to contribute to the stability of this country?  Conceive what is going to happen.  If you study the general election results in this country over the past 25 years, I think you will find that Fianna Fáil have never secured a clear majority.  Every Party in this house except Fianna Fáil is prepared to advise the people of this country to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; at this referendum.  I think the Fianna Fáil Party themselves realise they are going to be defeated in the referendum.  That is one of the reasons why the disappearance <Col N="514" /> of the Taoiseach has been ordained before his time.  He is to be thrown into the conflict in the hope that his person will contribute something to the total of votes procured at the referendum.  I think that is a miscalculation. I do not think it will have that result at all.</P>
    <P>Suppose at an unhappy hour that the people did not vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in this referendum.  Suppose they vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; by a majority of 50,000 or 60,000. What contribution to stability is it if you take from the people by a footling majority of that kind through the full blast of the propaganda the Fianna Fáil Party is in a position to deploy as a result of having three kept newspapers at their disposal, what contribution to stability in our society will it be if you take from a minority of 47 per cent. or 48 per cent. of the people or even, perhaps, 49 per cent. of the people that to which they attach supreme importance by a majority of 1 per cent., and all this for what purpose?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, contributing to the debate yesterday, said he is not opposed to the principle of P.R. at all. Then what divides us?  What is all the row about?  If we are agreed on that, we are willing and have been willing from the very first day to sit down with Fianna Fáil, Labour and everybody else and examine the present system of P.R. to see if any other system would work better.  The only principle upon which we are prepared to join issue in this matter is that you will not present the electorate with an electoral system which makes it impossible for minorites to get representation in this House.  I am perfectly certain that the members of the Labour Party and our Party are quite prepared to sit down with anybody and examine any desired amendment of the present system of P.R., if amendment be necessary, effectively to give effect to that principle and at the same time preserve stability in our political institutions.</P>
    <P>What a different situation would obtain if an amendment to the Constitution were proposed to the people by the unanimous resolution of this House! I do not suppose it is much use arguing.  The Taoiseach has now <Col N="515" /> vanished and has given up listening to the arguments.  I suppose that is a sort of preliminary abdication in favour of the Tánaiste.  Nobody in this House imagines that the Tánaiste is very much interested in the principles of democracy.  Nobody will regard him as being likely to lose any sleep at night, lest the rights of minorities be abridged.  That tough old warrior does not give two fiddle-de-dees whose rights are abridged so long as he comes out at the top of the heap.</P>
    <P>There was a while when the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Finance were trying feebly to give battle for the succession to the Taoiseach.  They have been put in their places, but in the net result the Tánaiste has come out on top. Does anybody imagine that he will champion the rights of democracy as defined by the test of how well the rights of minorities survive?  One feels somewhat frustrated then in addressing one's arguments to members of the Fianna Fáil Party who will vote as they are told, to a Minister for External Affairs who has avowedly lost in his contest for the leadership and succession to the Taoiseach, but still this is Parliament and so long as we can preserve the belief in ourselves and in the people that this Parliament is working, we will do our part.</P>
    <P>Let us not lose sight of this fundamental fact.  Parliament will function in Ireland so long as the people of Ireland are convinced that it is a Parliament.  No amount of stagecraft and no amount of play-acting in this Chamber will preserve the faith of our people in parliamentary democracy, the moment they make up their minds that minorities are here simply as exhibition pieces to cover up Party dictatorship.</P>
    <P>Our people can look round the world as well as the next.  They know what is called Parliament in Moscow, Pekin, Budapest, Prague and in Warsaw, perhaps.  They know how solicitously these institutions are described as the Parliaments of democracies, but they also know that they are not what we mean by Parliament <Col N="516" /> and democracy in Ireland.  We have got here working in Ireland something of which the people on all sides of the House should be infinitely proud.  After a stormy history and beginnings rooted in civil war, we have a true parliamentary democracy functioning in Dublin, into which any minority which can muster a quota of Irish voters behind it has the right of entry.  How long will the Irish people believe in Parliament if all minorities are swept away from the country and if there is no Labour Party, no Clann na Talmhan Party, no Independents and if nobody's voice is to be heard here who is not sponsored by a powerful political machine?</P>
    <P>That is the road to one Party Government.  God knows what will constitute that Party.  It may be Fianna Fáil.  It will not be Fine Gael for they do not want it.  We would not take it.  We would not act as Government in a Parliament from which minorities were excluded.  We want them in.  We find that we can work in Parliament better with them in, and we know by our experience with them in a Cabinet, that we can work with them.  In the benches of Dáil Éireann, some Independents may be tedious and exhausting, but they discharge a necessary function by bringing to the minds of Ministers and the Executive that no matter how the ultimate decision of the votes in this House may go, they have still in the country the right to be heard, and if they are displeased to make their displeasure felt.  They are an avenue and a channel that can be made to impinge harshly on the Executive and to leave the foundations of the State untouched.</P>
    <P>Are we walking the road now on which we will purchase immunity for the Executive from that kind of harassment at the cost of having the foundation on which Parliament itself stands undermined and eaten away? Here is the fundamental difference between us.  Here is the issue joined and I confidently await the verdict of our people on it.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil want all minorities swept out of Dáil Éireann; we want to see them with the right to come in. Fianna Fáil say they cannot work as the Government of this country if <Col N="517" /> minorities are here.  We say we can.  We did and we shall again. Fianna Fáil say that the hallmark of a democratic Government is the size of its majority; we say the hallmark of a democratic Government is the respect it shows for the fundamental rights of minorities.</P>
    <P>If we must, let the people pass their final verdict on that issue netly joined but it is a poor alternative to the right course which could, and should, put us in a position to offer to the people of this country an amendment, if amendment be necessary, to our present electoral system in the name of us all as representing our common judgment on something that would be of importance for every section of our community.  If that is not the way we go, then let us not face the people on the fraudulent representation presented by the Minister for External Affairs that this is a great national effort to shake off the cruel wrong imposed upon us by the British Government.</P>
    <P>Let us not follow the hopeful chimera of the Minister for Local Government, who thinks that at last Fianna Fáil can achieve, by subtlety and fraud, what they failed to do by force and violence in the past, and obliterate Fine Gael.  Let us not hope that the Parliament in Ireland can long survive as a truly democratic institution if the voice of minorities is no longer heard here, but let us ask our people in vindication of what is most precious to us&mdash;true democracy &mdash;to decree by their vote on this referendum, that so long as Ireland is Ireland, no minority will have a Fianna Fáil gag bound around its mouth by any Act of this Parliament or by any act of our people.</P>

      <P>What has transpired in the course of this debate which is now running in its sixth week clearly justifies the apprehensions we had that this Bill was highly dangerous and highly contentious.  It has been proved to be contentious by the acrimonious exchanges we have heard in the discussions on it.  It has tended to disturb considerably the political calm and the political reason that have been so much in evidence here in recent <Col N="518" /> years.  Whatever altruistic motives have inspired this Bill will be completely nullified by its after-effects if it is passed and P.R. is abolished.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House is a Bill to amend the Constitution and it will make possible the abolition of P.R. I believe the Constitution should only be changed as a matter of great national necessity and I do not believe the reasons given for this Bill can be claimed to be ones of great national necessity.  I do not think they are justifiable reasons for a change in our Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Constitution is the great charter of our democracy.  It is sacrosanct and should not be interfered with, except for the reasons I state.  We have had the system of P.R. for 37 years&mdash;a period long enough in which to examine its results.  Whatever the results obtained abroad are, there is no denying the fact that it has given magnificent results in this country.  It has survived a civil war and it has survived an economic war and all the turbulence associated with those episodes. It has survived all the political heat and political passion in the intervening years and right through those trying times, it gave us absolute continuity of Government and absolute stability of Government.  No greater case can be made for P.R. than those very facts.</P>
      <P>It is immaterial to us how P.R. works abroad.  We have to consider our own circumstances here and apply them as we did to P.R.  We are an island nation, a friendly homogeneous people, and no other system will ever give us the same results because I believe no people in the world have as much in common as we have.  We have no lordly wealthy people here commanding power and influence. Many of our people are self-employed. Many are small employers&mdash;middle-sized and large farmers and shopkeepers&mdash;and we are very interdependent. Because of that type of society, we have very much in common and certainly the system of P.R., the system that is now known to most of the present generation and the only system known to them, has given magnificent results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> P.R. helps very materially to blunt the edge of sharp political bitterness, as it has done in this country.  It has given a wide variety of representatives. It is the most perfect of all the democratic systems.  If two Parties are seeking election and if a well-known personality, under P.R., puts himself forward as a candidate, or is put up by a small group, the people will vote for him for his personal worth, his integrity or his national purpose.  No matter how Party affiliations compel them, no matter how they are tied by Party affiliations, they will consider supporting a man of standing.  I think that has fairly been demonstrated in this country.  Therefore, P.R. is valuable in the sense that it dissipates the political bitterness we have had in this country.</P>
    <P>P.R. was originally designed to safeguard the interests of minorities and I think it has done that fairly well.  We would be all the happier in the Twenty-Six Counties if we knew that, in the morning, P.R. operated equally well in the Six Counties.  I venture to say that, had we had P.R. in the Six Counties in the past 37 years, we would not have the trouble we have in the Six Counties to-day.  We would not have the sharp divisions we have in the Six Counties to-day.  I shall go further and state that, had we not had P.R. in this country, I doubt if we would have emerged as successfully and as readily into a State that is now peaceful and progressive.</P>
    <P>If the system of P.R. was held to be suitable in 1922, and again in 1937, it is surely more suited to our circumstances to-day because, in the interim, our people were organised along vocational lines&mdash;farmers, labour organisations and other vocational and social groups.  I do not think it is fair now, at this time of our history, to deny those groups the right to seek representation in this House in order to ventilate their grievances or propound their theories. Our ability to advance economically and our ability to survive as a nation is being challenged more and more <Col N="520" /> every day.  Is it not better for us to have the goodwill and the co-operation of all our citizens and all the groups which are formed by our citizens in order to withstand that challenge from abroad?  P.R. supplies the means because it helps towards co-operation and towards mutual understanding of our national problems.</P>
    <P>It has been asserted that the single-seat constituency destroys the proportionality of the P.R. electoral system. I am not an authority on that, but I do not see any reason why the Government, at the last moment, would not adopt the P.R. system, even in the single-seat constituencies that they are determined to create.</P>
    <P>Great Britain and the United States have been cited here as examples of progress because of the straight vote system, but these two powerful nations have Parties centuries old, Parties that have built up great power and influence. I am sure nobody in this House would like to see Parties built up on the same lines in this country. We know that in those countries these Parties wield great power and influence.  They often use that power in a very unscrupulous and ruthless fashion.  I do not think they are any example for us in this country or that there is anything in their example that we should follow.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the Referendum Bill will cost £80,000.  I believe that that is a very conservative figure.  What about the Amendment of the Constitution Bill which has been debated for the past six weeks and which this House has been called upon to debate now?  That Bill does not come before the House without heavy cost to the Irish nation.  The Deputies travel up here at the expense of the nation.  The sittings of this House are at the expense of the nation.  Furthermore, certain staffs have to be arranged or supplemented while the House is sitting, I presume.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am leading up to the cost of the Referendum Bill and <Col N="521" /> the cost of the Amendment of the Constitution Bill, added together. Then we have a further Bill following from the report of the constituency commission.  All these added costs will approximate nearer to £200,000 than to £80,000.  I question the morality of spending all that money at a time when the nation is in such economic circumstances, at a time when we have 80,000 unemployed, at a time when the Irish people are crying out for relief from the brutal taxation they have to bear year in, year out.</P>
      <P>We have been sent here to do the nation's work.  I do not think for one moment that this is work the people of this country want.  What they are concerned about most at this moment is how to eke out a livelihood for themselves and maintain their respective standards.  They are not interested in the system of election and, if it were changed in the morning, it would not make any difference to the economy of our country or the livelihoods of our people.</P>
      <P>In our circumstances to-day, I cannot see that this proposal will make any major change.  I believe it is a retrograde step.  I fear it will be a matter of national regret, another day, that this Bill ever saw the inside of this House.  We shall have this referendum Bill and the people will go out and vote at the referendum.  We have been told here that the decision will be left to the people outside.  I do not think the people are very interested and, in order to get them interested, we shall have all sorts of political pleas and all sorts of appeals to the people to go out and vote on this question that will be of no benefit whatever to them.</P>
      <P>On those grounds, I feel that this Bill has been brought in at a most inappropriate time.  It is a little disillusioning and disappointing to be presented with this Bill when we have so many vital problems facing us and I am convinced of the truth of the poet's assertion, &ldquo;Kathleen Ní Houlihan, your way is a thorny way.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <P>I have listened, like other Deputies, for the last six weeks to pathetic attempts from the far side <Col N="522" /> of the House to justify the introduction of this Bill.  It is very hard for the members on the Government side of the House to make a convincing case, when they are not convinced themselves. We in this House can even hear the rumblings and the grumblings of Fianna Fáil against the introduction of this measure.  Quite a number of them know that this is just a stick to beat themselves.  In various councils throughout the country, they did not even want to discuss it, so much do they feel that there is no necessity for it.  In County Roscommon, Fianna Fáil did not vote against P.R.</P>
      <P>The people cannot see the urgency for this measure.  They feel there are more important matters confronting this House.  This whim&mdash;because it can be described as nothing else&mdash;of the Taoiseach will cost the country the princely sum of over £100,000.  I say, while there is still time, let sanity prevail and let this Bill be withdrawn.  One would think this was an emergency measure when the House has to meet at this time of the year.</P>
      <P>During the past few weeks, I met a number of emigrants who were home on holidays and they asked me: &ldquo;What is being done up there to try to give us a livelihood in our own country?&rdquo; All I could say to them was: &ldquo;The Government are too busy raising hares to attend to such problems.&rdquo; This measure has been described as a red herring across the path.  I will go one further and describe it as a &ldquo;Moby Dick&rdquo;.  It is an admission on the Government's part that they are failing to deal with the problems that confront them.  The people to whom I was speaking have gone back to Birmingham and London without any hope.</P>
      <P>There is no public demand for the abolition of P.R.  Some time ago, I put down a question asking the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to grant a certain little thing that would have cost the country nothing, and the reply I received was: &ldquo;There is no public demand for this.&rdquo; Of course it is a different thing if the Taoiseach asks for something.  Then the public will be tumbling over one another looking for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputies <Col N="523" /> to the 1954 election in Galway City.  I was concerned in that election and I can assure the Deputies that there was no change in that election as far as Fine Gael went, but there was one change that hurt Fianna Fáil and I am proud to say I had the privilege of breaking the stranglehold that Fianna Fáil held in Galway City for 17 years.  Furthermore, in the last election we received an increased vote of 1,200.  Does that not confirm what I say?  I have no personal reason to fear the abolition of P.R.  Personal feelings should not come into this. Every man is entitled to stand for election and no one should take that right from the people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke on this matter at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis.  This is one of the places you can trot out the Party line because you have nothing but &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men there.  As I said, even the Party are not convinced of the need for this measure. On the opposite side, out of 77 Deputies, we have only four Deputies seated in those benches.  That is strong Government.  The Taoiseach said at the Árd-Fheis that this was going to be a difficult campaign.  The people would have to take off their coats and work hard, and that this was vital in the national interest. Emigrants I have met are prepared to take off their coats and work, but not do this sort of work.  They want the Taoiseach to carry out that promise he made on assuming office, that he would first deal with the twin problems of unemployment and emigration.</P>

      <P>I was sent here, as every other member was, to discuss these problems.  However, the Minister for External Affairs was speaking in Wexford one Sunday night.  He had another large audience of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men and he asked the people to use their constitutional right to change the system which has been a handicap to progress.  Do I take it that if P.R. is abolished we will have that progress, that the problems of unemployment and emigration will be solved?  It has been said it was a handicap to progress if you did not speak Irish. Many people are speaking Irish in Birmingham.</P>

      <P>After 36 years of the use of P.R., Fianna Fáil has discovered it to be a handicap to progress.  It is only an audience of Fianna Fáil &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men who swallow that sort of <i>ráiméis.</i>  They accepted P.R. as long as it suited them and if it suited them to-morrow morning, there would not be a word about its abolition.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence said that P.R. was imposed on us by the British. That was his reason for saying it should go.  The next thing he will be saying is that they have imposed their coinage on us.  There is not a Deputy who cannot pull the King's head out of his pocket, and none of them is throwing it away.  It is just moon talk.  I accuse the Taoiseach of trying to apply restrictive practices, in asking the people to divest themselves of these powers.  The people have given up enough of their powers, from Ministers to county managers, and now they are to be asked to divest themselves of the full use of voting powers, to suit the whim of the Taoiseach.  Let us have Government for the people and by the people.  Let us leave the people the full use of their powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the main street of this city, carved in granite and gilded in letters <Col N="525" /> of gold are the words: &ldquo;No man has a right to fix a boundary to the onward march of a nation.&rdquo; I should like the Taoiseach to take note of that and, instead of dealing with matters like this, deal with the boys leaving the North Wall every other night.</P>
    <P>This Bill is aimed at ousting the vocational groups.  I wonder if the Taoiseach or members of his Party read the articles in <i>The Standard.</i>  It might enlighten them as to what can happen.  I wonder why he is so consistently inconsistent.  Let him be a little consistent when it comes to the question of having condemned this in Northern Ireland and trying to impose it now in the Twenty-Six Counties. Of course, the Taoiseach is an old Rugby player.  It is a game I never played, but I often heard it said that you &ldquo;sell the dummy&rdquo;.  I should like to tell him that the people are not buying on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that he would deal with unemployment and emigration on assuming office.  I know this is out of order, but before he tries to take a run to the Park, let him first deal with the things for which he got into office and let him carry out the promises he made to the people.  Let him put the people to work.  &ldquo;Wives, put your husbands to work&rdquo; were his words then.  That is what is needed and not the proposals in this Bill which we have been discussing for the past six weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>When I listened to the Minister for External Affairs yesterday, he certainly did not refer to it at all.  When he supplied his speech to the <i>Sunday Press</i> last Sunday, he did not deal with any part of the Bill. I want to make it quite clear that I am totally against single member constituencies, in view of the size of our electorate.  It is inevitable that the division of the country into single member constituencies will make this Dáil an <Col N="526" /> urban Dáil.  Some people on the Government side of the House who have discussed the effect of the abolition of the multi-member constituency appear to think there will be constituencies where the vote will be in the region of 20,000.  Of course, that is nonsense. Any analysis of the returns in 1957 or 1954 makes it quite clear that the effective vote, if this sub-section is passed, will be in the region of 8,000. It is inevitable that, when constituencies are divided into single-seat areas, they will have as the greater part of that 8,000 votes, a very substantial urban vote in every constituency. A detailed examination makes it perfectly clear that the single-seat constituency here must be completely overshadowed by an urban area.</P>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs told us about Louth, that there would be North Louth, Mid-Louth and South Louth.  I will accept for the moment his description of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I said: &ldquo;If&rdquo;&mdash;if we have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from that that they were not so designated and coloured on the famous map produced to the meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party?  If we have those three, there will be in North Louth the rural area around Dundalk which will be completely deprived of rural representation here.  The town of Dundalk will outvote that rural area.  Again, in South Louth, the town of Drogheda will undoubtedly outvote the rural perimeter around it.  Even in the case of Mid-Louth, there will be towns such as Ardee with an entirely undue influence on what otherwise might be a rural constituency.  That is more or less bound to lead to the position in which the three Deputies sent up from those constituencies will be people who can sway urban votes, not rural votes.  At the present time, where there is a three-seat constituency like that, there is bound to be at least one-third, if not considerably more, where the vote is one which is swayed by rural considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took Louth because the Minister for External Affairs happens to be here.  I can see the same thing <Col N="527" /> happening in Kildare and in every constituency where I have looked at the figures and at the map of the electoral divisions.  Deputy Millar, for example, cannot possibly disagree with me when I say that in the area of East Galway, Ballinasloe will be able completely to sway the area around it which will be grouped with it as part of a single seat constituency and that it will be an urban vote which will have the influence in making the return there.  Does Deputy Donegan not agree that he will find in his constituency of North Cork the urban areas exercising much too predominant an influence in each of the three constituencies into which it would be divided, assuming that the divisions are kept more or less in the same way?</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher must agree that where you have Mitchelstown at one end of East Cork, Cobh at the other end and Fermoy in the middle, there will be an overwhelming influence of urbanisation, instead of the leavening &mdash;to put it at its mildest&mdash;of rural interest and rural Deputies which there should be in this House.  It sometimes can result, if the urban votes are to be the balancing factor in any particular single-seat constituency, that the Parties, when selecting their candidates, will turn to urban people, will select representatives &mdash; candidates &mdash; from the towns because they will have the major effect on the result of the election.  Any change in that way, any tendency towards depriving rural areas of representation, any change which would have the effect of giving the urban areas a greater influence in this House is, in my view, a retrograde step, and one to which we should not subscribe.</P>
    <P>It sometimes can result also that in the smaller area the power of the Party will be infinitely greater than it is in the multi-seat constituency.  There is some chance of a candidate in a multi-seat constituency being able to defy the Party machine and being selected as a Deputy for that constituency. There will be no chance whatever in single-seat constituencies of that happening, and the result of it <Col N="528" /> will be that the Party machine, and the Party bosses, will have an infinitely greater effect, and that it will be, very much more so than at present, the Party caucus that selects the Deputy who comes into this House rather than the people, the electorate as a whole.</P>
    <P>Some people spoke here as if there would be a wider circle of Deputies representing their constituents.  I do not consider that it is the job of a Deputy, or that it should be the aim of this House, to create a Deputy to be a post-boy for his constituents.  I believe that it is the job of a Deputy primarily to deal with the legislative matters that pass through this House, that come for consideration before this House, with the matters of general policy that come up for consideration here, and the matters of national policy that should be decided here.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that Deputies, where they see an injustice being perpetrated against one of their constituents, should not take up the cudgels on behalf of that constituent.  Of course Deputies should.  Of course it should be their duty to see that justice is done to all the people they represent, but the primary purpose of a Deputy is not to trot around to this Department and to that Department, to make representations on behalf of a constituent for something which is the constituent's right, because if it is his right, he should get it without any representations from anybody.  If we are to have, as Deputy Corry suggested here last night, merely a House full of people whose job it is to run around here and run around there, then we are not going to get the broad national problems considered here properly as they should be considered.</P>
    <P>With a single-seat constituency of the size that we will have, it is perfectly patent that the person who wants merely to deal with parochial pump matters will have an advantage, and a greater likelihood, of obtaining the Party selection rather than one who wants to deal with broad issues.  As I have already said, it is clear beyond question that it will be the Party convention, the Party caucus, that will select the new House, and that there <Col N="529" /> can be no possible breakaway, in a single-seat constituency, from the Party caucus.  It would be an entirely different situation, if we had here a population and a system under which we are to have perhaps 50,000 voters or so in a single-seat constituency, as they have in other places.  What is, or what could be a good system for constituencies of the 50,000 size, is totally unsuited to the constituency of the size we are to have here, where the vote will be 8,000-odd, taking the average of the last couple of elections.</P>
    <P>I cannot conceive of any genuine reason for the introduction of this Bill, and particularly this provision by the Government, except the fact that they wished to throw a smoke-screen over their failure, their abject failure, to fulfil any of their promises to the electorate on the last occasion, and any of their economic promises during the lifetime of the previous Dáil.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, too, it has been suggested during the course of the debate that the two-Party system that we see on the other side of the water has produced such a wonderful result there that it is for that reason we should take it and transfer it over here.  Quite accidentally, I happened to be reading a book that I did not even know dealt with this matter the other day, by a man who was a Member of Parliament in England for some considerable time, and who is now a well-known writer.  I think this quotation, albeit it is a little long, is worthy of being on the records of this House.</P>
    <P>From the chapter in which he deals with Parliament, he states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some people talk as if the two-Party system was a part of divine revelation&mdash;as if it was a law of God that there should be neither one Party nor three Parties, but always and only two.  To all suggestions for any toleration of a third Party they reply with the devastating and inevitable repartee of &lsquo;Look at France&rsquo;.  Yet, not only France but every parliamentary country on the Continent has more than two Parties, and in many of them parliamentary Government is <Col N="530" /> manifestly working much better than it is in this country at the present moment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, he was referring to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Indeed, in Britain, throughout vastly the greater part of our history, we have had more than two Parties.  So long as the British electorate appeared to want to have only two Parties it was fair enough to allow it to have its choice, but it is hardly possible to compel it to have only two Parties against its manifest and continuing will by means of an electoral system so unjust that the two Parties do almost everything short of actually stuffing the ballot boxes, in order to maintain their own monopoly.  We are told that a two-Party system gives us stable government.  This may be a solid advantage at a time when there is some great overriding issue, upon which every voter must take his stand on the one side or the other. But it is to little advantage merely to have the same Party in office over a number of years if it only maintains itself there by the most wild tergiversation from day to day, confident that, whatever it proposes, its supporters will obediently vote, even though the week before they voted the exact opposite. There is a continuity of faces. There is no continuity of policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that quotation from <i>Along the Road to Frome by Christopher Hollis,</i> at page 201, is a very striking commentary on the position on which we are asked to express an opinion at the moment.</P>
    <P>We are told that this single seat constituency is one of the things that will give us stable Government.  I do not believe it for a moment.  I am not in the least worried about the effect that a genuine system of election would have on the future of this Party.  I am distinctly worried with the facilities Fianna Fáil have in Government, that there will not be the genuine system of Government and I have no doubt whatsoever that, <Col N="531" /> in the words of Mr. Hollis, they will do everything possible even to stuffing the ballot boxes, if they think they will be able to do it, to make sure that any system they may propose may keep them further in office.  Regardless of what views I might have on the corruption of Fianna Fáil in that respect, it seems to me that even if a case could be made&mdash;which I think could not be made&mdash;for a reduction of our political system to make for a smaller number of Parties, if we were starting <i>ab initio,</i> there is no possible case to be made for a reduction at this stage of our national career.</P>
    <P>The inevitable effect of the passage of this Bill through the referendum, if it be passed and I do not think it will be&mdash;even with the old war horse himself coming out to try to carry it on his back&mdash;will be to create a spirit of unrest, a spirit of sourness which will do a great deal to prevent ordinary economic development, no matter who may be in Government, in the next few years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon reminded the Minister for External Affairs of the time when he had been out in the wilderness, keeping himself there deliberately, of his own volition; that he then repented of the error of his ways and that he came into this House.  Is it not far better that we should make it possible, and leave it possible&mdash; because it is possible at present&mdash;for those who likewise may be outside at this stage without any right or cause, to come into this House and to accept the democratic way of deciding what is best in the national interest?  Once this Bill is passed, if this referendum be passed, then it will undoubtedly be the law of the land and it will be a law of the land felt by many people to be so unjust that they will always have a feeling that one of the reasons it might have been passed was to prevent them getting that influence in the democratic procedure of Government.</P>
    <P>How can you have progress, if that is there?  Are you not bound to have turmoil below the surface which may effervesce and break out from time to <Col N="532" /> time?  Is it not far better, even if nothing else, that the assurance will be kept, so to speak, of being able to say to these people they have only to get a proportion of the votes in any constituency to be enabled to speak for that constituency in this House?  Is it not better that those on the extreme fringe&mdash;and let me say, in case anybody might misrepresent me, with whom I have no sympathy and from whom I differ categorically&mdash;should nevertheless have the right and the chance to come here in a multi-member constituency, to speak here and to advocate their views; to get, if they can, a majority to support them, rather than that the door should be slammed in their faces, which this proposal to create single seat constituencies will inevitably do?</P>
    <P>For those reasons, I want again to make it clear that I think the single-seat constituency will be quite disastrous in its effect on the interests of this country, with an electorate as small as it will be, about 8,000 casting votes in each constituency.  We are going to get the agricultural interests, on which the well-being of the country depends, swamped by the urban vote in every area.  It will be to the urban vote that the Party leaders can go when selecting their candidates.  The Party leaders will have greater power even than they have at present and it will be their caucus rather than the people who will have the selection of who will represent them in the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon talked about the civil war and attempted to draw us into an argument about the civil war and the history of that time and since, in order to avoid discussion. Deputy Dillon alluded to us as the civil war Party and others wanted to talk about economic measures in order to avoid discussing the particular issue of the single member constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> Deputy Sweetman, after cogitating for the last six weeks or two months, thinks he has an argument to put forward against single member constituencies and he disclosed it here to-night. His allegation is that if we set up single member constituencies, the urban community is bound to dominate the rural part of our people.  If we take Dublin City out of the population of the Twenty-Six Counties, we are left with the rest of the Twenty-Six Counties dominated by the agricultural community, because by far the great majority of the rest of the country are living in the countryside. Deputy Sweetman, however, by trying to make that case, that the minority would dominate the majority under the single member system, completely upset the argument that has been made by others of his Party and by members of the Labour Party for the past six or eight weeks, that the straight vote system would mean that minorities would have no rights and would get no representation.  Here we have Deputy Sweetman trying to make the claim that the urban minority will dominate the rural majority.  Which of them is right?</P>

      <P>The reason Fine Gael have been in opposition for 26 years out of the past 27 under the P.R. system they now want to keep is that they have contempt for the intelligence of the ordinary, average person throughout the country.  It is about time Fine Gael recognised that the average Irish man or woman who takes an interest in politics&mdash;and most of them do&mdash;can understand a political proposition and is able to decide for himself or herself where the balance of the argument lies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now, the Deputy spoke for&mdash;I do not know how long&mdash;and other Deputies spoke, and I did not interrupt.  Deputy Dillon tried to draw us out about the civil war.  He tried his best to stir up trouble, but we just let him wander on.  I do not want to go back over arguments that we have rebutted during the past six or eight weeks in the course of this debate. This small section has taken three days; I do not know how much longer the Opposition think the discussion should go on or whether they are going to take three days on each section.  I think, after a reasonable further discussion, they should allow the debate to be taken to the country, direct to the people and let them say there whatever they have to say about it. I do not believe the Opposition will have the &ldquo;neck&rdquo; to say directly to the people much that they have said in this House.  People can quite easily make their minds up when somebody like Deputy Sweetman or others of his Party go down the country and start talking off the subject in order to avoid dealing with it as a direct issue when they have no argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They have the opportunity of coming in at the moment, but they will not come in.  If the argument is that we should provide an opportunity for every minority wishing to organise itself to come in here, we should not keep to three or four or five member constituencies. Why stop there?  Why not make one seat of the whole 147 and then allow anyone who can get one-one hundred and forty-eighth of the votes in the country to come in?  What is the objection?  If you are not going to have to force minorities of that sort to come together to get a sufficient number of votes to win in a three or four or five seat constituency, the <Col N="536" /> thing to do is to make a single member constituency of the whole country.</P>
      <P>The argument against the single-member constituency and the direct vote is &ldquo;phoney&rdquo; and Deputy Sweetman and his Party and the speakers from other Parties who are against the straight vote system are trying to think of arguments as they go along. We know from our experience here as well as from the experience of the neighbouring countries in Europe that the P.R. system has thrown up a multiplicity of Parties which must combine and do not combine very well.  They form weak Governments that will burst up at the first whiff of difficulty.  We have seen it happen here twice.  Deputy Sweetman saw it happen to his own Government.  He found that when difficulties had to be faced, at one little bit of difficulty a section walked out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot deny that when they wanted to do a certain thing, a minority objected. They walked out, and in order to keep the minority in, even for three years, they had to surrender to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it became not the rule of the majority but the rule of the minority.  In the Coalition, anybody prepared to say at any time: &ldquo;Either we have our way or we get out&rdquo; found the majority in the Coalition had to surrender to them or collapse.</P>

It did not show itself here to the same extent because you had a Party like Fianna Fáil in power to do things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give us the chance of asking the people, by resigning to-night?  I want to make a few observations, taking the last point first.  The Minister says he wants people to coalesce before the election and not afterwards, because he is afraid they will change their minds as to what they said before the election and what they will do after it.  Could there be any <Col N="539" /> better demonstration of humbug and cant by anybody than that to which we have been treated just now by the Minister?  Is this not the Minister who went before the people in the last election, saying: &ldquo;We are going to guarantee the maintenance of food subsidies&rdquo;?  He told the people that before the election, but the moment they codded the people into giving them a majority, he comes into this House and abolishes the food subsidies. This is the Minister who said people should not change their minds but should stick to what they say before and during the election; whereas his own conduct and the conduct of the Government are monuments to the impunity with which that Party has repudiated the solemn promises it made to the people, in order to ride into office at the last election.</P>
      <P>I have never accused the Minister for External Affairs of suffering from introspection and I do not imagine that even his somersault on what Fianna Fáil promised about food subsidies and of what they did will make any impact on his armour-plated confidence.  But some of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party might dwell on the fact, when they hear the Minister for External Affairs talking about minds being changed and policies being changed, that their own record in that respect is by no means an unsullied sheet and that the Government now in office on two occasions made promises to the people, in 1951 and 1957, on the subject of food subsidies and food prices, and once they got into office, they failed to keep the promises they made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not relevant, except for the psychological inference to be drawn, from the Minister and his Party's disreputable political talk on these two occasions, as to the way in which the Minister wraps a white sheet around himself here this evening and says: &ldquo;You should not change your mind on what you say <Col N="540" /> before and during elections, and what you do afterwards.&rdquo; In that respect the Government has a politically putrid record of changing its mind and of doing somersaults completely on the promises it made to the people. Having just put that <i>caveat</i> against what the Minister for External Affairs said, I do not propose to pursue the matter further.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday that he was not opposed to P.R. as such, but he was opposed to coalitions, which he said were made possible by P.R., so although the people have had the P.R. system here for almost 40 years, it is to be abolished now because the Taoiseach does not like multi-Party Government.  The people of Switzerland, of Sweden, of Norway. of Denmark and of Holland can manage to run their affairs and run them very successfully, without the aid of Fianna Fáil but because the Taoiseach does not like the multiParty system of Government in Ireland, the people are to be deprived of the system of election by P.R. which they have known for nearly 40 years and which the Taoiseach commended to them in rather flowery language when he put P.R., at his own instigation, into the Constitution of 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If God did not make the Irish people numerous, he at least made them interesting, and it is a new depth of interest to find that a whole system is to be changed completely from the system we have known for 40 years to one which imitates the British system of election.  What we are talking about is the enthroning of the British system of election, the same system which Lord Craigavon introduced to deal with his political opponents in the Six Counties, the same system of election as is used in two dictatorships in Europe to-day, the same system of election as was used in Britain to kill the Liberal Party, the same system as is used in certain parts of the British Commonwealth. This country has to go through that excruciating ordeal to gratify the idiosyncrasy of the Taoiseach because he does not like multi-Party Government.  As the man said in the play, P.R. does not <Col N="541" /> suit that special type of personal constitution of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>That is not a reason for precipitating the country into a referendum; that is not a reason for wasting the time of the House in barren discussion of issues which bear no relationship to the urgent economic problems which confront the people to-day. Because the Taoiseach does not like multi-Party Government or inter-Party Government, this House is not legislating now to deal with the needs of the under-privileged people, to provide decent schemes of social welfare benefit, to take 80,000 people off the employment exchanges, to stop the exodus of our people to Britain day after day to try to find work which is not available to them here.  Instead of doing these things by co-operation between all Parties and with an enthusiasm which submerges all Parties, we are being asked to gratify the last political whim of the Taoiseach before he goes to the Park and get rid of P.R.  That will be his last triumph or his last act of vengeance, whichever you like to call it, against the Irish people because he was beaten in the elections of 1948 and 1954.</P>
    <P>That is not good enough for the Irish people.  This House ought not to be troubled with this legislation. The people ought to see those whom they elected only two years ago more concerned with improving the lot of the people than frittering away their energies discussing a Bill which will leave the people utterly untouched. This legislation will not take one person off the unemployment list, will not stop one person from going to Britain and will not reduce the price of a single commodity or make the life of the old age pensioner or unemployed man or woman any better.  Yet, opening the year 1959, that is the best hope we see for our people&mdash;getting Parliament to fritter away its time on a useless Bill which leaves all our main problems unsolved and adds to them by creating among the people a complete division of opinion, at a time when unity, co-operation and enthusiastic goodwill for the solution of our problems has much more to commend itself than these seeds of dissension <Col N="542" /> and bitterness which the Government are sowing.</P>
    <P>It will be interesting, when this referendum is beaten&mdash;as beaten it will be&mdash;and when the Fianna Fáil Party go out of office at the next election, for whatever inter-Party Government goes up to the Phoenix Park to meet the new President.  You might find the President with his back against a post up there saying: &ldquo;I will not give the seals of office to any multiple-Party Government because I do not believe in inter-Party Governments.&rdquo; I would not put it past him to tell anybody on the same delegation: &ldquo;Do you not remember me saying it in the Dáil when I was the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party?&rdquo; Once the Taoiseach dislikes inter-Party Governments, in his new role as President&mdash;he is such a unique figure with such a unique method of thinking and reasoning&mdash;it would not surprise me if there is to be another inter-Party Government in this country, if that Government came into office over the body of the Taoiseach, because he will not recognise it.  He will not approve of any Minister and he will not sign any Bill for an inter-Party Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have said enough to indicate the grave dangers which flow from the situation in which the Taoiseach invites the nation to abolish P.R. and substitute the single-member constituency with the non-transferable <Col N="543" /> vote.  Having wrought that vengeance on the people, he then says: &ldquo;I am going to the Park, gentlemen, and when I arrive there, I will give effect to the decisions I have announced here.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am passing from it, Sir.  I just wanted to put up the danger signal so that the people will realise they are not merely being asked to commit a grave evil by abolishing P.R., but that they are digging their graves as far as future democratic legislation in this country is concerned.</P>
      <P>The one outstanding benefit of P.R., the principle which dwarfs all criticism of P.R., is the fact that it gives to the people representation in Parliament in accordance with the votes cast for the Party or the candidate outside.  In other words, the people are allowed to vote under P.R. and their views are given expression to by counting those votes, electing Deputies on the principle of P.R. and giving to the people, within this Assembly and in the Government, representation in accordance with the strength of the votes cast at a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The single, non-transferable vote denies that principle.  It does violence to that principle.  In fact, it does completely the opposite from the standpoint of representation.  As I pointed out&mdash;this has not been denied, and nobody will attempt to deny it&mdash;under the single, non-transferable vote, you may have four Parties contesting an election in a constituency where there is one seat.  One candidate can get 30 per cent. of the votes and the other three candidates can get 70 per cent. of the votes.  Therefore, 70 per cent. of the people have indicated that they do not want the fellow who got 30 per cent. of the votes, but, notwithstanding that fact, the fellow who gets the 30 per cent. of the votes comes in here, and if a sufficiency of those getting 30 per cent. of the votes come in here, you can see clearly that a majority Party will be elected here which, as far as the <Col N="544" /> ballot boxes are concerned, got a minority of the votes.</P>
    <P>Would somebody in the Fianna Fáil Benches attempt to tell me that a system which enabled a person to secure a seat with 30 per cent. of the votes, and where 70 per cent. of the people voted against the elected candidate, is a more democratic method of election than the P.R. system under which every vote cast by an elector on polling day has a value in one degree or another when it comes to selecting members of the Dáil?  Nobody has attempted to say why we must have a system of election&mdash;the single, non-transferable vote&mdash;under which the 70 per cent. of the people who voted for the three other candidates might as well have stayed at home on polling day because no portion of their vote is effective whatever in the election of a Deputy for that constituency.</P>

      <P>This Bill rests on no principle except the principle of getting into office, clinging to it by every possible trick and creating a Party machine which will enable a Fianna Fáil Government to dominate Parliament.  Next, they will dominate the county councils.  In between, they will dominate the Park.  We shall have a nice scheme of democracy then.  We shall have the Park under Fianna Fáil control; we shall have the Dáil under Fianna Fáil control&mdash;and that includes the Seanad; and we shall have the county councils under Fianna Fáil control.</P>

I am quite satisfied that the Irish people are not as stupid as some members of the Fianna Fáil Party believe them to be. I am quite satisfied they have learned a bitter lesson since the last general election.  I am quite satisfied that they will see in this move the first step towards dictatorship.  I am quite satisfied that, once the naked realities of this Bill are put before them, they will recoil from the effort which is being made here to gratify the vainglorious ambitions of the Taoiseach, who apparently wants to have this last act of revenge against the people <Col N="546" /> because he was defeated in two general elections in the past ten years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision proposes the deletion of Article 16 of the Constitution.  We are discussing now what will probably be the last confidence trick to be played on certain minorities here.  Article 16 was written into the Constitution to provide guarantees for minorities which would leave them in the position of being able to support the Constitution and, therefore, to adopt it in 1937.  If we examine the result of the referendum on that Constitution, it is obvious that it was carried by a margin approximately representative of the minorities to which I refer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the fact that in order to get the Constitution carried, Article 16, providing for a system of P.R. in connection with parliamentary elections, was written into it.  Not only did that ensure the adoption of the Constitution, but it also placed us in the position of having a &ldquo;dictionary Republic.&rdquo; It would have been possible within the three years from 1937 to amend the Constitution without a referendum.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that he was always opposed to a system of P.R., but he wrote it into the Constitution in order to ensure that the Constitution would be carried.  He could have amended the Constitution without a referendum within three years of its adoption, but he made no move because the confidence trick would have been all too obvious at that time. From his statement yesterday, it is obvious now that he intended that Article to be incorporated in the Constitution solely for the purpose of getting the support of certain minorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He referred to the fact yesterday that he was disgusted in 1948 when the inter-Party Government was formed and Fianna Fáil went out of office.  He did not refer to the fact that over 700,000 people voted against Fianna Fáil in 1948 and fewer than 500,000 people in favour of Fianna Fáil.  These are points to which he failed to refer in trying to make a case for this measure <Col N="548" /> and in offering excuses for asking the people now to amend the Constitution passed in 1937.  He clearly showed yesterday that it was a spiteful whim on his part in 1948, when he found himself in the wilderness, which caused him to decide to prevent at the first opportunity the possibility of ever having here again another inter-Party or Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>This evening, the Minister for External Affairs suggested that a declaration of policy should be made by a political Party before a general election.  We remember only too well the 17-point programme which Fianna Fáil published nearly two weeks after the general election of 1951 in order to secure the support of five Deputies.  There is only one of them left in the House. The others, who were not elected to support Fianna Fáil at that time, went before the public in the following general election and were defeated.  That lends strength to the argument that those who do not vote for Fianna Fáil are against them.  There is the example of five Deputies who were elected when those who voted for them could have voted for Fianna Fáil and who were defeated in the next election.</P>
    <P>The system of the single transferable vote gives a very clear result.  Let us examine the results of by-elections.  On one occasion, the result of a by-election endorses the policy of the Government; on another occasion, the result shows that the public are against the policy of the Government.  That result is obtained under a system of P.R. where the single transferable vote for a single seat in a constituency is operated.</P>
    <P>When the Fianna Fáil Party introduced this measure in order to keep them here as a majority Party with a minority of votes, we must look back over the last 27 years to 1932 when they came in here first.  We find that on only two occasions in those 27 years did the Fianna Fáil Party get a majority of the voters to support them. They came in here as a majority Party supported by a minority of voters.  We have nothing to say against that, because, at least, they were elected under a system of P.R. where the wishes of the people could be fairly interpreted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> Now the Fianna Fáil Party wish to bring in a system under which, with a very much reduced measure of support in the country, they would have a much larger majority.  At present they have a working majority in the House of about 20 Deputies.  It is fair to say that conditions in the country were never worse.  It is difficult to understand why they bring in this measure now, instead of putting first things first and attending particularly to the problems of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the results of the present system of election.  In 1948, a Government was elected which carried on a very vigorous housing programme immediately after the Minister for Industry and Commerce had warned the nation that they were facing four desperate years and that there could be very great hardship.  Instead, there was a very great measure of prosperity. There was a situation in which tradesmen were brought back from England in order to help.</P>

I am referring to a system which brought to the country a very great measure of progress in a very short time.  There were practically 100,000 houses built.  There was a greater measure of prosperity than we knew in any other three years, although the Minister for Industry and Commerce had forecast very great hardship for the four years following 1947.  Instead, we had a situation in which we were able to give a considerable increase to old age pensioners.</P>

      <P>Very well, Sir.  The present system reflects very delicately policy changes.  Will policy changes be demonstrated so delicately under <Col N="550" /> the new system under which there can be a large political Party supported by a small minority of voters?</P>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs referred to the question of policy being declared before an election.  I would remind him that, in 1954, the electors were offered an inter-Party Government and the result was that nearly 800,000 people voted in favour of the candidates who were prepared to take part in the formation of an inter-Party Government and over 400,000 voted in favour of Fianna Fáil at that time.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach yesterday mentioned a multiplicity of Parties.  At the present time, there are only three political Parties in this House with a membership of more than four Deputies.  That cannot be regarded as a multiplicity of political Parties. It is likely that there will be a considerable amount of jobbery, place-hunting and dictatorship under the new system.  We can look forward again to the type of C.I.E. share scandals that had the effect of putting the Fianna Fáil Party out in 1948. There were several other scandals at the same time.</P>

There are other countries where there are Coalition Governments. In fact, most of the European nations, including Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden and Norway, have Coalitions. The type of government which the Fianna Fáil Party propose at the moment can be found in Poland and Hungary and other depressed countries, where a minority have control of a majority and keep that control <Col N="551" /> by an abuse of their powers.  I say that Coalitions in this country certainly improved the standard of living, if we compare the conditions enjoyed by our people during the years of Coalition Government with the conditions obtaining at any time under a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>I was about to say that the system would also leave the agricultural community without representation. We have often been told that this is an agricultural country, but under the straight vote system we can be sure that any candidate who stands in a town or city, or in an area where there is a large population, will secure election and that the rural areas will not have proper representation. At the present time, under the existing system, you can have a candidate from Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour living next door to each other and still the people in general over all the constituencies can support their own candidate and send him to the Dáil.  They have a representative there.  If you have a candidate <Col N="552" /> standing from some town, there is no chance for the farming community and the people resident in the rural areas to beat the town vote of the man who happens to be a resident of the town.  I feel it would be unfair to the people of the rural areas, particularly with an agricultural bias, to have a situation where it would be a waste of time for the people in rural areas to put up a candidate who would represent agricultural and rural interests.</P>
      <P>I heard the Taoiseach mention something about wild promises, but if anybody ever concocted wild promises, he himself has broken the record in that matter.  He argued here that you could not have Parties making promises and then after the election not going ahead with them.  We watched that trick played by Fianna Fáil in one election after another.  I think they have no more promises to offer and that is why they have now decided to adopt a system where they can be elected the Government, even with a minority vote.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned that an Independent candidate would have a fair chance in a constituency.  What chance would an Independent candidate have at the present time when he would have 13 issues of <i>The Irish Press, The Evening Press</i> and <i>The Sunday Press</i> circulating in his constituency with a Fianna Fáil bias?</P>
      <P>My case in the main is that the proposed system will lead to abuses particularly. We watched a number of abuses already put into effect by the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have several examples of barefaced jobbery.  For instance, under the 1951 Government, one of the Independent Deputies got a job of £500 a year probably for life. Another of them was pushed into the Seanad.  Those are only two examples, but we shall have more of those abuses if we have a Government with a substantial majority which cannot be disputed in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the example of a 75 per cent. vote.  You could have Fianna Fáil with 25 per cent., Fine Gael with 22 per cent., Labour with 15 per cent. and others with 13 per cent.  Yet, with that 25 per cent. vote, you would have a <Col N="553" /> Fianna Fáil member elected, and the other 50 per cent. of the electors, who could have voted Fianna Fáil but did not, would have no representation in Parliament.  Public feeling appears to be that they will not adopt the system now proposed.  They will stand by the system which has operated successfully here for the past 40 years.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the maintenance of public order.  The Irish people have a very keen sense of fair play.  We cannot expect in this country to see the people holding their temper or remaining patient if they find a situation where they have a Government which does not represent the majority feeling of the people. That is one of the things we have always had here, thanks to the system of P.R.</P>
    <P>The people in general did not dispute the results of elections.  They knew it was a fair system and that the results in the main were fair.  We are likely to have public unrest and turmoil if we have a position here in which a minority of the people have Government and the majority have no say in that Government.  There is then the question of the maintenance of public order.  Can we expect the Army, the Garda Síochána and public servants to stand over what appears to be an injustice where the people are not given their rights and their representation in Parliament?</P>
    <P>This is a very dishonest action on the part of the Government.  I feel, too, that, in general, the public are aware of the real purpose of this Bill, which is to strengthen and perpetuate the Fianna Fáil Party particularly inside this House, mainly because the Taoiseach is leaving the political scene.  They feel that, without the Taoiseach, their position may grow weaker, but even if it does grow weaker, the new system will have the effect of maintaining or, perhaps, increasing the membership of the Party in the House.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes a revolutionary change in our electoral system.  The proposed change has not, as far as we can see, been demanded by the public.  The people are being <Col N="554" /> asked, at a cost of about £100,000 to themselves, to do away with the system of election which has been in operation here for the past 30 years and to substitute for it the British system of election which is completely untried and untested in this State.</P>
      <P>The Government are asking the people to take a leap in the dark and throw away a system which is known and understood by the Irish people. The present system of P.R. means that people can be elected to the Dáil and public bodies in proportion to their voting strength.  This is clearly to my mind, a fair and democratic system.</P>
      <P>Under P.R., a person has also a choice between political Parties and individual members in these Parties. The people have become accustomed to this freedom of choice and they understand it.  I have heard it said in this House that the people do not understand P.R.  That, to my mind, is a false statement.  The Irish electorate is an intelligent one and they appreciate the value of their second and third preference votes in electing representatives to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>This Government proposal means that the people will be deprived of the freedom of choice which they now have.  If the Government's plan is carried through, it means that a person can vote for only one candidate, and that each vote cast for an unsuccessful candidate will be completely wasted. If there is to be only one candidate in each constituency, then that person can represent only one body of opinion in that constituency, leaving a vast number of people unrepresented.  That, to my mind, is a completely unfair system.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to speak on this Bill, but it seems to be the policy of the Opposition Party to drag this debate out interminably and people are about sick and tired of it by now.  They realise fully the issues which are to be placed before them. There are one or two points I wish to refer to, however, one of which is that speakers on the Fine Gael Benches to-day have referred to the fact&mdash;this matter was dealt with by the Taoiseach himself on Second Reading&mdash;that P.R. was written into the 1937 Constitution <Col N="555" /> as the method of election.  The Taoiseach has given certain reasons, to which I will refer later, as to why he is now changing this system.</P>
      <P>Everyone here who remembers the Constitution debate in 1937, and everyone who has read the debate which took place in this House during the enactment of that measure, will recall that nearly every single section was bitterly opposed, particularly by the Fine Gael Party.  It is my personal opinion, that if P.R. had been omitted from the Constitution at that time, it would have been very difficult to get that Constitution&mdash;which Deputy Mulcahy now quotes so glibly&mdash;passed by the Irish people at that time&mdash;and &ldquo;at that time&rdquo; are the operative words.</P>
      <P>We know that every bridge, every hoarding, every free space throughout the State was painted or whitewashed &ldquo;Vote &lsquo;No&rsquo;&rdquo; by the Fine Gael Party. It has been suggested&mdash;as a matter of fact, I do not think any speaker on the opposite benches has omitted to make the suggestion; evidently they are hoping for a gullible public&mdash;that the reason Fianna Fáil are now proposing this measure is that the Taoiseach proposes to retire from the political scene, and wants to leave the Government of this country to his heirs and successors in perpetuity.</P>
      <P>Are these speakers not very foolish to think that the Irish people would believe that suggestion?  I should like to draw their minds back, and try in a small way to convince them that the Taoiseach always had in mind what this system which we now propose to change could lead to.  For instance, in January 1948&mdash;that is a while back&mdash; speaking in Miltown Malbay, the home of Deputy Dr. Hillery&mdash;a historic spot &mdash;the Taoiseach said, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of Saturday, 3rd January, 1948:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Referring to P.R., Mr. de Valera said it had some advantages he was quite willing to admit, but it had one serious fundamental defect and that was that it made stable government extremely difficult.  It made it extremely difficult for one Party where there were six or seven in the field to get an over-all majority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was in 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> He is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 17th May, 1951, speaking in Galway during the 1951 General Election and referring to P.R., as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Costello had tried to raise it as an election issue, but it was so obvious to everyone that it was not an election issue, and could only be changed by a referendum, that Mr. Costello had shifted his ground. It was a very common trick to shift one's ground when one could not answer arguments.</P>
    <P>Mr. Costelllo pretended that although it was not an issue in this election, there were ways and means of tampering with it.  Mr. Costello pretended to be a super-democrat to-day but in the days of the Blue-shirts he was not quite so much of a democrat.  He also tried to pretend that P.R. was brought into this country through the Free State Constitution of 1922.  That was not correct.</P>
    <P>P.R. was first brought into the country by Mr. Lloyd George, and his reason for bringing it in was that he wanted to weaken the Sinn Féin movement at that time.</P>
    <P>Recalling that he (Mr. de Valera) was President of Sinn Féin at the time, he said he smiled at the effort of Mr. Lloyd George, knowing that the Sinn Féin movement was so strong and that national feeling was so strong that Mr. Lloyd George could have 100 P.R. schemes if he wished&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The quotation continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and the national feeling was sufficiently strong to overcome such obstacles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I went further,&rdquo; said Mr. de Valera, &ldquo;I admitted the advantages of the kind that were in P.R. <Col N="557" /> It has theoretical advantages.  I did not have the experience that I had in later times.  I did not see this nation broken up into small political groups, and the result of P.R. in bringing about the coalition of a variety of groups.  That had not occurred fortunately.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those were the very prophetic observations of the Taoiseach and certainly everything he forecast and his fears about the system of P.R. have all come to pass.  There are one or two other extracts I should like to read&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, this is to refute the suggestion, which has been made time and again, that this is just a proposal to perpetuate Fianna Fáil now that the Taoiseach proposes to stand for the Presidency.  Speaking at the Árd-Fheis on 29th September, 1943, mark you, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 30th September, 1943, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...he has, so far as possible supported P.R. but there were very grave dangers attaching to it.  When no big question was before them there was grave danger that the people would break up into sectional groups, resulting in the formation of a number of small Parties.</P>
      <P>That was the big danger; just as in the case of trade unions, they had splinter unions, and all the rest of it, with all the disadvantages and difficulties that accrued, so also they would have these splinters in the case of political organisations where individuals thought they would be better off as leaders of small groups, rather than not being leaders of a large group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;That is,&rsquo; said Mr. de Valera, &lsquo;such a serious danger for our country that I have in recent times been of opinion that a day will come in which the people will change the system, if that is going to follow from <Col N="558" /> it but the trouble is that, unfortunately, when the danger has happened you cannot rectify it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You certainly cannot.  We had two Coalitions afterwards and, as prophesied at that time by the Taoiseach, we now know the results.</P>
    <P>Later on, in Limerick, on 8th May, 1943, and as quoted in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 10th May, 1943&mdash;nearly 20 years ago&mdash;Mr. de Valera had this to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If P.R. got them into the position in which they were going to have Coalition Governments&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;This was in 1943, mark you&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;representatives of a number of different groups in the Cabinet&mdash; they were going to bring about, in his opinion, the end of democracy here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;If it ever did happen,&rsquo; Mr. de Valera said, &lsquo;that the people of this country, having a Government which would be composed of groups from various Parties with P.R. in being, then, much as I am in favour of P.R., I would suggest to the people that they should end it rather than have that situation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another reference was made here, and quite at length, by the Leader of the Labour Party.  I do not see why he should have got that latitude: I do not think it was relevant to the matter before the House.  He suggested, possibly jocosely but it will not read so jocosely in to-morrow's papers, that when the Taoiseach becomes President on 25th June next, it is not outside the bounds of possibility that he could refuse and might refuse to hand the seals of office over to a Coalition Government. Deputy Norton argued that, in the light of certain actions of the Taoiseach in the past, such a possibility existed.  Very few people would take Deputy Norton's suggestion seriously, but, just for the record, it would be no harm to read Article 13 of the Constitution on that point and then I will leave it.  Article 13 of the Constitution provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The President shall, on the nomination of Dáil Éireann,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;he has no option&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" />&ldquo;appoint the Taoiseach, that is, the head of the Government or Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>The President shall, on the nomination of the Taoiseach with the previous approval of Dáil Éireann, appoint the other members of the Government.</P>
    <P>The President shall, on the advice of the Taoiseach, accept the resignation or terminate the appointment of any member of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If he does not do those things, there is power in the Constitution to throw him out, to impeach him.  Therefore, let Deputy Norton not make those ridiculous statements.</P>

      <P>Yes&mdash;and, on the point of the relevancy of my remarks, I wonder what the proceedings of the House, which took place to-day, had to do with sub-section (1) because in my humble opinion, this was a Second Reading debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various members on the Opposition Benches interrupt with cries about what P.R. did for the Six Counties.  Again, that is a distortion of the position.  The abolition of P.R. in the Six Counties was not what was objected to at the time by the national leaders on both sides of the Border, but the system of gerrymandering which has been set out in great detail in the book quoted yesterday evening by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy J.A. Costello&mdash;Frank Gallagher's book, <i>The Indivisible Island.</i>  Therein he sets out in no <Col N="560" /> uncertain manner that it was not the system of election which counted but the carving of constituencies in such a way that, no matter what system of election operated, the Nationalists would never get true representation.</P>
    <P>Deputy J.A. Costello referred last night to a speech which he made on the Constitution in 1937 and the arguments and views he held at that time on P.R.  I agree that the former Taoiseach was not in favour, say, of abolishing P.R., but, at that time, he did advocate a certain amount of flexibility in P.R.  Other speakers on the Opposition Benches, for some reason or other, seem to take umbrage when we quote Deputy J.A. Costello or Deputy Dillon and refer to the views they held at that time.  They remind me of a few lines which I think would typify their mentality&mdash;&ldquo;the purple cow&rdquo; mentality.  They have not any purple cows in Kerry, but, for Deputy Palmer's benefit, I shall quote a few lines.  If Deputies can appreciate them, they will realise that the lines typify a certain type of logic exercised by the Opposition:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I never saw a Purple Cow</P>
    <P>I never hope to see one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

It is also noticeable, as mentioned by the Taoiseach, that the trade union movement in this country has recently appreciated the fact that splinter movements are a menace and that what is needed in this country is one strong union&mdash;an amalgamation of the splinter unions into one strong party.  The system of P.R. is not operative in trade union elections.  That was done away with long ago.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Deputy Dillon went back about 150 years and proceeded to the present day in relation to the system of election in Britain.  He dwelt at length on the system of election to the House of Commons, the system of the non-transferable or straight vote.  He forgot to say there have been a number of changes under that system in Britain.  We know it is not long ago when everyone, after the war, in the first flush of victory, expected Churchill to be returned with the Conservatives, but they were kicked out and sustained an overwhelming defeat.  We also know that this system of the straight vote we propose to introduce has one thing which, in my humble opinion, is one of the greatest features in favour of it, whether it is Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or any other Party which is in power.  It means that a swing in public opinion is much more accentuated than under the present system.  The corollary is that that swing in public opinion in favour of a Party will elect a Government for the full period of five years in such a way as to give them a sufficiently strong majority to carry out their policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been accused of wanting to stifle this debate and it was suggested by certain Deputies that it was the policy of the chairman, the mayor or the Fianna Fáil members of local authorities to stifle discussion on P.R. That is not so.  The attitude of the Fianna Fáil members of those local bodies was that this is a political issue and that local bodies had enough to do, if they did it, to administer their own peculiar, local affairs and that the pros and cons of P.R. were not their function, but a function of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I say that in reply to those Deputies who said that was the reason Fianna Fáil spokesmen on those councils objected to a discussion on that question.  They accuse us of stifling discussion although there was the strongest objection here&mdash;it was not unprecedented, but I do not think it has happened very often&mdash;to granting leave to introduce the Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill. They did not even want it to come in here for discussion by the House.  Who <Col N="563" /> then was trying to stifle discussion on the measure?</P>
    <P>The clichés about minority representation were dealt with very effectively by the Minister for External Affairs.  As the Taoiseach himself has said on several occasions, speaking with regard to the Fianna Fáil Party, we represent every section of the community, the big farmer, the small farmer, the professional man, the tradesman.  I do not think there is any section unrepresented.  It is like the committee of a football club.  As we know, on every football club committee, there is always a &ldquo;cribber&rdquo;.  It is like those queer characters who come into election rooms at the time of an election.  No one knows where they come from. They are never seen thereafter, until they appear at the next election.</P>

      <P>It is relevant to this extent, that if every person on the committee of a sporting club who objected to certain measures put forward by that committee decided to set up his own club it would be like a chain letter reaction.  However, you have people with the mentality that if there is a vote taken by a committee of a club on a proposal and there are ten for and three against, one of the three who do not get their way wants to form a club of his own.  You have that type of thing both in the sporting world and in the political world.  I think I have related my remarks to the section before the House.</P>

      <P>I was speaking, lest Deputy Blowick misunderstands me, about the good men and the bad men in a coalition.  Fianna Fáil were never members of a coalition and never will be.  We were told that we should have gone before the people, in the last election, on the issue of P.R.  It was said that we should have told the people that, if we were elected, we intended to abolish this system.  Well, of course, the less the Opposition could say on those lines the better for themselves because that sort of talk is a complete inaccuracy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on the Second Reading.  I thought that would be my <Col N="565" /> contribution but it seems that we are having this thing all over again, and so I intend to keep my end up, because in politics, like everything else, you must keep your end up.  I should like to mention that the people have no interest in this debate.  They say to me: &ldquo;When is it going to stop?  What about housing?  What about the unemployed?&rdquo; I am not blaming the Opposition.  The Opposition are sustaining the debate because they were provoked into it and, of course, they are entitled to defend their end. In proposing the amendment of the Constitution, the Government Party have their motives.  I believed, when I last spoke, that they had multiple motives and not just one motive.  It was not just a question of stability and now we know that the Taoiseach's candidature for the Presidency was naturally a part of the general plan. They must have had in their minds the question of losing the Taoiseach's personality and the prospect of losing a large number of votes in a general election, and because of that they want to try out one with the other.</P>
      <P>The sub-section we are dealing with deals with whether there should be one candidate, or a number of candidates, representing the people in an area.  I am not claiming infallibility, but I say this: an Independent Deputy, if he is rather false, has only to cover up for himself, but, when a Party man speaks, he has to cover up for himself and his friends, so, on the rounds, I would say my arguments are as good as any, if not better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of whether there should be one or many candidates, it is said that P.R. is a deal between Parties, but let me put it this way, that the single representative system will be a deal between individuals.  As is known, there are Liberal members of Parliament in England and, by right, they do not represent the constituencies. They are allowed to represent them in a deal with the Conservative Party and vice versa.  In other words, we hear about those who get second and third preferences, that it is not right that they should get second and third preferences&mdash;which P.R. gives the candidate in many cases&mdash;but in a straight vote constituency, a deal is <Col N="566" /> done and the larger Conservative Party permits a body, not as strong as itself, to take over the area.  The Conservative Party allows the Liberals to contest the seat so that their main opponent, namely, the Labour Party, will not win.</P>
    <P>That is the system in England.  Individuals are blackmailed and blackmailing is possible here if P.R. is abolished. Any individual in an area who can secure a couple of thousand votes can threaten one or other of the big Parties that if he is not allowed to stand, he will go up anyway and upset their chances.  Therefore, instead of deals between Parties representing large bodies of people, there will be deals between individuals representing selfish motives.</P>
    <P>Only a month ago, I read an article by &ldquo;Cross Bencher&rdquo; in the <i>Sunday Express.</i>  It is a weekly article which deals with current parliamentary affairs in England and this article dealt with a by-election which was pending in Southend.  It stated that the local Conservatives were of one mind not to put up the son of the late candidate because the late candidate's family had control of the area since 1912.  They were determined on this occasion that they were not going to be forced into accepting the heir who was only 23, but, according to last Sunday's <i>Express,</i> he has been accepted. The reason was that the son said: &ldquo;All right; I will stand&rdquo;, so he blackmailed the Conservative Party in the area into accepting him, and that is what the abolition of P.R. means. That is how it developed in England and that is how it must develop here, because if there are major Parties, if there are three persons with considerable strength in an area, one can say to another: &ldquo;Look, if you do not be good, I will go up.&rdquo; That is blackmail and, therefore, instead of deals between Parties, representing large sections of the community, you will have deals between individuals for selfish motives.  That is the alternative.</P>
    <P>I am not going back to what Fianna Fáil said.  I am not concerned with that.  I am concerned with what does happen and what will happen.  I am <Col N="567" /> concerned with human nature and how it will react to a proposal.  I am concerned with facts.  I heard a lot about what Deputy Dillon said regarding P.R. but what difference does that make?  In politics, you are always against the fellow in office and you speak with your tongue in your cheek. That is accepted, and what is the point in speaking about what Deputy Dillon said?  Let us get down to what will be the result of the abolition of P.R.</P>
    <P>I have made the point that in Southend a 23-year-old whose father and grandfather controlled the area since 1912, has now been selected because he threatened the local Conservative Party that if he was not selected, he would go up, and the Party would lose a few thousand votes.  We have a number of Liberals who do not represent the largest bodies in the areas, but they are allowed to represent them because they said that if they were opposed, then they would put up their candidates in Conservative areas where there were marginal seats.</P>
    <P>Do not tell me that, by and large, politics is not blackmail.  Of course it is.  Politics, in my opinion, is the art of deception.  I do not have to go to the principles of Machiavelli to know that.  I know it and you know it and nobody is going to stand down on principle.  If a man thinks he can obtain an end, he will shove his neck forward.</P>
    <P>Under P.R., no individual can decide what is to be done with his votes, but in a straight system he can.  For instance, if a man stands as a candidate under P.R. and gets 1,000 votes, he cannot say that he will not give them to another candidate.  He has no choice and the people decide.  If so-and-so is eliminated, his votes will then go to somebody else.  Under P.R., no individual controls his votes.  He cannot put a gun to anybody's head.  Under the straight system, a man who knows that he will get 1,000 or 2,000 votes can dictate and can blackmail the area. Whether you like it or not, that is true.</P>
    <P>More than individuals can blackmail. Newspapers can blackmail.  Any newspaper editor, if he decides to throw <Col N="568" /> his weight one way or the other, in a case where there might be a marginal seat, can decide who is to win. Churchill stood for Dundee on one occasion and lost by 42 votes.  His backer was Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Beaverbrook held that because one of his editors had a spleen against Churchill, and did not back him, he lost the seat.  He sacked the editor for not throwing his weight behind Churchill and told the editor that if he had done what he was told to do, Churchill would have won.  What I am trying to point out is that men can win or lose through any little source of influence at all.  This straight system is subjected constantly to blackmail of individuals, of money and of newspaper magnates.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy O'Malley mention all the small people who comprised his Party.  That is all right now.  The people who comprise his Party now are the products of P.R.  The small man gets his chance, but eventually there will be very few small men in his Party.  That is natural evolution.  In 1935, 60 per cent. of the House of Commons was comprised of lawyers, company directors and trade union officials.  That is stated in this book which I have.  I do not like quoting books.  This book is entitled <i>Parliamentary Representatives</i> by Mr. J.F. H. Ross.  The majority of the remainder of members in the House of Commons were men of means.  Now, through natural evolution, only the people with lots of money, or influence, will be chosen as candidates, so that poorer men may make up their minds that in ten or 15 years, there will be few small men in political life in this country.</P>
    <P>According to the same book, every Conservative candidate must hand back his salary and, in many cases, more than his salary.  Therefore no man can be a Conservative candidate, unless he is a wealthy man and that, to a large extent, is also applicable to the other Parties in England.  To be a candidate in England, you need to be a man of a certain income; therefore the present Commons represents only about 4 or 5 per cent. of the English people.  The rest are excluded by reason of the fact that they have <Col N="569" /> not got the income necessary to be a candidate.  That is natural evolution in politics where P.R. is not the practice.</P>
    <P>Let us take the Labour Party.  One would say: &ldquo;Well, there is a Party that should put forward small workers&rdquo;.  When I say that the small man should be put forward, I do not mean people who are small in mind. I mean people who are small in means. You can be a man of very small means and have a very fine mind and you could be a man worth a million and be a numbskull.  Because of finance, few men, other than trade union officials can become candidates in the Labour Party.  It developed that way.  Money has become so decisive that only people with substantial sums of money will be selected. The people in the local area realise the need for money and favourably consider the person who has a substantial amount of money.</P>
    <P>Let us not talk about our present composition.  Our present composition here came from P.R. and from the national struggle.  It was not only a question then of money but a question of whether you had guts. There is one other serious tendency and it is this&mdash;it is quite obvious that henceforth the average Government will be a minority Government.  It must be.  It may interest the House to know&mdash;again referring to this book &mdash;that for a period of 24 years, there were only five years of Government by a majority Party in England.  Do not forget that.  There were 15 years of coalition Government in England, where we are told strong Governments were a natural result.  Therefore, there is no guarantee that this miraculous stability, which is only alleged, will result.  In a nutshell, it can mean that men like myself&mdash; personally, I do not care&mdash;those who are not in Parties will not get a chance. Those like the heir of the family controlling Southend, will almost certainly be elected.  That position will worsen as politics develop and especially if P.R. is abolished.</P>
    <P>We are told that the one man will look after his seat, that it will be his <Col N="570" /> responsibility.  That is the best joke I have heard in a long time.  Let us take the case of the Taoiseach.  He is leaving politics and I hope he will have a good rest.  The Taoiseach has been representing Clare while he was Taoiseach, but has he been looking after Clare?  He has not.  He has had responsibilities&mdash;there are a lot of us in the same boat&mdash;but the other three or four members were looking after Clare.  He cannot run down to Clare and hang around there finding out the views of the people.  He probably did not see Clare more often than once a year but the other three or four Deputies were looking after Clare.  Suppose P.R. was abolished. Who would look after the constituencies of people like the Taoiseach or his Ministers?  They will not be able to get down to them except once in a blue moon and then hurry back again to Dublin.  How will they represent their areas?</P>
    <P>You may say that somebody will do it for them.  To my mind, nobody does anything in this life except they have a motive and nobody is going to kill himself down in Clare looking after the Taoiseach's interests, unless he is well paid for it.  So long as the incentive is there, so long as he realises there is a prospect of winning a seat, or of holding a seat there, he will look after it.  At present there are members living away from their areas and they do not go into their areas.  Yet it is said that under the new system they would go and walk the streets and listen to their constituents.  They will not.  They will keep out of their area and only go in on occasion when there is a meeting, say, in a place like O'Connell Street where they can get up and speak and then get out again.  There is no use fooling yourself.  If you want work done, there must be an incentive and the best incentive is for a man to know he has a chance to be elected a member of this House.</P>
    <P>There is a good chance for him to hold his seat if he is a T.D. but once you do away with P.R. it means, as in the case of the fellow in Southend, England, that he does not have to do anything.  He actually gets here <Col N="571" /> by blackmail; certainly, he does not have to break his heart for his area. It is no use trying to kill the hare with cross arguments.  Where there is an incentive, there is effort.  We all kill ourselves working, if we have to do so; we &ldquo;stall&rdquo; when we do not have to do so.  That applies to every one of us and in all things.</P>
    <P>As I said already, I wanted to speak to hold my own end up and if there is another big discussion next week, I will have another opportunity because naturally I must keep my name before the public.  I must do that.  I do it by hard work and I do it otherwise.  Other people get it done easily, but I work hard and I could not keep my name up easily like others.  I do not speak just for the sake of speaking and I believe every word I say is true.  I believe the suggested abolition of P.R. can only mean something to a handful of privileged individuals like the gentleman at Southend, and that for the average member of this House, for the blacksmith and the labourer and so on, it means they have an opportunity now they will never get again.  Fianna Fáil members may have to back the Taoiseach but in their hearts I am sure they have their doubts.  I shall say no more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with sub-section 1 of the schedule:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann shall be composed of members who represent constituencies, and one member only shall be returned for each constituency.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hitherto, we have had P.R. in its various modifications down the years. There used be nine-seat and seven-seat constituencies and later on we reached a stage where it was thought necessary by the powers that were to have a large number of three-seat constituencies, some fours and some fives.  If P.R. has any defect at all, its defects became manifest here when, for political reasons and political Party advantage, we began to tinker with it. That tinkering is most obvious in the large number of three-member constituency we now have in which any Party controlling 51 per cent. of the votes cast is certain of the two seats, which would not appear to be a <Col N="572" /> reasonable representation proportionately. The results were different when working on the larger number of seats, on the nine-seats, seven-seats or even on the fives.</P>
    <P>Why do we want to return to the British system?  On the Second Reading, I was anxious to know if anybody could point out from what source there came any public demand whatever for this change.  Nobody since then has either thought it worth while or indeed been able to say that in any walk of life there was manifest, before the Taoiseach made it known at a Press conference, any desire on the part of the community or any body of the community for the change envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There being no sign of public demand, I think it is reasonable to seek the motive and having sought for a motive, one must confine oneself to the source.  The source was the Taoiseach; subsequently the Party; subsequently the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, where there were a few resolutions asking for the change.  We all know that resolutions of that kind can be inspired, so that the motive for this change must be sought within the Fianna Fáil Party. Since the Second Reading, it has become more obvious, in my opinion, what that motive is.</P>
    <P>Introducing the Bill and speaking on the Second Reading, the Taoiseach might reasonably be credited at that time by unsuspecting people with the purest of motives.  They might think that in all sincerity he sought to bring about a system which he himself could work as the leader of a Party and as Taoiseach.  But in the course of the First Reading, somebody&mdash;I think it was Deputy O.J. Flanagan&mdash;said: &ldquo;This is Dev's last will and testament to the Fianna Fáil Party.&rdquo; To-day's news puts that beyond question.  It is a very nice gesture if it could &ldquo;come off&rdquo;, in that he would cement in power and rivet in Government seats those who for so long served him so mutely and so loyally.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Norton's view, however, that this referendum will be beaten by the people and if there was any doubt about it yesterday, there can be no doubt to-day.  The motive is now clear.  Even apart altogether from <Col N="573" /> the pious utterances of the Taoiseach about instability and the difficulty under P.R. of getting an over-all majority, it is very difficult to find in the speeches of other Ministers any sort of coherent reasoning or any reason that would suggest that this proposal relates to instability at all.  The Minister for External Affairs thinks it is the most awful system that could ever have been planted upon our people, because it is of British origin.  This Bill, however, proposes going back to something that is British.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government sought to tell us that if this referendum went through, the Fine Gael Party would have &ldquo;had it&rdquo;.  I heard him say that in this House.  In passing, in relation to that remark, I should like to pay a tribute to the Press of this country, who resolutely stood their ground when attacked on that matter, and who positively asserted that the statement had been made by the Minister in the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs, speaking to-night about minorities, accused Deputy Sweetman of seeking to preserve the present system because in that way there could be elected to this House people who believe in the force of arms.  Deputy Sweetman made no such statement and, anyhow, the matter has been adequately corrected.  But I would say this, in relation to the four Sinn Féin Deputies who have chosen not to come into this House, before the election, they went before the people in their respective constituencies and they told them that, if elected, they would not come into this House.  So far, they have kept their word to the people.  Can the same be said of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the several others of the &ldquo;Get Cracking&rdquo; brigade, who made statements before the last election and have not kept them?</P>
    <P>Why should the Minister for External Affairs taunt the four Sinn Féin T.D.s who have chosen to stay out of this House because they promised the people who elected them that they would stay out, if elected, when in fact they have been out only since March, 1957, whereas the Minister for External Affairs and his <Col N="574" /> colleagues in Government, very many of them, chose to stay out of this House from 1922 to 1927, until they decided that they could change their minds?  Perhaps, too, the Sinn Féin T.D.s will see their way to get permission from their people to come in here and work constructively. While I do not agree with their abstention from this House, I nevertheless resent any abuse being hurled upon them&mdash;because their abstention is the performance of a promise made to the people who elected them.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in the single member constituency in this country because the country is too small and because the country is predominantly agricultural.  There are no real divisions of vocations in this country. Take the average rural constituency anywhere along the west coast of Ireland and, say for argument's sake, if this referendum is successful, that there are 8,000 to 10,000 voters, all smallholders with possibly a small section of them fishermen, all the same kind of people living the same kind of lives.  What sort of line is going to divide them politically in the real sense and not politically in the civil war sense?  Even if there were any good in the single member constituency, as a result of the performance of Government speakers here and their efforts to resurrect hatred and all the other evil things in politics that are the residue of our history, I am satisfied that we are not sufficiently mature politically to change to this system now.</P>
    <P>In England, it is quite different.  In England, there are areas, with a large industrially concentrated population; there are others with a rural population. In other areas, you have large white-collar worker, Conservative classes; there are large landowners. There is a division&mdash;a division of wealth, a division of class&mdash;which is not to be found here at all.  Therefore, the sole purpose would appear to me to be nothing more than, on the present figures, to give the Fianna Fáil Party so substantial a majority that they would enjoy power in this country for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that the <Col N="575" /> people at the next election could change the Government and would change the Government, if they thought fit, on this system which it is sought to introduce now.  I do not think that that would be as easily done as it is said.  When people talk about a member &ldquo;minding his constituency&rdquo;, being more in touch with it in the single member constituency, they are talking of sectional representation; and the more you show that your representation is sectional, the more you are likely to gather in, in the hope of getting some of the political loot.  What is the idea?  I am not unacquainted with that kind of practice under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Let us take a constituency of that kind as an example, with a Fianna Fáil member, where practices that might not be regarded in the purer political sense as orthodox would be freely practised.  Who is going to raise a voice against them?  Nobody, lest he in turn would be victimised by the machine which he sought to change.  I could pursue that line of thought, from knowledge and experience of the actual working of Departments of State and of local government, as to how political bias can so alter the course of justice as to make the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; sound and look a joke.  However, on that matter, there will be another time.</P>
    <P>I think it is a mistake, at this period of our obvious political immaturity, particularly on the Government side of the House, to attempt to bring about this change.  I do not think the people will bring about this change for the Government, but the Government will again resurrect things that were fading away from our public life.  What I would ask the people, through the House, to do is to beware and have a genuine fear of this thing they are being asked to enact.  If they were foolish enough to do it, upon them, and upon them only, would it recoil; and they would be visited by the power that might not be so impartially used.  It is for those reasons that I am opposed to the single member constituency and all it entails.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the remarks of Deputy O'Malley and from the hesitancy shown by Fianna Fáil speakers to address the House and the country on this matter that it is the wish of Fianna Fáil that the debate on this subject should conclude as soon as possible.  I can sympathise with Fianna Fáil's anxiety in that respect, having regard to the steady and gross deterioration in the standard of the Fianna Fáil debate as the discussion progressed.  But it has been a useful discussion&mdash;a discussion which the country has followed with interest.  I believe if it went on even longer, the country would continue to follow it with interest.  It is a discussion on a fundamental matter, on a revolutionary measure, which has been introduced by the Government without any sound or good reason being given.</P>
      <P>The only reason that had even the ring of truth about it was the reason given by the Taoiseach in an involuntary answer to a question put to him by Deputy Dillon.  When Deputy Dillon suggested that the only reason this measure is being steamrolled through the House and sent to the people for decision is that the P.R. system had sent Fianna Fáil out of office in 1948, the Taoiseach, in his urbane way, smiled over at Deputy Dillon and said: &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo; That was the only good reason from the Fianna Fáil benches during the debate. The only reason it was good was that it was frank.  It appalled the average man, who thinks in the real political sense, apart from Party politics in this country.  It appalled the average, thinking man that the Leader of the largest Party in Dáil Éireann and the Leader of the Government should stoop to introduce a measure of this kind in what might be called a fit of political pique.  From then on, it was gratifying to us on this side of the House to note the deterioration in the standard of the debate on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is part of the duty of the Opposition to elicit from the Government side the reasons why they introduced the measure and, having done that, to investigate and criticise them.  One can only look most critically upon the confusion which existed yesterday in the <Col N="577" /> Government Front Bench, when we had, on the one side, the Minister for External Affairs assuring the House that there could not possibly be gerrymandering under the straight vote system and being followed by the Taoiseach, who was not quite so sure but who eventually told the House: &ldquo;Yes, there could be gerrymandering&rdquo;, but gave us the cold comfort that it would not be easy to gerrymander under this system.  However, in the course of yesterday's discussion, he did tell the House that we were doing away with the system under which it was impossible to gerrymander in order to introduce the system under which gerrymandering was possible.</P>
    <P>There is only one other aspect to which I should like to advert.  The reason is I do not know if anybody else has done so.  From all sides, we are continually being told that what the Irish political scene requires is an injection of young blood&mdash;that the young politician and budding statesman should be encouraged.  No measure I know of could be less conducive to young men entering Irish politics than this measure.  Almost every young man who came into this House graduated through a process of elimination in earlier elections under P.R. Eventually, he reached the stage where he was returned to Dáil Éireann after standing as a candidate on three or four occasions and being defeated. There is no possible chance of a young man doing that any longer.  You will now have a system under which the Party bosses can send to any constituency they consider safe, any old crocks from the Front Bench who they feel might fail to hold a seat at an election.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told the House yesterday, in his urbane manner of simplifying things, that under the new system the people in a constituency would declare &ldquo;This is the man we want&rdquo; and everything in the garden would be beautiful.  Nothing could be further from the fact.  Under the present dispensation, if a local body of a political Party decide they want a particular man, it does not matter who is sent from headquarters.  If the man they want is a strong man, they can <Col N="578" /> say: &ldquo;You can send Mr. X from headquarters but Mr. Y and Mr. Z from here will stand, too, and we will guarantee that, under the P.R. system, Mr. X will be beaten.&rdquo; In that way, much of the waste matter in Irish political life could be eliminated.  If the P.R. system goes, you will continue to invite and retain the waste matter for so long as the Party bosses decide to send such people to safe constituencies.  For that reason, I would ask the Government once more to reconsider the decision they have taken to put this measure through the House.</P>

      <P>I have not a great many points to raise on this sub-section. It is no harm to have clarification in our minds so that the general public will be helped to see the issue clearly, if and when this goes before them in the form of a referendum.</P>
      <P>I find myself in great difficulty trying to discuss even this limited portion of the measure because we are precluded from dealing with fundamentals in this very important debate.  To my mind, there is an air of unreality about this discussion.  We are told by the Government, on the one hand that the evils or weaknesses of the existing system can be remedied only by abolishing P.R. and substituting the single non-transferable vote in the single seat constituency.  The Government's argument is that unless that change is made, and made now, there will be little hope of stability in Government here in the future.</P>
      <P>I think it is a fair question to ask a Government or a political Party what exactly they mean by stability? What is the Government's interpretation of stability?  Does stability mean the kind of Government that exists in Spain?  Is there not a form of stability in those countries in which there is only one political Party?  Is it the view of the Government, I wonder, that stability means strong Government, strong in numbers but not necessarily strong in their political views and not necessarily strong in their social and economic policy for the betterment of the nation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not denied by anybody here that we have had strong Government <Col N="579" /> during the greater period in which Fianna Fáil held the reins of office. We had strong Government.  We had stability.  Fianna Fáil was a one-Party Government.  Is it not a fact that with 20 years of that type of strong Government and 20 years of that type of stability, the country has slipped down the slopes until to-day we are on the verge of ruin, so far as our population and our economic policy are concerned?  Is it suggested that by achieving stability in the future through returning the same Party, namely, Fianna Fáil, under a new system and in a new guise, the type of stability that we have had for that 20 year period is a desirable type of stability to perpetuate for the next 20 years?</P>
    <P>When we use the word &ldquo;stability&rdquo;, we should use it in the sense of good Government, progressive Government, benevolent Government, Government prepared to help the weaker sections of the community and, at the same time, protect our economic and social fabric.  In our experience here, a really strong Government has meant a Government in a postion to say: &ldquo;We cannot afford to give another sixpence, 1/- or 2/- to the old age pensioners; we cannot afford to increase widows' and orphans' pensions; we cannot afford to increase blind pensions.&rdquo; A strong Government, strong as the present Government are and have been in the past, can afford to trample on the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>That is why I say there is an air of unreality about this debate.  It is fantastic to be discussing what is likely to happen in the future.  It is fantastic to be discussing this measure within the restricted limits in which we are compelled to discuss it.  We are not allowed to bring before the public what the effects of this measure may be economically and socially in the future.  It should be appreciated that the public are annoyed and that annoyance may turn into ungovernable irritation at this House and those in it, because the public cannot understand why the members of this House are not <Col N="580" /> discussing the realities of the situation. Some Deputies have stated that we should be discussing fundamentally urgent problems needing solution. The public agree with that.  That is what we should be doing.</P>
    <P>We should be in a position on this measure to discuss its repercussions on the fundamental problems that call for solution, such as emigration, unemployment and economic expansion, industrially and agriculturally. The Government know perfectly well that if the public were given an opportunity of realising fully that, as far as this issue is concerned, Fianna Fáil are not interested in getting power for the future in order to solve our economic problems, in order to expand agriculture and put an end to emigration&mdash;they are interested in getting power in order to hold on to power; there can be no denying that&mdash; this proposal would meet with a very cool reception.</P>
    <P>We had an announcement to-day that the Taoiseach will soon be President elect, if he gets that far.  He hopes to go to the Park.  Only three months ago, he told the people that he wanted this measure to be discussed in a non-Party atmosphere, discussed calmly and coolly on its merits.  He hoped there would be no bitterness and that Party politics would be at a minimum. What has happened?  He has decided now, for reasons which are well-known, to carry this measure through on a sentimental appeal to the people by offering himself for the Presidency and holding both the referendum and the Presidential election on the same day.  If that is acting in a non-Party manner, I should like someone to tell me what is a non-contentious method of doing anything?</P>
    <P>Last night, the Taoiseach told us that P.R. worked reasonably well over the last 30 years, while there were fundamental differences in the House. Fundamental differences, according to the Taoiseach, constitute the question of one's approach to the Treaty.  He had the gall to suggest to-day, to the youth of to-day, that the type of difference that existed in this House was the true basis for any political <Col N="581" /> difference that existed amongst the people.  Is it any wonder we are described as a backward nation when our political differences are based not on social and economic views, but on the question of who, according to the Taoiseach, stood for the Republic?  He says all Parties are now united on the question of Partition and consequently the division between Parties has been blurred.</P>

      <P>In the course of my remarks on this motion last week, I established that it could not reasonably be held that it was incompatible with any of the obligations of his public office for Deputy de Valera to hold the position of controlling director of the Irish Press.  I showed, and, indeed, the mover of the motion himself proved, that the association of the Taoiseach with the <i>Irish Press</i> has been public property since the prospectus of the company which owns that newspaper <Col N="582" /> was published in 1931.  With this knowledge, the electorate, at eight general elections, voted to make Deputy de Valera head of the Irish Government.  Deputy Dr. Browne in his motion denies the right of the Irish people to vote in this way.  I challenge him to state what is the ground for refusing them that right.  The events which led up to the establishment of the <i>Irish Press</i> are well known to those who made Deputy de Valera Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Even if they were familiar with these events, even if they had lived through them, by what right do they set themselves up to override the judgment of the people who, with all the facts before them, have determined that it is quite compatible with his position as Taoiseach for Deputy de Valera to be controlling director of the <i>Irish Press</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next, it has been established by the mover of the motion himself, when he <Col N="583" /> quoted a long series of parliamentary questions which over the years have been addressed to the Taoiseach on this very point, that at no time had the Taoiseach's association with the Irish Press been concealed.  One of the questions which were mentioned in the course of his opening address was put in 1947, before Deputy Browne appeared upon our political scene.  The Deputy has shown himself to be a zealous delver into the Official Reports. I would recommend him to continue his researches back to 1932 and he will learn that Deputy de Valera's association with the <i>Irish Press</i> was debated, not once, but many times in this House.  Far from there having been any concealment in this matter, it has been widely published by all his political opponents.</P>
    <P>The people, in many general elections, have rejected the first proposition in this motion, to the effect that it is incompatible with his office as Taoiseach for Deputy de Valera to be controlling director of the <i>Irish Press.</i> Everyone knows that there is no foundation for the despicable allegation that the Taoiseach's association with this paper has ever been concealed by him and, yet, Deputy Mulcahy has told us that he and his colleagues are going to vote for the motion.  They are doing this on the ground that it should be quite understood that a member of the Government is not exercising a controlling influence in a publicly organised business.  Deputy Mulcahy tries to draw a distinction between a business which is publicly organised&mdash;I assume he means a business which is carried on by a public company&mdash;and businesses which are carried on under other auspices.  But he did not tell us why that distinction should be made.</P>
    <P>What grounds are there for suggesting that any director of a public company, any director of one of our large industrial undertakings, is a man of less integrity than any shareholder in that company, than any employee in that company, than any trade union officials who may have had discussions with him?  I gather from Deputy Mulcahy's remarks that members of the <Col N="584" /> Opposition have been themselves directors of public companies, but that they duly relinquished these directorships when they became members of the Government.  Will he tell us what heavy burden of temptation fell from them when they divested themselves of their directorships?</P>
    <P>Of course, it is quite nonsense to suggest that there is any difference in the character of a man who holds a directorship when he is sitting in Opposition and who divests himself of that directorship when he joins a Government.  I am certain that their standards of conduct&mdash;and, let me say, their high standards of conduct, their honour, their personal probity&mdash; were as high when those members of the Opposition to whom Deputy Mulcahy referred were sitting as members of the Opposition with their directorships as they were when they sat in the Cabinet without them.  But, that is not what Deputy Mulcahy suggested.</P>

      <P>The general principle is accepted by his own Party that a director should not hold a Cabinet post, whilst at the same time holding a company directorship carrying remuneration. The Minister for Health spoke about the gravity of the motion put down by myself and Deputy McQuillan.  I do not think the question can be reduced to any single point myself and if I were asked to reduce it to any single point, I would suggest that the lack of candour on the part of the Taoiseach is the one which strikes me as being the most important one concerning his position in relation to the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing we have been asked to do is to refer back to the debate of 1933 which I have read concerning largely the establishment of the <i>Irish Press</i> and the agreement by the Dáil that a certain section of the Republican Loan should be funnelled into the funds of the <i>Irish Press</i> newspaper. At that time there was a body called the American Corporation whose function it was to care for the interests and the assets of the American shareholders. <Col N="586" /> Then there were the American shareholders.  I was surprised that the Taoiseach did not tell us whether the position which obtained then was the same as it is to-day.</P>
    <P>I tried to find out, as a shareholder in the company and as a Deputy involved in the debate, if the position was identical to-day with what it was then.

That he has received no remuneration as director is true.  In my opening statement, I said there was £250, which he does not take.

      <P>The Taoiseach said his was a fiduciary capacity in relation to the shareholders of this company <Col N="588" /> and that he was, under the Articles of Association, given certain very wide powers in this company. My suggestion is that he had 500 qualifying shares in order to allow him to act as controlling director.  He subscribed, as far as I could see, to the suggestion that he had only 500 shares in this company.  Instead of that, the position since 1929 is that the Taoiseach as an individual or the Taoiseach jointly with his son.  Deputy Vivion de Valera, has continued to have these shares registered in his name to a total of 55,000, as far as I can see, anyway.  I inspected the books as a shareholder.  I am not an expert in these matters, but as far as I can see, there are at least 55,000 odd shares standing in the Taoiseach's name in the Irish Press Newspapers Limited.</P>

      <P>They are now majority shareholders.  It has been suggested that he acted as trustee for these shareholders whom the Minister for Health has described as these poor Irish-Americans who put their little savings into this country 25 or 30 years ago.  The position is, that acting as controlling director, Mr. de Valera has taken steps to see that the shares of the Irish Press Newspapers, Ltd., have not been quoted&mdash;quotations have not been asked on the Dublin Stock Exchange.  The result, of course, has been that these shares have been made available to the de Valera family at a grossly deflated undervaluation.</P>

I suggest he has used his position as Taoiseach to build up his position as <Col N="590" /> controlling director of these newspapers, and has used his position as controlling director of these newspapers to maintain his position as Taoiseach.  He has used his joint positions in order to create a very prosperous commercial enterprise, a very solid nest-egg, for the days of his retirement.  He has also used his position as controlling director which, under the articles of association of the company gives him the widest powers, to bring his son on to the board of directors and has brought his son's brother-in-law on to the board so that three of the de Valera family are on the board of directors, the total number of directors being six, two of whom are very ill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also a breach of his undertaking given in the letter soliciting funds from America in the thirties that he would receive no personal remuneration out of this enterprise.  He has deprived the shareholders of their just rights to a dividend when that dividend comes to be paid.  He has deprived the shareholders of their right to whatever assets are payable should this company go into liquidation and he has misled this House when he said in answer to a question of mine on 12th November: &ldquo;I have no financial interest in the <i>Irish Press.</i>&rdquo; That is an outrageous <Col N="591" /> misstatement and the Taoiseach should certainly not have been guilty of it.</P>
      <P>There is, I think, very considerable public disquiet over this whole question.  It was only with the greatest difficulty that I have been able to ascertain the facts as I know them.  If there is any doubt about them at all, the Taoiseach has only himself to blame, because he has been so evasive and because he refused to answer simple questions put to him in this House.</P>
      <P>I suggest that in view of these facts there is no alternative but for the Taoiseach to set up a public inquiry, a public judicial inquiry, and the inquiring body should be under the auspices of some judge nominated, not by the Taoiseach because he is an interested party in this whole matter, but by the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NOTE</P>
    <P>Contribution rates were increased on the 3rd September, 1956, but stamps at the old rates in respect of employment prior to that date were sold in the year ended 31st March, 1958. The numbers of old rate stamps sold are shown separately except in the cases of the 2/6 and 2/- rates.  It is not possible to segregate the stamps sold at those two rates between the different kinds of employment covered by them.</P>
