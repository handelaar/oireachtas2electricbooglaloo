    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give an estimate of the number of additional jobs which would have to be provided each year on average in order to solve the problem of unemployment; and if he will estimate the additional number of jobs likely to be provided each year on the basis of the Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> published last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of jobs required to solve the unemployment problem depends on a number of factors, such as the level of emigration, the proportion of women who are in gainful employment at different ages, which is affected to some extent by the proportion of women married at different ages, the age distribution of persons who retire from gainful occupations each year, the mortality rate of persons in the working population, the school leaving age, etc. Changes in any of these variables would affect the number of jobs required, and in view of the assumptions which would have to be made, it has not been possible to carry out the detailed economic analysis which would be necessary to compile estimates of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may however be said that at present about 55,000 young persons annually cease their schooling, the majority of whom can be assumed to <Col N="884" /> be available for employment.  It is estimated that about 30,000 persons leave the labour force annually through deaths or retirement (including retirement of women on marriage).</P>
    <P>As to the second part of the question, it is not practicable to estimate the additional number of jobs likely to be provided on the basis of the Programme for Economic Expansion. As was expressly indicated in the Programme, it does not purport to be a detailed plan based on predetermined production targets but, rather, an outline of the more important contributions to economic development proposed to be made by the State, the underlying principle being that the private sector will continue to be the principal source of new productive projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the last general election in Cork, the Fianna Fáil Party organisation issued a leaflet in which they promised that one of the things they would do immediately on being returned to office was to find 100,000 new jobs?  Two and a half years have passed since the promise was made and we are now entitled, in accordance with the promise, to see at least 50,000 new jobs.  How many of the 50,000 new jobs have since been provided?</P>

      <P>It is not possible to ascertain the total number of persons in wholetime employment in the State at any specific date. Particulars of the numbers of persons in insurable employment are, however, available in the form of estimates based on insurance stamps sold, or issued to employer depositors.  Thus the average number of stamps sold per week in a year provides an estimate of the average number of persons in insurable employment throughout that year.</P>
      <P>For the years ended 31st March from 1956 to 1959 the estimates of the weekly average number of persons in insurable employment were as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I miss the Taoiseach's customary courtesy.  I expected him to wait until I had finished.

      <P>Surely there is no need to get cross.  I am merely trying to get a correct understanding of the figures which were read out by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I may be mistaken but I understood him to say that in the second last year there were approximately 500,000 in insurable employment and in the last year there were 460,000.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána Pay Orders, No. 2 of 1958 and No. 2 of 1959, prescribe the rates of remuneration payable to members of the Force in consequence of the last pay revision.  The increases granted under these Orders, which are payable from 1st April, 1958, in all cases, correspond to the increases granted to civil servants on comparable salary scales with effect from that date. In the case of grades up to and including Superintendent the increase was 10/- weekly, with the exception that members under 21 years of age received only a 5/- increase.  In the case of Chief Superintendents and higher grades, the salary rates were adjusted to bring them into line with higher civil servants who received increases representing 5 per cent. of the portion of basic pay in excess of £965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> Deductions from the pay of recruits in respect of income tax are made as soon as the amount of the assessment is notified by the Revenue Commissioners. Under this arrangement deductions are confined to the last 5 or 6 months of the year, and amount to between £4 and £5 a month in the case of most recruits.  The question of spreading the deductions over a greater number of months is under consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to the Deputy's queries are as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)In the year 1959 to date, seventeen applications for new merchandise licences were received from persons resident in Achill Island and Corraun Peninsula. The applications were received on various dates from 4th February to 10th September, 1959.</P>
      <P>(b)Licences were granted to all applicants&mdash;eight in number&mdash; whose applications were received prior to 20th April, 1959, the date on which it was decided to grant additional licences in the area.</P>
      <P>(c)The licences were granted, in accordance with the provisions of Section 115 of the Transport Act, 1944, on the grounds that the existing road transport facilities in the area were inadequate.  C.I.E. are not interested in local transport within this area.  Prior to 1959, there was only one licensed haulier in the Achill area and there was no other licensed haulier within 30 miles.  His licence was confined to the carriage of turf, fish, seaweed, lime and limestone in Achill Island and was granted in 1940 because of the inadequacy of transport facilities in the area. He was not an &ldquo;existing carrier&rdquo; within the meaning of the Road Transport Act 1933.  He had no entitlement to his licence by virtue of having carried on a road merchandise business prior to the introduction of licensing. On the grounds of inadequacy of transport, he was granted a new licence on 8th January, 1959, entitling him to carry all classes of merchandise.  This did not, however, confer on him a prescriptive right to a monopoly of transport in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> The eight additional licences are confined to the carriage of stone, sand, gravel, seaweed, building materials, manures and agricultural produce in the area of Achill Island and Corraun Peninsula.</P>
    <P>The number of prosecutions which were pending against the successful applicants at the date the licences were granted is a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there were prosecutions pending against some or against any of the successful applicants at the time of the granting of the licences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual fact, even if there were, there is no statutory provision preventing these people from receiving licences.  As the Deputy knows, prior to the granting of this particular licence in 1939, the position was that there had been no arrangements made under the Transport Act for the provision of transport licences in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that on the whole his answer reveals a state of affairs that is contrary to the whole spirit of the Transport Acts?  The use of one section to prevent the operation of another in a court of justice at that time is certainly contrary to the spirit of the Act and the spirit of justice.

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if the subsidy for rural electrification has been restored; and, if so, why a special service charge, which in most cases amounts to more than the normal two monthly fixed charge, is being imposed on would-be consumers by the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1958, a subsidy of 50 per cent. of the expenditure incurred by the Electricity Supply Board on the electrification of rural areas after the 31st March, 1958, is payable to the Board.  The subsidy will continue until the total expenditure on the electrification of rural areas amounts to £30 million.</P>
      <P>Special service charges are still payable in cases where, after allowance is made for the subsidy, the annual revenue from the normal fixed charges is less than 4 per cent. of the capital cost of providing supply.  The amount of the special service charge in any such case is the amount which must be added to the normal fixed charge to produce an annual return of 4 per cent. on the capital cost, excluding subsidy, of providing supply.  I am informed by the Board that less than 5 per cent. of all rural consumers are paying special service charges, the amounts in each case varying according to the cost of providing supply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In moving the Second Reading, I would remind the House that it is with the principles of the Bill that we are chiefly concerned at this stage, though I shall have something to say about its specific provisions as I go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to fix the hours during which licensed premises may keep open for the sale of intoxicating liquor so that the needs of the community may be served, that the anomalies that arise from any licensing system may be kept at a minimum and that enforcement of the law may be practicable and effective.  These are the aims which the Government have kept in mind in their consideration of licensing problems.  They believe that the proposals in the Bill are for the common good and that while they may not serve the vested interests of particular <Col N="937" /> groups they will be backed by public opinion.  The Government believe that the existing licensing hours are either unduly restrictive or unsuitable and that in recent years enforcement of the licensing laws has proved impossible due to the fact that they have not the force of public opinion behind them.  The Bill, therefore, provides new opening hours on weekdays and on Sundays.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for many useful changes in the law of a secondary kind which could wait for a later day if they had to.  The primary provisions are contained in a couple of sections dealing with (1) the abolition of the so-called bona fide trade, (2) the fixing of more suitable hours of trading on weekdays and (3) the general opening of licensed premises throughout the country on Sundays and on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>Before I talk about the several matters dealt with in the Bill and why the Government have taken one course rather than another, I should like to refer to the background to the present-day licensing situation.  Licensing legislation is nothing new to us. Since the restrictions on the sale of drink were first imposed in this country in the year 1695&mdash;for the closing of licensed premises during Divine Service on Sundays&mdash;our statute books record change after change in the hours of sale.  In our own time, since this State was established, the hours have been changed by statute no fewer than four times: twice in 1924, again in 1927 and again in 1943.</P>
    <P>The problems of to-day are very much the same problems as the Legislature had to consider in the Twenties and in the Forties and the reason we now feel compelled to legislate again in a more liberal way is that we are satisfied that undue restriction does not pay, that licensing laws which have not the respect of the ordinary man in the street and have not the force of public opinion behind them cannot be enforced.</P>
    <P>We have had the licensing situation inquired into by two Commissions in the past 35 years.  In 1925, the <Col N="938" /> Government set up a Commission of Inquiry&mdash;it was reconstituted in 1929 for certain limited purposes&mdash;to advise as to whether changes in the licensing laws were necessary and in what respect.  Some of the Commission's recommendations proved unacceptable to the Government or to the Legislature, but, by and large, the 1927 licensing statute was based on the Commission's recommendations.  The hours of sale then fixed were given a fair trial but in 1943 it was apparent that they were unsuitable or too restrictive and the law was again changed.</P>
    <P>The debates on the 1943 Bill and the controversy in the public press for and against particular provisions illustrated the wide divergence of opinion that then existed in relation to licensing matters.  Little was settled, apparently, by the 1943 Act. In a short few years, there was renewed agitation for general opening on Sundays in rural areas, for later opening on weekdays and for the abolition of the bona fide traffic.  In 1948, a Private Members' Bill was introduced in the Dáil which provided for general opening on Sundays outside the county boroughs from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., and 7 to 9 p.m., in addition to the existing facilities by way of bona fide trade and area exemption orders.  The Bill was defeated, on Second Reading, by 106 votes to 23, and in 1950 a similar Bill was introduced but was not proceeded with.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1955, however, demands for liberalisation of the licensing laws had become increasingly persistent; there had been a substantial increase in the number of area exemption orders granted by the Courts; the abuses associated with the bona fide traffic on Sundays and late on weekdays were the cause of constant complaints by law-abiding persons; and, finally, there was a considerable amount of illegal drinking. In this set of circumstances, a motion was put down by Deputy McQuillan calling for legislation to amend the bona fide laws and to permit the opening of public-houses on Sundays and on St. Patrick's Day. Deputy Gerald Boland tabled an <Col N="939" /> amendment proposing the appointment of a Select Committee of 15 members of the Dáil to examine the licensing laws.  As a result of views put forward in the debate on the motion, my predecessor, Deputy Everett, informed the House that he would set up a Commission representative of all the political Parties, of the licensed trade, of the temperance movement and so on, to inquire into the operation of the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>In the result, a Commission of 22 persons was established in July, 1956, which included the Master of the High Court as chairman, parliamentary representatives from the city and other constituencies, representatives of the licensed trade, the trade unions, Bord Fáilte and the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.  There were also some members who were not appointed in a representative capacity. The Commission had the following terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To enquire into the operation of the laws relating to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor and to make recommendations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Commission reported a year later, having held nearly 40 sittings, having taken oral and written evidence from over 70 witnesses including members of the Judiciary, representatives of the Garda Síochána, the licensed trade and the temperance movement.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Chairman and members of the Commission for their painstaking services. They were given a very onerous task and they represented such diverse interests and viewpoints that even at the outset it was not to be expected that they would produce an agreed report.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that the Government have given a deal of time and care to examining the licensing situation in the light of the Commission's recommendations.  The Commission's report was printed and placed on sale.  I hope that it has been carefully studied by every Deputy who proposes to speak on this Bill.  Even though a Deputy may not agree with some of the Commission's recommendations, <Col N="940" /> he will have available to him, in a handy form, the main facts of the licensing situation.  While it is true that there was not unanimity, or near-unanimity in the members' recommendations on some of the main items, such as the necessity for uniformity of hours for the county boroughs and the rest of the country, or the appropriate hours of opening on Sundays or on weekdays, the very fact that the members could not come to agreement shows the complexities of the problems into which the Commission were asked to inquire and which the Legislature has to consider now.</P>
    <P>In coming to the Bill itself, I presume I can proceed on the assumption that all Deputies have read the official explanatory memorandum circulated with it and, in particular, the tables setting out the existing hours of sale and those proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>First of all, I would direct attention to the fact that provision has been made for full abolition of the bona fide hours of trading on both weekdays and Sundays, a proposal, which, I think, will have almost universal approbation. It is inevitable, of course, that the licensees of these premises, up and down the country but mainly situated around Dublin city, who have built up a lucrative business dependent on an after-hours trade, will not welcome this provision.  I recognise that abolition will result in losses for them but there is no help for it: the public interest requires that the bona fide trade should be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>It must be apparent to all&mdash;publicans and public alike&mdash;that scarcely any of those persons who patronise the bona fide houses are genuine travellers: they are, almost entirely, persons travelling to get drink and availing themselves of the bona fide provisions to get it in the knowledge that the motive for these journeys is not something that could be satisfactorily proved in proceedings against them in court.  There is a provision in the Bill, which we will come to later, which provides for general opening up to 11.30 p.m. in the four holiday months and up to 11 p.m. in the rest of the year.  These hours will benefit the bona fide houses to some extent. <Col N="941" /> It is true that neighbouring publicans who are not doing any bona fide business at present can remain open too, but the fact that publicans in the cities may remain open to cater for the city trade is not an argument for giving longer hours to the proprietors of the so-called bona fide houses in the rural fringe.</P>
    <P>I am convinced, as is, apparently, almost the entire Commission, that the bona fide trade must be stopped.  To maintain it is to encourage people to drive to get drink and, of course, they drive home with drink taken.  The evil consequences of driving with drink taken we all know.  I am convinced, also, that the bona fide trade must not be given a new lease of life in another form by the creation of a differential in the hours of trade between the cities and other areas, as has been recommended in the minority report of the Commission.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the trek from the cities to outside public-houses late on weekdays, and the trek from village to village on Sunday afternoons, has been caused to a large extent by a legitimate wish on the part of many law-abiding persons to partake of reasonable refreshments and in the Bill, in place of what has come to be known as the bona fide hours, we are providing for later opening on weekdays and limited general opening on Sundays.</P>
    <P>On weekdays, the hours of opening proposed are from 10.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. in the holiday months of June to September, and from 10.30 a.m. to 11.00 p.m. in the other eight months of the year.  The morning opening hours and the evening closing hours will be the same for both cities and country but the provision in existing law for an hour's closing from 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. in the four county boroughs has proved its usefulness and is being reenacted. We recognise that people who dine late should be able to have a drink as part of their meal and that there is a substantial demand for such facilities and, in consequence, we are providing that, up to midnight, drink may be supplied in a hotel or restaurant as part of a substantial meal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> At this point, I feel that I must emphasise that the Government are in no doubt that the existing hours ending at 10.30 p.m.&mdash;10.00 p.m. in winter time&mdash;on weekdays do not meet the legitimate, reasonable requirements of those who like to take a drink.</P>
    <P>The entire commission were satisfied, apparently, that 10.30 p.m. was too early for weekday closing outside the four county boroughs and a majority of them thought that that closing hour was too early for the four cities too.  Evidence was given to the Commission&mdash;this is referred to in the report&mdash;that the Dublin public-houses could not be cleared by 10.30 p.m. and that, moreover, there was an exodus to the bona fide houses.</P>
    <P>The view of the Garda authorities in favour of an extension of the hours is quoted at pages 5 and 6 of the commission's report.  Here are the extracts quoted on page 5 from the Garda Síochána memorandum.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is well known that it is impossible to secure observance of any law, unless the majority of the citizens are anxious to see it enforced.  It is very doubtful whether this can be said of the Licensing Acts.  People from all walks of life contravene them regularly. No social obloquy appears to attach to offences against the Licensing Acts.  The penalties imposed by the Courts are often quite inadequate as a deterrent, and public representatives have frequently not alone advocated amendment of the law, but suggested that enforcement of the law should be relaxed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Center">and</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The general result is most unsatisfactory from the point of view of the Garda Síochána.  Evasion of the Licensing Acts by people from all walks of life, inadequate penalties for offences and statements by public representatives tend to bring the Licensing Acts into contempt. Any contempt for one law may breed general contempt for the law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The practice of the courts, too, in <Col N="943" /> imposing extremely light penalties on the publicans and customers for breaches of the law relating to sales after hours would seem to indicate that the courts consider that the present law has not the force of public opinion behind it.</P>
    <P>There may be some arguments, valid as far as they go, for later opening in some areas than in others, at any rate at particular times of the year, but the Government are satisfied that it would be a great mistake to have differentials between, say, the county boroughs and the large provincial towns, or between the seaside resorts and rural areas&mdash;differentials which, they have no doubt, would revive the evils of the bona fide traffic, now about to be abolished.  What justification could there be for later opening in a purely rural area than in an adjoining village or small town, or in a town rather than in a borough or county borough?  How could anyone justify allowing the public houses in a small rural village to remain open until 11.30 p.m. in the month of December, while at the same time closing the city publichouses an hour, or even half an hour, earlier as recommended in the minority report?</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the Commission's majority recommendation in favour of uniformity of hours for all parts of the country is sound and that it should be adopted. They believe that in the country, in the months of June to September, opening up to 11.30 p.m. is justified and that 11 p.m. is a fair closing time during the rest of the year.  As everybody knows, farm work goes on late into the evenings during harvest time and a drink at the end of the day's labour is something the farmer and farm labourer look to.  Furthermore, in rural areas, in a great part of the country &ldquo;old-time&rdquo; is observed and the present closing hour of 10.30 p.m. is 9.30 p.m. in the farmer's life.  The Government are also satisfied that a genuine demand exists, particularly from tourists, holiday-makers and people accustomed to take late supper that drink should be allowed as part of a meal after that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> In this connection, my attention has been directed to the recommendations made before the commission of inquiry by Bord Fáilte in the interests of the promotion of the tourist industry. The board's recommendations and views were subsequently publicised in a weekly paper.  They recommend more liberal hours on weekdays, opening on Sundays and the application of a uniform system throughout the country.  They asked for special facilities for drink as part of a meal in hotels and licensed restaurants late in the evening when the ordinary licensed premises are closed.  They stressed the importance of the tourist industry in the national economy and the importance of reasonable drinking facilities for the tourist who had holiday money to spend.</P>
    <P>They stressed also that if our tourist industry is to capture a fair share of the British and American patronage now going to the continent and the continental tourists who have begun to show signs of interest in visiting Ireland, we must be able to show that Ireland is a pleasant place to live in and an enjoyable place to visit and we must be prepared to cater for their wants&mdash;and their wants include reasonable facilities for refreshments late in the evenings.</P>
    <P>I understand that an extension of the hours is being opposed by some of those publicans in Dublin city who are organised in an association and&mdash; though for different reasons&mdash;by the barmen who are members of the trade unions.  The publicans are, apparently, of the opinion that later hours would not mean more drinking to any appreciable extent and that the recompense for the trouble and inconvenience to themselves would not be worth while after payment of their overheads, including increased pay for their barmen.  The opposition of the unions to their members being required to work late is, apparently, because of the inconvenience and, also, because the publicans might not be prepared to concede the increases in pay which the barmen would ask.  It appears, however, that not all the publicans within the association are in full accord with the association's view and the <Col N="945" /> same applies to many of the Dublin publicans outside of the association who number at least one-third of all the city publicans.  There is no evidence at all that the hoteliers are opposed to the late hours&mdash;in fact the evidence is to the contrary.</P>
    <P>As for the country as a whole, I am informed that the publicans in the association, which purports to speak for the trade, number less than 10 per cent. of the licensees engaged in the retail sales of intoxicating liquor.  The licensed premises served by barmen and porters who are members of trade unions are also less than 10 per cent. of the number of on-licensed premises which sell drink to the public.  The number of barmen and porters in trade unions according to their unions' figures, is around 3,500 which, of course, is only a fraction of the number of persons employed in the licensed trade.  I mention these facts because the views of the Licensed Grocers' Association and the barmen's unions are being extensively quoted as if they spoke for the licensed trade as a whole.</P>
    <P>The trade unions have been stressing the hardship on the barmen and porters which later working hours would entail.  But the conditions of employment for barmen are already safeguarded by the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938 and these safeguards would apply just as much when licensed premises keep open for a 70-hour week as in the case of an 80-hour week.  Under the 1938 Act, barmen may not be required to work for longer than 11 hours in any day, or for longer than 48 hours in any week&mdash;56 hours, including overtime. The employment of persons under eighteen years of age between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. is prohibited.  Barmen may not be required to work for more than six hours without a meal interval. There are provisions for annual holidays and for compensatory leave for work on half-holidays or Sundays.</P>
    <P>If the present trading hours for public-houses in Dublin were increased, there might have to be an extension of whatever system of reliefs, etc., is operated at present so <Col N="946" /> as to avoid contraventions of the 1938 Act unless, of course, publicans decided not to open as early in the morning as they are permitted to do, a decision which they are quite free to make.  But, one way or the other, the worst that can be said of the proposed extension of trading hours is the wider spread but there does not seem to be any question of &ldquo;intolerable&rdquo; conditions of work for barmen.  Many workers in transport undertakings, hotels, cinemas, theatres, etc., have to work inconvenient hours to suit the public.  Acceptance could never be given to the proposition that the working of late or unorthodox hours, which suit the convenience of the public, should be forbidden by law because the employers and employees would prefer not to work them.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill, then, on weekdays is to be that all ordinary public houses will be open up to 11.30 p.m. during the four holiday months and to 11 p.m. in the rest of the year and that hotels and licensed restaurants can serve drink as part of a substantial meal up to midnight. There has been no objection, as far as I know, from the hoteliers or waiters to serving drink with meals up to midnight.  One thing I should emphasise is that the hours are permissive &mdash;they are not mandatory&mdash;and any licensee who does not wish to cater for the needs of the public is not obliged to.</P>
    <P>There have been some suggestions that increased facilities for drinking will result in an increase in drunkenness and alcoholism.  As I mentioned a short while ago, the publicans' association feel that the later hours will not result in any appreciable increase in drinking, much less an increase in drunkenness.  They would seem to be supported in their view by the fact that during the Tostal periods in Dublin, when some hotels and licensed restaurants were given extensions under special exemption orders up to 11.30 p.m. or so, there was no evidence of excessive drinking.  I think that the dangers of increased drunkenness and alcoholism may be over-emphasised. As regards drunkenness, the Commission have stated in page 4, <Col N="947" /> paragraph 8 of their report that their consideration of the question of general trading hours was &ldquo;helped by the knowledge, based on statistical information and the evidence of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, that drunkenness has ceased to be a serious problem in the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The police returns of prosecutions for drunkenness do not indicate that there has been an increase in drunkenness over the years.  In fact, the figure for 1958 at 3,080 is the lowest in the past 16 years and is substantially below the average for the Twenties, or the Thirties.  Apart from the first three years of the war&mdash;1940 to 1942&mdash;when drink was in short supply, the number of prosecutions for drunkenness in 1958 is the lowest on record.  Furthermore, the quantities of each class of intoxicating liquor retained for home consumption in recent years do not show any significant upward trend, apart from <i>cider.</i>  The figures for the years 1925 to 1955 are published in <i>Appendix C page 32</i> of the Commission's report and the figures for ensuing years, which are in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>, do not show any significant variations.  In the Thirties and early Forties, a period when incomes generally were lower than to-day, followed by the War when drink was in short supply, the quantities for home consumption declined, but in the past ten years or so they are at roughly the same level as in the Twenties.</P>
    <P>I do not think that a comparison of the quantities of liquor retained for home consumption in 1958 or 1957 with the quantities retained in earlier years proves anything in relation to the amount of drink consumed by individuals.  There are so many imponderables involved that he would be a rash man who would seriously suggest, on the basis of those statistics alone, that the same number of drinkers were drinking more in the same time.  It is a mistake, of course, for anyone to draw the conclusion that increased consumption of liquor in a particular year will necessarily give rise to more drunkenness.  Increased drinking may result from a variety of <Col N="948" /> causes such as a prolonged spell of fine weather when people move about more, a substantial influx of tourists with holiday money to spend, bigger pay packets enabling a greater number to take a drink or an extra drink without hardship in other directions, and so on.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, with the Commission, that there is no substance in any suggestion that drunkenness is a substantial problem here or that it is on the increase or will be increased, if the public are given more suitable hours. In actual fact, we are doing little more in this Bill than giving legal sanction to what is going on at the moment under cover of the ordinary law, the bona fide provisions, the area exemption order provisions and the illegal drinking which the police say they cannot control because public opinion is not behind strict enforcement of the law.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions, also, that alcoholism&mdash;as distinct from drunkenness&mdash;is a serious problem in this country and that it is on the increase.  If by alcoholism is meant addiction to alcohol, necessitating treatment in mental institutions, I think I can reassure the House that alcoholism is not a national problem.  Alcoholism is a problem, of course, even if a few people only were suffering from this disease, for addiction to alcohol must be recognised for what it is, a disease that requires medical treatment for the rehabilitation of the alcoholic.  I have had inquiries made in the Department of Health and have been informed that the annual number of voluntary and temporary patients treated in mental hospitals, public and private, for alcoholism in recent years is of the order of one-fortieth of one per cent. of the population&mdash;18 years and upwards&mdash;who are legally entitled to be served with drink for consumption on a licensed premises.  While this may be a matter of concern, it is not significant on a national scale.</P>
    <P>The terms &ldquo;alcoholism&rdquo; and &ldquo;alcoholics&rdquo; are sometimes applied, however, to cover the occasional heavy drinking of a social kind, not necessarily in licensed premises, or habitual tippling or any kind of drinking which <Col N="949" /> causes trouble to the drinker or to society generally.  There has never been an authoritative survey in this country in matters of that kind.  I do not think any reliance could be placed on conclusions based on the <i>per capita</i> rates of consumption of alcoholic beverages in particular years, that is, the total consumption quantities divided by population or segments of the population.  A report of an Alcoholism Sub-Committee of the World Health Organisation&mdash;No. 48 published in 1952&mdash;has this to say on the dangers of drawing such conclusions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Per capita</i> consumption rates, even the most refined ones, should never be interpreted as indicating a high or low degree of alcoholism or changes in the incidence of alcoholism. It would require <i>per capita</i> rates of extraordinary magnitude&mdash; as a matter of fact, of a magnitude which has never come within range of observation&mdash;to permit of such inferences.  Changes in <i>per capita</i> rates are frequently interpreted in such terms as &ldquo;people have been drinking more (or less) this year than last year&rdquo;, etc.  Such conclusions are entirely unwarranted.</P>
    <P>Before I depart from the subject of drunkenness, alcoholism and the <i>per capita</i> consumption rates of liquor, I think that it might interest the House to hear that, as regards the quantities of each class of intoxicating liquor consumed, comparison of Ireland's annual consumption with the consumption of 10 other Western-European countries, statistics as to which have been taken from a Danish publication, the Statistical Year Book, 1957, shows that Ireland consumes per head of the population less spirits than seven of these other countries, less beer than four of them and less wine than eight of them.  Now I do not wish to make too much play with these figures, as the basis of the statistics may vary somewhat from country to country, but the conclusions are broadly true and I give them for what they are worth.</P>
    <P>As regards the operation of the licensing laws on Sundays, the position <Col N="950" /> is even more difficult to resolve than for weekdays.  Under existing law, there is general opening on Sundays in the four county boroughs from 1 p.m.&mdash;1.30 p.m. in Dublin&mdash;to 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. with hotels and licensed premises being permitted to sell drink with meals from 1 to 3 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m.  Outside the county boroughs, there is no general opening but hotels and licensed restaurants are permitted to sell drink with meals from 1 to 3 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m. and bona fide travellers are permitted to drink between 1 p.m. and 7 p.m.&mdash;8 p.m. during the period of Summer Time&mdash;and on special occasions such as football matches, galas, etc., area exemption orders can be granted by the courts for a period of four hours during which locals and bona fide travellers alike can partake of drink. In practice, area exemption orders have been freely granted for tourist resorts throughout the summer season and for hours before and after the bona fide period so that in a great many towns and villages throughout the country, there have been prolonged hours on Sundays when people may drink&mdash;sometimes as late as 10 p.m.&mdash; over several months of the year.  In 1958, for instance, 56 holiday resorts got area exemption orders each covering 20 Sundays or more and 22 places got them for 15 to 19 Sundays.  In all, some hundreds of places had increased facilities because of the grant of area exemption orders.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, this Bill proposes to abolish bona fide trading on Sundays and, also, to abolish the area exemption provisions.  The Government have had to keep in mind the scope of these existing facilities in writing general &ldquo;Sunday opening&rdquo; provisions into the Bill.</P>
    <P>The hours proposed for general Sunday opening are from 1 to 3 p.m. and 5 to 8 p.m. except in the months of June to September when the evening hours will be from 5 to 9 p.m. and it is intended that hotels and licensed restaurants will be permitted to sell drink as part of a substantial meal up to 10 p.m.  These are to be the hours on Sundays throughout the whole country, inside and outside the county boroughs. <Col N="951" /> Again I would draw your attention to the fact that all the members of the Commission are in favour of evening hours from 5 to 9 outside the county boroughs throughout the year, while the majority are also in favour of these hours within the four county boroughs.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the creation of a differential inside and outside the county boroughs would simply give rise to the re-creation in another way of the so-called bona fide traffic with its attendant evils.  I think that there cannot be any possible doubt in anyone's mind that general opening in rural areas is preferable in the interests of temperance to the existing bona fide hours, plus the hours permitted under area exemption orders.  I think that there cannot be any doubt in the mind of any impartial person that the opening hours on Sunday, inside and outside the county boroughs, must correspond in all respects.  There can be no question of any differential.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will observe, the Commission, in their Report, have gone to some pains&mdash;in paragraphs 12, 13, 19 and 20&mdash;to explain the present Sunday position and why they recommend general hours of opening from 12.30 to 2 and 5 to 9 p.m.  The Government have come to the conclusion that the hour of 12.30 p.m. is too early having regard to the fact that it is so close to the time when Mass ends in most cities and towns; at the same time, they recognise that in truly rural areas where Masses may end as early as 11.30 a.m. and where country people have, in disregard of the law, been accustomed for generations to shop after last Mass in public-houses doing a mixed trade, strict enforcement of the law will create problems for many people.  The problem of what to do is a difficult one and, on balance, the Government have decided not to have an opening hour earlier than 1 p.m. in any part of the country.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision for the supply of drink with a meal in hotels and licensed restaurants up to 10 p.m. on a Sunday instead of 9 p.m. as at present, the Government are satisfied that there is a fairly substantial demand for meals up to that hour and they do not regard it as unreasonable <Col N="952" /> that drink should be supplied as part of the meal.</P>
    <P>In relation to St. Patrick's Day, the Government have accepted the Commission's recommendation that there should be general opening as on Sundays.  I think that this provision will be welcomed generally.  Under existing law when St. Patrick's Day has fallen on a Sunday&mdash;as it last did in 1957&mdash;the Sunday hours have applied and there have been no complaints of abuses.  Up to 1924, the hours of opening on St. Patrick's Day were the same as on weekdays.  Since then, however, ordinary licensed premises have had to remain closed but drink is served for long hours under occasional licences at dog shows, race meetings, dinners and balls and the like; in hotels and restaurants with meals; under special exemption orders late at night; throughout the evenings in sports clubs; at railway stations and airports for travellers; and, let me add, illegally behind closed doors.  This anomalous and undesirable situation does not serve the cause of temperance.  It does not serve any legitimate purpose.  I am satisfied that there should be general opening on St. Patrick's Day as on Sundays, as has been recommended by the Commission, and this Bill gives effect to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>The foregoing provisions are the primary provisions of the Bill.  There are some other provisions in Part II which relate to the hours when liquor may be sold in clubs or holiday camps, or which clarify the law as to the duration of general exemption orders and as to the circumstances under which special exemption orders may be granted under the licensing code. These are matters which will be dealt with fully on Committee Stage and I do not propose to make anything more than a passing reference to some of them now.</P>
    <P>As regards club hours, the Government have accepted the Commission's recommendations that they should be the same as for licensed premises and that they should have the same facilities as hotels and licensed restaurants for the supply of drink with meals. I am not sure that these hours will be <Col N="953" /> welcomed by all the registered clubs and that some of them would not prefer to be left as they are, enjoying a special position under the provisions of the existing law, but I am satisfied that, in the interests of uniformity, the hours of clubs should conform to the hours of licensed premises generally.</P>
    <P>I should mention here, perhaps, that the numbers of registered social clubs and sports clubs have remained fairly constant at about 120 and 150 respectively over the past 20 years and there is no foundation for the suggestion made in some quarters that new clubs have been springing up like mushrooms. Furthermore, I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the very great majority of clubs are very well conducted and that the police do not require any additional powers of supervision over them.</P>
    <P>As regards holiday camps, these establishments will continue to have the same general opening hours as other classes of licensed premises and the same facilities as hotels and licensed restaurants for the sale of drink with meals.  The lodgers in the camps may be served with drink during the same hours as they have under existing law and while these hours fall short of the hours for lodgers in hotels they are the hours asked for when the Tourist Traffic Act was being promoted, and I have no reason to suppose that either of the established holiday camps is not satisfied with the position.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with three matters which are of some consequence.  First is the proposal that, subject to certain safeguards to preserve existing equities, a new public-house licence can be granted for premises in a rural area on the extinguishing of two existing licences of the same character.  The purpose of this proposal which was recommended by the Commission, is two-fold; it will contribute towards the elimination of redundant public-houses and it will enable licensed premises to be established in parts of the country&mdash;generally in the West&mdash;where there are no licensed premises at present&mdash;a situation, I might mention, which has given rise to a fairly substantial poteen traffic in some areas.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there are provisions <Col N="954" /> whereby a person who intends to construct a new premises or to make substantial alterations in an existing licensed premises, can get a declaration from the courts that if he completes his premises according to plans and fulfils other statutory requirements, he will get a licence in due course.  This is a very important provision from the point of view of the licensed trade and one that the trade has been seeking for some time.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is the proposal for public bars in certain licensed hotels which cannot have a bar at present, it being made a condition of the grant of the bar licence that an ordinary 7-day licence is extinguished.  This proposal has also been sponsored by the Commission.  It is welcomed by the hoteliers affected and it will result in the elimination of some of the redundant licences.  When we come to the Committee Stage, no doubt the merits of these proposals will be discussed at length.  I feel that there will be general approval for the provisions.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with miscellaneous matters.  While some of these matters are of a technical character or are only of limited interest, others are innovations in the licensing code which may have far-reaching effects.  Amongst the latter I number the proposals to allow the health authorities to object to the grant or renewal of a licence on the grounds of the unfitness of the premises.  If the provisions in this respect become law, and are availed of by the various health authorities, there should be many changes for the better in a large number of licensed premises in the course of the next few years.  The Bill makes provision, however, for at least 12 months notice of the intention of a health authority to object in court to renewal of a licence and this safeguards the interim interests of the licensee.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is of some significance is the provision whereby licences which are dormant for five years cannot be revived.  There are a great number of premises up and down the country which were licensed prior to 1902 but which have not <Col N="955" /> done any business for several years. Under existing law, these licences could be revived at any time.  We are providing that after an interim period of two years after the passing of the Act, any licence which has been dormant for five continuous years cannot then be revived.  This again is a contribution towards lessening the number of licensed premises, of which there are a great deal too many in the country, and it will be welcomed generally by the licensed trade.</P>
    <P>A third matter of some interest is the proposal to restrict the sales of cider for consumption off the premises to persons licensed for the sale of spirits and beer.  In recommending that this should be done, the Commission drew attention to the increase in recent years in the number of premises selling cider for consumption off the premises, and they gave figures at pages 18 and 32 of the report indicating a very sharp rise in the annual quantities of cider consumed, and they said that they had accepted evidence tendered to them as to the ill effects of excessive quantities of cider drunk by young people.</P>
    <P>Coming to the close of the Bill, I would refer the House to the Schedule of &ldquo;Enactments Repealed&rdquo; which alters the licensing code in certain respects, the most notable of which are the repeal of the provisions relating to the bona fide trade and area exemption orders and the repeal of Part IV of the Act of 1927 under which compensation could be paid on the abolition of a public-house licence.</P>
    <P>I have already referred at some length to the repeal of the provisions relating to the bona fide trade and area exemption orders.  The repeal of the compensation provisions of the Act of 1927 is simply to take off the statute book a bunch of provisions which experience has proved are so costly and cumbersome to operate as to be useless for the purpose for which they were enacted, namely, to effect a substantial reduction in the number of public-house licences which were&mdash; and are&mdash;far in excess of public requirements. <Col N="956" /> These provisions were, in fact, operated in one year only and their operation had to be discontinued.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of licensing legislation to which I have made no reference so far to-day, namely, the adequacy or inadequacy of the penalties in the licensing code for breaches of the law.  There have been some suggestions that the penalties on publicans and customers for after-hours drinking are inadequate, that there should be minimum fines and that we should revert to compulsory endorsement of licences on conviction, with forfeiture of licence on three endorsements within a limited period, that is to say, the same rule about endorsements as obtained without qualification from 1924 to 1927, and, thereafter, up to 1943, subject only to the qualification that the Justice could make a special order against endorsement where he was in a position to certify that the offence was trivial.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to accept these suggestions. I think that the penalties provided by the licensing code are adequate to combat abuses.  For instance, an unauthorised person found on licensed premises after hours can be fined up to £5; and for selling him drink, a licensee can be fined up to £20 for a first offence and £40 for a second offence and his licence may be endorsed at the discretion of the court. What has happened is, as I mentioned earlier, that in recent years many of the District Justices have imposed very small fines when a charge has been proven&mdash;on occasions the fines have been as low as a shilling or even a penny&mdash;taking the view, apparently, that the licensing hours are inadequate for the reasonable needs of the drinking public and that the law on the subject has not regard for the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that when the law relating to licensing hours has been settled afresh by the Oireachtas, the courts will do their part.  I should be reluctant, on principle, to prescribe minimum statutory penalties.  I feel that the courts should be allowed to exercise a discretion in the matter of the penalties they impose, subject to a maximum prescribed by law.  I should <Col N="957" /> not like to see the principle of compulsory endorsement given a new trial, though I must admit that during the 19 years when it obtained, it was a powerful deterrent on publicans who were minded to take a chance on selling drink during prohibited hours.  Let us hope that we are not driven to using such measures again.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that the Government have given very careful consideration to the many serious issues involved in fixing licensing hours.  It has not been easy to determine where exactly the lines should be drawn but the Government have endeavoured to act in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that it is the Government's intention that when the Bill becomes law, it will be strictly enforced and there will be no periods of grace allowed after the clock has struck for closing time.  It is no secret that up to now, and particularly in recent years, the law has not been rigidly enforced and indeed, as I said at the outset, the Government believe that rigid enforcement was not possible in the absence of the support of public opinion.  That is one of the principal reasons why the Bill has been introduced. But that phase, demoralising alike to publicans, to the general public and to the Garda Síochána, will be over with the passing of this Bill. Nobody should be in any doubt about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the payment of £3,636 as compensation to the former chairman of the board of C.I.E.  The section states the reason for this provision is that the former chairman retired on the grounds of ill health.  I think it is fairly common knowledge&mdash;it is an open secret&mdash;that the reason given for his retirement in this section is not, in fact, the true reason for his retirement. Before this section is passed, I should like to hear the Minister further on that point.</P>
      <P>It is common knowledge, particularly amongst C.I.E. employees, that Mr. Courtney was appointed under the 1950 Act for a term of five years expiring in 1955 and reappointed in 1955 for a further five years which terminate on 31st May, 1960.  However, in fact, he retired on 31st August 1958.  It will be recalled that for many months we in this House were discussing transport policy and transport legislation until the Bill came before us.  My information is&mdash;and it is fairly common knowledge&mdash;that during the passage of that legislation through this House, all the members of the board of C.I.E., including the chairman, were given notice to quit and that from a certain date they operated on a purely month to month basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the board came to be re-appointed&mdash;certainly the appointments were made&mdash;I understand that the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Taoiseach, intimated to the then Chairman that he was not to be reappointed. I should like to know from the Minister now whether or not that is correct.  That story is being bandied round the country since.  It is in the interests of everybody, the Minister himself included, to make a statement as to whether or not it is true.  Did Mr. Courtney voluntarily tender his resignation on the grounds <Col N="961" /> of ill health or was it conveyed to him by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Taoiseach, that he should tender his resignation for other reasons?  Before the section is passed, I feel that we should have a clear and straight statement from the Minister on that matter.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the reason given in the section is the valid and correct one, some further comment is surely called for because I feel it introduces a new principle, particularly so far as the officers and servants of C.I.E. are concerned.  The position is that this payment of £3,636 is made up on three bases: loss of retirement gratuity, £300; loss on an actuarial basis, £792; and the difference between the pension and the pay for the balance of the period less tax, £2,544.</P>
    <P>Is this new principle to extend beyond the chairman?  Is it to extend to the general manager, the traffic manager, district superintendents, station masters, goods agents, clerks, conciliation grades?  Are those who retire before the ordinary retirement age on the ground of ill health to be compensated in the same fashion based on their salary or their wage?  I think what is good for one officer or employee should be good for the other.  If the Minister will now tell me that this is a new departure, a new approach, and the adoption of a new principle, I shall certainly support it, but if it is a special provision, I think we are taking it out of its proper perspective.</P>
    <P>The former chairman, we are given to understand from the reply to a question put by Deputy Corry on 28th last month, is already in receipt of a pension of £1,743 15s. arising out of other services to the State and to local authorities.  He is still, of course, in spite of his ill-health, director of C.I.E. for which he receives a stipend of £500.  The total annual income because of his past services and present part-time service to the board of C.I.E. is £2,243 15s.  We propose in this Bill to give him a further Christmas box of £3,636 because of the fact that he did not complete his service with C.I.E. for reasons of ill-health.</P>
    <P>Again, I must ask is this provision <Col N="962" /> to be extended to all officers and employees of C.I.E.?  I had occasion here earlier this year to inquire into the superannuation scheme for other grades in the board's service.  The question was down for answer on 29th April and I discovered that on that date the number of superannuated conciliation employees of the board numbered 2,461 people.  The question elicited the further information that of that 2,461 people, 1,094, approximately 50 per cent. of all the retired C.I.E. wages grade staff, were in receipt of pensions of not more than 12/- per week.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that most of the 1,094 are people who have given 30 and 40 years' service to the board of C.I.E. and its predecessors&mdash;the Great Southern Railways and the Great Southern and Western Railway &mdash;people who never enjoyed anything more than a very depressed rate of income during the time they served in the board.  I think it is singularly inappropriate that at a time when almost 50 per cent. of retired C.I.E. people are on a miserable pension of 12/- per week or less, we should approach the particular problem of a man who is already in receipt of a pension of £1,743, plus an annual income of £500 in director's salary in this way, that we should say that C.I.E. cannot afford any more for their conciliation grade employees and, at the same time, bring this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept my suggestion that he should inform the House and the country, first, as to the circumstances in which the former Chairman retired from the Board; secondly, as to why he finds it possible to make these extraordinarily generous provisions for a particular man, while other former employees of the Board are being doled out pittances; and, thirdly, whether the principle involved in this section is to extend to all executives, officers and employees of the board in future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy this Bill deals only with the provision of pensions for whole-time members of the board.  It has no relation to any other principle of superannuation <Col N="963" /> operating in C.I.E. The position of the Chairman is one of immense responsibility in a business with a number of branches covering rail and road transport, hotels, sea vessels and, up to now, the operation of the canals.  The turnover is some £15,000,000 a year.  The position of the Chairman is different in this case from that of any other person employed in C.I.E. and I do not propose to make comparisons, because no comparison can be made.</P>
      <P>This Bill refers to the case of the former Chairman and I can assure the Deputy that the former Chairman tendered his resignation on the grounds of ill health.  In fact, he had experienced some prolonged periods of illness prior to his resignation.  The operation of the new Transport Act of 1958 involves in some respects even greater responsibilities than those incurred under the old Transport Act of 1950.  I am quite sure the Chairman tendered his resignation on the grounds that he felt unable to carry out his duties under the new Act and that it was best for him in his own interest to retire.  These are the facts and I am sure the Deputy will accept them.</P>

      <P>If the Minister now categorically states that the former Chairman of the board of C.I.E. was not invited by the Taoiseach to tender his resignation, there is no course open to me but to accept that.  There are many interested people who will view it in another way but here in this House, I accept it.  So long as the Minister has said it, I shall accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I made, and which I think the Minister has not answered, was whether or not this principle was to extend further from the Chairman to the other officers and servants of the board so that a man who retires before the normal retirement age because of ill health will be compensated in this manner.  The Minister simply said that, of course, the Chairman had tremendous responsibility.  Nobody knows that better than I do.  I appreciate that fully and it is reflected in the salary he is paid in comparison with the salary or wages enjoyed by other people who contribute their service and labour to the board.  Nobody will suggest <Col N="964" /> that the compensation should be at the same level, but would the Minister say whether the principle is to be extended to employees of the board?  Naturally, the porter, guard, or ticket checker who is earning £6 or £7 a week would not be on the same scale as the Chairman or executive, but I am asking if the principle is to be extended to him, which I would support, that he should be compensated, because of his early retirement, on the basis of the wages he is earning?</P>
    <P>Arising out of that question, I have found that already there are on the pension list of C.I.E. 282 pensioners who retired before the normal retirement age because of ill-health.  There are 282 pensioners who did not find it possible to work on to the age of 65 and who were medically certified as being unfit for duty.  I find that the compensation they receive ranges from 7/6d. per week to 51/3d. per week. None of them is getting more than £2 11s. 3d. per week and many of them, because of their early retirement owing to ill-health, are getting the miserable stipend of 7/6d. per week.  That was, of course, before we had this new principle enshrined in legislation, but, because it is here enshrined for any full-time member of the board in future, as far as I can see, I want to know will the Minister give further consideration to the unfortunate people who have to go out from the wages grade, the clerical grade and even the executive grade and for whom no such provision is made?  Will the Minister further consider the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this section because we do not think the Minister has made a case against our proposition that a Select Committee of the House would be a more desirable method of deciding on the merits of the proposal to increase the salaries of the Judiciary.  Our belief in that proposition is based on the fact that we think the members of the Judiciary, in the assessment of their rights to an increase in remuneration, are in a particularly difficult position from the point of view of the assessment of the relative merits of the different members of the Judiciary.  We feel that the wisest procedure the Government could adopt would be to accept the proposition to set up a Select Committee. I believe that we here are not competent to decide whether or not this flat 10 per cent. increase is merited equally over all the different sections of the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>As a reasonably effective demonstration of our ignorance in this regard, I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the reply which I received to a Parliamentary Question to-day which was put down in order to try to elicit information upon which I might do my best to come to some conclusion about the merits of the proposal which the Minister now has before the Dáil, that is, Section 1.  In order to try to decide whether the 10 per cent. increase was or was not well merited, I asked the Minister for Finance to state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>... the net gain in income made by (a) Supreme Court judges and (b) High Court judges following the recent budgetary concessions to surtax payers.</P>
      <P>In reply to that question, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of persons comprised in each of the categories in (a) and (b) of the Deputy's question is so small that to supply the information asked for would not accord with the principle of observing secrecy in relation to the taxation <Col N="971" /> affairs of taxpayers.  For that reason, I regret that I cannot give the information requested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we have the Minister for Justice, in clear unambiguous terms at column 658, Volume 177, of the Official Report, trying to make a case for these increases, saying:</P>
    <P>In view of the Deputy's reference to income tax, I was interested to know how much of the increase will be recovered by the State in that way, and when I went into the matter I made a rather interesting discovery.  The proposed increase for the Chief Justice is £485.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that if he were to disclose information to me, it &ldquo;would not accord with the principle of observing secrecy in relation to the taxation affairs of taxpayers&rdquo; but the Minister for Justice is on record as having told us here what the Chief Justice will pay in taxation on the increase. He was generous enough to tell us&mdash;pretty specifically and unambiguously&mdash;that the President of the High Court and Supreme Court judges would get £370.  He went on to tell us that judges of the Circuit Court would get so much, and I think he ended at that.</P>
    <P>I want to protest against the scandalous decision of the Taoiseach to-day in trying to obstruct&mdash;and succeeding in obstructing&mdash;a Deputy in a bona fide attempt to discharge his duties.  I was attempting to obtain information to which I am perfectly entitled, as the statement of the Minister for Justice proves.  I think it was particularly scandalous of the Taoiseach to attempt to engage in this deliberate obstruction of a Deputy in the discharge of his public duties by advancing the principle of the secrecy of the taxation payments made by individual citizens in our society.  I think it was a particularly shabby display.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Bill, we have made a suggestion which we believe would have met one of the objections which must arise when a Bill of this kind is brought before the House, that is, the undesirable discussion of the more personal details of comparable income, and such-like factors, which must arise if a one-sided proposition is put before the House.  If the Minister would only accept our suggestion, then an agreed proposition could come before the House and, as in 1953, there would be more or less unanimous acceptance of the proposition.  Certainly there would not have been the detailed criticism which it is our bounden duty, as members of an Opposition, to make about the proposals which have been put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very surprised at the Minister's curious criticism of the Opposition in his reply to the debate.  I am particularly surprised at the Minister, an honourable politician of 30 or 40 years' standing, accepting the pejorative interpretation of the idea of politics or politicians generally when he says, as reported at column 653 of the Official Report: &ldquo;In opening my remarks, I must express regret that the subject matter of this Bill was dragged into the political arena by some of the Deputies&rdquo;.  What on earth does the Minister mean by that phrase?  He comes along here with a sectional proposition concerning the payment to be made to some of our highest civil servants.  An offer is made to him to remove the sectional colouring the Bill necessarily has, since it is a Government proposition and not a proposition put forward by the whole House, and he rejects that offer.  He brings forward this Bill to this House which is a <Col N="973" /> deliberative Assembly, which is the chief political Assembly of the nation, of which all of us are political members, and of which he is a politician. What is wrong with politics?  Why should we be ashamed of discussing this matter in a political way?  Politics are the art of government.  We differ in our view of it and in the interpretation of the different forms of government. Why should we not discuss this question in a mature and informed political way, in so far as we can do so?  It was the Minister who introduced the politics in making and insisting on keeping to a strictly one-Party proposition.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister, in relation to the proposition we put forward here, could accept our suggestion that comparisons with higher civil servants are permissible, our justification for that, if any justification be needed, is, as we have pointed out, that the case put forward by the judiciary themselves in 1953 showed comparisons with the increases of pay rates made to the different grades of civil servants at different times.  Equally, when Deputy G. Boland was Minister for Justice and was introducing the Courts of Justice Bill, 1953, he made reference to the payments of civil servants over the years and to the increases paid to them.  Therefore, we are not the only ones who believe there is a good reason to associate the increases proposed here in the minds of other people with the increases or payments made to civil servants, whether higher civil servants or the highest civil servants &mdash;secretaries, assistant secretaries, principal officers, assistant principal officers, executive officers of one kind or another and the other grades.</P>
    <P>I think most Deputies honestly believe there is a very good case for consideration of the need for an increase in salaries in respect of some members of the Judiciary, particularly in respect of the District Justices who are the lowest paid.  Of the others, I would say that the highest paid are very well paid.  As to the Circuit Court judges, I simply do not know.  That is why I think a competent committee of the House is the best body to examine the facts and come to a decision in relation to them.  However, in relation to <Col N="974" /> the District Justices, I think most Deputies would concede that probably the best case was made by Deputy Seán Flanagan for an increase to the Judiciary and a substantial increase to the district justices.</P>
    <P>The case was made by the previous Minister for Justice on his Courts of Justice Bill when he said that, whatever might happen in relation to the Circuit Court, in relation to District Justices, a Bill of that type would certainly increase the work which would have to be done by them.  We doubt if the principle laid down for assessing the merits of this award is the principle laid down for the rest of the workers in society here by the Taoiseach, that, before any demand for increases in wages or salaries can be looked for, there must be an increase in output.  I see no reason why a similar clause could not be observed in relation to members of the Judiciary.  I have every reason to believe that, in relation to the lower courts, this has certainly been observed.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to enlighten us as to whether the higher courts have increased their turnover of work to the extent which would merit serious consideration of the granting of this award.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to raise is in relation to this question of a principle.  At column 655 of the Official Report the Minister says: &ldquo;This does not involve any new principle.&rdquo; Possibly he is right.  However, I think there is this consideration in relation to wage and salary increases granted to the other members of society, namely, that it is usually given as a 10/6, or a 12/6, increase.  A flat fixed sum is given to everybody, whether earning £5, £9, or whatever it may be, per week.  I should like the Minister to justify this flat lump sum increase for the higher members of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The total increase proposed here is equal, as far as I can make out, to the annual income of probably nearly 70 per cent. of ordinary workers in the community.  In that set of circumstances, where these people are already getting £4,000 a year, the case has not been made by the Minister.  No matter <Col N="975" /> what may be the facts behind his suggestion, he has not given the facts clearly in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister was rather impatient of our suggestion that a Committee should be set up because they would have only this question of the increase in salaries to consider.  We also included the very important question of the system of appointments, but if that were not sufficient I would ask the Minister to read the 1951 Courts of Justice Bill debate.  He would there find what I certainly found to be a most enlightening, informative and valuable contribution by Deputy Moran, the Minister for Lands, concerning badly-needed legal reforms which could be brought within the ambit of any Committee set up as proposed by us.</P>

      <P>Very well, Sir.  I should like to take up this question of retrospection.  One of the most telling points made in this whole debate was made by Deputy Murphy in a speech in which he asked the Minister&mdash;and I should like the Minister to deal with it&mdash;why, in connection with these proposed increases, the Minister has sought retrospective payment for the best part of a year, while he is a member of a Cabinet whose recent Budget refused even an immediate increase to the old age pensioners. There was a concerted effort by the Government Party, through its spokesmen, Deputy Loughman, Deputy Seán Flanagan and, to a limited extent, the Minister himself, to squeeze out of the discussion consideration of the relative needs of the old age pensioner <i>vis-á-vis</i> the members of the Judiciary.</P>

      <P>The case made by the Minister in introducing this Bill was that because of the increase in the cost <Col N="976" /> of living these people with £4,000 or £5,000 a year, finding the price of bread and butter had gone up, required £400 or £500 a year to meet those increases.  If the Minister is discussing the cost of living and its impact on these people who get £4,000 or £5,000 a year, it is relevant to point out that there is a section which he appears to have overlooked in his assessment of the relative needs of our people in relation to the public purse, that is, the old age pensioner.</P>

      <P>It would be wise for the Minister to reconsider this whole matter.  We believe a case has been made to increase the remuneration of a certain section of the Judiciary but we do not feel competent to decide how much that increase should be.  In respect of the different sections of the Judiciary, it is unfair to include the members of the Supreme Court, who are very well paid, with the District Justices who are relatively poorly paid. We also believe the Minister should accept the principle of arbitration, which has been accepted to a certain extent in so far as the Minister has considered and agreed to the demands of this section.  This arbitration machinery should have been representative of all the sections of the community represented in this House. In that way the Minister would have been saved opprobrium and the rather contentious debate which has taken place.  He has nobody but himself to blame for that.</P>

      <P>I should like to urge on the Minister at this stage that he might take a fresh look at this proposal and consider the whole question, as he himself suggested, in an atmosphere away from political considerations, and to suggest to him that what was done in 1953 might with profit be repeated on this occasion, that is, the setting up of a Select Committee which could consider all the aspects of this question including the relative emoluments of the judges and justices of the various courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not too late yet to adopt that course.  I believe that the adoption of the precedent which was so successful and, I think, so satisfactory, in 1953 would commend itself not only to the House but to the country.  The matter would be considered from all aspects with full information being provided for the Committee, on which representatives of all shades of political opinion in this House would act. From the example of the precedent which worked successfully in 1953, the Minister and the House might expect to get a satisfactory recommendation. <Col N="978" /> I feel that the Minister might, at this stage, consider that course and that it would have the approval of all sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to this section is, as I mentioned on the Second Stage of the Bill, the fact that the Minister has departed from the principle adopted in 1947 and in 1953 of a graduated scale.  In reply to my point on the Second Stage, the Minister stated that he could not continue adjusting salaries on a graduated scale.  I disagree with the Minister and I should like to reiterate my point.  The present position is that there is a difference between the salary payable to a country justice and a Supreme Court judge of £1,950.  If this flat percentage increase is put into effect, that difference will be further increased.</P>
      <P>I submit, with all respect to judges of the Supreme Court, that the whole basis of law in this country centres on the work carried out by the District Justices throughout the country.  An increase of 10 per cent.  to a District Justice drawing £1,750 a year is far too low.  I did suggest, but I was ruled out of order, that the principle of the graduated scale should be reapplied to bring the District Justice to something just over £2,000, which I feel is a moderate figure, and to reduce the graduation down to approximately 5 per cent. in the case of the Chief Justice&mdash;in effect, to award a flat rate of £250 all round.</P>
      <P>In suggesting that, I am not objecting to the proposal to recommend this question to a Select Committee of the House but I would have preferred if the proposers had included with the whole question of the salaries of the Judiciary other considerations such as the system of appointing District Justices, the present cost of litigation in this State, and certain procedural delays which, in their own way, add to the cost.  In other words, if there is to be an inquiry by a Select Committee into the salaries of the Judiciary, the Minister should avail of the opportunity to go further afield and go into the whole question of law and its administration, with particular regard to its cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> It should not be overlooked, as was mentioned by, I think, Deputy Flanagan, that the District Justices deal with approximately 90 per cent. of the criminal cases&mdash;subject of course to cases that come under appeal &mdash;and about 60 per cent. of the civil cases.  Having regard to that, it is a very poor recognition of their services to offer them a comparatively miserly sum of £150 as an increase&mdash;the first increase for six years&mdash;against £370 for members of the Supreme Court and, of course, almost £500 for the chief justice.  I do not pretend to know how the salary scales payable to the Judiciary compare with those in other countries, but we must have some regard to the fact that we are a comparatively poor and small country. Of necessity, as mentioned during the debate, our payments to all sections of the community, and particularly to the poorest class of the community, must be less than is paid in richer and larger countries.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal again to the Minister to continue with the principle adopted on two previous occasions, in 1947 and 1953.  I think it would at least offer a modicum of justice to District Justices while at the same time giving what is an adequate increase to members of the Supreme Court.  It should not be overlooked, and I think it is relevant, that the recent adjustments to the surtax and income tax rates were far more beneficial to people in the higher salary class than to those in the lower class. I suggest that the increase in the ceiling of the surtax and the reduction in the standard rate of income tax must have been worth £250 a year to those on the highest rate of the Judiciary scale.  Of course, to a country Justice at the bottom of the scale the increase in the surtax meant little or nothing, only £5 or £6.  I again ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and to refer to a Select Committee not only the whole question in relation to salaries but also the question of costs generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to add a word or two to what has been said on this section.  Here is a proposal that there should be a flat 10 <Col N="980" /> per cent. increase on all the effective salaries.  The manner in which that proposal is put forward seems to suggest that there has not been the kind of consideration given to this matter which it should have had.  I repeat what I said already, and what has been said by other Deputies, that the way this Bill came into this House was bad and was bound to lead to a discussion which many Deputies might have preferred to avoid.  The proper way would have been to do what has been done successfully in the past, that is, to have the whole matter examined by a Select Committee.  Such a Committee could consider the question of salaries with which we are now concerned and if necessary other related matters.</P>
      <P>I suggest on this section that instead of asking the House to vote for this flat 10 per cent.  increase the Minister would be doing a real service to the House and to the country if at this stage he would not press the proposal contained in the Bill but instead set up a Select Committee so that the matter could be examined fully and dispassionately. As has been pointed out, that was the procedure adopted on two previous occasions.  It in no way avoids responsibility by the House but it would be a businesslike and proper way of facing up to this problem.  I should like to join with Deputy Cosgrave and other Deputies in urging that course on the Minister, even at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say briefly that I join with the other Deputies who have pleaded with the Minister to appoint a Select Committee of this House.  It was done before and it worked very satisfactorily.  I was one of the Deputies who had the privilege of serving on that committee. We went into the matter very thoroughly and we reached agreement which, I think, gave satisfaction to all the parties concerned.  We have here the formal legislative Assembly of this country and as Deputy Dr. Browne has said, we are a political body and can legislate on this matter, if we really so wish.  There is no question that the House should not do that, but, in this particular instance, we are not suited to go into the details of the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> To my mind this is a matter into which the question of surtax, and so on, enters.  It is a matter for discussion and for the production of figures which are impossible to obtain in the ordinary course of debate, even on Committee Stage.  I would say that what appears to be a £400 a year increase to the highest members of the judiciary is not, in fact, anything like that, when one takes into account the taxation which must be paid on it.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the scale, we have the question of payment to District Justices.  That should be gone into and I consider that more evidence should be heard in connection with it. It has been done before in this House. There are many people who, perhaps, feel that the Government propose to be over-generous at one end of the scale, while, at the other end, they are too niggardly.  That is something about which the ordinary member in this Assembly feels he cannot get sufficient information.  It is a subject that is not one for debate.  It is appropriate to committee work, for the production of evidence and figures to a small committee, and I would urge on the Minister that this is a matter very much suited to a special committee. It would avoid embarrassment and difficulties and I am sure, with representatives of all the parties concerned, agreement could be worked out quite easily, agreement that would give justice to both ends of the scale and to those in the middle also.</P>

The Deputy knows very well when I was speaking on the loss that judges would incur through the medium of income tax, I was making a calculation any member of the House could have made just as easily.  I was making a calculation on the judges' salaries.  The Deputy himself could have done that, but what he was looking for today was a different thing.  He was trying to find out what surtax judges were paying, in order to find out what incomes judges had over and above the salaries they are entitled to.</P>

      <P>The question of a special committee has been raised, and at this stage appeals have been made to do something that would apparently solve a whole lot of difficulties.  That might solve the difficulties of some of the people who find themselves in a difficult position, but it would not solve any difficulties for me.  I want to make it clear that when a Select Committee was set up in 1953, it was set up for a definite purpose, to find out what increases, if any, should be given to judges; whether they were entitled to pensions; whether, if they should die, their widows should be given pensions; and I think another point had to do with death gratuities. I am not too sure about that but I believe these were the points which that committee had to decide.</P>
      <P>I have already stated that this is only a question of making some recompense to the judges for the 15 per cent. rise in the cost of living.  No Select Committee is necessary to decide whether they are entitled to that or not.  The Government, in their wisdom or otherwise, instead of giving 15 per cent. decided to give 10 per cent. and that is all we are discussing at the present time&mdash;whether the judges are entitled to that increase upon which the Government have decided. As far as I am concerned I am standing over this Bill and I can see no reason whatsoever for a Select Committee. I do not propose to make any recommendation to the Government in respect of it.</P>

    <Col N="984" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Minister that when the Select Committee was set up in 1953 the principal matter for discussion, decision and recommendation was the question of salary increases, but in order to deal with a number of outstanding items, genuine matters of complaint on the part of the Judiciary, it was decided to include a number of other matters as well as the question of salaries.  In the memorandum submitted by the judges and justices the main emphasis is on the question of the necessity for a big increase in salaries, due to the radical change in the value of money since 1938.  They were more concerned with the question of making their case for an increase in remuneration than dealing with the other matters which were part of the work of the Select Committee.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, therefore, the argument today is just as strong for setting up a Select Committee as it was in 1953.  The Minister&mdash;and for this I compliment him&mdash;wants to stand over the decision the Government have taken but nobody would suggest that the Minister was weak if he agreed to a more-or-less unanimous proposal from the House.  It would be a more desirable way of dealing with the matter from the points of view of the general public, the Judiciary themselves and the members of the House if there is unanimous agreement on how to decide the increases to be given.</P>
      <P>The Minister has his view and the Government have theirs but the other side of the House are entitled to their views also.  Surely when it is a matter of the public purse and a question of dealing with the Judiciary in the fairest possible manner without having them dragged willy-nilly through all the debate, it would be much more desirable to have that done in a nonpartisan way through a Select Committee? The Minister would not lose &ldquo;face&rdquo; by acceding to a democratic request on the part of quite a large percentage of the public.  It would only strengthen his position to display a very democratic outlook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has at his disposal sufficient Deputies to put his point of view across in the House and he can <Col N="985" /> win the battle so far as forces are concerned. He can steamroll this measure through but in so doing he is not gaining, shall I say, the goodwill of a large section of the House and of the community who do not understand all that is involved.  In addition, he is really not doing a service to the Judiciary by putting them in the situation in which the Government decide in their own mind what the Judiciary should get, in spite of very genuine objections by members of the House and people outside it.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is too late, but I feel that the Minister on other occasions has been open to a fair proposal. I have no doubt that members of his own Party&mdash;indeed, quite a number&mdash; would prefer to see this matter thrashed out in Committee.  They will obey the Party Whip but the question arises of what the Taoiseach himself said in the debate.  He suggested that every Deputy was just as capable of deciding in his own mind what increase the Judiciary should get as any Select Committee.  In other words, he said each Deputy was as competent to deal with the question of what the Judiciary should get as a Select Committee. I put it to the Minister that every Deputy in that sense is not in <Col N="986" /> a position to decide whether the Judiciary should get a 10 per cent. flat increase all round or whether there should be graded increases with the emphasis on what the District Justices should get.  I suggest it is not left to the individual's discretion when the Party Whips have to be applied.</P>
    <P>I think a great case could be made for the Minister's changing his mind in a matter of this kind.  Instead of deserving criticism, I think he would earn admiration and congratulation because there will be a better result in the long run.  If the Minister goes back on the Second Reading debate, he will find suggestions made in regard to matters to which Deputy McGilligan referred.  The Taoiseach also referred to some matters which he is hoping will be dealt with in the near future. These could also be dealt with by the Select Committee.  Apart from the question of increases in remuneration, there are a number of items bearing upon remuneration which could and should be put to the Select Committee. Finally, I appeal to the Minister to consider the suggestion again in a more favourable manner.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before the section, in Part II, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;office&rdquo; means an office being either the office of Clerk of Dáil Éireann or the office of Clerk-Assistant of Dáil Éireann;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Chairman&rdquo; means the Chairman of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>(2)  (a) Subject to subsection (3) of this section, each of the following officers, namely the Clerk of Dáil Éireann, and the Clerk-Assistant of Dáil Éireann, shall be appointed by the Taoiseach on the joint recommendation of the Chairman and the Minister.</P>
      <P>(b) Where the Chairman and the Minister are satisfied that no member of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas is suitable for appointment to an office, they may, under paragraph (a) of this subsection, recommend for appointment to that office a person who is not a member of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>(3)  (a) If the Chairman and the Minister fail to agree on a recommendation of a person for appointment to an office, then, the Taoiseach shall nominate a person for appointment to that office and shall, with the concurrence of Dáil Éireann, appoint that person to that office.</P>
      <P>(b) Where the Taoiseach is satisfied that no member of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas is suitable for appointment to an office, he may under paragraph (a) of this subsection nominate for appointment to that office a person who is not a member of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points raised on the Second Reading was this point of the appointment of the officers of both <Col N="991" /> Houses, that is, the Clerk and Assistant Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk of the Seanad.  As I expressed during the debate here, the present system has lasted for many years and, although I cannot claim that it is entirely satisfactory, I said on that occasion that nothing had been suggested to me that appeared to be better.  The system in operation since these Houses were set up was that the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance made a recommendation to the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach made the appointment. The same, of course, applied to the Seanad.  That was the system and the difficulty about that was the difficulty that was raised here, that if the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance disagreed, there is no means of determining what will happen.  In an attempt to meet that contingency, I put in this amendment.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment is that where the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance agree on a candidate, then the Taoiseach, as Leader of the House, will appoint that candidate; but that, where they disagree, the Taoiseach, as Leader of the House, will nominate a person, whether it be the nominee of the Minister for Finance&mdash;which is more likely, I admit, than the nominee of the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;or the nominee of the Ceann Comhairle, or another person. He would at least have to make a good case for his nominee because he would have to get the approval of the Dáil and he would, of course, be subject to facing a discussion in the Dáil on the matter.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is no harm to refer to the amendment suggested by Deputy Sweetman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we might discuss the two together.  Would it not be easier for everybody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has suggested that, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach and the Leaders of the parties as laid down under another Act, that is, the Leaders of the principal Opposition Parties, the Ceann <Col N="992" /> Comhairle would then make the appointment.</P>
      <P>The principle which I tried to follow in this Bill all the time was that the Ceann Comhairle would be in much the same position in dealing with staff as a Minister is in his own Department. We have followed that fairly consistently all through.  In the appointment of minor staff, the Civil Service Commissioners will supply the names to him of clerical officers or executive officers or, indeed, of staff such as Reporting Staff and so on, and he will make the appointment.  That would be in line with what a Minister does in his own Department.  But, when we come to the higher positions, the Minister is not permitted to make the appointment of a Secretary to his Department.  That appointment is made by the Government.</P>
      <P>Following that analogy as far as I think we should, I thought that we could allow the old procedure to stand whenever it works smoothly, that is, that the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance would make the recommendation which the Taoiseach would adopt, if they can agree, but, in case of disagreement, the majority of the House would make the appointment. That would be on the nomination of the Taoiseach.  It is assumed, of course, that the Taoiseach will get the majority.  If he does not get the majority, he is no longer Taoiseach. That is all.  Another Taoiseach will have to do the job.  That is my way of looking at it.  I think the House as a whole should have a say in an appointment where there is disagreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment the Minister has introduced has undoubtedly met one of the objections, but only one of the objections, I raised on Second Reading, that is, that there was no provision for what would occur in the event of disagreement between the Minister for Finance and the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when replying to the Second Reading debate and, indeed, today, suggested that the reason he was against the principle which I have set out in my amendment was the analogy that a Minister of State was not entitled to appoint the Secretary of his Department, that the Government <Col N="993" /> made the appointment.  The suggestion I have made is that the Ceann Comhairle must consult with the Minister for Finance, because he is the Minister in charge of the Civil Service, with the Taoiseach, because he is the Leader of the House, and with the Leaders of the principal Opposition Parties as they are defined in the 1938 Act, because it is essential that the Ceann Comhairle, to operate efficiently and satisfactorily, should have the confidence of all sides of the House.  In the Ceann Comhairle to a very large extent is reposed the duty of ensuring that the privileges of the ordinary members of the House are not overridden by the Government of the day.  It is, therefore, particularly necessary in the appointment of his chief officers that there be the same type of confidence.</P>
    <P>The members of the Opposition are not in the same position as members of the Government.  Members of the Government have technical people to advise them in relation to the drafting of Bills, in relation to Standing Orders and so forth.  The Opposition have not as yet&mdash;though the Minister will get a request very shortly in that respect&mdash; that facility, and the whole working of this House can very well fall down, if the Clerk and the Clerk-Assistant of the Dáil are not the type of people who can be approached by Deputies on all sides of the House with problems in relation to motions, to amendments, to Standing Orders and so forth.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, the Minister underlined, and I underlined, that we were discussing this <i>in vacuo</i>, in relation to the future and not on the basis of individual people who happen to hold these offices at the moment.  It is absolutely essential for the proper discharge of his duties that the Ceann Comhairle and his two assistants should have the confidence of the whole House.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, the Minister made a point that very often a Minister brought a name to the Government and that his colleagues in the Government were able to point out to him that he had, perhaps, rather blinded himself to certain aspects of <Col N="994" /> this person&mdash;I think the way the Minister put it was that his colleagues were able to get him to see reason&mdash;and that because of that general discussion, there was more chance of the appointment being one that would be to the general good rather than that of some individual perhaps skilled in one particular aspect only.</P>
    <P>I agree, but surely the Minister is not suggesting that any Government would override a Minister, if the Minister had very strong views and kept to those views in the discussion in relation to the person whom he wanted to be the chief officer or secretary of his Department?  Frankly, I believe the position in that instance would be that, after full discussion with the Government, either the person recommended by the Minister would be appointed, that is, if the Minister was not prepared to change his mind, or the Taoiseach would have to get another Minister for that Department. It would be quite ridiculous to expect in relation to that Department, even with full discussion, that a Minister would be overridden in that way and would continue on with a different chief adviser.</P>
    <P>The scheme I have put forward provides for discussion all round the table so that the Ceann Comhairle can have borne in upon him the strong views that may be held by the Taoiseach, perhaps by the Minister for Finance as head of the Civil Service pushing forward the view of seniority or something like that&mdash;the strong views there can be on all sides&mdash;but that, in the long run, having heard all those strong views, the Ceann Comhairle is speaking for all sections of this House much more so than he and the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach in the way suggested by the Ministerial amendment.  I think the amendment down in our name is the one that preserves to a greater extent the independence of Parliament and that is the reason we put it forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mention it but Deputy Sweetman very kindly mentioned the point I made on the last occasion that whoever it may be&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle, the Taoiseach or <Col N="995" /> anybody else&mdash;he is required by the Act to consult only with certain people.  If he is very keen on a certain person, he can go back to his own person, even though they may think he is not the man for the job.  I have known a number of cases&mdash;I do not know if the Opposition have any experience of it&mdash;where Ministers in making recommendations for the appointment of secretary to a Department were, in my opinion, and in the opinion of some of my colleagues, unduly and unjustifiably prejudiced in favour of a certain official.  That may happen here, too.  It may happen that the Ceann Comhairle at some future time may be influenced in his judgment by having worked so long with a certain man or something like that.  We are rather fortunate discussing this question now because it is not likely that any of those appointments will be made in our time.  We have young men in the positions and we can, therefore, discuss the matter disinterestedly. That is what I am afraid might happen&mdash;that some Ceann Comhairle in the future would be unduly prejudiced in favour of a certain person and that, in spite of consultation and so on, he would go back to that appointment.</P>
      <P>When introducing the Bill, I said I did not think the present system of appointment, apart from the difficulty that arises, was ideal&mdash;that the Minister for Finance and the Ceann Comhairle should make the recommendations. It was all right when the officials were, as they were, part of the Civil Service because the Minister for Finance had some say in it, but under the new conditions, I do not know if the Minister for Finance will have any say at all.  As I said before, it was because I did not hear of any better alternative that I left that provision in the Bill.  I should be glad indeed for some alternative, but I do not like the alternative offered by Deputy Sweetman. I should like to get a better alternative, if possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's amendment is better than the original section but I do not think it goes far enough.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="996" /> might be able to meet me in some degree this way?  Very often, without putting it in a statute, there is an expression on both sides of the House that, before a certain decision is come to, it is desirable that there be consultation. Would the Minister be prepared to express it as his view that, before the appointments are made under the amendments put down here, it would be proper, without putting it in the statute, for either the Minister for Finance of the day, or the Ceann Comhairle of the day to consult the views of the two principal Parties?</P>

      <P>Yes.  Without writing it into the statute, I feel if it were expressed by the Minister, representing the Government, and by our side, representing the principal Opposition Party, that it was desirable that consultation would take place, with the principal Parties as named in Section 10 of the Act of 1938, then I am quite certain that would happen.</P>

As the Deputy has pointed out, this is just a matter of taking a list from the Civil Service Commissioners and there would, therefore, be really <Col N="999" /> no great point in having consultation about it.  But the Chairman of the Seanad might be pressing for another officer and it might be said that he should really appoint two rather than one, or three rather than two.  I think there is a point there.  I would ask the Deputy to allow me to consider the point between now and the Report Stage and, on that Stage, I may be able to introduce something to cover the situation.  I am not sure.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) The Chairman of Dáil Éireann may delegate to the Chairman of Seanad Éireann the powers, in relation to any matter arising directly in connection with the business of Seanad Éireann, exercisable by him under this Act as the appropriate authority in relation to members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and if he does so, then, so long as the delegation remains in force,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  those powers shall, in lieu of being exercisable by the Chairman <Col N="1000" /> of Dáil Éireann, be exercisable by the person who is for the time being the Chairman of Seanad Éireann, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  that person shall, in lieu of the Chairman of Dáil Éireann, be, for the purposes of this Act, the appropriate authority, as respects the exercise of those powers, in relation to members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We had some discussion on this matter on the Second Stage.  The amendment I have tabled is taken straight from a section of the Civil Service Regulation Act.  The Taoiseach had power in relation to members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas. He had a discretionary power of delegating his powers to the Chairman of Dáil Éireann.  I have taken the same section for the purpose of giving the Chairman of Dáil Éireann the power of delegating to the Chairman of Seanad Éireann the necessary powers in relation to members of the joint staff when those members are working in the Seanad.  The powers may be there, inherent in the Bill and without being expressed, but I think it is better that a specific provision should be included as an expression of the desire of the House, in relation to staff working for the Seanad, that the Dáil should not interfere with such staff in the performance of their duties for the other House.  As far as possible, the two Houses should be kept segregated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 is my effort to give the Chairman of the Seanad control over the joint staff while the Seanad is sitting.  Anybody connected with the Seanad, when it is sitting, would be under his control&mdash; for instance, the reporting staff, and the ushers who would be dealing with admissions and so forth.  Anything connected with the sitting of the <Col N="1001" /> Seanad would be covered by Amendment No. 9.  The Chairman of the Seanad would have power to suspend. We have to be very careful how far we go there because we cannot have two people ultimately responsible.  We could only, therefore, allow the Chairman of the Seanad to suspend, and we give him power to remove the suspension again. If he thinks the offence is really grave, he can actually leave the suspension operative for a considerable period. When he removes the suspension, however, the Chairman of Dáil Éireann comes back into the picture again; it is he who will make up his mind as to whether the officer should be dismissed, reinstated without further penalty, or even, if he considers the suspension too severe, whether the officer should be paid for all or part of the period during which he was suspended.</P>
      <P>I thought this amendment No. 9 would meet the Deputy's point.  I think the Deputy goes too far.  He is handing discipline over completely to the Chairman of the Seanad.  That would create an impossible situation.  One man must ultimately be responsible. If the Chairman of the Seanad has complete control during the sitting of the Seanad over officers and members of the staff there, I think that is sufficient. He will have power to suspend. It will be up to him also to decide when the suspension will be removed. I ask the Deputy to have another look at my amendment to see if he might agree with me in that.  I am quite prepared to accept amendment No. 8 which asks the Ceann Comhairle to listen to the Chairman of the Seanad before there is any dismissal.  I have no objection to everybody being heard and, from that point of view, the amendment does not do any harm.  All points of view should be considered before an officer is actually dismissed. I am quite prepared to accept amendment No. 8.</P>

There are matters which arise in the getting out of the debates, the Order Papers and so forth.  I shall be quite frank with the Minister.  I am not quite happy about amendment No. 7 in my name and I am not quite happy about amendment No. 9.  Perhaps we can have a look at both later, between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>(2)  The Chairman may suspend from duty a civil servant to whom this section applies who, at a meeting of Seanad Éireann at which he is in attendance, is guilty of grave misconduct warranting disciplinary action.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Chairman may terminate the suspension of a civil servant to whom this section applies who is suspended under subsection (2) of this section.</P>
      <P>(4)  Where the Chairman terminates, under subsection (3) of this section, the suspension of a civil servant to whom this section applies and restores him to duty&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the appropriate authority, if satisfied that considerations of equity so require, shall direct that ordinary remuneration, in whole or in part, as the appropriate authority may direct, shall be paid to that civil servant in respect of the period of suspension.</P>

    <P>(5)  Where the suspension of a civil servant to whom this section applies is terminated by his dismissal from office, the appropriate authority, if considerations of equity so require, shall direct that ordinary remuneration in whole or in part, as the appropriate authority may direct, be paid to him in respect of the period of suspension.</P>
    <P>(6)  (a)  Save in accordance with subsections (4) or (5) of this section, a civil servant to whom this section applies who is suspended shall not be paid remuneration in respect of the period of suspension.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where a civil servant to whom this section applies is suspended and satisfies the appropriate authority that, by reason of the prolongation of the investigation of his case, undue hardship is being caused, nothing in paragraph (a) of this sub-section shall prevent the appropriate authority from authorising, for the mitigation of hardship, payment of such portion, as the appropriate authority thinks fit, of the remuneration which would, but for his suspension, have been payable to that civil servant.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I must accept that they are out of order.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 26 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 26 has the effect, in relation to one of the persons named, of adding six years to his actual service for the purpose of computing his pension.  In the case of the other person concerned, it has the effect of giving him credit for 13 years' service which he had in the Garda Síochána and for which, under the Superannuation Acts, he would not otherwise get credit.</P>
      <P>I made it quite clear on Second Reading that so far as we, in this Party, are concerned, we were not raising any objection to the steps being taken by the Minister in this section in so far as the two persons are concerned, but that we felt very strongly, and we feel very strongly, that what is being done for one person, or two people, should be done for other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first amendment to this section in my name was designed to give to other members of the staffs of the Houses who might be under the age limit and forced to retire before they would receive their full pension, the same addition of six years' service as the Superintendent is getting, or, if the effect of six years' additional service to the person concerned would go over 40 years, then such period as would be necessary.  The House is aware that the maximum pension which any civil servant of the State or the Government can get under the Superannuation Acts is based on 40 years' pensionable service.  I cannot, for the life of me, see why the Minister who must have known that the amendment, as proposed by me, would be out of order under the Standing Orders <Col N="1006" /> of the House, has not put down an amendment in similar terms himself.</P>
    <P>It seems to be common justice that what is being done for one person should be done for anyone else who is involved.  It is, to put it mildly, most invidious that out of all the employees in this building, two people, and two people only, are picked out for special service pensionable terms, that they should be picked out and have given to them under this Bill, by this <i>ad hoc</i> section, an increase in their pension such as is being given here.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am not raising this in any spirit of objection to the two individuals who are named, but we have very strong views that what is being done for one should be done for others. There are people who have served this House well and faithfully since it was established, who, because of the age limit, will go out on pension when they reach the age of 65 years without getting the maximum pension.  They are just as entitled&mdash;and indeed, if I may say so, because of their long service and not because of any personalities, more entitled&mdash;to the special terms in the section as are those two persons named.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it would be common justice to apply to everybody who is in the service of the two Houses of the Oireachtas on the date specified in this section, 1st June, 1959, the same benefits and the same addition to the normal pension calculated under the Superannuation Acts as are being given to two people.  There is no valid argument as to why these two particularly should be picked out as against others and should be given an increase which others are not being given.</P>
    <P>I want to say at once that I appreciate&mdash;and I want to express my appreciation of&mdash;the courtesy of the Minister in giving me all the information for which I asked to enable us to come to a decision in relation to this section.  There are other members of the staff who will get the &ldquo;knock&rdquo; because they will have to go out at 65 without full service.  There are other members of the staff, just like the person specified in sub-section (2), who served in the Garda Síochána but will not get credit for their service in <Col N="1007" /> the Garda Síochána unless the Minister introduces some amendment on the lines and on the type of an amendment I had put down.</P>
    <P>We must remember, too, in relation to people in this House, that there is a very big difference between their service and the service in Ministerial Departments of State outside.  In Departments outside, there are very many more adequate openings for promotion., etc., than there are here.  For that reason alone, it would be meritorious and desirable to ensure that where, because of age, they would not get the full pension, their cases will now be met.  The Minister inserted these special provisions, not anyone else.  When he himself saw fit to include special provisions for two, then, in equity and in justice they ought also be made to apply to everybody concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Sweetman, on the Second Stage I drew the Minister's attention to the problem.  I am surprised that, in the amendments submitted by the Minister, something has not been done in relation to this section.  I did not put down an amendment; I knew it would not stand.  However, like Deputy Sweetman, I am surprised to find that the Minister has not gone a little farther to show not generosity but justice to the members of the staff.</P>
      <P>We are all in favour of giving the consideration for which the Minister asks to the people mentioned here but why put us in the false position of accepting a Bill that, in itself, gives advantages to two and denies rights and justice to others?  I understood that, since the discussion on the Second Stage, the Minister, through his Department, would make inquiries as to the revelant position of other employees in this establishment.  Has that happened?  If it has, what has been the result of such investigations?  If it has not happened, why did the Minister not consider it suitable and equitable that such investigation be made in relation to what we have been asking, namely, fair play for the other members here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> We all know from our association with this building that some of the staff are not alone disappointed but are rightly entitled to be aggrieved at the time spent in this House on a discussion of this Bill which is giving a privilege or a right to some and denying it to many.  Even at this late stage, why does the Minister not consider giving fair play to the others?  Not many are involved.  If we can clear the present position in relation to the severity under which some members of the staff are being forced to continue&mdash;if that hurdle could be got over&mdash;perhaps, in the future, no employee may be faced with the problem with which some of the present members of the staff are being faced.</P>
    <P>I believe that, in fairness to every member of this House anxious in his or her own way to support the Bill, it is important that the Minister should let us know now what he intends doing &mdash;whether he intends giving fair play to the people concerned or whether he is making this Bill a vehicle whereby some are getting privileges and others are being denied justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understood the Minister's remarks on the Second Stage, he said he would be prepared to consider the cases of any members of the staff who might be short of service in order to qualify them for full pension rights.  In considering this matter, I should like to express our approval of the idea of granting, where necessary, added years such as is being done in the case of the Superintendent and of the Captain of the Guard.  The present Superintendent, General Tobin, is a man who has a most distinguished record of pre-Truce service and a distinguished record as a soldier in the early days of the State.  For these reasons, it is appropriate that that service should be recognised and full credit given for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that a number of members of the staff who have given loyal and devoted service to the State, irrespective of what Government was in office, find themselves approaching a period when their retirement is imminent.  A number of these officials had some earlier service either in the <Col N="1009" /> Army or in the Garda Síochána and some had pre-Truce service with the I.R.A.  In justice, they are entitled to some consideration and should be given, where necessary, added years so that they may qualify for full pension rights.  I understand that some of them have longer service than others and that because of the age at which some were appointed they cannot qualify for full pension purposes.  In order to treat them on an equal basis with the terms proposed in Section 26, I feel the Minister should give the added years necessary in each case, or make whatever appropriate amendment is necessary to come within the terms of the Superannuation Acts.</P>
    <P>The conditions of service, the hours of work, and so on, in the Houses of the Oireachtas differ very considerably from the conditions of service in Government Departments.  All these officials have given most creditable service to the various Governments, to the Ceann Comhairle and to the Dáil and Seanad over the years.  In the early days of the State, there was a certain amount of confusion.  Appointments of this nature and other matters had to be attended to.  Consequently, some of the anomalies which existed about the terms on which these people were appointed have probably never been rectified.  This is an occasion when any injustice which may exist can be remedied.</P>
    <P>I should like to urge on the Minister that for the future it is likely that all appointments will be filled on a recognised basis and appointees will know they are coming into the Service on certain conditions.  Many of the present staff came in directly from the Army or the Garda Síochána.  They probably never bothered to inquire what conditions they were coming into but were prepared to serve the State in whatever capacity was considered suitable or appropriate.  It is always invidious to discuss the terms and conditions of employment of individual members of the Civil Service or members of the staff of this House, but I believe that the same consideration&mdash;the amount involved cannot be considerable&mdash;should be extended to the other members of the staff here <Col N="1010" /> who are short of the required service. Some of them are a few years short; others may require a few years more but, whatever the period, I have no doubt the particulars are available to the Minister through the appropriate section of his Department.  Justice demands that similar treatment should be given to all members of the staff of the two Houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse very emphatically all that Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Cosgrave have said in this matter, but I should like also to mention one other element in this situation&mdash;the case of a member of the staff who has retired already.  I understand that in his case he made his services available to the House because the House badly wanted him on the Translation Staff and he left the vocational education service to do so.  Had he entered any service other than the service of this House he would have got credit for the years he spent in the vocational education service, but in the special circumstances attaching to the service of this House he did not get credit for those years of service.  From a pension point of view he would have been better off if he had refused to come to the assistance of the House with his peculiarly specialised knowledge and stayed in the vocational education service.  I do not think the Minister will have much difficulty in identifying the case I have in mind.  I shall gladly give him the name confidentially; I can say to him it is the second last name on the list he was good enough to give us of the cases associated with this problem, and I would bespeak his sympathetic consideration of all the special circumstances surrounding that individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to assure Deputy Sweetman I did not know these amendments would be ruled out of order.  Neither did my officials but, in any case, I do not think that would have made a great deal of difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did happen to get some enlightenment from members of the House on the problem as to whether we should go further than the two men named or not.  When I was dealing with the two men named in this section, I said that up to the present men were taken from the old I.R.A. ranks to fill these offices.  I felt these would be the last to fill them from those ranks and that in future men from the Army or from the Garda Síochána would probably be selected who would have had full service and therefore a fairly decent pension before they came in at all.  A case like this is not likely to arise again and for that reason I selected these two men.  These men are, of course, officers of the House. There are four other officers: the Clerk and Assistant Clerk of each House.  They are all men who came into the Civil Service in the ordinary way and if they live the normal span of life, which I hope they will, they will be entitled to a full pension. Therefore, no difficulty arises in relation to superannuation as far as they are concerned.</P>
      <P>The other members of the staff are what is referred to as the Joint Staff. They were admitted to the Civil Service through the usual machinery. Whatever you might do for any individual there could be claimed by any member of the Civil Service.  Deputy Dillon mentioned a certain case.  I have a vague idea I know the person to whom he referred because I have been looking at these cases, but there might be a similar case, say, in my own Department, in the Department of Justice, or the Department of Health. They would have as good a claim to special treatment as the men we are dealing with here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a certain sympathy with the case Deputy Cosgrave put forward because the service of this House is the type of service an old I.R.A. man would probably elect to take.  You could make a sort of tenuous case that they were going from one State service to another that had some relationship. I am quite sure my own Department would give me all the objections to that, all the pitfalls and the precedents <Col N="1012" /> I might be creating, but it is a line I am prepared to examine.</P>
    <P>There was another case referred to by Deputy Sweetman of a man who was in the Garda Síochána.  It is a fairly well known principle of superannuation that where a man goes into another branch of employment in the Civil Service to do work for which he was actually trained in the first service, the superannuation is usually continuous; in other words a man who was in the Garda Síochána and came in here as Captain of the Guard should really be given credit for his service because his experience in the Garda was the reason he was appointed.  On the other hand if a man spends eight or nine years in the Garda Síochána and, being a man of many parts, let us say, is appointed librarian here, I do not think he would hold that his experience in the Garda Síochána fitted him in any way to be a librarian.  Therefore, it would be hard to argue that that service should count.</P>
    <P>The same observation applies to teachers.  Deputy Dillon referred to a case.  National teachers taken into the Department of Education as Inspectors can have their service counted for superannuation purposes because their training as national teachers fitted them to be inspectors. However, if a teacher resigns from his school and becomes an inspector in the Land Commission, his previous service would not count because there is no great reason why a national teacher should be in any way fitted&mdash; although he may happen to be&mdash;to be an inspector of the Land Commission. Therefore that service would not count.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to the point Deputy Sweetman raised.  There are certain cases where you could say in regard to the teacher: &ldquo;There is no doubt he should be given credit for his service if he becomes an inspector of schools.&rdquo;  If he becomes something else far away from that, say, an army officer you could say: &ldquo;No, he should not have his service counted there because it was not in preparation for this that he was doing that.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The particular case referred to by the Deputy, of somebody joining the Translation Staff, is one that should be examined.  I think all that I can say at this stage is that I could not hold out any hope of doing anything big or very general for the members of the staff.  I should be inclined to examine it from the point of view that I have just mentioned, of, say, a Garda officer, or a member of the Garda Síochána, or the Army, who might become an usher, because that is good training.  I might be inclined to look on that case with sympathy and if possible, I should be glad to follow the lines suggested by Deputy Cosgrave.  I hope to be able to say more on the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>One other point is one which Deputy Sweetman mentioned on the previous day&mdash;I do not think he mentioned it today&mdash;in connection with the two posts becoming vacant around the same time.  He wondered if it was necessary to have the two posts.  I did not examine that but I promise to examine it before the Report Stage, and, if something should be done, we can put in an enabling clause on Report Stage.</P>

Everybody was not born in time to be a member of the I.R.A. Is there to be a differentiation?  After all, all these members of the staff are good Irishmen and my information is <Col N="1014" /> that there is one member who was a good I.R.A. man and was here for practically 20 years before he was made permanent.

      <P>I should like the Deputy to realise the case of a man who joined the clerical staff&mdash;say the Reporting Staff, which a man may join when he is much above the normal age for coming into the service&mdash;at perhaps 35. He cannot, of course, have the full service to give him a full pension.  I do not think you could deal with these cases for that reason only, because there are thousands of people in the Civil Service&mdash;there is no doubt about it&mdash;professional men and so on, who come in at an age at which they cannot possibly get the full pension and nothing can be done about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister agreed with me that there was something special about service in this House and when giving this matter the consideration which he has been good enough to promise to give it, he should take that into account, particularly in relation to the problem that is undoubtedly a great bone of contention throughout the rest of the service&mdash;the question of unestablished service, where only half of the unestablished service counts for pension purposes. There is a case that the type of work here is quite different from the type of work done, say, by an ordinary unestablished messenger in a Department outside.  The hours and the difficulty of getting home after the House rises are all things&mdash;I do not want to say anything in the least controversial about the initial stages or the initial years of this House&mdash;which add up to the fact that there is a case here which is different from the case in the ordinary Civil Service.

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Since it is held or maintained by the Government that the amount of land available in the country for the relief of congestion is limited, Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that the public interest requires that the Land Commission should acquire the Rockingham Estate, Boyle, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>Since this motion appeared on the Order Paper very good news was conveyed to the people in the area in which this estate is situated.  I want to express my sincere appreciation to the present Minister for Lands for the part he played in ensuring that this large estate was held for the purpose of relieving congestion among the Irish people.  I regret very much that the present Minister had not the opportunity of using his weight and influence since Fianna Fáil took office a few years ago to ensure that other equally-precious estates were taken over rather than having many of them pass into the hands of aliens.  I am convinced that, had there been no change in the Ministry of Lands in recent months Rockingham demesne would, in all probability, have been divided by the owner into four or five lots and sold to the highest bidders. Alternatively, it would have been purchased by an outsider and, in my opinion, that would have been a tragic blow to the hopes of small farmers in the area who for the last 40 years have anxiously waited for Government action in regard to this estate.</P>
      <P>The estate has been acquired but I understand that no steps have so far been taken by the Land Commission to acquire the shooting and fishing rights.  As Deputies are aware, approximately 40,000 acres of shooting and fishing rights are attached to this estate.  These rights, in my opinion, are part and parcel of the estate and consequently should be taken over by the Land Commission with the estate itself.  The Land Commission could then, when allocating the farms, vest in the tenants the shooting and fishing rights of the particular area over the land and water that they hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be suggested in a moment that there is no pressure or demand from the small farmers in the locality for these rights but I suggest to the Minister that demand is bound to come when the land is being divided. I think it would be deplorable to leave <Col N="1019" /> the land holders in the position that the shooting and fishing rights which should normally belong to or be vested in them would be acquired by, say, a company composed of solicitors in Dublin or in London, or a group of people who might for commercial exploitation lease the shooting and fishing rights from the present owner, Sir Cecil Stafford King-Harmon.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that the former owner of this estate has no objection to the Land Commission acquiring the shooting and fishing rights.  Consequently, I think the Minister should ensure that, having gone so far, the Land Commission will go that little step further and take over the estate, lock, stock and barrel.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that at the moment in Boyle there is a development company which purports to attract tourists to visit the lovely, picturesque beauty spots in North Roscommon and that this development company is interested in leasing the shooting and fishing rights.  However desirable it may be to attract tourists, I suggest to the Minister that it would be wrong in principle to allow any such company, in Boyle or any other place, to make a bargain to lease these shooting and fishing rights over the heads of the people who will in future be the vested holders of the land which will be divided.</P>
    <P>First of all, let the Minister acquire the shooting and fishing rights and vest them in the tenants.  Then if a development company in Boyle desires to lease the shooting and fishing rights from the tenants, that is a matter which can be considered.  It might be a desirable step in order to protect the shooting and fishing rights and possible development.  We all know that the question of poaching arises wherever people have no respect for the laws in operation with regard to shooting and fishing over certain areas. We all know that the best protectors of fishing and shooting rights are the local people, if they have a sense of responsibility.  The best way to give them a sense of responsibility is to make them owners.</P>
    <P>I do not think that at this stage the <Col N="1020" /> Minister will object to my line of approach on this because I read very recently in the daily papers that the Minister congratulated a number of game associations in County Roscommon for the energetic approach they made towards improving sporting facilities.  I feel that the Minister in congratulating those people had in mind the fact that first-class facilities would be available on this estate and that if the individuals concerned were in a position to meet the tenants on the Rockingham estate they would possibly form a good club in their own interests and in the interests of the general public.  A good club devoted to shooting and fishing does not need the protection of bailiffs, guards or any other public officials.  The best protectors in that regard are the people themselves, who, as owners, will be quite alert to ensure that there is no exploitation or depredation, as far as the sporting rights are concerned.</P>
    <P>Now that the decision has been taken to acquire the Rockingham demesne, I should like to impress upon the Minister that there should be no delay in his Department in preparing the necessary scheme.  I understand&mdash; and I am sure that every Deputy understands&mdash;that it takes a considerable time for the Land Commission to prepare a proper and suitable scheme of division.  I make this statement now in the hope that it will come to the notice of the people in the locality who, at the moment, seem to have taken the view that the estate should be divided within the next two or three months.  I want it to be understood that it will take the Land Commission a considerable length of time to prepare a suitable scheme.</P>
    <P>I should be the last to ask the Land Commission to rush the job and make a hash of it, but at the same time I do not want to have this estate put on the long finger for two or three years.  We had the experience before with various farms and estates all over the country where the Land Commission set these lands and when the tenants got their allocations, the land in many cases had been made very poor, practically mined in many instances, by speculators and others who had no real interest in conserving the <Col N="1021" /> fertility of the soil but whose sole object was to get as much out of the land as they possibly could while the going was good.</P>
    <P>While I do not want the scheme itself rushed, I would ask the Minister to see that no time is lost in initiating and preparing the scheme.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to express my thanks to him for one of the first actions he did on becoming Minister for Lands. If he keeps up that start, he will be doing a good day's work for the people in rural Ireland who have with patience over the years looked on while the best land in the country passed out of the hands and control of Irishmen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and I should like to be associated with the thanks extended to the Minister, the Land Commission and all concerned for having done a splendid job of work, as far as the Rockingham estate is concerned.  It would be a sad thing for the people in the neighbourhood, the congests, the uneconomic holders and others, if this very valuable estate were allowed to pass into the hands of foreigners or some big <i>cartel.</i>  I should like to know from the Minister if a certain acreage of these lands has been apportioned for forestry and how much.  I should also like to know how much will be available for subdivision or grazing.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy McQuillan in his plea for the preservation of the game rights for the tenants who are allocated farms on this estate.  I think their claims should receive priority.  As a matter of fact, I think their claims go far beyond the claims of any other individual or individuals.  I do not know what bargain has been entered into between the former owner of the land and the Land Commission.  Perhaps, the game rights and fishing rights of this estate may be vested in the former owners of the lands; perhaps, they may be vested in the Land Commission. I should like to know from the Minister in whom they are vested. With my colleague, Deputy McQuillan, I would make a very special appeal to have those rights vested in the tenants who will become the allottees in time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> There is another matter which perturbs me.  I live convenient to this estate.  It is only a few miles away. Within the past couple of days, cattle were taken in there on the monthly system, for grazing.  I did not hear any complaint about the rates charged but I did hear that the number was greatly in excess of the number the land would feed and keep in good condition.  I do not know whether that is true or not and I hope the Minister will check on it.</P>
    <P>I also heard&mdash;again I would ask the Minister to check on it&mdash;that lorry loads of cattle from outside the county were taken in.  I also heard that further numbers of cattle were booked to be taken in within the next week or fortnight.  It would be a sad state of affairs if there were such overcrowding on the estate that people who pay a reasonable rent for grazing during the winter months should have their cattle coming home to them as shadows.</P>
    <P>I join with my colleague in asking the Minister to expedite the division of this land.  He is aware that in former times lands were held by the Land Commission for what I might call indefinite periods.  Remember, land held by the Land Commission deteriorates more rapidly than land held by private individuals because it is not maintained in good heart.  I would ask the Minister, in his own interest and in the interests of the allottees who will live on this estate in the years to come, to have these lands divided and allocated as soon as possible.  I have seen lands held by the Land Commission for up to 10 years.  Such lands were abused. They were let in conacre and all the good was extracted and when the tenants got the land it was practically good for nothing.  I hope that sort of thing will not happen again and that this business of letting land for tillage and handing it over to tenants without having been properly re-seeded and manured will not apply to the Rockingham Estate.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish again to thank the Minister.  The Minister for Transport and Power had something to do with the acquisition of this estate in the initial stages.  I include him also in my remarks and congratulate him and <Col N="1023" /> the members of the Land Commission who took such an active part in this matter and undoubtedly acquired the land in the shortest possible space of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I, as a Deputy from Roscommon, am very glad that the Rockingham Estate has been acquired. I am surprised, however, that the motion is in order because I thought that Section 6 of the Land Act, 1933, takes away from the Minister the power of determining what lands will be taken over, to whom the land will be given and the price that will be paid for it. Deputy McQuillan quite clearly implied that if there had not been a change of Minister, the land would not have been taken over.  Of course, that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I am surprised that the motion is in order at all because this is a semi-judicial function.  If I had been Minister for Lands, I would have raised that question with the Chair. As the Minister has no function in the matter at all, I do not understand why the matter was allowed to be raised.  The Minister has no function whatsoever in the acquisition of land. He is specifically excluded from having anything to do with the taking over of land, the division of land or the fixing of a price for land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I was not going to raise that point before Deputy McQuillan made his speech or before Deputy Beirne spoke, but now that I am on my feet, I want to say that I know that negotiations were in progress when Deputy Childers was Minister for Lands and the only thing outstanding was the price to be paid for it. About eight or nine months ago, I took occasion to protest against the action of the Roscommon County Council in interfering in a matter which purely concerned price.  I thought it altogether improper for a public body to interfere in a case where negotiations were in progress between a landowner and the Land Commission.  It was a matter of bargaining between them <Col N="1024" /> and I thought it was improper for the Roscommon County Council to interfere in a matter of that kind when it was only a question of price.</P>
    <P>Again, I say that I am delighted the land has been taken over and I have no doubt whatever that it will be properly divided and that every aspect of the situation there will be fully investigated.</P>
    <P>As a former Minister for Lands, I should like to say that, although it is very easy to talk about the Land Commission holding land for a certain number of years, anyone who knows the position as well as I do knows that, in order to make proper division and proper allocation, the Land Commission very often have to wait until they get more land so that they can make a fair re-arrangement.  I am doing what the Minister should be doing now.  I merely rose to protest against the implication&mdash;it was more than an implication; it was practically a charge&mdash;that if Deputy Childers had remained as Minister for Lands, these lands would not have been acquired. Surely Deputy McQuillan knows that neither the present Minister nor the previous Minister had any say whatever. It is entirely a matter for a semi-judicial body, the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Most of the things I should like to have said about the acquisition of this estate have been said by my colleagues, Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Beirne.  I endorse everything they have said.  I should also like to express my appreciation of the <Col N="1025" /> action of the Land Commission in taking over this estate.  It was long overdue.  For quite a long time, in Roscommon, we have been fighting to have this large estate and other estates taken over by the Land Commission and divided amongst very deserving applicants.  I would ask the Minister to see to it that there will be no undue delay.  He has done very well in getting this estate acquired in the shortest possible time but I would ask him to see that there is no undue delay in the division of the estate, as the land is very badly needed.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Beirne in asking the Minister to see that fishing and game rights are vested in the new owners and not let to any outsider.</P>

I was amazed to hear Deputy Beirne complaining about cattle being taken in from outside the county.  I should like Deputy Beirne and every other Deputy to understand that the people who were evicted from the Rockingham estate are living on the Curlew Hills in Sligo.  I hope the Minister or the Land Commission will not be intimidated in taking in cattle or in dividing the estate, when the time comes.</P>

      <P>In view of the references made by Deputy Boland, this is, indeed, a very interesting and a very profitable discussion which will bring it home to the people that it is the Land Commission who divide lands and who allocate the various divided lands.  It has been claimed down through the years by the cohorts of the Party in Government that it was they had the division of land.  They have claimed, year in and year out, that it was the Fianna Fáil Deputies supporting a Fianna Fáil Government who were really the power and the influential people in getting land for particular persons, and they demanded their pound of flesh from the <Col N="1026" /> smallholders who succeeded in getting such lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the few occasions in my many years in this House that any Deputy has had a good word to say about the Land Commission.  In so far as that has been said, I welcome it.  To deal first with Deputy Beirne, there are approximately 2,300 acres all told in this estate and between 900 and 1,000 acres of that would be for afforestation. I should inform the House that a considerable portion of the estate is at present under timber.  We estimate that approximately 1,000 acres of it will be taken up by the Forestry Section of my Department.</P>
      <P>The question of game rights has been raised by a number of Deputies including Deputy McQuillan.  This motion did not indicate that any such question would be raised but, so far as I know&mdash;the Deputy will not hold me to this&mdash;the game rights are being acquired by the Land Commission and will be duly vested in the tenants when the estate comes to be divided.</P>
      <P>In connection with the division of this estate, Deputies, particularly western Deputies, know quite well that a large operation of this kind cannot be carried out overnight.  The House will appreciate that my officials have to interview, not alone local people, but people who may be disemployed as a result of the acquisition of the estate and to consider the possibility of providing migrant holdings. All that will take time, but I can assure the House that I shall see to it there will be no avoidable delay in the division of Rockingham estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of saying that the owners of large estates apparently feel frightened of dealing with the Land Commission. The law provides that the market value must be paid for land.  This is one instance where the Land Commission have reached agreement with the owner concerned, and I think I shall be able to announce within the next couple of days that another very large estate in another part of the country will be acquired by agreement.  There seems to be some kind of fear abroad that the Land Commission in some way will not be fair to some people in the matter of price.  That is not so. <Col N="1029" /> Even where we acquire compulsorily, the owner has the right to go to an impartial court and have his compensation assessed. Owners of large estates, instead of turning away from the Land Commission, should turn first to the Land Commission, as their best potential customer.  They will get there a fair deal as between themselves and the State.  They will get the full value of their land.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is any foundation for the suggestion that too many cattle are being taken in on this estate at the moment.  I would be very surprised to learn that that is so, but I shall certainly have the position examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly shall have the position examined.  As I have said, there is a large amount of very valuable timber on this estate.  Without any desire on my part to cast any reflection on the people of Roscommon, I want to suggest that local public opinion should ensure that there is no depredation in the interregnum. As far as my own people are concerned, during the emergency a certain amount of county council turf had to be whitewashed so that it could be traced and identified.  May I express the hope now that public opinion in the immediate vicinity of this estate will ensure that no vandalism is committed and that people are not a bit careless, shall I say, in helping themselves to State property down there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure my predecessor, Deputy Childers, was just as anxious to acquire this estate as I have been.  The primary aim of the Land Commission is to relieve congestion and, if we can get more goodwill and a better public understanding of the job the Land Commission has to do, we shall make much quicker progress.  As I have said, I want to see more owners of large estates coming <Col N="1030" /> along and making a deal with the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister say that the Land Commission are acquiring the sporting rights on this estate and that these rights will be vested in the allottees. That is a step I could never induce the Land Commission to take.  I do not know whether Deputy Boland made any effort in his time to induce the Land Commission to take that step, but I think he did.  Sporting rights are as much part and parcel of the land as is the soil itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a step in the right direction.  I never could understand the process of acquiring land and leaving the game rights on that land to someone else.  The land would be given to Mr. X and the game rights to Mr. Y.  This led to an inexplicable legal tangle because Mr. X, while he could not claim the rights himself, could refuse permission to Mr. Y, who had bought the rights, to walk his land.  I hope that in all future cases the rights will be vested in the allottees along with the land.  Indeed, if that could be made retrospective it would be a very welcome development. Deputy Boland got very wroth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at the fact that this motion was put down.  I am one of those who always uphold the judicial functions of the Land Commissioners. I would be one of the first to defend them.  When, however, such a huge estate as this is involved, I think it quite proper that its acquisition should be discussed here in the Dáil and that the Commissioners should have, if necessary, the assurance that the House considers that it is in the public interest that such a big slice should be taken <Col N="1031" /> over.  In the case of ordinary run-of-the-mill acquisitions it would not, of course, be proper to table motions for the purpose of discussing such acquisitions here.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that very close on half is forestry land.  That will provide a very useful forest centre in Roscommon.  I am sure there is a great deal of valuable timber in it.  I understand the area covers some 900 to 1,000 acres.  That will leave approximately 1,300 acres for other purposes.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley was very anxious to lead the House to believe that it was Fianna Fáil who gave the Land Commissioners their judicial functions. I would ask the Deputy to go back to the 1871 Act.  He will find that in 1871 the Land Commissioners were given their judicial functions.  He will also find that the same judicial functions have been and are operative right up to the present time.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the fact that there is a fear of the Land Commission among landowners.  That is a very real fear because there is land which would be of great benefit both to the Land Commission and to the ultimate allottees.  The fear has a very real foundation.  It goes back to the time the landbonds were issued at 4½ per cent.  The people who received these bonds in exchange for their lands could not sell for a period of two years in most cases and, when they did go to sell, they found the £100 had to be sold at £82, £83 and £84 in the public market.  In my time, the six per cent. land bonds were brought in and those who hold them are today getting the full value on the stock market.</P>
      <P>The buying of land through the medium of land bonds is completely outdated.  I throw out this hint&mdash;the Minister might now consider turning over to cash payment.  I know the trouble he will have with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, but there is no use continuing an outdated method of purchasing land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, this was a proper motion to table for discussion in this House.  The Land Commission might not have liked taking responsibility for acquiring such a huge slice of land. I do not advocate that every acquisition <Col N="1032" /> of five, 10 or 100 acres should be discussed here by way of motion. Be that as it may, I think the Land Commission will be grateful to know that they have the backing of this House in acquiring such a huge slice of country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I am surprised at Deputy Boland but I do not intend to join with others in criticising his approach to this motion.  The Rockingham demesne, as the Minister and others in this House know, was up for sale.  This motion, therefore, was put down in order to get an expression of opinion from the public representatives on a matter of public policy: was it desirable to allow one of the large estates left in the west of Ireland to pass into the hands of outsiders? When I say outsiders, I mean non-nationals, perhaps combines, perhaps a large business man.  When I use the word &ldquo;non-national&rdquo;, I do not use it in any derogatory sense.  Was it desirable to allow that to happen when, under the Constitution, the Land Commission, if you like, are charged with ensuring that the greatest possible number of Irish families are settled on the land in economic holdings?  How can you ensure that that direction is carried out, if the only land available for that purpose is allowed into the hands of those who perhaps already have sufficient?</P>
      <P>Consequently, when this land became available, when the owner wanted to part with it, and the Land Commission and the Minister concerned showed no great enthusiasm or anxiety to acquire it, I felt it was in the public interest to put down this motion in order that the House should get an opportunity of expressing their views.  There was no question of a dictatorial approach to this. The House could decide to have a vote, if necessary.  The motion was not put down on the basis that a precedent was being established which would give the idea to every Deputy that he could put down a motion dealing with every farm of land.  I had no such idea in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was unfair to suggest that the credit cannot to a great extent be <Col N="1033" /> given to the Minister and I want to make it quite clear&mdash;and whether it is looked upon as a present to the Fianna Fáil Party, I do not care; I am not interested&mdash;the Minister, who comes from the congested areas, understands the problem of congestion in the West and he has told us his sympathies lie with the small farmer in the West.  When it came to a question of the Land Commission deciding whether or not a certain price should be paid for this farm, undoubtedly, the Minister with his interest in the small farmer was in a position to use, even indirectly, his important status as Minister charged with the responsibility of looking after the congests, to ensure that the necessary financial accommodation would be made available in order that this land would not pass into the type of hands I have suggested.</P>
    <P>I repeat my congratulations to the Minister.  I am expressing my own opinion and I do so on behalf of the constituents of the county.  I appreciate, as do other Deputies, his very encouraging statement that the shooting and sporting rights of this estate will also pass into the hands of the tenants who will be vested.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That in view of the increase in the <Col N="1034" /> cost of living since present scales of benefits were fixed, and the general inadequacy of the rates of benefits now paid, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that old age, blind and widows' and orphans' pensions, sickness and unemployment benefits and unemployment assistance should be increased immediately.</P>
    <P>It should hardly be necessary to stress, or explain in detail, the terms of this motion or to give any justification for having it brought before Dáil Éireann.  During the past hour, five, six or seven Deputies paid tribute to the Land Commission and the Minister for Lands for doing a certain thing which will give a certain amount of property to people who already have some, if only a little, property.  This motion deals with people who have no property and, mind you, it is not alone for those who have no property we speak, but also for those who not only have no property but who have no means except what the community, through State legislation, decides to give them.</P>
    <P>The motion is in two different parts. It pertains to two different sections: those in receipt of social assistance and those in receipt of social insurance.  It should be stressed, in the first place, that so far as social welfare benefits, as they are called are concerned, they are divided into two different classes. Many people are under the impression that every person who draws a pension, an allowance, or a benefit from the State, is getting a complete handout. It is true in some cases that it is a complete handout in so far as there is no contribution for it.  That applies in respect of old age pensions, widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions, blind pensions and unemployment assistance, to quote a few.</P>
    <P>There are others: those in receipt of unemployment benefit and sickness benefit and those in receipt of widows' and orphans' contributory pensions. These are people who are not getting a handout from the State.  They are people who have to contribute and whose employers have contributed, week after week, month after month, and year after year, by way of the <Col N="1035" /> insurance stamp affixed to the insurance card.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak first about those people who are absolutely dependent on social assistance.  When we talk about social assistance, we think of old age pensioners.  I have a fair idea of the type of reply I shall get from the Government benches when the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister stands up to reply.  In any case, we in the Labour Party believe that the treatment of the old age pensioners and those in receipt of unemployment assistance, blind pensions and widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions should be vastly improved.  There should be an effort, or some sign of an effort, on the part of the Government to make such an improvement.  I shall probably be told, in respect of old age pensions that there has been an increase in recent years as the cost of living increased.  That may be a fact to a certain extent, but that is not our entire case here this evening.</P>
    <P>As will be noted from the terms of the motion, we talk not only about the increase in the cost of living, but we specifically stress, in the second line of the motion, the general inadequacy of the rates of benefits paid at present. We may have regard to the cost of living and try to delude or &ldquo;kid&rdquo; ourselves by saying that old age pensioners and others have got proportional increases.  It is a long time since the initial 5/- was given to the old age pensioner.  It seems ever so long ago since the old age pensioner was asked to exist on 10/- per week. In relatively recent years, in the past ten or 12 years, we were a little more generous as far as the increase in the cost of living was concerned.  However, I do not think any of us would readily admit that our old age pensioners are getting the treatment they deserve.</P>
    <P>The old age pensioner is now receiving 27/6 per week.  We have spoken about judges and justices within the past fortnight.  The Taoiseach said that because the cost of living increased by 15 per cent. between 1953 and the present time the least we could do for these people would be to give <Col N="1036" /> them an increase of 10 per cent.  He regretted we could not give judges and justices the full increase of 15 per cent. Bear in mind that, in receiving an increase of 10 per cent., one of these gentlemen, at least, will receive an increase, not an actual salary but an increase, of £480 per annum which is something approaching an increase of £10 per week.  I do not base my argument entirely on a comparison with the salaries paid to judges, justices and members of the Supreme Court but I think there is a vast difference, to say the least of it, in the two cases. It is certainly not overstating the position to say that between the income of certain sections of the community and that of those who are required to live on 27/6 a week, there is a vast difference.</P>
    <P>If one has regard to an old age pensioner living on his or her own, who has to pay even 3/- or 4/- per week for rent, we can readily calculate what is left to buy the other necessities of life, particularly food.  It means that about 23/- or 24/- per week is left.  Divided by seven, it means that the old age pensioner living on his or her own has something like 3/- or 3/6d. per day for maintenance. We must ask ourselves how can anybody buy sufficient food, not to talk of anything else, on the small sum of 3/6d. per day?</P>
    <P>In all fairness to the Department and to the officials, it should be said that the blind person has some little extra.  There are some different schemes whereby he can benefit to a slightly greater extent.  Weighted against that is the fact that the recipient is blind.  He cannot do for himself. He cannot enjoy many of the pleasures of life that even an old age pensioner can because he has no sight. The fact still remains that, with these other small schemes for blind pensioners, the State says, in effect: &ldquo;A blind pension of 27/6d. a week is sufficient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Consider the widow whose husband, before his death, had not sufficient stamps.  She is now in receipt of a widow's or a widow's and orphans' non-contributory pension and gets something like 26/- per week.  Without <Col N="1037" /> going into figures, it must be abundantly clear to everybody that we cannot be proud of the position.</P>
    <P>Consider the much-abused, unfortunate man on the dole, the man who draws unemployment assistance.  The single man gets something like 19/- per week if he resides in an urban area but if he happens to live in a rural area he gets something like 13/- per week.  That is a situation which not alone the Government but the general public will have to face and do something to relieve.  In particular, these men and women who must have recourse to unemployment assistance, or the dole as it is generally called, will have to be assisted in some way. Neither the community nor the State can provide work for them.  We have no work to give them.  We have neither productive work nor non-productive work for them.</P>
    <P>We say, in effect: &ldquo;If you stay in this country and in a rural area we shall give you 13/- per week.&rdquo;  They must feel pretty bitter and cynical so far as the Government and the public are concerned, especially when some people accuse them of loitering around the labour exchange merely to draw the dole.  The vast majority of them do not want to draw the dole.  The vast majority of them want not the dole, not the 13/- or 19/- per week, but employment.  That employment has not been forthcoming and is not forthcoming from the Government. Therefore, I suggest the Government will have to face the problem of providing work for these people, whether productive or non-productive, or else give them some inducement to stay in their own country by giving them a somewhat better allowance.</P>
    <P>On two occasions the Parliamentary Secretary has made the remark&mdash;he said it last week in reply to Deputy T. Lynch who raised the subject of the inadequacy of the old age pension&mdash; that it is only a grant-in-aid.  He said that in a voice which was not too audible.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what he means by a &ldquo;grant-in-aid&rdquo;?  I am sure old age pensioners in Wexford would not understand if I said to them that they were not expected to live on that <Col N="1038" /> 27/6d. per week as it is only a grant-in-aid. What does the Parliamentary Secretary imagine they have to supplement the 27/6d. per week?  Is he of the opinion that these people have some sort of income?  Is he of the opinion that they are assisted to any extent by other people and that the 27/6d. per week is a sort of bonus or present from the State?  I assume the Parliamentary Secretary's reply to me will be something like this: &ldquo;The local authorities have responsibility&rdquo;, &ldquo;Their families have responsibility&rdquo; or &ldquo;Some charitable organisations have responsibility towards those in receipt of old age pensions, blind pensions, widows' pensions and unemployment assistance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me take the position of the local authorities first.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do that many local authorities in this country, representing the ratepayers, refuse to accept the responsibility placed upon them by this House under the Public Assistance Act, 1936. Therefore, these old age pensioners, blind persons, widows and people on the dole wonder who is responsible for them.  They are not wastrels. Because of their age the old age pensioners cannot work.  They get the old age pension because they have not an income of a certain amount.  The vast majority of them have no income whatever.  The means test provides that if they have not more than £52 10s. per annum they may qualify for an old age pension.</P>
    <P>Most people assume that, because they get the old age pension under that means test, they have £52 10s. per annum, or £1 per week, but such is not the case.  The local authorities are not too generous.  As far as I am aware, many of the local authorities will not come to the assistance of an old age pensioner if that old age pensioner is not living on his own.  I had occasion to go to a certain local authority recently to ask for assistance for an old age pensioner and I was asked immediately: &ldquo;Is he living on his own?&rdquo;  If he is living on his own, they give him 5/-.  If he or she happens to be living with somebody else, whether a relative or not, the local authority give nothing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> Therefore, we can accept that it is only in exceptional circumstances that a local authority will come to the assistance of an old age pensioner, a blind person or a widow and then only to a very small extent.  That is another very good reason why the Parliamentary Secretary should clarify his two recent statements to the effect that this sort of weekly assistance is merely a grant-in-aid.  They may get assistance in some cases from their families but the heads of the vast majority of these families find it difficult to maintain themselves, their wives and their families and they believe it is not unreasonable that the State should not necessarily keep these people fully and in the utmost comfort, but treat them a little better than they have been treated over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>There may be quoted to me the cost of living index.  The cost of living index has no bearing on the cost of living to such as an old age pensioner. I said that in the House before and I repeat it tonight.  The cost of living index figure, which is supposed to represent the rise or fall in the cost of living four times per year, has nothing to do with the expense it is to an old age pensioner to try to maintain himself, because in that cost of living index figure, there are not alone food and rent but various other things which are supposed to make up the cost of living. These things have no bearing whatsoever on the way of life of the old age pensioner, the widow, the person on the dole or the blind person.</P>
    <P>The old age pensioner, the blind person, the widow and the orphan and the unfortunate man on the dole are concerned with only three things.  They are concerned with the price of food, with the cost of their rent and with the cost of clothing.  As regards tobacco, drink, the price of newspapers and all the other things that are in the cost of living index figure, he does not care a jot for them because he could never afford them.  The last time I spoke on a similar motion I said that while the ordinary cost of living had gone up by 12 per cent., at the same period, the cost of food, rent and clothing had gone up something like 20 per cent. <Col N="1040" /> Therefore none of us need pat himself on the back and say we have compensated the old age pensioner for the increase in the cost of living over the past five, six or ten years.</P>
    <P>I know it would take a fair amount to give these increases.  That is a point the Parliamentary Secretary made before.  He will quote to me, I am sure, as he has quoted before, the total amount required to give 2/6, 5/- 10/- or 15/- to an old age pensioner. I know it is a colossal sum.  It is a formidable sum but there is also the formidable responsibility placed on the community to look after the aged.  We must make the effort and if people have to make sacrifices, it should be brought home to them that they are making sacrifices for people who are not wasters, who are not just looking for charity but who merely want to live a normal life and to live the normal span of life.</P>
    <P>When we think and talk about money, we should add up all the small amounts of money this Dáil and this Government passed for this, that and the other project.  It may be said: &ldquo;We shall pass this project&rdquo;; &ldquo;We shall give this grant and that grant&mdash;it is only about £15,000.&rdquo;&ldquo;For this venture, we shall allocate another £500,000.&rdquo;  Any Minister for Finance or Minister for Social Welfare may well say: &ldquo;That would not give an old age pensioner an increase of a farthing.&rdquo;  We know that but it all adds up.  These sacrifices added up could in time reach a figure that could give justice to the people for whom we plead tonight.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about tuberculosis in cattle.  We are concerned with the growing of Irish wheat.  We are concerned about tourism.  We are concerned about the foreigner coming in here to spend money and generally to amuse himself.  All these things cost this country millions of pounds.  I shall not take the Government to task in relation to the question of bovine T.B. eradication.  We realise its importance to the country.  However, the Minister for Agriculture blandly announced at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, or some place down the country, that this year we are spending <Col N="1041" /> £5,500,000 to eradicate T.B. in cattle and will spend more next year and the year after.  Granted one cannot make an absolute comparison, but we can get that sort of money year after year for that kind of project and it is only every three or four years we become bountiful and say: &ldquo;Here is another 2/6 for the old age pensioner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have not seen a gleam of hope nor have I heard a hopeful word from this Government since they came back to office in March, 1957, so far as social assistance recipients are concerned. We are paying £17 million for health services and £24.5 million for social assistance and social welfare benefits. This is mentioned any time one refers to this question.  It all boils down to one thing: the person on the dole who cannot get employment in the rural area gets 13/- per week and the old age pensioner who has worked all his life for this country and who has incidentally worked for himself can get only 27/6 a week at 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>This is not a condemnation of any particular Party; it is a condemnation of the whole community.  We want to see some initiative shown by the Government and by the Parliamentary Secretary by way of giving hope to these people that there will be some scheme, that there will be some money available in order to ensure that in future we shall not be ashamed of the small amount of social assistance we handed out individually to these people week after week for many years gone by.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion talks about insurance benefits.  I do not see the great difficulty there.  If the Minister makes the case that we spend so many millions, £20,000,000, on social assistance, as it is very desirable that we should do, I do not think we can make the same case against an increase in insurance benefits.  We may have been lagging behind to the extent that we have not yet provided insurance schemes not so much to provide against blindness, as to provide for all the widows and orphans or all those people who may be rendered widows and orphans, an insurance scheme for all those who <Col N="1042" /> cannot labour any more when they come to the age of 65 or 70; but we have the scheme so far as social insurance is concerned.  We have the scheme whereby a worker pays one-third into the fund, the employer pays one-third and the State pays the remaining one-third, or whatever sum is required from year to year.</P>
    <P>The last increase to these people was given about the Fall of 1956. People in receipt of sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and widows' and orphans' contributory pensions got an increase of 25 per cent.  That compensated for a past increase in the cost of living but there has been a 12 point increase in the cost of living since August 1956.</P>
    <P>I suggest that inasmuch as there is a scheme and that the workers do not object to paying a little more, nor do the employers, the State should also face up to its responsibilities and give an increase that would compensate to the extent of the full 12 points.  The sooner we attach these benefits to the actual cost of living&mdash;I am talking specifically about insurance benefits&mdash; the better.  We found, over the years, that the payments to these people have lagged behind.  It is only after five, six or ten years that we have given them an increase but it is not sufficient to compensate them for their losses in the intervening period.  There have been increases in food prices&mdash;naturally Fianna Fáil know that better than anybody because it was their 1957 Budget proposals to abolish the food subsidies which made tea, bread and butter much dearer.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that house rents have increased&mdash;I allege on the direction of the Minister for Local Government. There have been all these increases and life has become much more difficult for people who find themselves dependent on social insurance at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is another big item of expense that usually has not been taken into account&mdash;medical expenses.  The attitude of the Minister for Health and the officers of the local authorities with regard to giving out medical service cards has resulted in many more people incurring much more expense <Col N="1043" /> than prior to the inauguration of the present health scheme.  Apart from anything else, if we were, for the sake of argument, to say that everybody who should have a medical service card has one, there may be a period when people become ill, even say for two or three weeks, during which they are not granted a card.  Some of the assistance officers are reluctant to give them the temporary medical service card and these unfortunate people find, because of the way the health scheme is administered, that they are required in those two or three weeks&mdash; during which they are, perhaps, suffering from influenza or tonsilitis&mdash;to pay 10/- to a dispensary doctor or pay for drugs which they may require.  These are additional expenses for which they have not been compensated.  They are reflected in the cost of living since August, 1956.</P>
    <P>We have not much experience of it in rural areas but bus fares have been increased in Dublin.  That increase must be borne by people mentioned in this motion, from old age pensioners down to people in receipt of insurance benefits.  It was a further smack in the face for people on social assistance and people in receipt of social insurance to hear the Taoiseach blandly state, in the speech he made in Oxford recently on Partition, that if the people of the Six Counties decided to join with us in a Thirty-two County Republic they would lose nothing in social welfare benefits.  Very laudable indeed but there is a very hollow ring in it when one remembers the old age pensions, the sickness benefit and the unemployment benefit given in the North and what is given here.</P>
    <P>Would it not have been far better for the Taoiseach to pledge himself, the Government and Irish people, when speaking at Oxford, in a statement to the effect, not that those people in the Six Counties would lose no benefits, but that in a short time the people in the Twenty-Six Counties would enjoy benefits comparable with those paid at present in the Six Counties or in Great Britain?  But in his speech he said he recognised that these were adequate. We suggest that it would have been far <Col N="1044" /> better for him to pledge himself and the Government to make an effort to see that our social welfare benefits and social assistance were improved, and greatly improved, quickly.</P>
    <P>The attitude has been: &ldquo;We are doing well enough when we give them an increase now and again&rdquo;.  It reminds one of a hungry dog.  It will equal when hungry but we throw it a crust or an old bone and that keeps it quiet for a while.  The 1/6d. or 2/6d. keeps the man on the dole quiet for a while but then there is an agitation and people write to the newspapers and say that the treatment of old age pensioners is scandalous.  The public also have a responsibility in making that clamour count in order to induce Governments, and particularly this Government, to give them more.</P>
    <P>I am always appalled at the attitude of the Minister for Social Welfare with regard to all these benefits and with regard to&mdash;I do not want to pursue it here&mdash;his attitude to health services.  On one occasion I heard Deputy Sherwin ask the Minister, would he consider that the disabled person's maintenance allowance of £1 was sufficient to keep that person for a week.  The Minister for Social Welfare just folded up the file wherein he had the information and sat down saying: &ldquo;It is not too bad from other people's pockets.&rdquo;  I heard him say that in this House, that £1 for the man who is disabled, the man who cannot work, is £1 from other people's pockets.  We have a duty to all these people whether they are blind, disabled, or old.  If that is the attitude of the Government&mdash;the attitude displayed by the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;I am afraid we cannot expect much improvement.  I commend this motion to the House and to the Government.  I hope that the House will unanimously agree that the people mentioned in this motion deserve more assistance and that that assistance should be granted to them immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion, and, like my colleague, Deputy Corish, I would draw the <Col N="1045" /> attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the statement of the Taoiseach in the course of his Oxford Union speech.  In doing so, perhaps it may be well to quote one short paragraph from a booklet National Insurance Fund&mdash;National Insurance (Reserve) Fund&mdash;Accounts 1957-58 presented to the Parliament of Northern Ireland, and dated 27th January, 1959.  The last paragraph states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The National Insurance (No. 2) Act (N.I.), 1957, increased the rates of all benefits from dates in January and February, 1958.  For example, injury benefit and full disablement benefit for adults were raised from 67s. 6d. to 85s. a week, and widow's allowance from 55s. to 70s.</P>
      <P>I wonder did the Taoiseach have in mind such a position, and I wonder does the Parliamentary Secretary consider the position in regard to the services being offered just a short distance from the capital of the Twenty-Six Counties?</P>
      <P>It may also be well at this stage to direct particular attention to the answer to a Question in this Chamber today.  The Question asked for the weekly cost of food and of clothing and bedding in certain institutions in the Twenty-Six Counties. The answer stated that in one hospital in County Louth the cost of food per week amounts to 14/8½, and clothing and bedding to 1/2 per week per inmate.  In another institution in Louth, it amounts to 19/6½ per week for food, and 1/5½ per week for clothing. In County Meath, about which the Parliamentary Secretary should be well informed, the cost of food amounts to 23/11 per inmate per week, and the cost of clothing and bedding to 1/9 per week.  In many other hospitals, as stated in the reply, it costs about £1, or a little over it, to maintain an inmate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the cost of food in all these instances is the cost of food in a large institution, and that averages out from 18/- to £1, and in some cases, a little more.  In some instances, clothing and bedding work out at 5/3, and that must bring home to us the fact that if it costs so much for food per inmate in <Col N="1046" /> a large institution, the cost to an old age pensioner, in his or her own home, even with the full allowance of 27/6 per week, must be more.  What then of the widows and the children of widows, and what of the man depending on unemployment assistance, as mentioned by Deputy Corish?  Surely these figures are a clear indication that if any claim should be considered by the Government at present, it is the claim in this motion for increased benefits for these people?</P>
    <P>As I have often said in this House, no Government since the 1920's has shown much liberality to these people. We admit that.  As Deputy Corish has stated, the increases over the years have been just steps, though perhaps steps in the right direction; but when we consider the financial benefits bestowed on these people, these increases at all times were but a drop in the ocean compared with Government expenditure in other directions.  A lot of money can be provided for other services and, therefore, it is not too much to ask that fair consideration be given to these people who at this stage are entitled, not to the privilege, but to the justice that should be theirs under an Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may say that an old age pension is only a contribution or a grant-in-aid, but he knows as well as I do that an old age pensioner is entitled, not to charity, but to Christian justice.  If Lloyd George and a British Government found it suitable to accord the Irish people some measure of fair play, in return for the services they had given, even to an alien Government&mdash;5/- and 10/- prior to 1920&mdash;we must admit that our present grant-in-aid shows an utter disregard for fair play for old age pensioners.  They are in the winter of their lives and they now ask us for some small return to help them through their remaining years.  We can bestow large increases of 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. on our judges and other officers of State.  They may be entitled to these increases but these increases differ immensely from what the Parliamentary Secretary wishes us to consider as a grant-in-aid for old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to hold the House too long in dealing with this motion. <Col N="1047" /> I do not see why we should have to delay long with it.  It would not be necessary at all if we had been able to keep in line with the cost of living through increases to the old age pensioners, the widows and blind persons, but I am sorry to say that irrespective of what Government have been in power, we have not done so.  It cannot be offered as an excuse that the finance is not available.  As I have already said, finance has been made available in many other instances.</P>
    <P>In reference to this matter today, the Parliamentary Secretary said something to the effect that these increases might not be worth a threepenny bit. I give credit to the many members of the Fianna Fáil organisation who gathered from different parts of the country in the past two days and raised their voices on behalf of the old, the blind and the widows.  If they realise that fair play is not being given to these sections why is there a defence of the present system under which the increase which they should get is denied to them?  We are asking only for a just measure of fair play for the recipients of these benefits. I do not wish to dwell any longer on this: I do not see why it should be necessary.  In view of the recent statement of the Taoiseach at Oxford and in view of the reply given in answer to this question here today showing that, in justice, these people are entitled to these increases, I would ask that the Government give these people what they are entitled to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We, in the Fine Gael Party, strongly support this motion is so far as it is directed towards easing the lot of the aged, the blind, the widows and orphans.  In company with a great number of people outside the House, we feel that this is one of the pressing problems of the moment.  It transcends politics. There must be in both Dáil and Seanad members who are daily brought close to the problems affecting these people.  Any Deputy who is a member of a local authority, or indeed any member of the House who even occasionally meets his constituents, must quite frequently be reminded of the dire circumstances of very many <Col N="1048" /> old and disabled people.  We must realise that this is reflected in the additional attention that charitable organisations feel they must give to easing the lot of many of these unfortunate people.  We must all agree that money has greatly reduced in value and when we think in terms of what £1 can buy today&mdash;not in luxuries but in necessaries&mdash;we must concede that these are the classes most seriously affected by the increase in the cost of the necessaries of life.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Corish, I would wish not to rely on the cost-of-living figures because we know that these figures include many classes of goods and services which are not applicable to the people with such limited incomes as old age pensioners, widows or blind persons.  When the drastic decision was taken to withdraw completely the subsidisation of food, we knew what the impact would be on these classes. Some moderate assistance was given by way of increased benefits, but can anybody contend here that the pittance given was sufficient to make it possible for these people to buy the same amount of food as they did when prices were much lower?  What classes in the community mainly depend on bread, butter, tea and sugar?  Is it not the people in the lower-income groups, the people who rely on such benefits as the State seems obliged to give them to enable them to exist?  Are those not the people who rely on bread, flour, tea and butter for three meals a day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government decided to withdraw the food subsidies, they found subsequently that they had to heed the demand of people in the middle classes and of some people with substantial incomes because of the impact on them of the increased cost of living.  The local authorities and private employers were also so conscious of their obligations that they gave salary and wage increases to meet the fresh demand on the workers' pockets. Surely that was an admission of the impact of the increase in the cost of necessaries of life?  Many people who are compensated&mdash;perhaps not in whole, but in part&mdash;for that increase in the cost of living are people enjoying meat three times a day.  Can we say that a man who has bacon and egg in <Col N="1049" /> the morning, meat at lunch and possibly dinner in the evening is very concerned about the price of bread, of half a stone of flour or of butter? Surely it is the man or woman who depends on the little that, so far, unfortunately we have seen fit to give them who are really hit by that drastic, dramatic and, for them, tragic increase in the cost of living?</P>
    <P>It was considered and indeed represented to the people that the withdrawal of the food subsidies would be reflected in some reduced expenditure. That has not happened.  Bearing that in mind, can we not now examine the impact of the increase on the people towards whom this motion is directed with a view to alleviating their lot? Surely no Deputy can argue that these people have received any measure of compensation comparable with the increased cost of their normal necessaries of life.  The cost of running institutions of State has been increased. Many of these institutions are doing marvellous work in looking after the aged and disabled, those who have no one to depend on and who are compelled to take up residence in such institutions. Because of the higher cost of running these institutions, the authorities, against their own desires, have been forced to demand a higher proportion of the residents' pensions in order to keep up these institutions.  We know of the increase also in the cost of simple luxuries but this motion is not now directed towards the old age pensioner who may enjoy a pipe of tobacco or a very occasional bottle of stout.  We realise that less is left to them of their pensions when the institutions, naturally, had to increase their demands for the cost of their food and maintenance.</P>
    <P>In the past, the State was careful in many instances when legislation was brought in giving increases, to protect various people among the classes concerned from the enactment of anything that would worsen their lot but we all know in our constituencies people in receipt of military service pensions or special allowances who actually suffered a reduction in their special allowances by a sum greater than they received <Col N="1050" /> in the old age pension because, although one's own pension is not taken into account in the means test, the pension of the spouse must be taken into account.  Surely when the Government bring in a measure to increase the allowances in some way, it is directed towards actually increasing them and not to producing something that under the regulations is twisted into a reduction in their income.</P>
    <P>When the Government are considering this matter, as they will be forced to do by public opinion, they should bear that in mind and remember that when increases were given, Ministers of State received the increases in full, while unfortunate men and women advanced in years down the country could not avail of them because of the factors to which I have referred in regard to means.  Far from there being an easement in the situation of these people in recent years, we say sincerely, not making any charges that cannot be sustained, there appears to be, if anything, a more stringent application of the means test.  I know a number of widows whose means have not changed in recent years and yet their pensions were withdrawn. Having regard to the circumstances through which our people have been going in recent times, I suggest that they require attention.  I fail to see, in the atmosphere of giving increases to various classes of our people, how the strict application of the means test in these instances can be supported.</P>
    <P>When a previous Government were in office, something completely outside the control of that Government brought about certain increased charges on the necessaries of life for these people.  There was an increase in the price of tea, but the Government of the day were so conscious of the impact of the price of even that commodity, which is far from being the most essential of the necessaries these people have to purchase that they gave at Christmas time a double payment which adequately compensated the recipient for the entire year's cost.</P>
    <P>That was consideration.  It did not cost a whole lot.  In recent times, this <Col N="1051" /> Government have been asked in present circumstances to cushion these people against the impact of the increased cost of living by making a similar concession, but we still have no indication that any serious consideration is given to doing so or that there is any intention of doing so.  I urge on the Government that, pending any legislation to give the increases, for which there is an unanswerable case, they should immediately make arrangements, which are so simple from the administrative viewpoint, to see that a double payment is given to these unfortunate people this Christmas.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary can provide the House with figures relating to what the cost would be to the Exchequer and the country of acceding in any way to the request embodied in this motion.  Yet when one meets people outside, one realises that this is a problem about which very many people are perturbed.  I think that, notwithstanding the logical and strong case for keeping a careful watch on Government expenditure, this is something in which the Government would have the support of the vast majority of our people because they feel that these are classes who are very poorly equipped to meet the demands of present-day life.  I think the Government would have the support of the whole people if they could divert some of the finances of the State to an immediate alleviation of the plight of these people.</P>
    <P>This afternoon at Question Time, a Minister of State&mdash;he was quite within his rights&mdash;could not state whether a particular project in the south of Ireland received £3 million, £4 million or £5 million.  Where did that money come from?  It came from the same source as that from which the money would come to meet these increases. The Parliamentary Secretary will be in a position, when he replies, to indicate the £. s. d. involved for the State if they were to meet what is proposed in this motion, but another Minister can sit back and refuse to give information and leave everybody in the dark in relation to the extent of expenditure in another sphere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> We must be fair all round and ensure that there are not people in our community who suffer dire distress in these days.  It is for that reason that we in the Fine Gael Party are supporting this motion, with particular reference to the old age pensioners, widows and orphans and blind people.  I recall an occasion when a motion similar in terms to the present one was defeated and the Minister at the time said it would be impossible for the State to find the £250,000 which was all that was involved at that time.  Yet within 12 months, it was possible for another Government to find that money.  Since then, further increases have been given even by the Party in office in order to ease the burden on these people.  These are the circumstances in which this motion is now being discussed.</P>
    <P>While it must be conceded that, perhaps, the attention of the House may be diverted to the legitimate claims of other people, if we were to place them in the order of priority, at the head of this queue must come the people mentioned in this motion.  If the State can find the money to satisfy the demands of other classes, they must give precedence to the unanswerable demands of the people mentioned here this evening.</P>
    <P>Just at this time, the people's sympathy and consideration are being excited in relation to the pitiable plight of refugees all over the world.  No doubt the Irish people will respond to that appeal with the same generosity and sympathy as they have always extended to people in distress, but surely we cannot in this year deny to our own people, many of whom are not in any better plight, the right to seek some support during this universal effort to help distressed people in other parts of the world.  We are asking the Government to look first at our own people and see how they exist having regard to the high cost of the necessaries of life and realise that it is incumbent upon us to do something for these people who have first charge on us.</P>
    <P>There are many people in the country who criticise, and with some reason, the present system of applying a means test in relation to old age pensions.  They feel that there are <Col N="1053" /> arguments which can be advanced for seriously considering the abolition of such means test.  But even though there are very many exponents of that point of view, we must sit back until such time as those people who are classified as being in the very lower income class have got something to assist them.  Then the wider issue of modifying or wiping out the means test can be considered.</P>
    <P>It is in these circumstances that we feel we can support this motion.  We feel that there really does not exist any comparable demand on the Government by any section with such a legitimate case as the people who are trying to live today in face of the dramatic increase in the cost of every necessary of life.  We appeal to the Government to consider this motion and provide the ways and means to give increases to these classes, not that they may have comfort, but that at least they will be spared the privation which exists among some and which could exist among more unless some step is taken to alleviate their position at the first possible moment.</P>

      <P>If this motion does nothing else but indicate to the country the change of heart on the part of the Fine Gael Party, so ably put by Deputy O'Sullivan, and the Labour Party also, it will have served a very useful purpose.  It is not so very long ago&mdash;it is within the memory of many Deputies present here&mdash;that old age pensions were reduced by the Party that now pretend to be prepared to give their life's blood for the old age pensioners.  It is not very long ago that the Labour Party were in the box seat.  The present Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Norton, was then Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare and was for three long years in office and, although he did promise an increase in social benefits, I have yet to see what they amounted to.  As far as the old age pensioners were concerned they were almost infinitesimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is unnecessary while the Fianna Fáil Government are in power because, every time the nation's resources are sufficient, Deputies can <Col N="1054" /> be quite sure that the first people they will think of will be the old age pensioners, the disabled persons and the widows and orphans.  The Fianna Fáil Party were the first in the world to introduce non-contributory widows' pensions.  Others have copied.  We thank God for that and every Irishman should be very proud of the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party Government of some years ago gave that great example.  As a result, widows, instead of having to go to the home assistance officer who, more often than not, would meet them with a scowl, can go to the post office and get the widow's pension.  No longer are they reduced to poverty-stricken circumstances and asked to be paupers in the eyes of the public.  That is something of which we are very proud.</P>
    <P>The actual reduction in the old age pension some years ago was not the most serious element of that act.  The alteration of the means test to the detriment of the claimant was a matter of which the Party responsible will always be ashamed.  The amendment introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1932 was one of the redeeming acts that put paid to the terrible hardships inflicted on old age pensioners up to that date and, in 1952, again to the credit of Fianna Fáil, the old age pensioners were taken off their knees.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us the increase in the number of people in receipt of old age pensions today as a result of the alteration of the means test in 1952.</P>
    <P>In 1928 the means test was altered by a reduction in the ceiling level from £49 10s. to £39 10s. and in the floor level from £26 to £15 12s. 6d. That is what Fianna Fáil had to undo. That was one of the many tasks they had before them.  The various Pensions Acts of 1908, 1920, 1924, 1928, were amended by Fianna Fáil and if old age pensioners are enjoying even frugal comfort they may thank benevolent, conscientious Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>There is another very important aspect of the old age pension code.  I should like to see the code recast.  I hope it will be recast.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred, and rightly so, to <Col N="1055" /> people in charitable institutions.  They were deprived at one time of their right to retain the old age pension and on admission to a county home their old age pension automatically ceased. Again, Fianna Fáil came to the rescue of those poor people who were destined to end their lives in such institutions.  Thank God, since the advent of Fianna Fáil to power, the old age pensioners who go into a county home are entitled to the maximum old age pension.  These things are forgotten by many people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority takes a certain amount from the old age pensioners.  Deputy Kyne as a member of a local authority knows that local authorities find it difficult to secure money and that the rates have benefited very substantially by the fact that old age pensioners are now able to contribute in a generous way towards their support and upkeep <Col N="1056" /> in the county homes.  One of the great things that happened under the 1952 Act is that the people who go voluntarily into mental homes are fully entitled to maximum pension.</P>
      <P>Under Section 7 of the Act of 1924, if a small farmer transferred his farm to his son on the occasion of a marriage within three years before or at any time after he became entitled to the old age pension and either before or after the passing of that Act, such property was calculated for the purpose of the means test.  The Act was amended with the result that farmers who so transfer their property are now fully entitled to the pension.  Since 1952, where the valuation of a farm does not exceed £30, whether there is a transfer to a single or to a married son or daughter, farmers are fully entitled to the pension. Again they can thank Fianna Fáil for that steady advance.  The 1952 Act provided something which was not provided in any other Act. Instead of reducing the old age pension and altering the means test to the detriment of claimants, as was done by Fine Gael, the Fianna Fáil Government, in 1952, made the most extraordinary alteration in the means test, something that even the most optimistic person never thought would happen or could happen.  The ceiling of £52.10s. was raised to £104.10s. and the floor level was raised to £52.10s.</P>

    <P>The Forests listed are situated either wholly or partly in the Gaeltacht, as defined in the Gaeltacht Areas Order, 1956.  It would be impracticable to extract separate figures related solely to the Gaeltacht areas.  Such figures would in any case give an unrealistic picture since the acquisition, planting and management of land near a Gaeltacht area can reasonably be expected to benefit people living in that area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will furnish a statement setting out side by side in respect of each county and each county borough (1) the number of vocational schools erected, (2) the number of vocational schools under construction, (3) the number of vocational schools proposed to be erected in each county in the next five years, and (4) the estimated number of children reaching school leaving age at a recent date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The attached table shows (1) the number of buildings which have been erected or adapted as vocational schools, including a small number of rented premises which are used for full time day courses and (ii) the number of vocational schools at present under construction or extension.</P>
      <P>Precise information as to the number of vocational schools to be erected in each county in the next five years is not available in my Department but present indications are that the erection of between 40 and 50 new schools and some 30 extensions will be undertaken by county committees of vocational education within the next five years.</P>
      <P>Figures are not available in my Department in regard to the number of children reaching school leaving age at any particular date, but the number of children between thirteen and fourteen, the latter being the compulsory school-leaving age, is approximately 50,000.  Many of these, of course, are already in postprimary schools.</P>
