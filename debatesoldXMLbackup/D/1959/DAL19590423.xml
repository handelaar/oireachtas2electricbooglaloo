      <P>When progress was reported last night, I was dealings with the accusation made by the Opposition to the effect that the Minister presented the figures incorrectly to the House and in some way juggled the figures to create a more favourable Budget than otherwise would be justified. The inference was that was done because of the forthcoming Presidential election.  I was arguing that even if there were no possibility of the £2½ million which the Minister estimated he would get from over-estimation being realised, it would not be completely and utterly disastrous. I think, however, that his chances of reaching his target are excellent. <Col N="950" /> The accusation that he has fiddled the figures is based on three grounds. The first argument is to the effect that he has taken credit on the Revenue side for the receipts from special import levies.  The Opposition say that in Deputy Sweetman's Budgets receipts under that heading were placed to capital.  It is quite true that they were but that was an extraordinary device adopted by Deputy Sweetman to deal with what he considered to be an extraordinary situation and by any legitimate standard it can be shown that in our circumstances today receipts under this heading are clearly and definitely current revenue and as such are legitimately available for current expenditure.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has also been made by the Opposition that some items which would properly be chargeable in this year's Budget to revenue have been transferred by the Minister to the capital side and that thereby he has been able to present a more favourable picture than would otherwise be the case.  The Book of Estimates shows a sum of £14.4 million for voted capital services and a careful examination of the items in the Book of Estimates shows clearly that there is no departure from the usual practice this year.  Everything that is capitalised can, in accordance with the principles which we have traditionally adopted, be legitimately capitalised and there is no basis at all for that suggestion by the Opposition in this respect.</P>
      <P>Most of the criticism from the other side of the House is directed to the fact that the Minister has taken credit for £2½ million for over-estimation this year as distinct from £1½ million last year.  Again the figures for recent years show that the Minister has not departed from established practice.  In the Budget proposals for the year 1954-55, credit was taken for £3¼ million over-estimation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Budget proposals.  I am not talking about the out-turn but of the Budget. <Col N="951" /> In the proposals presented to the House for 1954-55, the Minister at that time took credit for £3¼ million under this heading and in the subsequent year credit was taken for £2¼ million.  In the year after that, the figure again was £2¼ million; in 1957-58, £2.05 million; and in 1958-59, the figure was reduced to £1½ million, so that in increasing it this year to £2½ million, the Minister has not gone so far as to bring it back to the 1954-55 figure.</P>
      <P>In this respect the Minister has two possibilities of reaching his target.  On the one hand he can hope to make economies and allow for over estimations, and, on the other hand, he can confidently expect that revenue will be more buoyant than had been anticipated because of improved trading conditions, and between the two he should undoubtedly make up the amount for which he hopes.  I, for one, am confident that the outturn for the Budget will justify this estimate by the Minister.  None of the three reasons advanced as grounds for the accusation of &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; the figures can stand. The Budget is exactly what it purports to be, namely, a sound honest presentation of the Minister's estimates.</P>
      <P>I suggested last night that there are two different approaches to budgeting today.  There is the earlier conception of the Budget, that it has done its work completely if it balances itself.  The older theory is that if revenue and expenditiure are brought into line that ends the matter.  I pointed out that the more modern approach is that the Budget should be used as an instrument to balance the whole economy and that it is not enough that it should merely balance itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard it is important that we would not adopt and apply to our situation British thinking and British theories indiscriminately.  In Britain the Budget is seen to be an instrument for regulating the flow of the economy. Our Budget, however, and our economic policies must be designed to do more.  We must create the financial conditions and the financial climate within which expansion can take place but we must also be active in encouraging, developing and organising the <Col N="952" /> actual physical expansion itself.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer is like a policeman on point duty regulating the flow of traffic.  The traffic is already there and his function is, to a large extent, confined to regulating it. In our case we must, to a considerable extent, generate the traffic and then proceed to regulate it.  Those who are critical of the financial policy and the financial establishment in this country should realise the essential difference between the two countries and that, from the point of view of the Minister and his Department, ours is by far the more difficult task.</P>
    <P>In this Budget the Minister has adhered to the traditional arithmetic of the Budget.  As I have shown, he has conformed to orthodox principles. He has seen to it that the revenue he hopes to get will be sufficient to cover current expenditure.  That is all that is expected by traditional standards because for some time now, even in Britain, they have abandoned the idea that the Budget should be in over-all balance, that revenue should be sufficient to cover both above-the-line and below-the-line expenditure.  In this year's Budget in Britain they have clearly abandoned that theory and have shown they believe that if the above-the-line Budget is in balance that is all that is necessary.  If that is so in Britain, with their developed economy, it must be even more so in our case.  Even the most orthodox economists here will agree that once we have above-the-line balance we have done enough to preserve the traditional approach to budgeting.</P>
    <P>I should like, however, to examine the question a little further to see how this Budget measures up, in relation to the theory that a Budget, in addition to adhering to this old standard, should also be used as an instrument of general economic policy, that when the occasion demands, it should be used to stimulate activity and, on the contrary, when the occasion demands, it should be used to deflate the economy.</P>
    <P>That theory propounds that it is the state of the economy that is the governing factor in the framing of Budget proposals and it is in that <Col N="953" /> light that I should like to examine the Budget as presented by the Minister. This Budget is different from any we have ever had because it must be considered in relation to and as part of the general programme for economic expansion which has been set out in the White Paper.  For the first time we have clear definite lines of long-term policy set down to be followed.  We can see in what way the Budget as such fits into that long-term picture and judge its effectiveness in contributing to that overal objective.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Economic Expansion makes very clear the desirability of a reduction in taxation. At page 9, paragraph 11, it states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In particular, the Government's aim is to create conditions permitting as soon as possible of a reduction in direct taxation.  This would be a tonic to the economy, a stimulus to personal and corporate saving and an encouragement both to native and foreign enterprise to undertake new projects.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you have a clear and definite principle propounded in the White Paper.  Equally clearly and definitely, you have the Budget proposals of the Minister fitting in exactly to that programme in the reduction in direct taxation which he has achieved. The White Paper envisages a certain programme of capital expenditure. The essence to the White Paper proposals is that such an expanded programme of capital expenditure should take place.  This Budget does its part in that regard and, in so far as this coming year is concerned, the capital projects to be embarked upon and the amount of capital expenditure on productive lines are in accordance with the objectives set out in the White Paper.  It is important for us to realise the significance of the Budget in relation to our economy.</P>
    <P>The day has long since passed when the Budget was simply a matter affecting the amount of taxes people pay directly or indirectly.  The amount of money the Government collects and spends now forms a significant part of <Col N="954" /> the total volume of economic activity. In the coming year receipts and expenditure will be of the order of £130 million.  That must be compared with a total gross national product of £577 million in 1958.  That gives us a clear indication of the importance the Budgetary proposals have in relation to the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>In Britain, coming up to the Budget of this year, there was a very great volume of discussion and writing on the importance of the Budgetary proposals in relation to the economy.  I think it was widely agreed there by the commentators that the Budget would have a very significant effect on the total volume of economic activity.  The size of their Budget in relation to their total economy is much the same as ours.  In so far as I can calculate it, the volume of the State's financial activities in Britain in relation to the total gross national product corresponds to ours.  Therefore, if it is important for them, as they agree over there it is, it is equally important for us.</P>
    <P>Another indication of the importance of the Minister's proposals is the fact that in our circumstances gross domestic capital formation is in the order of £70 million per annum and capital expenditure by the State is in the region of £45 million.  On the capital side of the picture, the State is directly responsible for an expenditure of £45 million out of a total of £70 million.  Therefore, in these circumstances, it must be agreed that the Budget and the Minister's proposals have a very important and a very significant effect on the economy as a whole.  That being so, let us see what the Minister has done to improve our situation and to make a contribution towards solving our difficulties of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has made a very important contribution towards the solution of these difficulties.  He has given a direct fillip to the economy by remitting back to consumers a total of £2½ million.  He has placed at the disposal of the community for current consumption an additional £2½ million by, on the one hand, remissions <Col N="955" /> of taxation and, on the other hand, increased social welfare benefits. If you take a multiplier effect of two it is clear that the Minister is injecting into the economy an additional £5 million or £6 million of purchasing power which cannot fail to have a very important stimulating effect on economic activity.  I am quite convinced it will undoubtedly beneficially influence the level of production and the level of investment.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in our situation the thing we most urgently require is a consistent expansion of productive investment.  It is widely agreed that, if you want to get productive investment next year, by far the best way to achieve it is to stimulate demand this year.  In so far as the Minister has, to the extent of £5,000,000 or £6,000,000, stimulated demand in the coming year, it must have the beneficial effect of bringing about an increase in productive investment towards the end of next year and certainly in the year after that.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to deal for a moment with the position here in regard to initial allowances. We have a system of initial allowances for plant, machinery and equipment.  I notice that in Britain this year they have altered these to investment allowances, the difference being that in the case of an initial allowance the amount allowed in the first year is taken off the value of the asset in future years for wear and tear purposes, whereas, in the case of the investment allowance, the allowance which is given in the first year is ignored thereafter.</P>
    <P>In the case of these initial allowances I suggest the Minister might consider making a change.  It has been suggested for some time by economists that either initial or investment allowances are bad economics because they distort the normal pattern of investment and encourage investment which might not be wise and might not otherwise be made.  It is suggested that a far better and a far more correct way of achieving the same result of stimulating productive investment would be to give optional <Col N="956" /> depreciation allowances to manufacturing industry.  That system was tried and found very successful in Sweden and it was abandoned there only because it was too successful.  In our situation, it would be well worth careful examination.  The idea of the system is that the Revenue Commissioners would allow the same basis for wear and tear purposes as the firm adopts for depreciation in its own accounts.</P>
    <P>The specific stimulus that has been given in the Minister's Budget to increased consumption and increased production must be considered in relation to and added to the whole series of measures which have been introduced in the past two years and which are designed to create a financial apparatus to assist expansion.  The most significant factor is of course the fact that good government, stable government, has done a very great deal to restore public confidence and not alone public confidence but more important perhaps the confidence of the financial institutions.  The institutions, banking and others, are now prepared to make finance available and grant credit where formerly they were not prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>Money is now available in the normal, commercial way on a liberal scale.  We have had the legislation dealing with the Industrial Credit Company, the funds of which have now been increased to the extent, and the scope of its activities expanded to the point, where the Minister is able to say in this House, for the first time in living memory, that no project which is worthwhile and has a reasonable prospect of success need be held up because of lack of capital.</P>
    <P>In addition to the reduction in direct taxation for the coming year, we have had the tax incentives to industrial exports and production generally. Among other things we have joined the World Bank which brings the resources of that organisation within our reach in case we require them for any specific project.  We have joined the International Monetary Fund which is available to help and advise us, should we get into <Col N="957" /> balance of payments difficulties again. We have considerably expanded activity by the Industrial Development Authority in the administration of the Industrial Grants Act, and An Foras Tionscal has expanded its activities in its endeavours to promote industrial activity in the under-developed areas. In addition, the Minister has brought into being the system of Exchequer Bills and has given to the Central Bank increased powers in connection with commercial banking all of which are designed to provide the financial background necessary for expansion.</P>
    <P>A very significant development has been the agreement between the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the commercial banks on a scheme to speed up the flow of credit for agriculture. Over the whole picture, there is a series of measures designed to see to it that, in so far as financial measures can do so, expansion and development are facilitated in every possible way.  In addition to the purely financial measures which we can take to assist our growth and development, I have already said that we must go further and must actively participate in the organising and developing of the actual physical opportunities for expansion.  In so far as this aspect is concerned, we have seen vigorous action during the past two years.  The Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Act has been passed to facilitate the introduction into this country of foreign firms with capital and, more important than capital, access to the most modern technological know how.</P>
    <P>We have the Industrial Development Authority active all the time in endeavouring to promote projects of every sort.  By direct Government action, we have got under way such ventures as the oil refinery, the Dundalk Engineering Works and the developments in Cork Dockyard.  As I have already mentioned, the Industrial Credit Company is actively seeking out ways of promoting new industrial enterprises, as is An Foras Tionscal, so that, in regard to both possible lines of development, the creation of the financial apparatus, on the one hand, and the seeking out of the <Col N="958" /> physical opportunities on the other, the past two years show a picture of successful activity.</P>
    <P>I think that our problem in this country in a general economic way is one which is facing developing countries all over the word, countries which for centuries have not had an industrial background.  They have been endeavouring to catch up with their more advanced neighbours and have been endeavouring to create economics for themselves which would give their peoples a standard of living comparable with the standard of living obtaining in countries which have long traditions of industrial development.  In that situation, the problem is to try to pursue a programme of vigorous internal expansion without getting into balance of payments difficulties.  That dilemma has faced practically every one of these countries.  India is the most spectacular example but that dilemma has affected all other countries pursuing such programmes such as Turkey, Greece, and so on, to a greater or lesser extent.</P>
    <P>In our case, I think it is clear that the answer to that dilemma is to achieve an expansion of exports, both industrial and agricultural, which would correspond with expansion internally. That, being our problem, I think we have set about solving it in a realistic and determined manner.  The whole problem of marketing our agricultural products is being reviewed in a systematic and comprehensive way. The Government have indicated that they are ready and prepared to give whatever assistance, financial or otherwise, is necessary to ensure the best possible marketing of our agricultural surplus.</P>
    <P>The promotion of industrial exports is equally being encouraged in every way.  All possible forms of encouragement are being used and brought into play, the most revolutionary, of course, being the tax incentives in this regard. In so far as that is our problem, I think we can congratulate the Government on seeing clearly what the problem is and taking determined action to solve it.  The problem of increasing productive investment was always a major problem but, in recent times, it has been accelerated by the slowing up <Col N="959" /> of the housing drive and by the falling off in the necessity for certain social building, hospitals, and so on, which had been running at a certain level up to recently.  In this regard, the devising of physical projects of productive investments is particularly important.</P>
    <P>The housing and building industry was a great employer of labour and the slowing up in that sector has undoubtedly accentuated our unemployment problem.  It is important that we absorb the people who are becoming redundant in the house building industry in some way, and it is important that we keep in this country the skills which they have.  The only suggestion I can make in that regard is that we might try to do something under two headings.  First of all, I think the necessity for increased hotel bedroom accommodation is outstanding. The building operatives could be to some extent absorbed in a programme of increased hotel construction.</P>
    <P>I should also like to suggest that in so far as we have surplus building labour, we should now set about the construction of factories even though there is not a particular project in mind for them.  I would visualise that in towns of any size a factory would be built which should be available for an industry when it could be procured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>By the Government. By the local authority, if necessary, but it would be financed by the Government. My idea is two-fold.  First of all, when an industrial project is mooted, there is often very serious delay and difficulty in procuring suitable premises.  An industry is frequently lost to a town, or to the country, because of the delay and difficulty involved in procuring sites, getting town planning permission and erecting a factory.  If a town were able to come to a potential investor or industrialist and say: &ldquo;Come to our town and start your industry; we have a factory already built waiting for you,&rdquo; it would often clinch the issue. In terms of national wealth these factories would be a very good investment, <Col N="960" /> particularly in so far as they would contribute now towards using the surplus building labour we have on hands.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether anything could be done in regard to what is sometimes known as structural unemployment. We are inclined to talk loosely about unemployment, which is a generic term used without specifying the particular type of unemployment we have in mind.  As we know, employment is accounted for under many headings.  The type of employment about which I think we might do something is the structural type.  Our efforts are all the time directed towards endeavouring to do something about the volume of chronic unemployment we have because of lack of development.  But, pending an increase in productive investment, which we must get to solve that problem, it might be possible that with increased information and organisation, we could do something to alleviate the amount of unemployment which arises through structural changes in the economy.</P>
      <P>I suppose the only vehicle at our disposal in that regard at the moment is the Labour Exchange.  I do not know that for that particular purpose of switching from industry to industry and from job to job the Labour Exchanges are the most efficient possible machinery.  It is something that might be examined because any little bit that could be pared off the total volume of unemployment, would be an advantage.  I am sure that in the total unemployment figures there is bound to be a certain amount which can be attributable to structural changes of that nature.  If we could do anything, by better organisation and more information, to reduce that amount it would be a help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the criticisms one hears in business circles is that, whereas Ministerial pronouncements and speeches indicate certain lines of policy, very often when the individual business man comes up against the officials of the Department he does not find the same urgency and desire reflected at all levels of the Civil Service.  I do not know whether there is any <Col N="961" /> validity for that but the accusation is certainly made that people, who have heard a particular line of policy announced Ministerially, do not find the follow-up at the lower level in the various Departments and institutions which the Ministerial pronouncements would lead them to believe should be there.</P>
    <P>On that point, it is important that our Civil Service and the officials of all our State institutions should realise that they have a vitally important part to play in our economic salvation. After all, the Civil Service is the intellectual élite of this country.  Every year, for decades now, the best brains have gone into the Civil Service and there must be in it a tremendous reservoir of talent and ability.  I would be the first to state that our Civil Service is a really excellent one in every way and that the officials are very capable and conscientious.  In our situation, however, I think they must be a little more than that.</P>
    <P>The corollary I made between the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and our Minister for Finance can be extended to the relationship between the British Civil Service and the Irish Civil Service.  The duty of the British Civil Service is to sit back and impartially administer a dynamic economy. In our case the Civil Servant must go further.  He must consider himself as one who must not be content merely to administer; he must take a part in encouraging and developing the economy generally.  I admit that that may be against the established tenets of what a good Civil Servant should be.  I also would be prepared to admit that there are persons in our public service who have that approach and determination to assist the general economic revival, but I think it could be more widely developed in the whole sphere of the public service.  It should be realised in these circles that it will demand an extra efforts from everybody if we are to succeed in achieving economic prosperity.</P>
    <P>There has been some volume of opinion recently which has suggested that the abolition of income tax would be a very desirable thing.  Indeed, my colleague, Deputy Booth, suggested <Col N="962" /> that he would favour such a development. The only point I should like to make in that regard is that it is important that a system of taxation should be progressive as well as regressive. Those who advocate a sales tax or an expenditure tax are inclinded to overlook the fact that a sales tax is entirely regressive; it bears much more heavily on the poorer sections of the community and that the better off you are the less you need worry about such a tax.</P>
    <P>Income tax restores the balance to some extent.  In so far as everybody in the community pays a certain amount of indirect or expenditure taxes, the poorer sections share the burden with the richer.  So far as income tax is concerned, it bears more heavily on the better-off sections so that you achieve a balance.  In this question of whether or not we should abolish income tax, in addition to the problem of an alternative source of revenue, we must also bear in mind that it provides an important progressive element in the whole.</P>
    <P>Our system of taxation is as a whole a combination of regressive and progressive taxation.  If you abolish income tax you will be left with an entirely regressive system.  That would be socially unjust.  I should think that our efforts in this regard should be directed more towards procuring, in the first instance, accurate statistics of the yield from the various sections liable for income tax and sur-tax.  I put down a question some time ago in this regard.  I was told that the information for which I was looking in relation to Schedules A. and B. was not available.  I believe that similar information would not be available with regard to certain aspects of Schedule E.</P>
    <P>If we are to do anything significant about income tax, before thinking in terms of abolishing it, we must find out first of all, far more accurately than we do at the moment, from exactly what sources and sections of the community the tax is collected.  I am sure it came as a stock to some people to discover that Schedule B. income tax&mdash;that is the income tax paid by farmers on the occupation of <Col N="963" /> agricultural land&mdash;amounts to only £94,000 a year.  If we had information of the cost of collecting that particular tax and the cost of making the assessments, it might become apparent that the sensible thing to do would be to abolish, Schedule B, altogether or amalgamate it with Schedule A.</P>
    <P>I think our efforts should be directed towards eliminating from the lower reaches of the income tax net uneconomic assessments.  If we had sufficient information we could, I think, establish a point on the income scale and say that anybody below that point was out&mdash;not that they would not in the normal way be liable for tax but that, on balance, the cost of administering the code for people below that level would not be sufficient recompense for the amount of tax coming in.  I should prefer that our efforts and our thinking would be directed along these lines rather than advocating the abolition of income tax altogether and its replacement by a sales and expenditure tax.</P>
    <P>The Budget, in addition to its broad financial implications, contains quite a few things which are excellent in themselves.  The Minister is to be congratulated on introducing the provision with regard to apprentices.  That is something in relation to which there has been considerable agitation for a long time.  It is, I think, an essentially just provision.  I am very glad to see it incorporated in this Budget.</P>
    <P>The increase of the lower level of sur-tax to £2,000 is again something socially just.  The £1,500 limit had no relevance at all to modern conditions. It bore no relationship to the basis on which it was originally fixed in the light of modern conditions.  Indeed, we had the absurd position for some time past in which it was possible for a man to be liable for sur-tax without being liable for income tax.  The Minister is to be congratulated in taking this eminently sensible decision. Even more to be commended, is the sensible decision to allow personal reliefs for sur-tax purposes.  That, again, is something eminently just from the social point of view.  It will, I am sure, also lead to a certain amount of administrative convenience from the <Col N="964" /> point of view of the revenue by eliminating a great number of marginal cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in this Budget statement, referred to his efforts to nationalise the whole structure of the Civil Service.  That is something in which people are very interested and the Minister's effort is something for which everybody is grateful.  It is good to know that that examination is proceeding, and proceeding obviously on the basis of getting the goodwill and co-operation of all concerned. At this stage, we can only hope that the Minister will be able to achieve a solution to this problem which will be satisfactory to everybody &mdash;the taxpayer and the hardworking civil servant as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he progress to introduce in the Finance Act a provision in relation to the acquisition of patents.  The cost of patents purchased will be chargeable against profits and, as a corollary to that, when patent rights are sold the income received from the sale will be taxable.  That is an excellent provision in our situation because it will facilitate an increase in the technical efficiency in industry.  The industrialist will now be able to buy useful patents to enable him to become more efficient, or to expand his industry in some direction.</P>
    <P>I should, however, like to mention one danger.  It is important that the Minister should make that provision applicable only from this date forward because it is possible that a firm or an individual may have purchased a patent on the basis of exploiting it and, having purchased it on that basis, would now become liable for tax on the profits of its sale.  In equity, the Minister must, when he comes to give effect to this particular proposal, excludes from taxation the income from patents sold from now on, which were acquired before this date.</P>
    <P>On the capital side of the Budget, the position is eminently satisfactory. The most important thing in this regard to which the Minister must look is the savings of the community. He has been able to report that Prize Bonds and the more trational forms of savings have kept up during the <Col N="965" /> year.  The limit for Exchequer Bills issued has now been raised from £2,000,000 to £6,000,000.  Possibly the most encouraging single feature on the capital side of the Budget Statement is the fact that £9,000,000&mdash;the contribution to Sinking Fund last year&mdash; could be genuinely applied to a reduction of dead-weight debt.</P>
    <P>Table XI of the Financial Statement which the Minister issued with the Budget gives what is called the State Debt Balance Sheet.  That Table shows that at 31st March, 1959, the gross capital liability of the State was £455.9 millions.  There are a number of assets, of varying degrees of legitimacy, to be set off against that over-all liability. Let us take that figure of £455.9 million and see if it is as frightening as some commentators would have us believe.</P>
    <P>The first comparison I would make in relation to it is that it compares with a national income of £493,000,000 for 1958 so that our total gross State debt is still less than one year's national income.  In those circumstances I do not think there is any need for a critical tightening-up in State capital expenditure.  Bearing our situation in mind, the fact that we have an underdeveloped economy and the problem of procuring increased productive investments, I think it would be wrong and not justified by the facts to let the size of our gross State debt interfere in any way with our programme of capital investment particularly as it is made clear by the White Paper and by the Minister's statement that the emphasis is on productive investment.  So long as we keep the emphasis on productive investment and in so far as we comply with the ordinary rules of prudent public finance in managing our State debt, I do not think there is any need for curtailment in this regard.</P>
    <P>Table 4 of this Financial Statement gives the Capital Budget for 1959-60 and it is shown there that the total capital investment in the public sector in the coming year will be £45 million.  That is quite a significant contribution by the Government towards economic expansion and, as we look down the list of avenues in which this amount is going <Col N="966" /> to be spent, it is perfectly clear that it is a very desirable programme of capital investment.  The list includes £5.8 million for the E.S.B., capital for Irish Shipping, Bord na Móna, C.I.E., the Air Companies, the Industrial Credit Company, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Shannon Free Airport and so on.  It is a comprehensive list of economic projects totalling £45 million for the coming year.  That is a sound expansionist programme and one on which the Minister is to be congratulated, firstly, on devising it and secondly, on his ability to procure the necessary capital to put it into operation.</P>
    <P>I cannot find any logic or coherence in the Opposition attack on this Budget.  It seems to me that their arguments are confused and diverse and that is so because they must attack for political reasons a Budget that is in itself excellent.  The Minister is to be congratulated on introducing a Budget which must be, by any standards, one of the best ever introduced in this House.  When one considers the position obtaining in 1956 the improvement in our general economic and financial position is little short of miraculous.</P>
    <P>In the year just passed we have balanced our Budget and we are looking forward to another balanced Budget in the coming year and that in the context of being able to give substantial reductions in taxation.  We have restored public and private credit in the country; we have balanced our international payments; industrial and agricultural production are on the way up and the position is improving in every direction.  I think it is illogical for the Opposition not to give the Minister credit for that.  The great activity he has shown and the whole series of measures he has introduced in his comparatively short time in office have made a very significant contribution to the improvement of the situation generally.</P>
    <P>This is a wise and just Budget.  The Minister, through good management, had certain resources at his disposal which he was in a position to give away and he has given them away wisely and justly.  He has allocated a certain amount to the sections of the community that need it most and, on <Col N="967" /> the other hand, he has been careful to use some of the resources at his disposal intelligently to stimulate economic activity and productive investment.  In so far as he had done that he deserves the congratulations of the whole House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey has treated the House to a long, interesting, and obviously well-prepared and well-delivered speech in defence of this Budget.  The only fault I have to find with his contribution is that it gives a very false impression of the conditions obtaining here at the moment.  A stranger listening to Deputy Haughey might be forgiven for thinking that over the past year or two vast strides had been made towards the solution of our major economic ills and that in cases where solutions had not been reached we had plans to deal with them during the coming year or two.</P>
      <P>I wonder would the ordinary man in the street be convinced of that.  I wonder would Deputy Haughey's speech convince the man at the Labour Exchange or the married man who is now working in England and sending remittances home every week. We had a lot of academic, accountancy discussion but the one practical proposal put forward by Deputy Haughey to deal with our unemployment problem was when he suggested that, in order to absorb those who are at present unemployed in the building trade, with State aid or with local authority aid, factories should be built in several towns throughout the country.</P>

      <P>To my mind, it was the only practical suggestion put forward by Deputy Haughey to employ people who are now unemployed.  One would think from that suggestion to build factories in every town in the hope that industries might come to them that there was no other work available at the moment for the people unemployed in the building industry.  It was implied in Deputy Haughey's statement that our housing problem was now almost solved.  I am quite sure Deputy Haughey knows that is not correct, and I am quite sure that if he wished to do so, he could have pointed out to us the present shortage of houses in Dublin.  Certainly, those of us who are attached to local authorities in other cities know that we still need very many houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone listens to the Minister for Lands.  He has talked himself out.  In the city of Cork at the moment, we need 2,000 extra houses.  Factories, for which there is no industry, are being built while these houses have still to be built.  Deputy Haughey is well aware of the bed shortage in many of our hospitals.  Those of us who are on hospital boards know of the pressing need for further provision in that direction.  We know the need for homes for old people who are at present dumped in unsuitable accommodation. We know the need for convalescent homes.  There is hardly a mental hospital authority which has not felt the pressing need for further accommodation.  The accommodation available for mentally defective children is regrettably scarce.  Surely it is obvious to us, before we start building these empty factories, that we could <Col N="969" /> alleviate the sufferings of some of the unemployed by absorbing them in building in that direction.</P>
      <P>The Minister was faced with an invidious task in preparing this Budget. Not only was he confronted with the ordinary problems associated with producing a Budget, together with the added embarrassment of the concessions given in the British Budget, but he was also set the task of firing the first shot in the Presidential election and the P.R. referendum campaign.  He was also set the extra task of writing the Taoiseach's election address and drawing up the draft of the advance publicity on behalf of his Party for both of these contests.  He made a brave effort.</P>
      <P>The Minister spread the concessions as widely as he could.  He was aware of the widespread demand by practically every section of the community and the various organisations in relation to the old age pensioners.  The increases he gave are, indeed, welcome, but he, the Government and the Government Party, should not think that by giving 2/6 to the old age pensioners they were setting the world on fire.  Looking at these concessions and analysing them, one sees that while they are helpful, they are very small indeed.  An increase of 2/6 amounts to approximately 4d. per day, or approximately 1d. per meal.  I do not think anyone can claim that the standard of living of the old age pensioners will be greatly improved by giving them 1d. per meal, with prices as they stand to-day.</P>
      <P>Those figures stand in striking contrast to the other sections of the community who, through tax concessions and otherwise, will benefit to the extent of £50, £60, £70 or £80.  I understand that some members of the front bench of the Government will benefit to that extent.  We must take that into account when we look at the increase given to the old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a mean and miserable political trick to defer the payment of the old age pension increase to 1st August. It was an endeavour to get the support of the old age pensioners, and their sympathisers, for the election without paying them until two months after the <Col N="970" /> election.  It was a real case of: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;, especially when one realises that the concessions given to boxing promoters and greyhound racetrack managements came into effect as from the day after the Budget&mdash;16th April.</P>
    <P>I do not know, of course, why we gave those concessions at all to the professional boxing promoters.  I understand from the Minister's statement that some pinhead over in Bord Fáilte got the brilliant idea that if we removed the tax and put on a professional tournament we would be overrun with visitors from England and elsewhere during An Tóstal.  I do not believe that.  I do not think it is very desirable to give a further impetus which is not needed at all and will not help Bord Fáilte so far as professional boxing is concerned.</P>
    <P>The justification put forward by the Minister for the removal of the tax from greyhound racing was that an anomaly existed in so far as there was no tax on horse racing.  I agree with him that there was an anomaly but my method of righting that anomaly would have been to put a tax on horse racing.  By doing that, both of them would have been put on the same level and uniformity would have been achieved.  It cannot be denied that the fraternity who go racing would scarcely miss the extra taxation and it would be a considerable source of revenue to the Minister.  It was a hopelessly bad decision to try to get uniformity by taking the tax off greyhound racing rather than putting it on horse racing.</P>
    <P>There are many people who suffered drastically and severely under the 1957 Budget who get no relief at all in the current Budget.  There is a vast army of people who had £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 filched out of their pockets by the removal of the food subsidies in 1957 and who get nothing at all.  It is true that the widow who draws a non-contributory pension gets an increase in the same manner as the old age pensioner, but the unfortunate orphan has not been taken into consideration in this Budget.</P>
    <P>The single man drawing unemployment assistance must still take his <Col N="971" /> dreary stand in the breadline.  There is no hope for him at all, no relief. The insured person drawing sickness benefit, whether married or single, has been omitted.  There is no concession for him.  The last time he was thought of was when the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Health, thought of him and raised the hospital charge from 6/- to 10/- per day, and added a fee for X-ray and consultation.</P>
    <P>The person drawing unemployment benefit, whether married or single, gets nothing at all, not one brown farthing, and for the widow drawing the noncontributory pension, there is not a farthing.  There is not a farthing for the small pensioner such as a C.I.E. pensioner.  He will pay the same for his foodstuffs, his tobacco, his fuel, his rent and rates.  The ordinary working-class married man, supporting a wife and children on a weekly wage, who was badly hit by the removal of the food subsidies, gets nothing either.  He is in the wage bracket of £6, £7 or £8 a week.  He has to support a wife and family, and he is liable for income tax, but he gets nothing at all, not one brown farthing from the Government.</P>
    <P>You may add to that group the small struggling farmer, the small shopkeeper in a rural town and anyone living on a fixed income.  That vast army of people have not been thought of in this Budget, have not benefited to the extent of one halfpenny and must carry on in the face of constantly increasing prices.</P>
    <P>This Government has seen fit, since it assumed office, virtually to abandon price control in the hope that prices will find their own level.  They found their own level all right but a level very many people cannot meet, a level which drives people almost to starvation point in the case of the underprivileged members of the community. Out of the total of 200 prices that go to make up the cost of living index, 150 of them have increased since this Government came into power and this Government has the unique record of allowing prices to reach an all-time high level.  This vast army of people who get nothing from this <Col N="972" /> Budget must continue to meet the very high cost of living.  That, of course, stands in strong contrast to the fact that the Minister was able to spare £160,000 for sur-tax concessions for people in the salary bracket of around £3,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The greatest concern to me in relation to the Minister's Budget Statement is that he fails to indicate to us how it is proposed to deal with our unemployment and emigration problems.  I have always regarded the Minister's Budget speech as a vehicle of which the Minister might avail to inform the House as to what exactly he intends to do regarding our most pressing economic ills.  However, I have read and re-read the Minister's Statement and I can see no indication of hope that this Government is either willing to tackle or capable of tackling these problems.  We have the unique record of having perhaps the highest unemployment figure in Europe, 10 per cent. of our insurable people unemployed, and our annual emigration figure is a challenge to us. One would think the Minister would indicate how it is proposed to solve these problems.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech at column 354, Volume 174, of the Dáil Debates of the 15th April, 1959, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Though the unemployment figures for recent weeks are running about 5,000 less than a year ago, they are still much too high and it is the aim of Government policy generally to increase employment as rapidly as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to these words and to say how anaemic and barren they are when compared with the words used in dealing with the unemployment problem when this Government was seeking power at the last election.  In my constituency in the City of Cork, there was issued a pamphlet headed: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil plans the end of emigration.&rdquo;&ldquo;Quick action needed to avert national disaster&rdquo;.  In the course of the pamphlet they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The present spate of emigration is the most serious problem now facing the nation.  The recent Census <Col N="973" /> Report has shown that the situation must be righted quickly if disaster is to be avoided.</P>
    <P>In contrast to the inaction of the present Coalition Fianna Fáil have been preparing plans for the day when the Party will again take up the reins of Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Two years ago they took up the reins of Government and I have quoted what the Minister has said in the course of his Budget speech.  They go on further in this pamphlet and say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The full employment proposals recently announced by Fianna Fáil show how the Party intend to deal with the problem of emigration by providing work for our own people at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then in heavy type:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Fianna Fáil plan proposes an increase over five years in the number of new jobs by 100,000.</P>
    <P>This would result in full employment and the end of abnormal emigration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the plan put before the electors of Cork on that occasion: &ldquo;Return Fianna Fáil to power and 100,000 new jobs will be created in five years,&rdquo; creating a situation of full employment and ending abnormal emigration.  We have reached the end of two years of their term of office when the people of Cork and the people of Ireland generally could have expected 40,000 of these new jobs to have turned up.  The promises have now been watered down to the statement used by the Minister: &ldquo;It is the aim of Government policy generally to increase employment as rapidly as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We know there are fewer people in employment now than there were a year ago.  The labour force has been steadily reducing from year to year and when we turn to the Minister's Budget speech we would expect some comment from him on that, but not at all.  He has not referred to the fact that the number of people at work in 1958 was 10,000 fewer than the number at work in 1957.  These figures of course are revealed to us in Table XII of the Economic Statistics compiled by the <Col N="974" /> Central Statistics Office.  They have referred to the fact that there are 32,000 fewer at work than in 1956; 50,000 fewer than in 1955; 54,000 fewer than in 1954; 51,000 fewer than in 1953; 69,000 fewer than in 1952; and 88,000 fewer than in 1951.  I referred to the fact that over the period from 1951 there were available to people in this country 88,000 fewer jobs.  I do not know why these figures should be ignored and why we should have such enthusiastic speeches from people like Deputy Haughey about the position of the country.</P>
    <P>I think the Budget, notwithstanding the support it has got from Government speakers, is simply proof of the incompetence of this Government to deal with the country's economic ills. It is further proof of the extent to which the people were duped during the last election campaign.  The day of reckoning is coming.  I have no doubt as to what the verdict will be.  I think that if the people were now given an opportunity of a general election the false promises made by the Fianna Fáil candidates at the last general election would boomerang and the people would give notice to quit to the present Government.  For the sake of the country, for the happiness of the people, for the sake of giving them some hope, the sooner that day comes the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is indicative to me of the situation to which the country has been reduced that Fianna Fáil Deputies have attempted to work themselves up to some stage of enthuasism for this Budget and more particularly that the type of speech made by Deputy Haughey should be founded upon the rather meagre proposals contained in it.  It was stated with regard to a person in charge of the affairs of Malta that he said he prepared a scheme for the betterment of that country which he could put into operation if somebody would give him £100,000,000.  It is a significant figure and reminiscent of the Tánaiste's plan. The comment made afterwards, when he propounded his plan for spending the £100,000,000, was that it was a <Col N="975" /> sort of apocalyptic vision the radiance of which was very bright but the details of which were sunk in obscurity.</P>
      <P>Another vision of this country which has been brought before those who deal with economic matters in Paris, where delegates sometimes go to consider the circumstances that may arise if there is a free trade area and we have to take our place in it, is by no means radiant but the details are formally marked.  It adds up to the fact that it is considered there are four undeveloped countries in Western Europe and we are marked with Iceland as two of them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey congratulates the Minister on all the schemes introduced for getting credit for the State without the necessity for national loans.  In his reply, would the Minister tell me which of these schemes is the product of his brain?  How many of the schemes that are now being used as devices for getting people to lend money to the State without the necessity for national loans have proceeded from the Government he represents?</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey gave a radical idea &mdash;Deputy Casey referred to it&mdash;with regard to factories.  I understood him to say his proposal was that each of our towns should build a factory and get a progressive industrialist to come along and put something into the factory.  If that is the brightest idea emanating from one of the best speakers, so far, from the Government benches in this debate, I should like to hear the Minister's comment if that proposal were carried out even to a limited extent in the country.</P>
      <P>I wonder if Deputy Haughey would stop there at the building of the factories? There is no question of machinery and plant.  A difficulty arises also about the town in which you would provide the factory.  It is still more difficult to install the plant and machinery for the industrialist who might be tempted by the fact that the State had built some sort of a building called a factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an interesting booklet entitled <i>Seven Republics in Search of a Future.</i>  Our new book would be <Col N="976" /> entitled <i>Thousands of Factories in Search of an Industrialist.</i>  The Deputy cited the building of something in the way of a shack in which the factory would be housed.</P>
    <P>Some Fianna Fáil Deputy wanted to know why there was any complaint about the 2/6d. a week for old age and other pensioners.  The only complaint I heard in that regard was that the sum offered is inadequate in the circumstances in which it has been brought about.  Deputy Haughey said that an Opposition Deputy remarked that the Government were shamed into giving the 2/6d.  Deputy Haughey then asked, in effect: &ldquo;Is it not a good thing to have a Government that will yield to shame or to a shameful position?&rdquo; It is, of course.  However, one must look behind what there is at present and see how it was that the plight of the old age pensioner was such that shame reduced the Government at the moment to give the 2/6d. described by Deputy Casey as equivalent to 1d. per meal per day to the pensioner.</P>
    <P>The cost-of-living index figure is the test.  When one considers it, and how it has been increased by Fianna Fáil direct action, it must further be remembered that the cost-of-living figure at the moment is based on what might be called &ldquo;subsistence allowances.&rdquo; Many years ago, when the cost-of-living figure was introduced, it included many items which have since been cut out in the compilation of that figure.  It included items such as tobacco and drink&mdash;items which gave some solace to people.  But, in 1947, when the then Fianna Fáil Government had in mind fiercely to increase the taxes in these two respects, it was necessary, in relation to any demand that might arise for more wages owing to the increased figure, to cut out these items and include only items described as &ldquo;essential commodities.&rdquo; The figure by which this 2/6d. is judged is a figure based on subsistence allowances which never did allow for anything in the way of an improvement in the standard of living.  The old cost-of-living figure included commodities which were not regarded as essentials but as quasi-essentials.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> We have reached the level in the present cost of living figure at which even the Government were shamed into giving the 2/6d. to the old age and other pensioners&mdash;whatever it may be worth as against the new demands for wages which are bound to be made, and, when granted, will raise the cost of living still more.  The cost of living index figure does not mention the cost of living of a great majority of people in this country.  It should be remembered in that connection that when a Budget has to be considered it should not be considered in the light of a Budget that has not increased taxes. The customs duties, as they are estimated for the year that has ended, were round about £45,000,000.  They brought in £1,000,000 more.  They are estimated to bring in £1¼ million next year.  One of these days, I shall ask the Minister to provide me with details of how that extra £1,000,000 arose in the year that has ended and how it is believed that revenue from customs duties will rise by £1¼ million in the year we are in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey says there were comments that the Minister, as he put it, &ldquo;fiddled with the figures.&rdquo;  I do not know that any complaint has been made other than that the Minister has definitely made these arrangements to give away £2½ million which he has not got.  He has played with the figures at least to that extent.  He allows himself £1½ million for over-estimation&mdash; that is a net figure.  I wonder does the Minister feel that that over-estimation contains all the items likely to be met during the year, or has he any apprehension whatever as to Supplementary Estimates?  If so, will he give us what his gross estimation is and let us know what subtractions to make from that, by way of Supplementaries, which he thinks he must meet?</P>
    <P>With regard to this over-estimation the Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am, however, satisfied that at the present critical stage in our development programme the taking of a limited budgetary risk in order to reduce direct taxation is fully justifiable.  I believe that a reduction in direct taxation would stimulate <Col N="978" /> productive enterprise and, by encouraging saving, provide additional resources for expansion.  The economy needs this tonic and, in the confidence that national output will be raised and the revenue base ultimately strengthened, I am increasing my allowance for over-estimation to £2½ million so as to make £1.2 million available for relief of direct taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are good sentences and were well pronounced but what do they mean?  That is just simply a gamble with regard to £1 million.  I think he is gambling with £2½ million and I would like the Minister to say if there is any other Estimate he will have to meet during the coming year.</P>
    <P>There is a more sober estimate made by the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;the estimate of receipts and expenditure.  I always understood that one of the ways of measuring the buoyancy of the economy as between years is to look at what is the estimate of increased yield by way of direct taxation, and the increased yield is put down by the Revenue Commissioners at half a million pounds in the next year.  Half a million is what they think is likely to emerge from a more buoyant situation in the year ahead but, in addition to that, the Minister assumes there will be another £1 million.  Perhaps he would explain how it is that his view is more optimistic than that of the Revenue Commissioners, or whether there are any signs whatever in the three months that have passed, as to whether any better estimate should be made, or whether the Revenue Commissioners were unduly pessimistic or conservative in the case of the estimate in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The other matter which Deputy Haughey complained of, as meeting with criticism on this side of the House, had regard to the special levies. As far as I am aware the only matter complained of in that connection was this.  Two years ago the Minister, in order to prepare the ground for the removal of the subsidies, had to pretend that the Budget was in a very weak deficit.  Speakers from this side of the House urged that if there were to be any new ways of getting money the <Col N="979" /> special levies, instituted in the first instance for capital productive work, should be turned over to ordinary revenue.  All the knowledgeable economists on the Fianna Fáil benches protested against that.  They said that the levies were introduced for the purpose of providing capital and they should not be diverted to ordinary revenue. The only point that occurs is that if it is now possible to take the revenue coming from the special levies and look on it as current revenue, why was that not the position a year ago, or two years ago?</P>
    <P>If the Minister would adjust himself to the old time situation he would find, as Deputy Sweetman said here, that the deficit that occurred in the Budget he left would not be anything like the figure put forward as indicative of the deficit the present Government alleged, and would be something of the order of £1? million. As Deputy Casey said, Deputy Haughey spoke very much like an accountant on certain matters in reference to the fillip to the economy that is going to arise from the giving away of £2½ million.  The Minister, on his own confession, has still to get £1 million of that, and the best he can hope for at present is £1½ millions. We had the accountant's view with regard to the multiplier effect of £2½ million spread over the economy, and I want to get this into its proper setting.</P>
    <P>In 1957 the Minister counted on a saving from the food subsidies of £7 million.  There were other savings he was to get, but leave those out for the time being.  There was increased taxation in 1957 at the time when the Minister was definitely robbing all the people who required the food subsidies for their economic sustenance. There was £7 million saved on the food subsidies and taxation was increased by £2.9 million.  There was to be £1 million and a bit from tobacco, a bit more than half a million to come from beer, £1¼ millions about to come from petrol and a small fraction from oil, but it all added up to £2.9 million&mdash;that is, in addition to the looting of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> Would Deputy Haughey tell me about the multiplier effect of that taxation last year and how did he get such a great result as he depicted from the fact that £2½ million of that £2.9 million is now being given back, all the while reserving any comments with regard to the £7 million deducted from the food subsidies?  If there is a multiplier effect of such tremendous advantage with regard to the giving away of £2½ million, will he equate that to the bad situation that developed, multiplied by whatever the multiplier is, of increased taxation of nearly £3 million last year&mdash;£3 million that was extracted from the people after they had been made pay the £7 million which used to be provided by the State in food sibsidies?</P>
    <P>I go back a bit further to the Budget in 1952.  At that time the gross savings on food subsidies was £6,668,000. Between the years 1952 and 1957 the food subsidies were costing £13? millions.  Those were taken away and the people had to fend for themselves and get substenance elsewhere.  In addition to that, in 1952, one shilling was put on income tax, bringing in £900,000.  Tobacco was taxed to bring in £5½ million, beer to bring in £2? million, spirits to bring in £1 million&mdash; nearly £9 million between those three taxes and, in addition to that, petrol and oil were to bring in £1½ million and income tax £1 million.  That was an extra amount of £11¼ millions increased taxation at a time when savings to the extent of £6? millions were being made on food subsidies. For these two Budgets the subsidies added up to £13? million and they have now been cleared off to the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>Increased taxation to the amount of £11¼ millions was put on in 1952 and £3 millions was put on last year.  Was there anybody to talk about the multiplier effect of that on industry, and what was really to be the results on the unfortunate people who had to bear these extra taxes put on tobacco, spirits, and everything else and who were deprived of the food subsidies at the same time?  They had to look for that money elsewhere and, to a certain extent, they got it through increased <Col N="981" /> wages which, developing again, caused increased costs.  But the State was saved in its Book of Estimates having to provide the £13,000,000 which used to be provided.</P>
    <P>People will ask, and will ask again and again, what has become of that saving that has disappeared from the State Budget.  Where is the good effect that has come to us from any easing of our lives elsewhere?  We have been told about this £2½ million.  How is it divided?  The proprietors of dance halls are to get something; the proprietors of cinemas are to get something; the promoters of boxing tournaments in the open air are to get something; and greyhound racing is somehow to benefit to a small extent. Outside that, half-a-crown is to be given to the old age pensioner.  No explanation has been given as to why it was considered necessary to give that this year; simply, there it is.</P>
    <P>Last year, we were told there was to be an allowance for compensatory benefits of a very small amount indeed. Last year, it was argued that, whatever they might be, these supplementary benefits would be sufficient to make up to the old age pensioner what he had suffered by the cutting away of so much of the food subsidies as were left to be cut away last year. There has been no explanation, other than shame, as to why it was found necessary to give the extra half-crown this year.  Shame, of course, has been widespread throughout the country and has found expression in the speeches of many people of different denominations and different types regarding the shocking condition to which those who depend on the State for mere subsistence had been reduced.</P>
    <P>Then there are two remissions or alleviations by way of direct taxation. One is in regard to surtax.  For the future, surtax is to start at the £2,000 limit.  The whole concession will cost £160,000.  In addition to raising the point at which surtax comes to be paid, there is the extra matter that the personal allowances will be permitted as deductions from surtax, whereas previously they had not been.  I want the Minister to tell me&mdash;in the course of his reply or perhaps in answer to <Col N="982" /> supplementary questions&mdash;what is the division of that £160,000?  First of all, I want to find out, if the £160,000 refers only to this year, what is the cost of this so-called remission in a full year.  Secondly, I should like to know how the sum is divided as between the saving to the community by the point of entry for surtax being raised from £1,500 to £2,000 and how much is attributable to the running of the personal allowances to all others who pay surtax starting from the £2,000 level.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners' reports classify incomes for the purpose of surtax.  Out of 6,676 who paid surtax in the year 1953-54, 2,400 were persons who were classified as having an income of between £1,500 and £2,000.  The total income on which those people were assessed was £4,000,000 and the total tax assessed on that was £1¾ million.  There must be some way of dividing out the saving of £160,000 between those who are no longer open to surtax and those who still are.  The figures are not easy to make a calculation on, but it would seem to me that less than a third&mdash;more nearly a quarter&mdash; will go to the people who are entirely relieved of surtax.  It is quite clear that when you go to the upper limit, people whose incomes are above £5,000 or indeed above £10,000, there will be very much more relief for the people in the higher brackets for sur-tax purposes than for those who are getting £1,500 and who are being put off assessment level.  They were paying at the rate of 9d. and there are so many ninepences saved.  I should like to get the calculation of what that amounts to in a year.</P>
    <P>I shall take that as a lead to another matter.  Income tax is to be reduced by sixpence in England.  The calculation has been made during the course of debates in the House of Commons that there are 18,800,000 taxpayers in England and that, of these, 12,000,000 odd have an income of £750 a year, a little over £15 a week or less.  Of these 18,800,000 income tax payers, it is calculated that 12,000,000 would receive £50,000,000 in alleviation and that the other <Col N="983" /> 6½ million with incomes over £750 would collect between them £116,000,000.  In other words, the people who were on low-level incomes up to £750, being a numerous body, would get a bigger relief per head. Although very small in comparison with those in the higher brackets, they would get a bigger relief per head.</P>
    <P>I should like to find out from the Minister if any such calculation can be made with regard to this community. I do not know why it has always been that the Department of Finance refuses to estimate the number of people who are assessed to income tax.  The Commissioners find it possible to classify the incomes of those chargeable to surtax.  There is at least an estimate; I have seen it.  It can be estimated how much of the taxpayers' income flows from the different groups in the community.  Based on such a figure as £750 and £1,500, I should like to find out how much relief&mdash;or what is regarded as relief&mdash;from the reduction of sixpence in the standard rate will come to the benefit of the small taxpayer, the numerous class, and what it will mean to them per head.  Take £750 and £1,500 and the people above that.  Indeed, the greatest part of this will inure to the benefit not of the small persons but to a great extent to the benefit of the man with the big income.  To him the main part of this relief will go.</P>
    <P>I have noticed two companies whose accounts have been paraded in the last couple of weeks.  Both of them are monopolistic concerns.  One of them indicated that their gross profits had risen this year from £600,000 to £800,000.  They had to pay considerable tax on that.  The relief to them, of course, will be very big.  In the other concern, the profits had risen from a couple of hundred thousand pounds, I think, to almost double.  I am speaking of gross profits.  Again, they were salted very heavily as far as income tax was concerned, but they will get enormous relief from this. The shareholders, who got very big dividends in the last two years, will get as individuals a correspondingly bigger <Col N="984" /> return than the small struggling person.  The family man, struggling with all sorts of difficulties, will get very small reliefs, whereas the big person will get tremendous reliefs.</P>
    <P>I have talked about the visions that some people have of this country.  I want now to compare two things and I want to try to find out wherein truth lies as between these two.  The Taoiseach addressed a message on St. Patrick's Day to Ireland's friends. He felt that our friends abroad would want to know how Ireland stood.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...here at home we are looking forward hopefully to making substantial progress towards achieving the national objectives at which we have been aiming over the years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The friends of Ireland were given then a dissertation on the Irish language and Partition, and all the other matters to which we are accustomed to listen in addresses to our exiles.</P>
    <P>He came then to more concrete matters.  He thought that one of our objectives was to give employment and a reasonable standard of comfort to the greatest number of people; a second was to establish as many families as practicable in economic security on the land; and a third, to promote social justice and use the strength of the nation as a whole to bring aid and support to the weaker sections.  These are three great concrete aims.  Bring aid and support to the weaker sections!  The voices raised on many public platforms drove the Government in shame into giving the half-crown.  That is giving aid and support to the weaker sections.</P>
    <P>To establish as many families as practicable upon the land: Table XII of the <i>Economic Statistics</i> has been referred to already, and it will be referred to again.  It shows that the labour force, which includes people working with their families, in agriculture, forestry and fishing has dropped from 496,000 to 420,000 between 1951 and 1958.  There are 76,000 fewer people occupied on the land to-day. Take the figures for earlier years.  In 1926 there were 652,000 people <Col N="985" /> occupied on the land.  To-day there are 420,000.  In other words, there are 230,000 fewer people occupied on the land to-day as compared with 1926. In face of that, the Taoiseach can tell us in his St. Patrick's Day message to the friends of Ireland that his aim is to establish as many families as practicable in economic security on the land.</P>
    <P>The first aim was to give employment with a reasonable standard of comfort to the greatest number. Deputy Casey spoke about the pamphlets that went through every constituency in the election of 1957. He referred to the 100,000 new jobs which were to be created over a number of years so that our people could work in their own country. Table XII shows all the various classes in which people get money in return for their services.  As between 1951 and 1958 there was a drop of 10,000; as between 1956 and 1958 there was a drop of 31,000.  In 1955, which was supposed to be a shockingly bad year, a year in which everything was going to the bad and the country was drifting to ruin, there were 1,181,000 people in employment.  To-day there are 1,131,000 people in employment&mdash;50,000 fewer people occupied in 1958 as against the year that was regarded, and there was propaganda along these lines, as one of the worst years this country ever had.</P>
    <P>The objective is to give employment with a reasonable standard of comfort to the greatest number.  One remembers the barrage from Fianna Fáil when the food subsidies were removed and it was said that the workers would naturally seek to get in wages what the State had taken from them by way of subsidies.  We were told we were engaging in a conspiracy to defeat the plan on foot to provide employment for a greater number of people&mdash;if only that greater number so to be employed would put up with a lower standard of living and not look for any increase in wages to meet the increase in the cost of living.  Notwithstanding that, the Taoiseach, on St. Patrick's Day, spoke of the objective of giving employment with a reasonable standard of comfort <Col N="986" /> to the greatest number.  He did not dare to expose the skeleton in the cupboard and say that what the Government tried to do was to reduce the standards of living, the level of subsistence, and not merely the standard of comfort for a lower number of people getting employment in the country.  As to bringing people on to the land in economic security, he failed to say that the number who used to be able to live on the land was down by one-third as compared with 1926.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to say: &ldquo;The success so far achieved gives us reasonable grounds for confidence in the future, even though complete success might be tedious and difficult.&rdquo; The success so far achieved is reduced numbers in employment, with a lower standard of living.  Those who depend upon the State for justice fail to be maintained by the State.  Their condition has been so reduced that there was shame brought upon the Government by the many who spoke of the dire straits to which these people had been reduced.  Yet, the Taoiseach speaks of that as the success so far achieved.</P>
    <P>Further details flowed from the Taoiseach: &ldquo;Our rivers have been harnessed, our bogs utilised for the production of power and fuel.  Our mineral resources are being surveyed and exploited.  Our hillsides have been planted with tens of thousands of acres of forestry.  Our harbours have been developed and equipped.  Drainage schemes for our large rivers have been undertaken.&rdquo;  Just ponder on those details for a moment.</P>
    <P>Our rivers have been harnessed.  The great white elephant of old!  Our bogs have been utilised for the production of power and fuel.  When did that start?  The War found us wanting in any native fuel and it was at that late hour and not in 1932, when Fianna Fáil first got control of the country's resources, that that development started.  It is really only since the War that our bogs have been used for the production of fuel; the fact that they are being used for the production of power adds to our cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" />&ldquo;Our mineral resources have been surveyed and exploited.&rdquo;  The first Vote granted in this House for mineral exploration was granted at the demand of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not parody him when I say that his explanation to this House was that there were many mistaken ideas about the mineral wealth of this country and he hoped that by the time we had expended the £750 or the £1,000&mdash;whatever it was&mdash;we would have proof that there were no minerals in the country.  It was in that hopeful mood he set out to have our mineral resources surveyed and exploited.</P>
    <P>As to our hillsides being planted, I remember the time when Deputy Blowick, Minister for Lands, inaugurated a programme increasing the acreage to be planted year by year.  He met with nothing but discouragement and sneers from the people who now sit behind the Government.  We were told, in particular, that afforestation west of the Shannon was impossible.  When certain estates were bought down there for the purpose of plantation we met again with the greatest discouragement. All that is now transformed and disguised in the Taoiseach's St. Patrick's day message into &ldquo;a tens of thousands of acres of forests&rdquo; which have been planted.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Harbours are being developed.&rdquo; We shall get an indication some of these days as to how that harbour development has speeded up and under whose auspices.  Drainage schemes for large rivers have been undertaken&mdash; with great reluctance by Fianna Fáil and by ourselves when in control, with great enthusiasm, because we thought that was work that could be beneficial to those who tilled the soil and lived on land.  Later, of course, we had reference to the beet factories, one of the three great white elephants, when his people were critical of things.</P>
    <P>He speaks then of &ldquo;what we have achieved&rdquo; as a source of wonder to those who remember the conditions here a generation ago and says that &ldquo;we hope to go forward steadily until <Col N="988" /> all our aims have been achieved&rdquo;.  That note has been echoed, of course, by quite a number of his followers.  The Minister for Lands, speaking at some dinner on 3rd April, referred to the &ldquo;signs of change for the better&rdquo; and he went on, in a way typical of the criticism we are accustomed to hear from him in the House, to say that the Government would gladly pay anyone a premium of £1,000,000 for any short-term project to end emigration, the direct effect of which would not create a serious balance of payments crisis by a process of stimulating demand for imports.</P>
    <P>In the various athletic sports that I have been able to enjoy occasionally in my lifetime, a prize is usually put up and anyone who wins that prize three times gets it as his own.  I do not know why the Minister for Lands is offering £1,000,000 now because surely the Tánaiste must have won that prize at least three times in the past 20 years.  Surely&mdash;I can get the quotations if necessary&mdash;unemployment and emigration could be ended by the Fianna Fáil plans and the plans would not even have to be put into effect because when they got going and got industries started, they would have sufficient jobs!  They would not have enough people to fill the jobs and would have to call the emigrants back.  They had two plans.  There was the first plan which would give us 100,000 jobs in five years and which of course would mop up not only the surplus population of unemployed but would certainly prevent also the greater part of the emigration.</P>
    <P>That was the Minister for Lands&mdash;&ldquo;the signs of change are there for the better&rdquo; and £1,000,000 for anybody who can give a project to stop emigration and not cause a balance of payments crisis.  It is apparently being done at the moment, as we shall see.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech last night the Minister for Lands ventured to say, with regard to the cattle business on which it is now agreed the whole of our fortunes depend, that Fianna Fáil were never against it.  I take that as a sample of the standard of his speech in respect of accuracy.  We <Col N="989" /> need not go back to the British market &ldquo;being gone and gone for ever,&rdquo; and that it was &ldquo;like children crying for the moon to try to get it back.&rdquo;  The phrase was used that &ldquo;It has taken 100 years to build up that market in Britain, but please God, it will not take so long to break it down&rdquo;. Despite that, the Minister for Lands referred last night to the matter of the cattle trade &ldquo;against which Fianna Fáil never had any objection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Earlier, in March of this year, the Minister for Lands at a Fianna Fáil convention in Mullingar, reported under the headline taken from the <i>Irish Times</i>, &ldquo;Cynical Pessimism Diminishing&rdquo;, produced this gem.  He said that once again the Taoiseach was proving that his team could produce more new plans for spurring the economy than had been forthcoming in the life history of any other Party. Plans are grand things; the results are in Table 12 of <i>Economic Statistics.</i>  The Taoiseach is to be congratulated because his team can produce more plans to spur the economy than had been produced in the life history of any other Party!</P>
    <P>Again, in March, the Minister for Lands was speaking at a dinner in Manchester of the National Bank and referred to the N.F.A.  Heifer Retention Plan linking other bank credit, the Government plan for fertiliser subsidies and other items to improve the livestock industry as constituting the most massive programme of agricultural expansion since the foundation of the State.  I want to examine that in more detail later on, but the bank credit and the N.F.A. Heifer Retention Plan amount to this, that the banks are now going to lend to creditworthy farmers&mdash;and there is a good deal of the note of interrogation about that phrase&mdash;moneys that may be repaid over a number of years at 5¾ per cent. That is regarded as one of the points in &ldquo;the most massive programme of agricultural expansion since the foundation of the State.&rdquo;  The phrase is very much the same but it is just a different type of sentence when, speaking on the Vote on Account here, he said: &ldquo;Never in the history of the <Col N="990" /> country had there been a greater marshalling of aids to encourage industry than there had been in the last two years&rdquo;.  Then, of course, the Tánaiste has to tell us that economic recovery has begun and all that is necessary now is to press on with our plans and that &ldquo;any relaxation of effort now could defeat our whole purpose.  This has to be the year of acceleration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance speaking at the Insurance Institute said that all the available information pointed to a resurgence of economic activity.  I want these to be remembered because I want to examine what has happened in the way of economic activity and how it outcrops in employment and the cost of living here.</P>
    <P>Finally at a dinner, a Fianna Fáil celebration reported on 3rd of this month, the Minister for Finance said that this country was now solvent for the first time.  The banks were inviting farmers to apply for credit&mdash;that is, on the banks' terms&mdash;and there was a very big change in the attitude of the banks from their attitude two years ago.  There was no longer any credit squeeze; there was an expansion of credit through the commercial banks because of confidence in the economy at present.  That is one picture: I turn to another picture. On the Vote on Account, I said I had seen two editorials phrased in much the same way.  One spoke of the position of the country this way&mdash;this was a year ago&mdash;&ldquo;The shadow of unemployment grows darker every day; the population is steadily dwindling; emigration is threatening the existence of the race; people are eating into their savings and their capital.  The external trade has been somewhat redressed, but this is largely due, on the one hand, to the cattle exports which are enjoying a prosperity that nobody can say will endure, and, on the other hand, to illusory benefits from other agricultural exports which are artificially maintained by costly subsidies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second editorial was in these terms.  It spoke of a speech made by the Taoiseach some time earlier and said: &ldquo;This is perilously near trifling <Col N="991" /> with the country's interests.  The man who is trying to make a living, the man who is bringing up a family, the housewife who is daily faced with the problem of making ends meet, are all much more concerned and very properly and urgently concerned with bread and butter.  They look around and see young men and women fleeing the land.  The farmers are desperately and courageously endeavouring to put their husbandry on a sound basis.  The businessman is watching the wolf approaching his door because of the oppressive demands of the national tax gatherers and the local rate collectors. The cost of living remains an economic nightmare.  The building trade is depressed, and unemployment is driving whole families out of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think those descriptions were too pessimistic of the country as it was at the time.  What relief has come to it since then?  How much relief will come to the country from the 2/6d. to the pensioners or from the sixpence off the income tax, the main benefit of which will, as I have said, accrue to those on higher levels?</P>
    <P>It must be remembered, as against all this, that a Christus Rex Congress took place in Kilkee this year in the month of April.  Would anyone reading the papers brought before that assembly get the picture that Deputy Haughey thinks is so clear of the prosperity that we are enjoying and the greater prosperity that we are likely to enjoy?</P>
    <P>One priest read a paper on &ldquo;The Responsibilities of Capital and Labour&rdquo; and the most striking phrase is given a headline &ldquo;Unemployment Is A &lsquo;Moral Evil&rsquo;&rdquo;.  Speaking about labour and capital, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That there were times in every industry when redundancy and unemployment became unavoidable was readily conceded, but too often one found that the wages bill was the very first item of expenditure to be reduced.  Surely, he said, it was private profits and not the workers' wages which should be sacrificed first.  Unemployment as <Col N="992" /> a remedy, should be adopted not as a first solution, but rather as a last resort.  One felt that during an employee's illness the employer could show a more human touch.  He thought that where at all possible the differential between the amount of National Health benefit and the normal wage should be paid for at least a month or six weeks.  This was not a duty binding in justice but there was also a law of charity from which the realm of industrial relations could not be exempt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that regard the industrialists throughout the country did not get a lead from the Government during the time when they were removing the subsidies on food.  There was a great commotion from the Government benches that nobody should urge the workers to seek any improvement in their position through wage increases and we were told that to encourage people to go to the Labour Court or to arbitration courts of different types was a conspiracy against the progress of the State, which progress could only be made if wages could be kept at the same depressed level.</P>
    <P>Another speaker at the same conference spoke in these terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Another problem they would have to face more practically was that the abolition of poverty was a requisite for proper living.  Poverty was most obvious and most harmful in the family.  Many would still plead that our voluntary associations were sufficient to relieve the poverty which we have.  He would suggest that they were not; and besides, there was to-day many families who suffered from inadequacy of income and who could never hope to be considered by voluntary charitable associations. Inadequacy of income faces many families to-day and in the present circumstances extensions of statutory social services in the fields of health, welfare, education and housing seemed the only practical way to overcome with speed, the pressing financial stress that faced many hardworking and thrifty families.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was not the choice obviously he <Col N="993" /> would like to give but it was the only choice.  One can read into this lecture that it was the only choice open in the circumstances.  He spoke of inadequacy of income as being:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;almost a thing of the past in England, and poverty, at least the worst kind of poverty had been splendidly overcome.  This at least prepared the ground for good living&mdash;if viewed correctly and with responsibility.  It provided not a freedom from want merely but a freedom for living and the opportunity to develop spiritual values which we all knew to be real living ...The test for democracy today was not political freedom but economic freedom... Pope Pius XII spoke of &lsquo;Social Wages&rsquo; i.e., that the obligation of society as a whole to supplement wages in certain groups, by contribution to the &lsquo;wage&rsquo; in subsidies, grants-in-aid, welfare.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He made a plea at the end that something should be done for the agricultural labourers who contribute greatly to the national economy.</P>
    <P>The theme of the Christus Rex Congress was poverty in this country, poverty which these reverend gentlemen had found to such an extent that when they gathered together, they expressed their feelings in these papers, and I have referred to only two.</P>
    <P>The Bishop of Cork has been criticised here for some of the statements he has made, but he did say this&mdash;and I want to repeat it because it has been proved by recent events and more particularly by <i>Economic Statistics</i> to be completely true&mdash;on 18th March: that out of the total population there were less people working and more emigrating than at any time since the Famine.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Relative to the total population there was less work and more emigration than at any time since the Famine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bishop went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Worse still, those who could and should put these things right accept this catastrophic and unnatural state <Col N="994" /> of affairs with the fullest complacency and regard as a crank anyone&mdash;like himself&mdash;who even calls attention to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I leave it to God and history&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to judge as between them and those who place emigration in the forefront of Ireland's unsolved national problems.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He later deplored the flight from the land and said that the Irish countryside was &ldquo;becoming depopulated at a rate almost equal to that of the famine years&rdquo;.  One-third of those who occupy the land do not use it and that gives the background for the type of statement that the rural areas are &ldquo;becoming depopulated at a rate almost equal to that of the famine years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have one other excerpt from the newspapers.  The Rev. Canon R.J. Kerr, Rector of St. George's Church, Dublin, preaching in Christ Church Cathedral on 15th March and reported on 16th March said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>...There were almost half-a-million people in this country suffering from grinding poverty and in many cases slow starvation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Church, because it is the Church of Christ,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;must of necessity concern itself with unjust and deplorable social conditions, such as unemployment, bad housing, malnutrition as a result of poverty and so on.  The very fact that we profess belief in the doctrine of the incarnation should urge us to be actively concerned with the bodily as well as the spiritual welfare of other people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He summed up the situation as it appeared to him in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The unemployed&mdash;at present the figure was about 80,000&mdash;and their dependants were not receiving sufficient to keep body and soul together in the way of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  The 150,000 old age pensioners received miserably insufficient benefits&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The old age pensioners are now to receive an increase of 2/6d. a week. At a meeting of the Dublin County Council, reported of 7th March this <Col N="995" /> year, a representative who I understand is a Fianna Fáil representative on the Dublin County Council said that he knew families of the middle income group who were in the underprivileged class and were unable to have meat more than once a week as a result of the rates demand by the Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>These are the two pictures which the Taoiseach wants our friends abroad to be presented with as to how Ireland stands but I have quoted the viewpoints of people with differing views from different walks of life and the picture they paint is not exactly the rosy one Deputy Haughey would have us believe is the true one.</P>
    <P>I turn now to another expression of our position as shown by our representatives who go to Paris dealing with the Free Trade Area.  I have in my hands a blue book issued by the British Stationery Office &ldquo;Negotiations for a European Free Trade Area&rdquo; It is mainly a compilation of documents which have passed between the Council of the O.E.E.C. dealing with this matter and the various authorities which have been established.  Ireland stands out in this report as one of the four underdeveloped countries in Western Europe.  The four are: Ireland, Iceland, Greece and Turkey.  The special conditions of each of these four countries are mentioned in this booklet. At the beginning, our situation in general is mentioned with that of the others.  It sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>At the outset of the discussions it was decided to make a separate study of the situation of each country which wished to be so examined. It was difficult to draw up any general code until special provisions were made for countries in course of development within the area which would not merely fail to benefit but it would be positively harmful, arresting their development and thus widening rather than narrowing the gap between the more and less developed countries.</P>
    <P>In a short time Western Europe would be divided into two camps. Quite apart from considerations of <Col N="996" /> politics or altruism, Western Europe cannot afford to allow within her boundaries the existence&mdash;much less the extension&mdash;of underdeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>Then there comes the warning that if these underdeveloped countries are approached in a sympathetic way, they will, so to speak, have to play ball with the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The other countries cannot be expected to sign blank cheques and they will expect that, in exchange for favourable treatment, the countries in course of development will adopt definite obligations under a time-table laid down in advance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At page 34, paragraph 10, it says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The case put forward by Ireland for special treatment in respect of the Free Trade Area may be briefly summarised as follows.  The present exceptionally heavy emigration of the active population is a matter of serious concern.  Despite this emigration, however, unemployment in the towns and underemployment in the countryside remain substantial, while there is much scope for an increase in agricultural production, agriculture is not able to provide greater employment than at present. (Some further loss of workers from the land may, in fact, be inevitable.)&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, having reduced our people on the land from 652,000 in 1926 to 429,000 last year, all our delegates at Paris can say for the future&mdash;perhaps I should not say this but it is an extract indicating their point of view and it has not been countered&mdash;is that some further loss of workers from the land may be inevitable.  The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Greater industrialisation (and a corresponding increase in the present low level of investment) is therefore necessary if Ireland is to provide work for its citizens on a more adequate scale.  Hence the view is taken that protection is essential to the development of the economy, not only to facilitate the setting up of new industries, but also to enable those industries which have been established in the past decades to <Col N="997" /> consolidate and expand.  A special problem for Irish export industries is the extent to which shipments to Britain may be affected by the gradual elimination of the tariff advantages which they enjoy in that market <i>vis-á-vis</i> Continental countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In relation to the operation of the Free Trade Area and its effect on this country, paragraph II states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...The Irish authorities, however, feel a difficulty in accepting definite obligations immediately since they fear that the implementation of these obligations might have a catastrophic effect on their industrial structure and level of employment...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then a series of conditions are set out to which this working Committee thinks this country should accommodate itself if it is to get any alleviation against this feared catastrophic effect on our industries.  Towards the end of the book, at page 231, there is this statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Industrialisation, on the other hand, is somewhat hampered by lack of natural resources.  Much of the surplus rural population is able, at present, to find employment outside the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a new way of describing emigration.</P>
    <P>But emigration on the present scale &mdash;which still leaves unemployment at about 10 per cent. of the insured population&mdash;itself raises considerable difficulties for the Irish economy, discouraging domestic investment and draining off types of manpower which are particularly important from the point of view of industrial development.</P>
    <P>That is not exactly the picture Deputy Haughey tried to give us today.  In fact I wonder would our efforts to have ourselves described and classified as an undeveloped country be helped or to any extent impeded by the sort of <i>ráiméis</i> Deputy Haughey talked to-day. There is no way of reconciling these two points of view.  We should recall our delegates and put them into another mood to express themselves if what Deputy Haughey said is correct, <Col N="998" /> that this country is not merely enjoying prosperity but is likely to enjoy greater prosperity almost at once.</P>
    <P>I have spoken already of the attack on wages made in 1957 and last year I cannot say that this mood has left the Government.  We are back again tramping around the old circuit.  Again the cost of living has increased.  Budgets come and go and give no alleviation to any worth-while extent to a great number of the people.  Those who are left out start a new round of wage claims and no doubt the Government will scrounge a little benefit by having these demands resisted for a little while, or only deal reluctantly with them, thus giving some little relief to a hard-pressed Government in a bad year.</P>
    <P>I wonder have the Government yet realised how bad was their attitude with regard to wages.  In England there was the same struggle where the view was held that it was a bad choice to bring about economic stagnation by moderating wages.  The Economic Editor of the <i>Sunday Times</i> says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...This attempt to moderate wages by means of economic stagnation is a highly uncertain business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At a later period the same Economic Editor wrote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...society threatening itself with depression in order to bring organised labour to book...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, of course, was the attitude of mind prevailing in the Government Benches away back in the days of the standstill order.  It prevailed in 1947 but did not get expression because although the legislation was drafted it was prevented from going through by the change of Government. Certainly it was the prevailing mood in 1952 when the fierce Budget of that year lowered the standard of living and an attempt was made to prevent people getting any alleviation from the depression in which they were put.  It was obvious again in 1957 and 1958, and the exponent of it was the man who speaks most of all the Government people, the Minister for Lands. He is reported on the 7th February, 1958, as saying:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" />&ldquo;Irish people for the next 20 years would have to accept a more modest standard of living until production increased...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Twenty years apparently was the period in which the Minister then saw production increasing.</P>
    <P>However, he sounded an ominous note in his speech at the Wicklow Chamber of Commerce.  He spoke of one thing which is constantly recurring in his speeches in regard to emigration. He told the Irish Country-women's Association in the last week that Scotland has suffered more from emigration than this country has and more or less says we should accept Scottish conditions.  This is what he said in his speech reported on the 7th February, 1958:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The population of Scotland had barely increased in 20 years and had declined in rural areas.</P>
    <P>But one of the major factors to be faced in this country was this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>...capital was beginning to flow back into the undeveloped areas of the world because industrialists looked for more loyal and hardworking operatives and more reasonable costs of production.</P>
    <P>My mind goes back to elections that were fought in England over what was called coolie labour.  Industrialists are looking to the undeveloped areas of the world&mdash;and we are one of those&mdash; because you can get more loyal and hardworking operatives there.  The trade union presumably is not as strong in the undeveloped area and in addition to that you get more reasonable costs of production.  That is followed out at great length in this except from the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>The report continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>...wages, salaries and profits must be kept at a level which allowed for the extra freight costs and the fact of Ireland being an island not in the main stream of European commerce ...  The best production might have to be reserved for export.</P>
    <P>That is a theme the Minister for <Col N="1000" /> Lands is constantly harping on&mdash;that this country has a great chance if we can keep wages low, cut down costs, have coolie labour, have no nonsense about Labour Courts or Arbitration Boards, keep people in a depressed condition, send the best of what we produce away and charge at home more for the least good material which we keep for our people, the residue of production.  That, however, is not a view that will prevail very long.  The Minister for Lands shows signs of extricating himself from the difficulty caused by those old speeches.</P>
    <P>Last night, the Minister for Lands was in a lyrical mood about overproduction. It is through that, that this pamphlet on <i>Economic Expansion</i> will be approached.  Let me again get this setting.  We have got a pamphlet on Development.  Deduced from that, we get a programme for economic expansion.  We have heard many speeches from Ministers telling us that this programme has been put to such effect that there is a surge of optimism and a better surge of production.</P>
    <P>The effect of the <i>Economic Statistics</i> book, and all that, has to be considered. There are two pages in <i>Economic Statistics</i> which have always to be kept in mind.  Table 10 deals with the price index number.  It shows that the cost of living figure&mdash;and that is the subsistence figure&mdash;is steadily rising.  Table 12 deals with the labour force, the number of people at work in the main branches of economic activity, with the all-over reduction as between 1957-58 of 10,000 people and of 30,000 as between 1956 and 50,000 as between 1955.</P>
    <P>We are constantly being told by members of the Government that emigration is on the decline and that unemployment is on the decline.  If the people are not emigrating and if they are not, while remaining at home, classified as unemployed, what are they doing?  There was an old pantomime song long ago &ldquo;Where do the Files go in Wintertime?&rdquo;  Where are the people who are getting off the unemployment list and who are not going on the emigrant ships?  What are they doing at home, because the <Col N="1001" /> unemployment figures are down on the figures I have shown?</P>
    <P>Last night, the Minister for Lands, Deputy Childers, said that in 1958 a total of 38 enterprises with a capital of £4,000,000 was started.  Another 12 factories were now in course of construction with a capital of £2,000,000 and another 12 would start with a capital of £2,000,000.  In yesterday's debate, he had 38 enterprises with a capital of £4,000,000 starting. A question was asked either of the Taoiseach or of the Tánaiste with regard to this £4,000,000 capital for factories or business established.  The Tánaiste was asked to say what programme or what permanent employment was likely to be given by it.  His figure was between 2,500 and 2,900.  I shall take the average figure of 2,700. So that £4,000,000 capital expenditure puts 2,700 people at work.  That is the £4,000,000 enterprises already started.  Then the Minister for Lands speaks of the other 24 factories with another £4,000,000 capital.  That is a tot of 62 establishments with £8,000,000 capital and, on the Tánaiste's figures, that will give employment to 5,000 people.</P>
    <P>This picture with regard to economic expansion looks to a £50,000,000 provision for what is called &ldquo;additional or new capital works&rdquo;.  Multiply your capital by £8 million in these three sets of factories the Minister for Lands referred to and you get £48,000,000&mdash; nearly £50,000,000.  Multiply the people employed&mdash;2 x 2,700 x 6 and you get 32,000.  Supposing it all comes off, and that is very problematical, and you get £50,000,000 embarked on new enterprises in this country, what is it really giving us?  The State will not have caught up on those who have left employment as between 1956 and 1958.  If that works out, you might get back then 1,163,000 people who were employed two years ago. That will be the result of all this hullabaloo about capital expansion and the capital development programme for it.</P>
    <P>It is in that connection, and with that preamble, that I want to attend to one part of this programme.  First of <Col N="1002" /> all, it is wrong to call it a &ldquo;programme&rdquo;. Years ago, when I was in the Department of Finance, I used to be asked: &ldquo;When will you bring in social welfare legislation?&rdquo;  Various people who had been Ministers and who were on the Opposition benches told us about the Bills they had left behind them.  If they meant legislative proposals, they had not left any.  That was soon shown.  The word was changed and they said they had &ldquo;plans&rdquo; and &ldquo;programmes&rdquo;.  The present Minister for Finance said later that there were none but that he was gathering together a certain amount of actuarial calculations and that, on foot of these, plans could have been made and programmes could have been developed.  I feel that that word ought not to be applied here.</P>
    <P>There are no plans.  There are many statements to the effect that there appears to be room for the spending of a certain amount of money under certain headings but there is no programme, there is nothing in the way of a direction, there is nobody to entrust with the job of seeing that private enterprise will be encouraged.  Take say, the amount of credit that either the Industrial Credit Company or the Agricultural Credit Corporation may put at their disposal.  There is no programme. There is nothing in the way of an outline.  No target is set.  There is simply set out that under certain headings there appears to be room for the expenditure of certain moneys.  Tots are then made and the total is arrived at.  The first remark that has to be made about this is that the last page, Appendix 2 of the so-called &ldquo;programme&rdquo;, is said to be inclusive of the additional expenditure projected in Appendix 1.</P>
    <P>When I took at all this I see that there is to be a figure of £220 millions. That is a tot, that is the capital investment by public authorities&mdash;by either local authorities, public authorities and by State sponsored organisations' borrowings.  That is £220,000,000 in Appendix I, and that would mean a capital programme of about £44,000,000 per annum.  The capital programme that the Inter-Party Government had in 1955-56 was £43.5 <Col N="1003" /> millions and in 1956-57 it was £44.5 million.  It was cut down in 1957-58 and cut still further in 1958-59, but one must relate that expenditure.  There must be a relationship to people who were occupied at work in 1955-56 and 1956-57.  I shall take the years 1955-56 and the years 1956-57.  In 1955 there were 1,181,000 employed and in 1956 1,163,000 employed, and that was on a capital programme of over £40,000,000 a year.  Let it be realised that this programme for expansion does not include a penny piece over and above the capital programme we had for the years 1955-56 and 1956-57.</P>
    <P>There has been a cutting down of that capital programme in 1958 and 1957 with results that are showing in the employment figures, and that is one of the matters that is not being attended to in connection with this alleged programme.  First of all, there is no programme, as the word is properly used and, secondly, if there is, supposing all these moneys are spent, I think it is back again to the employment situation, and only to that situation, in the years 1955-56 and 1956-57.</P>
    <P>How much of this money is likely to be spent?  I shall take Appendix I first.  Credit is to be provided through the Agricultural Credit Corporation for five years at a total of £7½ million, and credit is to be provided through the Industrial Credit Company of £17½ million.  What has the Industrial Credit Company provided annually? Take an average for a number of years and tell us what has the Agricultural Credit Company provided?</P>
    <P>In the Second Appendix there are these figures for credit and expansion: £11,000,000 is to be made available for the Agricultural Credit Corporation, £20,000,000 for the Industrial Credit Company and £2½ millions for hotel improvement.  That is a total of £33,000,000 but the spending of that £33,000,000 depends on private people, people who own hotels and who, for some reason or another, want to expand in industry and agriculture.  It is only if private people want this money that this credit, placed at their disposal, may be taken up and it is only if that amount of credit, £33,000,000 <Col N="1004" /> over five years, is taken up that you might get a programme approaching that of the inter-Party Government in 1955-56 and in 1956-57, but this is a matter than can be debated at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There is one comment that has been made on it by the Association of Chambers of Commerce of Ireland who made submissions to the Minister for Finance, dated 29th January this year, which submissions they have circulated to Deputies.  They call attention to the fact that the volume of industrial production is only 4 per cent. over that of 1953 and it is still below the level achieved in 1955.  In their comment at the bottom of page 2 they state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The total amount of the Public Debt, as at 31st March, 1958, was £347.7 million; other capital liabilities represented a further £65.5 million and State Guarantees outstanding amounted to £85.5 million. Thus the total, actual and contingent, liabilities of the State at this date were £498.7 million.  These liabilities are partially covered by &ldquo;assets&rdquo; which were taken into account in the Finance Accounts at a figure of £230.1 million.  But it must be emphasised that in some cases these &ldquo;assets&rdquo; are merely book figures not represented by tangible assets.</P>
    <P>Then they deal with this charge which is a matter that the Minister for Finance must face.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This matter of State liabilities is of particular moment in view of the White Paper recently issued by the Government.  The capital programme mentioned therein envisages the expenditure of £220.4 million over the next five years.  If this programme is financed by borrowing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is &ldquo;if&rdquo; of course&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the total amount of Government indebtedness would be increased by almost fifty per cent. and the State's aggregate liabilities would be greatly in excess of the present national income figure.  At this stage it is not possible to comment on this programme in detail.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> That, I think, is exaggerated.  The indications are that all the money is not expected to be borrowed but even though some may come from direct State sources there will still have to be an interest and sinking fund.  One looks further to find information from the Minister as to what will be required for the service of the debt incurred in a variety of ways by the State if this programme of £220,000,000 is carried out in the next five years. If, in fact, that brings us only to the point that we get back to the employment figure of three years ago, it seems to me it is going to be a tremendous expenditure without any firm idea of what the result is to be either by way of employment of greater productivity in this country.</P>
    <P>We are told of the great future that lies ahead for agriculture.  In that connection I should like to make a last comment.  There are great aids for industry in this country.  At least, the Minister for Lands said last night that in the whole of Europe there could not be found any better facilities for industry than are given in this country by the present Government. That is a complete exaggeration but let it be accepted that there are aids in the form of remission of rates, exemptions from taxation on profits on exports, and certain exemptions for plant and machinery.  However, I do not think those are as good as they are in the North, in the Six County area, but still they are things that are given.  Against that it is recognised that the future of this State depends on agriculture and, in the main, depends upon cattle.  It is an amazing victory for common sense to have that recognised now by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The basis for the future lies there but what is being done for agriculture? You have remission of rates, exemption from profits, allowances for plant and buildings to industry, particularly to industries that are exporting, but a great part of our agricultural productivity is always for export and most of the hope for the future is founded on a tremendous expansion in the exportable surplus of agricultural production.  What is being done for agriculture?  We have <Col N="1006" /> plans and the Minister for Lands spoke of the N.F.A. Scheme applied to all the banks but what are our banks doing?</P>
    <P>I take one reference to the National Bank Scheme published on the 9th March this year with regard to the construction of cow byres:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Applications for loans on the basis of £20 per cow will be considered from any credit-worthy farmer of sound integrity, whether an old or new customer, for the construction of a cow byre, with the repayments spread over ten years by half-yearly instalments with interest at the ordinary rate on the reducing half-yearly balance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another and lengthier report of what they want to do is to be seen in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 25th March, which states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Loans sanctioned will be subject to normal interest rates (at present 5¾ per cent. per annum) and to reasonable security in each case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Farmers get a certain amount of money by way of relief in rates on agricultural land but even that has been questioned by advisory committees advising the Government.  Nothing is given to the farmers for allowances covering plant and buildings and there is no question of a reduction on any profits the farmers might make on increased exports.  He shot into the banks, the banks who believed so much in the agriculture of this country&mdash;at least one bank has held itself out as offering good credit terms to the farmers.</P>
    <P>Credit?  Five and three-quarters per cent., if there is some security and if it can be proved&mdash;in the phrase the banks have always used as a standard by which they can block down development and by which they have for years blocked down development&mdash;that the scheme is a credit-worthy scheme. And those who determine whether it is a credit-worthy scheme or not are the banks themselves.  For this great industry of ours, on which our whole hopes depend, all that can be offered is credit.  If a farmer likes to go into debt and put on himself the burden of paying a bank 5¾ per cent. after giving some security, one bank, if the scheme is considered credit-worthy and <Col N="1007" /> the farmer a person of integrity, may give him permission to pay the bank 5¾ per cent.</P>
    <P>I have often talked about this matter of bank interest.  It now arises in a very acute way.  What is the 5¾ per cent. interest required for?  Is it a risk payment?  If there is any feeling of risk, 5¾ per cent. is absurd; it would not pay.  What is the risk?  That cattle will not be bred here or that, if they are bred, they will not be sold in England; or that some fierce epidemic will devastate the cattle in the country?  It cannot be classified as a risk payment.  What is it?  Is it a service payment?  A service payment for a scheme that is regarded to have the best prospects open to this country?  Everywhere we turn we are told we are not supplying as much to the British market as we could supply, that there will be a bigger demand than ever and that there will be few competitors.  In those circumstances the banks want 5¾ per cent. to assist in the production of more cattle in this country.</P>
    <P>I feel the banks should be asked to justify that.  In fact, all the banks should be asked to join together in a scheme in which credit, at some rate which would merely be for the administrative costs, would provide extra money.  All the banks should be encouraged, even commanded, to do that and if they do not do that, the Government will adopt a certain financial scheme whereby the Bank of England was put under the Treasury. If the prospects are so alluring and good&mdash;and on the agricultural side they appear to be good&mdash;it is nothing short of a crime for the banks to give such little assistance to the scheme. They hold themselves out to the public as benefactors because they are giving interest at the ordinary rate of 5¾ per cent. to people who are supposed to be in the best position the farmers of this country have ever been in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that the Minister has endeavoured to bring in the very best possible Budget he could.  I am sure each member of his Party has the same feeling.  It is <Col N="1008" /> regrettable he was not able to give some alleviation to those in the lesser income group in regard to bread and butter.  It is true he has given half a crown to the old age pensioner.  The ordinary man in the street with whom I am in contact&mdash;and the smaller percentage of them would be in the middle class group&mdash;says it is a good Budget.  Some of them may be less charitable and say it is a good election Budget.  The help given in relation to income tax has been appreciated. The Minister, however, might be interested to know that the ordinary man in the street is asking how this is to benefit him when he has no employment to enable him avail of it.</P>
      <P>I should like to bring to the Minister's attention a typical case of an old age pensioner.  As a result of inquiries I made this morning, I am assured that there is a very large section of the old age pensioners who will not benefit one penny by this half crown.  I hope the example I am about to give may bring forth some alleviation in regard to the means test under the 1952 Act.  The case I have in mind is that of a man, 74 years of age, who served his country and lost his pensionable job by virtue of that.  He resigned from the D.M.P. and later served his country in the Republican organisation. Subsequently he spent over 30 years in the fire service but had to resign through ill health.  He is enjoying a pension in excess of £208 and less than £250.  Despite the increased cost of living since 1952, no consideration has been given to the raising of the means test ceiling to allow a man such as that to enjoy some portion of the increase given to old age pensioners.  So that, when you analyse the benefit given to old age pensioners, it really is not very great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed at some of the speakers in this debate.  Deputy McGilligan gave us 98 per cent. extracts from newspapers going back over the years.  Deputy Haughey endeavoured to suggest ways and means for the alleviation of the national evil of unemployment.  Three times in my short period in this House I have asked the Minister who happened to be on the floor at the time <Col N="1009" /> or the Taoiseach to deal with this position as a national emergency.  The official reply given yesterday regarding the number of unemployed in this country should alone be sufficient for the Taoiseach to accept this position as warranting emergency action.</P>
    <P>Last week, before the Minister's Budget speech, a professor teaching students of commerce in one of our universities forecast what the Minister's Budget would be.  His forecast was astonishingly accurate.  He mentioned that the English Budget could be taken as a pattern.  For the fourth time, I ask the Minister to follow the pattern even more closely.  It was stated recently by a responsible member of the Government that, thanks to be God, we are now solvent. If we are solvent, we should be able to raise another £10,000,000.  Will the Minister take steps to raise this money? Let us go on aping our English neighbours. Will the Government establish a Ministry of Labour or Works with a special Department to cater for this national emergency, this cancerous growth of unemployment?  If that is done the cure for emigration will follow rapidly.</P>
    <P>It has been said that agriculture is our first industry.  I have been engaged in the building trade all my life.  I know very little about statistics or high finance.  The position of the building industry to-day is more parlous now than it was even in 1913.  Deputy Haughey suggested the erection of factories in certain towns; he said such factories would absorb vast numbers of unemployed.  I do not intend to waste time denigrating the present Government or their predecessors.  I am not convinced that their predecessors would be able to alleviate the position that exists at the moment. But, instead of listening to extracts from past speeches, I suggest that the Opposition should submit to the House their alternative to the present Budget. We might find a solution in that.</P>
    <P>Various opinions are expressed on the Budget.  Some housewives will tell you that it is no good to them; nothing was taken off bread and butter.  Others remember that the present Government promised to <Col N="1010" /> create 100,000 jobs.  They told the wives to get their husbands out to vote and thereby get them back to work.  Many husbands are lucky enough to-day to be in England, but their wives are denied their company.</P>
    <P>If the Government are satisfied with the present situation, then it is time we gave serious consideration to another expression of opinion from the man in the street: the sooner America takes us over and we become the 52nd State the better it will be. The Government's attitude is that everything will be all right.  Perhaps it will be all right.  I hope the Minister's statement about increasing employment as rapidly as possible is something more than just an empty promise.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the money provided for building was not spent by the local authorities.  Perhaps it was not.  Maybe that is another reason why the Government should immediately set about establishing this new Ministry of Labour or Works that I suggest with a Department which will not be tied up in its own red tape.  Deputy Haughey said that, while the Minister for Local Government may be anxious to promote schemes to alleviate the present situation, his enthusiasm does not penetrate to the civil servants in his Department. I am not casting any aspersions on the Minister.  I believe that, no matter how desirous he may be, he cannot cope with the present situation.  I do not see why we should not have a Ministry of Labour or Works.  We had one in the past.  I think the late Madame Markievicz was the first Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister will consider these points.  There has been no reference to the unemployment situation in his Budget statement except for the comment that employment must be provided as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate on this Budget, for the first time in many years, we hear on all sides that it is an election Budget.  An election Budget is associated in our minds and in the public <Col N="1011" /> mind with a good and favourable Budget from the people's point of view and the fact that the strongest criticism the Opposition can make of the Budget proposals is to suggest that they are designed to appeal to the public from an election point of view is I think indicative of the type of Budget this is.  The Opposition would be very quick to point out if the situation were otherwise.</P>
      <P>We have some rather confused thinking on these proposals, some people suggesting that it is an election Budget and others saying that not nearly sufficient reliefs are given to any section of the community.  It is difficult to reconcile these opposing points of view except on the ground that some people always want to have it both ways.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan spoke at considerable length on the Budget proposals and gave quotations from various sources.  He also lectured us on what the Government's relations with Labour should be and alleged that the Government and the Minister for Finance were shamed into making some provision for old age pensions. It appears to me that Deputy McGilligan has been politically asleep for a long time.  He alleges that while the economic paper, as published by the Government, is there it contains no plan, that there has been no direction under it and that the Government have done nothing about it.  He alleges that the provisions set forth in the economic plan for national economy are mere expressions of opinion and that no attempt has been made to do anything to give effect to these expressions of opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He must have been absent from this House for a considerable time and, in addition, he must have failed to read the Minister's statement.  He wants to know what was being provided for agriculture but if he just turned to page 39 of the Budget statement he would find £1¾ millions provided for fertiliser subsidy and a net allocation of £1.8 million for intensification of the drive to eradicate bovine T.B.  If he troubled to read the Minister's <Col N="1012" /> statement he would find that fisheries and tourism received a capital allocation of £540,000, that an extra £160,000 was being provided for telephone development giving a total for this service of £1.6 million, and that in other respects the figures reflect how the Budget is designed to carry out the programme set out in the economic paper to which I have referred, including legislation enacted last session to permit the expansion of activities by such concerns as Irish Shipping and Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy had read the Minister's statement he would have found that there was further legislation dealing with the extension of the operations of the E.S.B., Bord Fáilte, An Foras Tionscal, the Industrial Credit Company, the financing of Shannon Free Export Development Company, and the financing of Coras Tráchtála as a permanent State agency and provisions concerning oil and natural gas. He would find all these provisions have come, or are coming, before the House.  The Budget has been based and framed on the over-all economic plan as set out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>This is the plan which Deputy McGilligan says is no plan and which he alleges at great length the Government had just published and had done nothing about.  I do not know where the Deputy was when the legislation which has already gone through the House was moved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give effect to the White Paper proposals.  It is not for me to speculate as to why he failed to read the Minister's statement in introducing the Budget or whether, on the other hand, he had read it but tried to create the illusion in the public mind that this economic plan was illusory and that no action was being taken to give effect to it.</P>
    <P>This plan has received favourable comment from all sections of the community and from many economists outside the State.  I do not wish to pass from Deputy McGilligan's lecture on the economic plan and particularly what he had to say about labour relations with the Fianna Fáil Government and the provisions made by the Minister for Finance for old <Col N="1013" /> age pensions.  He suggested there was a point of view in this Government which was anti-labour, that that point of view is still here and that it was indicated by members of the House that it was a crime to suggest to labour that they should look for any increase in wages.  He conveniently forgets evidently that very shortly after this Government came into power a national wages agreement was negotiated between the Unions and those concerned with the assistance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That agreement has given very good stability to employer-labour relations in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan forgets, evidently, that those who spoke for labour realised the necessity to aim at stability and to stop inflation.  They realised if such a tendency were to continue the very first people to suffer would be those in the lower income group, the workers themselves.  Those matters were conveniently forgotten by the Deputy when he made many references to what he called &ldquo;coolie labour&rdquo; and suggested the members of this House were concerned in trying to obtain &ldquo;coolie labour&rdquo;, or provide such labour, for the development of Irish industry.  He also quoted from a meeting of Christus Rex and suggested from some quotations that the Government were showing a bad example as far as employer-labour relations were concerned.</P>
    <P>Above all people in this House who should try to lecture the members of the Government, or indeed any Government outside of a Fine Gael Government, on Government example on employer-labour relations, Deputy McGilligan is one Deputy who should keep silent.  In view of what he said it is only fair to remind him of what his labour charter was when he was a responsible member of a Government dealing with employer-labour relations. Deputy McGilligan was the responsible Minister in the Government which ordered Irish labour to work for 15/- a week on the Shannon Scheme and the maximum which he would allow in those days was 27/- a week if the workers were away from <Col N="1014" /> home.  Those provisions were laid down by Deputy McGilligan whether the worker was a single man or a married man with a family of ten or with no children.  This is the Deputy who lectures us on what standards we should set as far as labour is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan in criticising this Government on its niggardly approach to old age pensions, and in saying how he and those associated with him shamed the Minister for Finance into making this provision for old age pensions in this Budget, should think again of his own political record in connection with old age pensions. There was only one occasion since the foundation of this State on which a Government clamped down on the old age pensioners.  In the whole history of this State there was only one Minister for Finance who economised at the expense of the old age pensioners. Deputy McGilligan was a member of the Cumann na Gaedheal Government which cut the old age pensions by one-tenth, when the maximum old age pension was 10/- a week.  This is the Deputy who now lectures us on our niggardly treatment of the old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>Of course he went on to tell us about the economics inherited by the present Minister for Finance when he came into office and he told us what the position was then.  I do not know how often the facts will have to be reiterated in this House on what the actual situation was when the last Government left office.  When we examine all the allegations made since about the abolition of the food subsidies and the unnecessarily severe Budget that Deputy McGilligan alleged was introduced by the Minister for Finance, we can see what the position was.  He would like us to forget what the situation was and what the Book of Estimates showed when this Government came into office.</P>
    <P>The first Budget introduced by the present Minister for Finance was based on a Book of Estimates which was actually printed before he assumed office.  When we saw these Estimates in 1957 they showed that there was £126.8 million to be found and the <Col N="1015" /> revenue from all sources came only to £117.11 million, which showed a deficit of £9.07 million to balance that bill. That was not the full picture because there were other odds and ends that had to be added to the liability that had been incurred by the last Government, including £500,000 for secondary teachers.  All those odds and ends brought the total deficit on these figures to the sum of £11 million, required to balance the bill inherited by the present Government at that time.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan also suggested that there was no necessity to take some of the measures which we did take, or to remove the food subsidies at that particular time.  But not only was the position that which I have given in cold figures, with a deficit on paper of £11 million, but the severe measures that had to be taken by the Minister for Finance were not sufficient to prevent the year showing an actual deficit of £6 million.  That very fact is indicative of the truth, that notwithstanding the severe measures taken to correct the situation the Minister for Finance was unable to get sufficient money to balance the Budget and was actually in deficit at the end of the year to the extent of £6 million.</P>
    <P>At all events, it is a good thing to see that times have changed.  That times undoubtedly have changed is admitted by all.  It is now admitted, to put it in a simple countryman's language, that money is not so tight as it used be.  I have been listening to Deputies from the opposite benches, and particularly from the Fine Gael Party, trying to give us some explanation as to why money was so tight during the period of the last Coalition Government.  Last night listening to Deputy Carew we heard him state that there was no doubt about the severe credit restrictions in the last years of the Coalition Government. That apparently is now admitted by all.  It was not admitted by the members of the Coalition Government at that time, when local authorities were crying out for aid from the Minister for Local Government. There was no crisis admitted then.  It <Col N="1016" /> was not suggested that there was nothing in the till to help them.  It is now, evidently, admitted that we were facing a crisis and that there was severe credit restriction in 1956 and in the beginning of 1957.</P>
    <P>One universal alibi is always trotted out by Fine Gael so far as that situation is concerned and that is the Suez crisis.  It was responsible for all the trouble apparently that the Government had here.  The Suez crisis, it would appear, brought down the Government.  Little did poor Nasser know when he sunk a couple of tugboats in the Suez Canal that he was sinking the Government in Dublin. That, at all events, would appear to be the alibi given to us now for the extraordinary monetary situation in which we found ourselves, in which the economy was during that particular period.  It is admitted now that things are better and it is not alone Fianna Fáil members who are saying that.  The most significant, and perhaps the most dramatic change in the whole economic set-up is the situation in which the farmers find themselves to-day, that not alone are they not refused credit but credit is being pushed at them by the banks. As long as I can remember it was virtually impossible to get the banks to regard Irish land as good security. Irish land had become debased as a security and there was no bank which would accept it as collateral.</P>
    <P>Any farmer who went in to try to raise £200, let it be to buy cattle or machinery or for a new cow shed, was told by the banker to bring in two other people, who must have businesses or be depositors in that particular bank.  No bank or banker down through the years would accept Irish land really as a security.  Consequently, the change in recent times is all the more dramatic.  There is no question now with the banks of sending the farmer back for two more people to sign the bill for him. There is no question now, even for the purpose of buying heifers under the heifer scheme, or buying livestock, of the other collateral which was formerly required by the banks.  That in itself is possibly the most dramatic change in the financial climate here. <Col N="1017" /> People will ask themselves how that change came about or why the situation was so bleak in 1956 and up to the advent of this Government. People will ask themselves if there is no plan, as Deputy McGilligan alleges, or if this Programme for Economic Expansion represents just so many pious aspirations, how it is that this extraordinary change has come over the bankers and come over the general financial climate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the Bank of England in a few moments.  I am dealing now with our Irish banking system.  Some things which occurred in the last two years are very significant in our economy and very indicative of the dramatic change which has come about.  One of the most significant, displaying the new confidence, not alone at home but abroad, in our economy, is the fact that there has been a considerable inflow of capital, that it increased from £1.1 millions in 1957 to £17.7 millions in 1958. Secondly, the value of our exports has been maintained.  Thirdly, the number of cattle has increased by nearly 15,000 as from January, 1958.  Fourthly, current deposit and other accounts in the commercial banks have increased by over £15 millions.  Fifthly, there has been an increase of 4 per cent. in industrial output in 1958, reversing the previous trend.  There has been a general upward tendency in the output of manufacturing industry.  That, coupled with the reduction we have had in unemployment and in emigration, is indicative of something, irrespective of what people on the Opposition benches may say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take a view, which is not a Fianna Fáil view, of the Economic Plan to which this Budget is giving effect.  Let me take some independent views of outsiders.  They will be helpful as indicating that Government policy on economics here, at all events, is having some effect.  The <i>Irish Banking Review,</i> which is published by the Irish banks, in its March issue, dealing with the White Paper, which Deputy <Col N="1018" /> McGilligan said is not a plan at all, has this to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government White Paper on Economic Expansion is a novel and noteworthy document in many respects.  It evidences a constructive, realistic and dynamic approach by the Government towards solving the long enduring national problems of underemployment and underproduction in agriculture and industry, emigration and relatively slow growth in real national income.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not the least heartening feature of the Programme, indeed, is the evidence that the Government has the courage to face the facts bluntly and present a plan of development compatible both with the country's resources and its disadvantages. This fact will serve to stimulate the public support and co-operation for the Programme, upon which, as the White Paper explicitly recognises, its eventual success depends.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further down it says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The new investment expenditure will involve an estimated £53.4 million in the five year period 1959/60-1963/64.  Total State investment over this period will be at an estimated level of £220.44 million.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what the bankers evidently think of this Plan, which Deputy McGilligan alleges is no plan at all.</P>
    <P>There are other comments which have been made on the situation here and on the change in the financial climate since the change of Government occurred in 1957.  The February issue of <i>The Statist,</i> speaking of the new optimism in Irish industrial life, said, in its issue of February 28th 1959:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The year was also marked by the actual achievement of some worthwhile economic projects which also contributed to the spirit of hopefulness.  A few important undertakings which had long been mooted but never forthcoming took physical shape and new ideas began to break through the hard crust of official dithering and political immobility.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> I leave it to the imagination of Deputies to decide to whom or to what Parties <i>The Statist</i> was referring when it talked of official dithering and immobility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he is and I hope he will enjoy this comment, which is taken from the <i>Financial Times</i> which it cannot be suggested to be a Fianna Fáil organ, dated the 13th February, 1959.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ireland on the Turn.  The Irish economic scene looks considerably more promising now than it did a couple years ago... The rate of national income growth is sufficiently realistic for the widespread optimism it has created to be well founded.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would also like the Deputy to listen to an extract from <i>Euromarket,</i> the monthly review of European markets, which in the April issue, page 26, referred to industrial development here, including the recent development of Cork harbour.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;These major industrial developments in Cork Harbour come at a time when the Irish economy is on the verge of a period of expansion. During the past two years dangerous inflationary tendencies have been effectively curbed, and the past year has seen a major growth of foreign investment in the country&mdash;especially investment by industrialists from the Common Market countries.  In addition 1958 saw a recovery in industrial production (at a time that output in many other countries was static or declining), a reduction in emigration and a recovery of confidence, which has been encouraged by the Government's five-year programme for economic expansion, in which the growth of the Cork <Col N="1020" /> Harbour industrial complex plays a prominent rôle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All these comments come from sources outside and inside that are independent and non-political.  All these comments are made on the financial climate here, on the effect that has been given to the economic plan published by the Government and the progress that has been made in restoring the confidence of our own people in the future of the country. All the indications that I have given show that people both outside and inside have come to the conclusion that, not alone is the economy of the country sound, but is expanding and, what is more important than all, they show the view that our own people are now starting to take.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest disasters of all was the feeling that got abroad in this country for some years until recent times that there was no future for Irish men and women in the Ireland of these times.  The despondency that was rampant in the country was a financial disaster.  It was the greatest cross the country had to bear and the greatest brake on economic recovery and development.  This Budget is designed further to combat that feeling. It is designed to rout the pessimism, whether it is professionally inspired by people here or otherwise, that was rampant in this State.  This Budget is in keeping with the wave of economic confidence that has surged through the nation over the last couple of years and this Budget, like some of the legislation that has been introduced recently by the Tánaiste, is giving further effect to the over-all plan of the Government's White Paper which has been published.</P>
    <P>It would be well, of course, if more reliefs could be given.  It would be well if the economy could stand greater reliefs.  But, in giving the reliefs that have been given, particularly in the form in which they have been given, the Minister for Finance, not alone took every aspect of our economy into consideration, but took the means to give the economy the necessary incentive and took them wisely and deliberately.</P>
    <P>The way in which direct relief in <Col N="1021" /> taxation has been provided is possibly important, from the effect it will have on the economy, not by the amount of actual relief given but as an indication to the people of the Government's intention as far as taxation is concerned.  It is more effective, and will be more effective in our circumstances, to do it that way than to give that relief, as some people have suggested it should be given, in an indirect way.  In our particular situation it was necessary that the direct method should be used.</P>
    <P>This has been described by Deputy Sweetman as a shot in the arm to the economy.  Not alone does the economy need a shot in the arm but it particularly needs it at this particular time and these budgetary proposals are part and parcel of the more progressive economic view that is being taken by all the various elements that make up our community, both industrial and agricultural.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that, examining this method of using the Budget as an instrument of policy, the Minister for Finance was wise in the method he adopted.  In advising the British Chancellor of the Exchequer before his recent Budget, <i>The Economist</i> of April 4th, 1959, had this to say:</P>
    <P>The most myopic recipe for next Tuesday would be to concentrate on reliefs of indirect taxes, on the ground that these would give the promptest incentives to spend.  The most constructive recipe would be to concentrate on reliefs of direct taxes, on the ground that these would give the most durable incentives to earn and save.  To the extent that some money from income tax reliefs might be saved rather than spent, this does not mean that such reliefs are ineffective as weapons against recession, but merely that there can be more of them.</P>
    <P>That should be the guiding rule for the Chancellor as he turns to consider the separate sectors of his revenue.</P>
    <P>I believe that, in our particular circumstances, at this time, at the turn of the corner to economic recovery, the direct method adopted by the Minister <Col N="1022" /> to give relief in taxation in income tax was the best method and the proper method and that it will have a dynamic effect on the economy.</P>
    <P>Some of the other reliefs that the Minister has given have been widespread. I listened to Deputy McGilligan suggesting that it was a terrible thing that companies were going to get big&mdash;I forget the adjective he used&mdash;very large or fantastic reliefs under this Budget.  One would think it was a crime, in our situation, that industry should get this fillip.  Of course, the reliefs will be an incentive to industry as well as to the individual and that is part of the reason why this Budget has been framed by the Minister in this particular way, so that its direct effect will have the desired result on our economy.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister proceeds to another point, I want to raise a point of order.  Last Thursday, the Minister for Education quoted from <i>Euromarket</i> and I asked him to fulfil the normal procedure and to table it and put it in the Library.  I did not interrupt the Minister for the Gaeltacht when he quoted from <i>Euromarket,</i> because I assumed his colleague had fulfilled the procedure.  I inquired in the Library and found that it had not been tabled.  Could it be tabled now, so that we will have an opportunity, before the debate is concluded, of checking the quotations, which is the normal practice, or, if the Minister likes, he could give it to me across the House when he is finished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, Sir. Speaking in the Budget debate here, Deputy Cosgrave had this to say, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on Wednesday, 22nd April:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was easy to see what was wrong and what should be changed, but what was not easy was to provide a remedy or remedies for those economic problems.  Undoubtedly, the lack of progress had been due to a very considerable extent to politics and personalities.  If impending changes on the political scene meant an end to those disastrous activities <Col N="1023" /> then the sooner those changes took place the better.</P>
    <P>Strange to say, leaving out the personalities, I entirely agree with Deputy Cosgrave in that statement.  Many of our economic problems have been due to politics&mdash;by politics, I mean the political system we have had here&mdash; and I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that when these changes are made in our political system and when proportional representation is abolished it will have tremendous economic effect.  In agreeing with Deputy Cosgrave, I want to examine for a moment the effect that proportional representation has had in this country, as far as its economics are concerned, over a very considerable number of years.  I should like some economist to calculate, if it were possible, the material losses alone to our nation as a result of having proportional representation here and to estimate the brake that it put on the progress of our economic system.</P>

      <P>When the next Budget <Col N="1024" /> comes to be introduced by the new Government after the next election, we will have stability for a further expansion in the economic progress which is now being made.  It will expand far more rapidly as a result of that stability which we will have after the next election.  That stability will be an attraction which is always provided by stable governments to outside capital.  Outside capital is on the up-surge, due to the stability that we have, owing to a strong Fianna Fáil Government being in power.  We have the figure I quoted which shows a very welcome trend and an increase of up to £17,000,000 last year in the inflow of capital.  Of that £17,000,000, it is very interesting to know that the largest proportion of it is provided, not by banks, but from private capital.</P>

      <P>That is quite fair, but I can assure the Deputy that it is no invention on my part.  I shall show it to him in black and white.  I do not know if the Deputy intends to speak, apart from what he said initially after the Minister's Budget Statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Deputy when making his contribution, to give to the House an explanation of how there has been this extraordinary upsurge in the inflow of capital to this country during the past 12 months and how it was that there was an inflow of £1.1 million above the previous year.  What has been responsible for that?  How has such an extraordinary change come into our financial climate that we are now starting to attract outside capital? Comparing the difficulties of the Deputy and his Government when they were in office and the situation in the country when they went out of office, the Deputy and his colleagues will have an awful job trying to convince the people that there was nothing wrong with the coalition administration that was in charge of affairs at that time and that some extraordinary miracle has occurred during the past two years since this Government took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assert that every indication one can get from the economic point of view shows that we are slowly but surely struggling out of the economic rut in which we found ourselves in 1957.  I assert that not alone is this Budget a balanced Budget, but for the first time in many years, money is provided for very substantial reliefs to many sections of the community. There is an indication of the economic progress that has been made by the nation under the guidance of the Government and I assert that if all the financial indications which are now apparent continue&mdash;and with the help of our people and our people's efforts, they will continue&mdash;the country will proceed on the national road to <Col N="1026" /> financial recovery.  It will proceed steadily and surely, irrespective of any diversions Opposition Deputies may try to set up on the advance towards the national economic goal which is indicated in the White Paper upon which Government policy and this Budget have been based.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht spoke of statistics that were not furnished and apparently started to give away some information which his Chief refused to make public yesterday.  I would remind the Minister that yesterday I asked the Taoiseach for the particulars and the break-down of that £17.7 million figure.  I was refused, but apparently the Minister for the Gaeltacht imagines that he will give in a side way something which the Taoiseach was not prepared to disclose.</P>
      <P>However, we will pass from that because it was just one typical instance of the innuendo slant the Minister tries to throw around to everybody and in particular to Deputy McGilligan when he was speaking.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the Minister for Finance concluded his Budget speech, I made certain observations on that speech as I heard it.  The more I read it and the more I consider it, the more certain I am that the comments and the observations I then made were not merely accurate but were perhaps too light, if anything.  I admit frankly that in the few minutes then available to me, I misheard him in relation to the levies.  I understood him to say&mdash; clearly on reading the speech, I misheard him&mdash;that the levies were being abolished in a far wider way than they have in fact been dealt with.  As the outcome determines, there has been virtually no change whatever made in the levies that were imposed and that still remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even taking away from the levies those articles which have been transferred to permanent customs duties, to the tune of about £1,200,000, something less than one-eighth of the other levies remaining were in any way affected.  Walking sticks&mdash;Fianna Fáil Deputies can now cheer that walking-sticks have been freed from levy. Pickles have also been freed from levy. <Col N="1027" /> Whether it is to put a rod in pickle for some of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers who are not coming up to scratch is another question.  If you go through the list you will see that nothing has been changed except trifles of no account of that nature.</P>
    <P>I admit frankly I did not quite appreciate that the Minister, in his Budget Statement, was making so little change as that when I was speaking immediately afterwards. However, I want to make it as clear as I possibly can that the comments I made then on hasty consideration of the Budget are those I propose to make again today on mature consideration of it.  In fact, the more I look into the position the more reason I find for making the same comments.</P>
    <P>When the history of the last few years comes to be written by somebody interested in financial matters, one of the things I believe that person will most certainly say is that Deputy Dr. Ryan in his period as Minister for Finance&mdash;at least in the last two years; I hope he will change&mdash;sublimated the national interest to Party advantage commencing two years ago when he introduced his 1957 Budget. All the time since he has never dealt with problems in this House in the manner in which a Minister who is considering primarily the national interest should deal with them.  He was always much more interested in trying to have a skelp at his predecessors or trying to place blame on them in relation to any problem with which he might be faced.  I was left many problems by Fianna Fáil when I succeeded to the Department of Finance in 1954.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy left a number of problems to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And one problem to which I intend to refer was a problem that was aggravated deliberately by Deputy Burke for Party purposes. I was left many problems by Fianna Fáil when I succeeded to the Department in 1954, but if the Minister cares to take the trouble to go over the record of this House he will see I tried <Col N="1028" /> to deal with those problems not by way of parking the baby on my predecessor as I could easily have done. Deputy Dr. Ryan, as Minister for Finance, has always taken that line and it is a line that has been particularly unhappy for the country.  I am not going to minimise the difficulties of 1955 and 1956, but in the second half of 1956 and the very beginning of 1957 we had reached a point at which the essential thing was that confidence should be engendered if we were to surmount those difficulties.</P>
      <P>I could feel sore about the manner in which Fianna Fáil during the general election of 1957, deliberately tried to dissipate that confidence, but I can excuse what takes place during the heat and turmoil of a general election, even though it should not take place.  However, it is the period after that to which I wish to refer today.  I am not permitted, and properly so, to criticise or commend public officials in this House, but I am certain that the officials in the Department of Finance were not giving to me one piece of advice today and a different piece of advice to my successor tomorrow.  They are above that.  They were giving both of us, I am sure, the same honest advice in which they believed and the advice could not possibly have changed from one day to the next.  I defy contradiction of the belief that when Dr. Ryan succeeded to the Department of Finance he would have been advised there and from the Statistics Office that we were over the hump and starting on the turn.  Notwithstanding that, he delayed that turn by the deliberate attack he made for Party purposes at all times on his predecessors. In doing that he showed a lack of frankness that has been quite lamentable, a lack of frankness which has continued right up to the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early part of last year we had some discussion here on the Vote on Account and on the outturn of the financial year then ending.  Deputy Dr. Ryan either did not know or else deliberately did not disclose to this House that the figures then being published every week in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> by way of comparison with the figures of <Col N="1029" /> the preceding year for Government expenditure were not comparable at all because he had changed the system of accounting on the 1st January, 1958. Either deliberately or for his own purposes he failed to disclose to this House that such a change had been made and in consequence those on these Benches who did not know the change had been made were misled. This year again he has deliberately tried to mislead this House and the country and it is that misleading, both in the documents that have been furnished and in his speech on the Budget, which I think will do the greatest harm.  It is because of that approach by him for Party purposes that the confidence that is necessary to be engendered throughout the country as a whole will not be engendered.</P>
    <P>I asked a good many questions this week.  I deliberately deferred asking them till after the Budget because I knew from my experience that the Minister and his officials in the Department would be very hard pressed indeed up to Budget day, particularly when Budget day was early this year, in trying to get matters in train.  I am sorry the replies I got in relation to some of these questions were not full or frank replies.  Knowing the practice that has been followed in this House of always answering questions of that sort in a full and frank manner and putting the answers on the records of the House, I could not understand why there was a change until quite by accident, when Deputy Haughey was speaking last night and referred to one of the Tables in the Budget, the answer came to me suddenly.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made a very deliberate change in the presentation of one vital figure in his budgetary statistics this year.  He has made that change without adverting to it at all in public, and without drawing the attention of this House or of the public to it.  It is made in the words of his Budget speech where he changed the word &ldquo;over-estimation&rdquo; to the words &ldquo;errors of estimation&rdquo;.  It is made in the first Table that was published with the Budget where, for the first time in any year I can trace, the <Col N="1030" /> basis of over-estimation has been entirely changed.  Notwithstanding that change the Minister never thought it worth while to inform the House or the country of the change he was making. I can only assume that it was because it would appear so very clear from the figures and the replies to the questions I asked when the answers were put down, one underneath the other, that I was not given the answers to the questions I asked on Tuesday and Wednesday this week. What are the facts?</P>
    <P>The facts are that every Minister for Finance, going back for as many years as I have had the time to go back in the past couple of days&mdash;naturally, I expected I would get the answer to my Question&mdash;going back to 1953 when Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Finance, has always taken into account a certain figure for gross over-estimation. The figure he has taken into account for gross over-estimation has always been the amount by which the Minister of the day anticipated that the current Estimates for the Supply Services would not be expended.  The amount that has been taken by different Ministers in different years from time to time has always varied, but it has been that figure always that has been taken&mdash;the over-estimation on Supply Services, the over-estimation in the volume, the Book of Estimates, with which all Deputies are familiar.</P>
    <P>This year, for the first time, the Minister threw into his current Budget out-turn table of last year not that figure less the Supplementary Estimates figure, as had always previously been done, but variations in revenue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This year in his Budget speech, the Minister does not use the word &ldquo;over-estimation&rdquo;.  He uses the words &ldquo;errors of estimation&rdquo;. I do not know why he does that.  Perhaps it might be for this reason.  What has been the over-estimation, gross, <Col N="1032" /> over the years?  I do not want to mislead anybody.</P>
      <P>The actual out-turn of over-estimation in 1953-54 was £6.197 million; in 1954-55 it was £7.868 million; in 1955-56 it was £3.848 million; in 1956-57 it was £2.849 million; in 1957-58 it was £2.940 million.  Last year, the gross figure was £1.183 million.  The figure has been dropping year by year from £6.197 million to £1.183 million.  This is the year in which, after dropping year by year and coming down to that, the Minister thought out of his head an extra million and added it on.</P>

      <P>These are the gross figures.  Without the facilities I asked for in my Question, and which the Minister refused to give me, I am not able to work out the figures for net over-estimation, but, last year, speaking on the Budget, the Minister gave us figures for the earlier years.  As reported at col. 610 of the Official Report during the debate on the Budget last year, the Minister gave us the figure that the net over-estimation, that is, the over-estimation, less unanticipated supplementaries, as I understand his phraseology of last year.  Again, I have not got those figures except there, although I asked for the information: in 1954-55, £3.25 million; in 1955-56, £2.25 million; in 1956-57, £2.25 million; in 1957-58, £2.05 million.

      <P>Perhaps then the Minister would be able, if that was the anticipated one, now, even at this late stage, to give me the net figure? I have the figures for the Supplementaries here.  I was trying to break them down as well as I could.  The Supplementary Estimates introduced in 1953-54, the first year to which I referred a minute ago, were £10.656 millions, of which, as far as I can understand, £2,400,000 was anticipated and £750,000 given in the general <Col N="1033" /> figure.  In 1954-55, the particular estimated ones were £900,000 and the global figure £750,000.  In 1956-57, the particular estimated Supplementary Estimates were £420,000 and the global figure £750,000.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1034" /> if in view of the fact that it has been necessary to import raw sugar to augment home production, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann will consider contracting for a greater acreage of beet this year than heretofore, rather than reducing contracts to individual growers with the possibility of such reductions leading to continuing imports annually of raw sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo. inform me that they have received beet contract applications for an acreage in excess of the capacity of their factories during the normal refining campaign period.  They have accordingly arranged to give first priority to satisfactory regular beet growers for their normal acreage and to allot the remaining acreage in accordance with a priority agreed with the Beet Growers' Association.  The estimated quantity of sugar to be produced from home-grown beet in this year will exceed total home requirements.</P>
      <P>Raw sugar is imported for refining at periods of the year when native beet is not available, for the purpose of facilitating export trade in sugar goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to give a licence to the Sugar Company to import foreign raw sugar while they refuse, or will not give contracts to people who apply for them and who sowed beet in previous years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the position.  The Sugar Company is giving contracts for all the beet they can handle.  The importation of raw sugar outside the refining campaign period has nothing to do with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that answer.  Is it the case then that the Sugar Company cannot refine any more Irish beet?  That is not the answer given by others.  Will the Minister state is there a necessity for a further sugar beet factory in this country to handle our full sugar requirements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that if they could get a sufficient quantity of beet, delivered to them earlier in the <Col N="1035" /> year so that they could open their campaign earlier, they could handle more but they could not do that to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that growers who have been growing beet in North Tipperary for the past number of years have been reduced in acreage by at least 50 per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is correct.  At least, the information given to me was that growers who have been growing beet regularly for more than two years are getting contracts for the acreage they normally grew and, in other cases, who would naturally be new growers, the areas are as agreed with the Beet Growers' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that no sugar is imported during the period of the year when native beet is available, and a decision not to import raw sugar would not increase by a ton the quantity of beet they could handle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if any statistics are available to indicate the number of persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts (excluding holders of medical cards) who availed of hospital and medical services under Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953, towards which a contribution was made by such persons to local health authorities in a recent period; and if he will indicate them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been explained in reply to similar questions in the past, many persons who receive health services as members of one eligible class could also be properly regarded as members of another eligible class.  Many agricultural small-holders are also insured persons, and the majority of insured persons are also within the terms of the Acts by reason of their being persons whose yearly means do not exceed £800.</P>
      <P>For these reasons it would be misleading to regard the number of persons who claim and receive services as members of a particular eligible class as representing the total number of persons in that class for whom services are made available, and it would be impossible to apportion to any one of the categories of eligible persons a part of the total income from charges made by health authorities.</P>

The facts are that one of these alleged ponds is a dangerous ravine which was caused by the excavation of sand from the land about 100 years ago and, far from constituting an asset to the farmer for watering his cattle, his problem is to fill in the dangerous ravine, and that the other so-called pond consisted of a depression in the ground which collects water during the winter period.  Is he aware that it is <Col N="1042" /> in fact a sludge cesspool and was previously used as a cemetery for the dead animals of the previous owner and that the bones of the cattle can be seen in the pond to-day?  Does the Minister think, and does his colleague, the Minister for Health agree, that this is a suitable source of water for cattle used by a man for supplying milk, that they should be watered in a pool containing the bones of dead animals? I inspected these ponds and I should like to inform the Minister that whatever official told him these were suitable water pools should be sent immediately to kindergarten to do a course of nature study so that he will know what a pond is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Questions, I was referring to column 610 of the Minister's Budget Statement of 23rd April last year.  The Minister gave figures for 1957-58, 1956-57, 1955-56 and 1954-55&mdash;four years of figures of what he called net over-estimation.  In the Minister's view, net over-estimation was the amount of general over-estimation he anticipated, less the general provision for Supplementary Estimates.  For example, in the Budget <Col N="1050" /> of 1956, the amount taken for general over-estimation was £3,000,000 and the amount taken for Supplementary Estimates in global form was £750,000, thereby leaving the figure of £2¼ million the Minister clearly quoted last year.  I might add that from the figures I have already given, it will be seen that the out-turn of over-estimation in that year was £2.48 million, as near as makes no difference to the gross figure of £3,000,000 to which I referred.</P>
      <P>As I say, that was the practice that has always been taken every year in every Statement and was taken by the Minister last year in his Budget Statement.  This year, however, as I was trying to explain to the Minister, when he came to circulate the Tables in connection with the Financial Statement of 1959, and in particular Table 1 thereof, he changed the basis in comparing the actuality with the estimate without telling this House or the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure of savings for net over-estimation of £1½ million was put in as being an estimate in the first column of that Table.  Nothing was put in in the second column.  But <Col N="1051" /> there is a note, note (b) which sets out that the Budget provides for a net adjustment of £1.5 million by way of deduction from expenditure to allow for errors of estimation.  Then the out-turn goes on to show how that was arrived at.  As I say, the Budget last year did not provide £1.5 million for a net adjustment for errors of estimation; it provided £1.5 million for over-estimation, and that is an entirely different thing.</P>
    <P>When the Minister came to circulate the Tables this year, he compared, not over-estimation either gross or net, as was always done every year up to this, but over-estimation, less supplementaries plus revenue buoyancy.  As far as I can find out, it is the first time there has been any effort to throw in the increase in revenue receipts of £1.667 million and to allege that that arose from over-estimation.  It was only last night I suddenly saw why I was not getting the answers to some of the questions I asked in tabular form. It is because this might have emerged more clearly, when you saw the figures for each year under each other, instead of having to go through half a dozen books to take them out.</P>
    <P>Last year, the actual over-estimation was £1.183 million gross.  I do not know what sum the Minister allowed for general supplementaries, but it is quite clear that his anticipation of last year was not reached or anything like it.  It was quite wrong of the Minister to try to slip across in Table 1 this year that the out-turn had been as he prophesied last year and that he was taking the same figure this year on the same basis as he had taken it last year, whereas it was on an entirely different basis.  It now appears clear that the figure the Minister is taking of £2.5 million, if you adjust the figure for this year's account, is a figure, not merely for estimated excess of provision on the Supply Services, less Supplementary Estimates, but also takes into account a figure written in by the Minister for an increase in revenue receipts over the estimate.</P>
    <P>We had many discussions here in the past in relation to the buoyancy of revenue.  Buoyancy of revenue is <Col N="1052" /> shown, or should be shown, in the estimated receipts printed and published every year on the Saturday before Budget day.  I shall not go into the processes&mdash;the Minister knows them quite well and I know them quite well &mdash;by which those revenue receipts are taken into account and by which they are arrived at.  But the buoyancy is taken there and, to take it in addition to the £2,500,000 as the Minister has done as well, is not being fair on straight with the House or with the country.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had come along to the House and frankly put all the facts before us and told us that in relation to last year's gross over-estimation&mdash; which he must, I think, have anticipated, as far as I can judge, at a figure of about £2,500,000 to £2,750,000 but which only reached £1,183,000&mdash; there were special circumstances last year why that was so, or, if he had come along to the House and put the facts clearly and fairly before the House and told us, regardless of how these figures had turned out in the past, in the circumstances of the country's economic position to-day it was desirable to give certain reliefs for the purpose of stimulating economic activity, apart altogether from Budgetary totting, I would have had no fault to find with him.  But I am finding fault with him now.</P>
    <P>I say quite deliberately that it has become quite fantastically childish in recent years for people to try to show that in one year a Budget balances and in another year it does not.  It is entirely a matter of opinion whether one puts certain items to capital account and capital services or whether, when one is framing certain legislation, one puts the issues which are to go for that legislation into capital services or into below-the-line issues.  What we should do at all times is take the general picture of our absolutely current expenditure and also the capital expenditure we want to generate, take our balance accordingly, and frame our plans according to the economic position in which we find ourselves at any particular time.</P>
    <P>That might mean that in certain years we would have, and deliberately <Col N="1053" /> budget for, a surplus.  In certain years we would deliberately budget for a deficit.  In other years we would deliberately budget for a lineball.  When I am speaking of budgeting now, I am speaking of budgeting in relation to what are called known capital services and, perhaps, on occasions certain below-the-line issues.  We have taken far too rigid a line and tried to give ourselves pats on the back, or something else, and tried to denigrate our opponents because figures come out on a tot one way or the other.</P>
    <P>All that matters of course&mdash;I agree entirely with Deputy Haughey in this &mdash;is the general economic position at the time and the manner in which it should be faced and dealt with.  To say the least of it, it is regrettable that the Minister did not do things in that way and that he tried instead to put over a cheap change of phrasing, tried to pretend in Table 1 that he was comparing like with like, tried to suggest in his Budget Statement that he was making a figure for over-estimation on the same basis as he made it last year, and as his predecessors made it in the years before, when it would appear from the outturn for 1959 in relation to gross over-estimation that there could be no possible justification&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I did my best to ensure that, when I was presenting the facts to the House, I was presenting the House with the truth, and the <Col N="1054" /> whole truth in the national interest.  I am sorry the present Minister for Finance has not taken the same line. We had some discussion this morning on the part of the Minister for the Gaeltacht in relation to the economic trends.  I have already complimented the Minister on the publication of <i>Economic Statistics.</i>  I think it was a very good thing indeed that these statistics were issued particularly in our present circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance was present yesterday when I asked the Taoiseach a question in relation to Table 1 of the Appendix relating to other capital transactions.  The figure there shows a difference of £16.6 million this year; approximately £16,000,000 as compared with 1957 and, note particularly, a difference of £16,000,00 as compared with 1956.  In 1956 the residual figure there under the heading of &ldquo;Other capital transactions&rdquo; was £1.5 million.  This year it has jumped to £17.7 million.</P>
      <P>I quite appreciate and accept at once, and did accept yesterday, that there are ingredients in that figure which relate to private and confidential business which could not and should not be exposed.  It would destroy the efficacy of statistics of confidential figures were given out in public in a way in which they could be identified.  What I want to know is quite simple.  I want no confidence broken.  I want to know how much of that £17.7 millions is known capital transactions and how much of it is the residual figure of unknown transactions which inevitably arise and which can be brought in to fill up the picture. It is quite clear that there must be some portion of it absolutely known with certainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current items we have, for example: &ldquo;Other known current items&rdquo;; then we have &ldquo;Balance unaccounted for&rdquo;.  Just as we have that in relation to our external balance of international payments in the current position so also we must have it in relation to the capital position.  It would be quite beyond the powers of any Statistics Office, if it had three times the staff, to trace every minute detail of capital transaction but there must be some figures; when they have <Col N="1055" /> made all the possible examinations they can make, when they have taken all the confidential information into consideration, there must be some item that they make as a general estimate of what they think are capital transactions but that they cannot actually pinpoint.  All I want to know is how much of the £17.7 millions is known capital transactions and how much of it is &ldquo;Balance unaccounted for&rdquo;.  It would have been comparatively simple for the Taoiseach to have given me that information yesterday. As he did not, perhaps I can hope that the Minister for Finance as the person who probably tabled this book, will give the information to me in his closing speech.</P>
    <P>The picture of our economic position shown in <i>Economic Statistics</i> is a picture of an economy that, as I said last week, undoubtedly needs a shot in the arm.  It is a picture of an economy that is not progressing as it ought to progress and has not progressed as it should have progressed in the past two years.  If we were to believe the Minister for Finance and his colleagues and particularly the Tánaiste, they had a panacea for all our ills, a panacea which they advertised from every hoarding in Dublin and throughout the country during the last general election.  It would seem as if the picture which one draws from these statistics is undoubtedly one which up to the end of 1958 certainly is satisfactory as regards our balance of international payments.</P>
    <P>We were, in my time, in balance on our international payments on the Minister's own statement in the year ending 31st March, 1957.  We had a surplus on our balance in 1957, and we were virtually in balance in 1958. Obviously, nobody minds about the £1,000,000 that was off balance in that year.  In the first three months of this calendar year, our excess has gone up fairly steeply.  It went up particularly steeply in January and I think it is quite fair for the Minister to say, from the January details which have been circulated, that part of the increased excess arises from the importation of wheat, following the bad harvest of last year.  At <Col N="1056" /> the same time, I am a little disturbed by the suggestion in the estimates of revenue given to me in relation to the Minister's anticipation on our external account this year.  The main buoyancy in revenue suggested on page 3 of the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, is in customs duties, that showing an increase of approximately £1¼ million. If one looks at the customs duties, the main item of revenue is, of course, tobacco which provides, I think, somewhere about £25,000,000.</P>
    <P>According to the trend of revenue figures given to me in answer to a question this week, there does not appear to be much hope of a rise in tobacco receipts, unless, of course, there is some special circumstance known to the Minister confidentially that would not be known to us.  To be quite fair to the Minister, if it was known to him, he could not disclose it, but it would not appear from the trend that there is great hope of much increase in tobacco revenue.  In those circumstances, it seems that the buoyancy in customs revenue of £1¼ million to which I have referred&mdash;and indeed this is proven also by the answers I got to another question&mdash; and anticipated by the Minister, will arise in other imports where the value of the imports is practically equal to the duty content.  The value of the tobacco we import is trivial, from the balance of payments point of view, compared with the revenue duty and it seems that, in taking the trend therefore, the Minister in that customs figure must be anticipating a rise in other importations and that, inevitably, will show on our import figures and will affect our balance of payments position unless there is a similar rise in exports.</P>
    <P>For the first three months of this year, there has been a slight drop in exports, a drop which I do not think should seriously worry us because I believe the exports are still there and that really the situation is that they have not been sent out.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to give us some more information on that customs figure, something more of an indication of his expectation of the balance on external account in the current financial year and to say <Col N="1057" /> whether he thinks it is possible to maintain the existing balance and if so, whether he thinks it will be maintained at a higher level than in 1958 or whether we must hope to maintain it on a lower import level or whether the position will come back more or less to where it was in the past year.</P>
    <P>I presume that later on in the year, making full allowance for the fact that these figures were issued earlier than usual, we should get a more detailed break-down of the savings table on page 18.  It is an unsatisfactory trend that we see there, that the total of personal savings, company savings and local authority savings&mdash;or otherwise, dissaving as it might more often be&mdash; is down in 1958 by no less than 25 per cent. on the previous year.  A great deal of the basis upon which the grey book, <i>Economic Development</i>, is built&mdash;in fact, I might almost go so far as to say its whole basis&mdash;is the assumption that there would be an adequate volume of savings available and that Government policy would be able to ensure that that saving is there to sustain the programme.</P>
    <P>On both sides of the House, we have been saying from time to time that the volume was too small.  That has been common ground for both Governments but in relation to that, I want to refer the Minister to the top of page 37 of <i>Economic Development,</i> and paragraph 11 of that chapter.  The whole basis of economic development as set out there and the whole basis of our being able to carry through the productive effort envisaged was stated as being dependent on a progressive rise in five years in monetary savings from £45,000,000 per annum to £55,000,000.  The £45,000,000 mentioned there is, of course, purely fortuitously, the same figure as for 1958.  It is taken as the average of the preceding five years up to 1957. The whole ratiocination of <i>Economic Development,</i> to be able to do the things it is suggested we should do to resolve our difficulties, is dependent upon savings rising progressively to a figure of £55,000,000.  It is disappointing to see that in the first year after that survey has <Col N="1058" /> been completed, there has been a drop of 25 per cent. rather than an increase.</P>
    <P>I might say, in passing, that for reasons of which some members are aware, I was not here for the Vote on Account.  I was not therefore in a position to make any comments on the first occasion on which <i>Economic Development</i> came to be discussed.  I should like now to take the opportunity of adding my voice to the commendatory remarks on the grey book made by Deputy Dillon on that occasion on behalf of Fine Gael, and particularly to his very apt reference to the swan.  It is, however, disappointing to see the whole basis which was taken, if that trend were to continue on the productive effort side in the future, has failed.  That was one of the reasons why I said to the Minister last Wednesday that the economy needed a shot in the arm now after two years of Government by Fianna Fáil.  I do not suppose the Minister liked my saying that but I felt that was true because of his mishandling of the situation in the past two years.</P>
    <P>We have already referred on other occasions, and I want to refer briefly again, to the fact that we have a great opportunity now, having regard to the way in which the terms of trade are moving with us.  I referred the other day to the manner in which the index had risen from 83.7 in February, 1957, to 97.5, which was the last figure published for November, 1958.  As far as one can see, that trend is continuing to improve, so far as our purchases and exports are concerned.  It is undoubtedly a fact that they appear to have arrived at some stability in prices in Britain and that such stability, having regard to our import of manufactured goods&mdash;goods which we cannot produce here at home&mdash;must inure to our benefit.  Similarly, export prices, particularly in regard to agricultural products, appear to be likely to hold and we have seen the benefit of that in the figures for the year which has just passed.</P>
    <P>I do not know what hopes or prognostications the Minister, or his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, are prepared to hold out in respect of our increasing agricultural exports.  We <Col N="1059" /> have next door a market which consumes somewhere in the region of six million cwts. of butter every year.  Our share of that, in 1957, was about five per cent.  We have next door a market which consumes almost the same amount of bacon every year and our proportion of that was only somewhere around four per cent.  Our proportion of the lamb and mutton market, of some £7 million, is somewhere about £70,000.  It would seem, therefore, that there is under those three headings ample opportunity for us to get a more adequate share of that market, if we can so organise ourselves to get it.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat inclined to think, if I may digress for a moment, that the grey book&mdash;and it is a natural finance outlook&mdash;is somewhat derogatory of our butter and bacon possibilities. I think they are possibilities which must be faced and which should be tackled.  I am sorry that we have been allowed to hear nothing whatever from the Agricultural Marketing Committee that was set up.  The report of that body was one of the things I should particularly have liked to have seen published before entering on this Budget debate because the marketing of our production is a matter absolutely vital to our future and we must ensure that Budgetary policy makes that marketing easier.  If we are to sell successfully, we must have&mdash;and all those concerned in any industry must have&mdash; a thoroughly sound knowledge of the markets to be tackled.  We must also have an assessment of the place in that market which the product to be sold will occupy and, in addition to that, we must have a competent marketing plan backed by an adequate selling effort and by effective promotional efforts.</P>
    <P>I should have liked to have had the report of that Agricultural Marketing Committee available to this House so that we could have seen whether their investigations could give us any indication of any manner in which, by Budgetary policy, we could have assisted the capturing of, say for example, the three markets to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> I do not propose to weary the Minister any more with repetition of the fact, as it is a fact, that since he went over to that seat the cost of living has risen from an index figure of 107.7 to 116.9 for November and rose again in last February.  It is difficult for any Government, for any person in private commerce, or for any farmer to be able adequately to plan greater production unless he can see reasonable stability in the cost of living. The index figure is not always the best evidence of that.  It certainly is evidence of the trend and we know ourselves exactly in what respect the items have gone up.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the manner in which the number of those who are employed has gone down.  I want to suggest that the position is, perhaps, even worse as a trend than is suggested in Table XII.  I always understood that one of the first indices one ever got of employment was that of the sales of insurance stamps, which is contained in Table 60 of <i>Economic Series.</i>  I have here before me the last published number of <i>Economic Series,</i> dated 16th April, 1959.  I find that there were fewer insurance stamps sold in the second quarter of 1958 than were sold in the second quarter of 1957, that there were fewer again sold in the third quarter of 1958 than there were in 1957.</P>
    <P>The figures for the last quarter are not yet available to me, but it seems, from the fact that there is this trend &mdash;and it is a trend because the third quarter was worse than the second&mdash; that the trend is in the wrong direction, and that perhaps some of the average figures of the total of people at work as set out in Table XII may have been even lower at the end of the year because of being arrived at as an average, because the first quarter of 1958 was better but the last three quarters were worse.  I do not know when we will get the fourth quarter figure for 1958. Even when we get the first quarter figure for 1959, I think I am right in saying that it will not be strictly comparable, because of the increase from £600 to £800 in the upper limit of those who have to be insured under <Col N="1061" /> the social welfare code.  Certainly, when you take Table 60 in <i>Economic Series</i> and see the decline in the second and third quarters of 1958, and when you take Table XII in <i>Economic Statistics</i> and see the decline of 10,000 there from 1957 and of 32,000 from the year in which the people's wives were told to vote Fianna Fáil to get their husbands back to work, there is not very much in that which can be taken as very comparable with that advertisement.</P>
    <P>The question of building construction has been referred to.  I listened with amazement to the speech made here the other night by Deputy Briscoe. He spent a great part of his time, when we were over there and he was over here, here and in the Dublin Corporation agitating about the amount that was available to Dublin Corporation for capital works.  He said here the other night that he has no difficulty in obtaining now all the money that was required by Dublin Corporation.  In 1955-56, the amount which was made available by me and other sources with our consent to Dublin Corporation was £4,900,269.  In the following year, it was £4,379,806. Fianna Fáil came in&mdash;the Party which Deputy Briscoe says has made it easier for him&mdash;and in their first year they gave Dublin Corporation only £2,635,865 and in their second year, the year just passed, £2,132,111.  Then he has the brazen effrontery, having got last year less than half what was made available by us to Dublin Corporation, to come in here and say that with the present Government, he can get all the money he wants.  The fact is that he was conducting a ramp for political purposes in the period of the previous inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>I might add, just to put the figures on record, that at that time in 1955-56 we made available to Cork Corporation £884,670 and in 1956-57, £866,021, while last year all that was made available to Cork Corporation was £569,036.  For the record, might I say that the figures for 1955-56 and 1956-57 are taken from Volume 167, column 901; and that the figures for last year are taken from the reply to a <Col N="1062" /> Question asked by me on 21st instant. It is simple enough to judge the genuineness of the views expressed by the Deputy when one contrasts those two records.</P>
    <P>Following this Budget, we shall have the Finance Bill.  In the detailed consideration of that Bill, we may have another opportunity to consider exactly the impetus which will be given by the decrease in income tax.  I do not know whether the schedules of figures which were made available in certain newspapers were issued with the Minister's approval.  If the Minister tells me that the figures which were given in those papers are the correct figures, I shall not bother him with a question.  I may say that I think he was perfectly right in issuing them, if he did so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean the income tax figures here and in Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I mean the schedules which were quoted at the bottom of page 1 of the <i>Irish Press</i> of Thursday, 16th April, 1959.  I am not making any point that it was improper for the Minister to circulate schedules to the Press.  I do not think it was.  If he did, it would be quite right to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I did.  I am not sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would tell us.  If these are official figures, I shall not weary him with a question.  If they are not official figures, then, perhaps it would be desirable to have the facts on record but, as I say, we will get the opportunity on the Finance Bill itself of considering the impetus effect, the shot in the arm effect, of the reduction in taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, to repeat exactly what I said when I was beginning after Questions, let me say that we have been, in our conception of considering budgetary policy, far too much attracted and torn by individual figures and have concentrated far too much on them.  What we want to do to a much greater extent is to take the global picture, current expenditure, <Col N="1063" /> capital services, below the line expenditure, and ensure that our current expenditure is cut to a figure that was within a more reasonable proportion of our national income.  If we are able to succeed in doing that, then the effect will be that we will have more moneys freed, whether through savings or otherwise, for the purpose of ensuring that we can carry through a proper programme of productive capital development.</P>
    <P>Carrying through a programme of productive capital development is not something that was thought of or started only with the grey book or the publication of the Government's White Paper, to which I have referred earlier.  But it is an undoubted fact that there was no proper thought or consideration given at all between the wars by the Fianna Fáil Government, from 1932 to 1938, to a programme of productive expenditure because, if there had been, we would not have been faced in the recent post-war years with many of the difficulties with which we have been faced.</P>
    <P>We are sometimes appalled by the amount of capital that has to be invested for the purpose of ensuring that one man is employed in industry. The figures that have been given for the investment that is necessary show the magnitude of the task.  It is a task that can be faced in a constructive way only by whoever is Minister for Finance frankly putting all the cards on the table and not trying to gloss over something that may not be so pleasant to explain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make some observations arising out of this Budget which has been so fully discussed in the past few days.  The principal aim of the Fianna Fáil Party since they resumed office was to restore the national confidence which had been at such a very low ebb.  If anything can achieve that aim, it is the present Budget.  Undoubtedly, the previous two Budgets introduced since Fianna Fáil took office were not as optimistic as one could expect.  The present Budget is in very striking contrast to those Budgets inasmuch as it has been balanced and we are not presented with <Col N="1064" /> a deficit of approximately £6,000,000, as was the case in the last two Budgets.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has gone to great pains to try to establish that something exceptional took place on this occasion in so far as the Minister took the rather unusual step of bringing in certain amounts to revenue and thus, as the Deputy alleges, created an artificial position.  While I am satisfied that that is not the case, that question is not for me to explain.  In any event, it is a question that should be left to the Minister and I have no doubt that the explanation will be forthcoming when he is concluding the debate.</P>
      <P>As I have said, this Budget contrasts in a very significant way with the previous two Budgets introduced by the Government since they took office. From my point of view, the mere fact that the Budget gives a number of reliefs would not mean that it was a satisfactory Budget.  There are many other features associated with the Budget which make it what I think the people have accepted it as&mdash;a satisfactory Budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted a number of instances which indicated that the general economic position of the country had improved.  I submit that no amount of argument which the Opposition can put forward in regard to a number of those instances will succeed in getting the ordinary man in the street to accept their point of view as being correct.  The average citizen, although he might not have the opportunity of studying the financial trends of a Budget of this kind, is a pretty good judge.  What matters to the people as a whole is how trade and commerce are progressing, how employment is running and the availability of financial accommodation for agriculture and industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is anything that proves the case made by the Minister, it is the fact that financial assistance is available now for any project, whether agricultural or industrial, that is worthy of consideration.  A very important step in that direction is that commercial banks have taken the unprecedented step of offering people in agriculture and industry any reasonable financial help required to stimulate production.  A Deputy tried to <Col N="1065" /> make the case that the offer of the banks was not in practice what it appeared to be on paper.  I deny obsolutely that such is the case.  The change in the policy of the banks was long overdue.  When the banks did decide to make credit available, they set about it in a very practical and definite manner.</P>
    <P>Deputies who represent rural areas know that the farmers now have access to banking loans on a basis which is considerably easier than that which existed heretofore.  The old arrangement was that banks might consider limited advances to farmers on being given possession of a very substantial form of security.  Most people nowadays prefer to have recourse for loans to bank sources. They like to conduct that business in a confidential and private way.  The new arrangement the banks have announced gives that facility.  I am in a position to say that I have known at least a dozen farmers who, within the past two or three months, have had occasion to approach the banks for facilities in connection with the purchase of cattle, or the erection of farm buildings, under the new scheme.  I found on all occasions that the local bank managers were quite sympathetic to the applications made, and in most instances, were able to grant the accommodation applied for.</P>
    <P>The general policy of the banks is not such that they are inclined to throw money loosely about the country.  A number of conservative-minded people were alarmed when they found the banks were advertising the credit facilities available, but I say that the general approach of the banks to that question is realistic and practicable, and one which will certainly help the agricultural industry to a very great extent.  In the past year&mdash;and it is to be regretted&mdash; there was a fall in agricultural production. Opposition speakers have gone to great pains to indicate that it was because the general economic position of the country had worsened but the fact is that the Opposition selected a very bad year on which to base their case.  We all know the harvest of 1958 was one of the worst in <Col N="1066" /> history.  Deputies with common sense realise that a bad harvest affects the agricultural industry in this, and in every other country, more than it affects industry or other forms of activity.</P>
    <P>That reduction and the general fall in agricultural output are certainly to be attributed to the harvest.  To prove that we have only to wait and review the matter next year.  I shall be very surprised, if normal weather conditions prevail during the current year, if our deficiency in agricultural production is not made good, and if our target of something around two per cent is not achieved.  Improved weather conditions, and improved financial accommodation for the farmers and the people who engage in agriculture will certainly make for the achievement of that target which has been more or less set.</P>
    <P>It is true that employment is falling in the agricultural industry, but we must be fair when considering that aspect of the matter.  In recent years, the agricultural industry has been mechanised to a very great extent.  With the aid of whatever credit facilities were then available through agricultural associations, and particularly through hire purchase companies, it has been possible for farmers to introduce mechanised methods into the agricultural industry much more easily than they could have in the ten or 15 years before.  It is quite obvious that if agriculture is mechanised to an increasing extent, it will, in some way, affect the trend of employment in the end.  At the same time, I think the agricultural industry, in view of the substantial State aid available to it, has not contributed as much as it might have to the employment requirements of the country.  I should like to say that I am not prepared to suggest that that was the deliberate policy of those engaged in agriculture. It is due to a very great extent to the fact that the employment of labour in the land was, in past years, considered to be a burden which was beyond the capacity of the ordinary employer to shoulder.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency, particularly among farmers, to feel that they can <Col N="1067" /> afford to engage labour only during their principal activities in the busy seasons, and that during the quieter period, during the winter months, it would not be an economic proposition for labour to be employed.  That is a very false concept.  Nowadays, with the assistance from Government sources which has been made available for quite a number of years by this and previous Governments, there are many agricultural activities which can be undertaken during the winter period, as, for instance, the reclamation of land.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that those engaged in agriculture cannot be made to realise that full time employment on the land is necessary for the purpose of enticing workers who elect to engage in agriculture to remain on the land.  They have to be given what I regard as an incentive in that direction. A good deal of controversy has taken place in the local councils and in the House with regard to the reluctance of the Government to amend the Agricultural Land (Relief) Act because reliefs are not allowed except where the employment is continuous the whole year round.</P>
    <P>That is one of the many incentives which the Government have given and their reluctance to accede to representations made here to modify that Act is due, in no small measure, to their desire to ensure that employment in the agricultural industry should be as continuous, in the main, as it is in other industry.  The labour pool available to agriculture in general is not as great as it was many years ago.  For some reason which I find hard to explain, workers suitable for employment in agriculture seem to prefer to work in the industrial sphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter for the Estimates rather than the Financial Resolution. Details of agricultural policy do not arise on the Financial Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir.  I shall go back to my main subject. The loosening of credit in general for agricultural projects is one arrangement about which we can all feel very happy.  It is only right that we should <Col N="1068" /> make it clear that with that improvement in the financial structure of the agricultural industry, it is reasonable to expect the improvement in output which is so necessary at present.</P>
      <P>The fact that the general economic experience in the country has been satisfactory during the year was demonstrated in many ways.  I have already referred to one aspect.  Revenue during the year exceeded the anticipations that are usually set out when Budgets are being introduced.  It is reasonable to assume that if there is buoyancy in revenue, it is an indication &mdash;and in my opinion, a very strong indication&mdash;that the position, generally speaking, is satisfactory.  We have had that experience during the year and it was one of the most marked signs of the progress we had in our efforts to achieve the national economic advance to which I have referred.  Another demonstration of economic recovery is the general public support for the financing of capital programmes.  We have had the unfortunate experience of floating national loans over the past few years which have not been taken up.  It is very satisfactory that since the Fianna Fáil Party took office national loans have been floated successfully. The improvement in small savings, particularly in the saving certificates and saving banks, standing at £5,000,000, exceeded expectations, and the net increase of £2½ million pounds in respect of Prize Bonds is something of which we can be proud.  Of course, the Prize Bond scheme was initiated before this Government took office and I am prepared to give credit to the people now in opposition for their action in introducing that scheme.  It has proved very successful in making funds available to the Government to finance projects of national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his speech this evening, Deputy Sweetman dealt very fully with the financial accommodation available for the carrying out of works by local authorities during the period of office of the Coalition Government. I took a note of the figures the Deputy quoted, but, if the amounts which the Deputy mentions&mdash;and I take his word for it that the necessary sanction was given by his Department&mdash;were available, <Col N="1069" /> why were the local authorities unable to turn the accommodation into solid cash?  Those of us who have been members of local authorities know that there was a period of financial stringency, particularly during 1956.  The housing schemes of local authorities were held up at that time. It would take a period of several months to get a housing scheme sanctioned by the Department and when it came through, the local authorities were unable to carry it out owing to lack of finance.</P>
    <P>It has been stated by a number of Deputies that guarantees issued to local authorities particularly during the year 1956, would not be implemented by the banks.  I did not have any experience of that in my local authority, but I have been told by members of other local authorities that such was the case.  It would be very interesting if some speaker from the Opposition Benches could enlighten us on whether that statement was true.  I find it very hard to understand why an authority from a State Department in connection with a capital project could fall flat because the treasures of the local authority would not implement the authority issued.</P>
    <P>The general position in relation to local authorities is satisfactory.  The recent amending legislation passed by the Minister for Local Government in connection with the availability of the Local Loans Fund for purchases, particularly of houses which have been hitherto occupied, has been of great assistance and will be of considerable benefit to people seeking houses on the loan system in the country and urban areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman made light of the Minister's announcement that a number of these special levies were being removed and said that the general result from this move was not worth mentioning.  Referring to the Ministers Budget Statement, I find that 35 items were removed from the list and I do not regard them as being of minor importance.  They are useful items in the household and their purchase comes within the reach of the ordinary householder.  The items still subject to import levy are, in the main, <Col N="1070" /> non-essentials.  However, I feel that during the current year the financial position may improve to the extent that the Minister will find it possible at the time of the next Budget to review this list and reduce still further the number of items there and gradually eliminate it altogether.</P>
    <P>The output in manufacturing industry should be satisfactory to everybody, being in direct contrast to that which obtains in the agricultural industry.  The present policy of the Government in regard to helping industrial projects, particularly in the underdeveloped areas, is a very important factor in increasing industrial output in the future.  The policy of the Government in sending accredited representatives abroad in an endeavour to get foreign capital for industry here is one that has the general approval of the House.  The fact that the efforts made by these representatives has not shown fruit as readily as we would expect is to be understood.  The most satisfactory outcome to be expected from any representations is that an industry will be established which will be permanent.  Nowadays people investing money are conservative to the extent that they are not inclined to gamble as much as they were 15 or 20 years ago in putting up capital for industrial projects.  The market in that connection is to some extent drying up.  We cannot go on indefinitely having industries which may be inclined to be duplicated.</P>
    <P>There are many fields of new activity in connection with the general industrial programme.  I am quite impressed that our representatives abroad seem to be exploring those fields and endeavouring to the best of their ability to get any deficiencies in that sphere made up.  The general improvement in the economic position here and the better standard of living the people have undoubtedly been enjoying in recent years have to some extent helped to stabilise general efforts for the acquisition of new industries.</P>
    <P>In the course of debates here, particularly Budget debates, quite a lot of fuss was made on a number of <Col N="1071" /> previous occasions about the Government's policy of removing the food subsidies to the extent of £9,000,000. I do not know whether it is because the argument is getting worn out or is a bit hackneyed, but there has not been much reference to the matter on this occasion.  I think it is true to say that the people of the country as a whole accepted and have now accepted from experience that the removal of the food subsidies&mdash; whilst it was a step which, I am sure, the Government sincerely regretted&mdash; was a decision in the right direction&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not a financier. I know very little about the general impact of finance as it applies to Budgetary methods.  While I was listening to speeches from Opposition Deputies, I was hoping some speaker would sooner or later make a simple statement as to the advantages, under normal circumstances, food subsidies were providing in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read a good deal on this subject and I have been able to get some information and statistics, so far as food subsidies apply in other countries.  My information, for what it is worth, suggests that these subsidies were introduced, wherever they apply, during the war period. It is obvious that they were introduced generally to cushion the people through the erratic increases and shortages that applied at that time to essential commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The food subsidies had to be found by taxation.  The ordinary citizen had <Col N="1072" /> to contribute his due share to those subsidies.  From the way Opposition speakers tried to describe the removal of the subsidies, one would imagine they were appropriated in order to give some direct payment to members of the Government.  What would the position have been if we did not remove the food subsidies in the 1957 Budget?  I have my own views but I hope some Opposition speaker will, before this debate concludes, try to explain the position coherently.  I should like to have it explained from the Opposition point of view, provided the case is made simply and in language that can be understood by the ordinary man in the street.</P>
    <P>I feel the step the Government had to take at that time was essential.  I am sure, also, it would not have been taken had it not been absolutely essential in the opinion of the Government. From 1932, when Fianna Fáil took office, their general policy has always been directed towards helping the poorer sections of the community.  If the food subsidies would in themselves give that measure of relief and improvement to the poorer sections of the community which Opposition Deputies allege would be the case, I am certain the Fianna Fáil Government would have found other ways and means of overcoming the difficult position they had to face on resuming office at that time.</P>
    <P>I come now to private enterprise versus State or public enterprise as I call it.  Deputy Dr. Browne dealt with that matter fully yesterday.  Our State-sponsored companies have given a very good account of themselves.  In all their spheres of activity, they achieved results which might not be possible for private concerns.  We must accept that the field for State-sponsored companies is rather limited and that very few projects are now left undealt with by other sources in which State concerns could engage.  I have been searching for industries that might possibly be established under State-sponsored companies or private enterprise and I feel that very little is left which could usefully be assigned to State bodies.</P>
    <P>State bodies have the advantage that they have a virtual monopoly.  It is quite easy for any interest, whether <Col N="1073" /> State-sponsored or private enterprise, to succeed if they enjoy a virtual monopoly which a number of private enterprises have not got.  I feel that the policy of encouraging State activity could be overdone.  The average man does not like to see it carried too far. It eliminates the possibility of competition because when the State is asked to undertake an important project, it generally gets the exclusive right to manufacture, distribute and sell the commodity.  Undoubtedly, if there were still any industries that could usefully be taken up by State-sponsored companies, I should be inclined to favour them but to a limited extent.  As I have already said, the projects available in that connection are very limited and are gradually getting fewer and fewer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reliefs given in the Budget, I am sure every Opposition Deputy in his heart agrees that the Government went to the greatest extent possible in giving them.  We may differ as to the methods that should be employed or as to the extent to which certain reliefs were given but, by and large, I think there is general agreement in this House that the reliefs that have been given were ones that were badly needed, and in many cases were long overdue.</P>

      <P>For my part, I have no hesitation in saying I have hope that, even in some of those categories to which I have referred, the Minister may find it possible next year to examine them with a view to supplementing reliefs to some extent.  I was rather amazed to hear it said by members of the Labour Party that the increase given to old age pensioners would be nullified to a great extent because those in receipt of home assistance from local authorities would have their assistance reduced by that amount.  I do not accept that point of view.  I read the Minister's speech and he does not appear to have made any statement that would indicate that would happen.  I have not the slightest doubt that if any local authority proposes to take that course representations will be made to the Minister and the position will be corrected.  I do not believe that the Minister intended <Col N="1074" /> to give an increase of 2/6d. per week to old age pensioners and the recipients of home assistance, and felt that that particular increase might be deducted from those unfortunate people who have to supplement their incomes in the form of assistance from local authorities.</P>
      <P>I do not think I need refer to the other reliefs given in entertainment taxation covering cinemas, dancing and greyhound racing.  Those reliefs were sought by the various organisations who control these forms of entertainment and, whilst the Minister possibly did not give relief to the extent that these promoters required them, he met their case in a reasonable way.  I am particularly impressed by the method with which the Minister dealt with the tax on dances.  I feel that the cheap dances should be tax free, and I am glad that the Minister found it possible to remove taxation from the 2/6d. admission charge to dances.  With regard to the higher admission charges to dances, I feel that a reduction in taxation would not benefit the public generally.  The most popular form of dancing is the short dance, the admission charges to which are about 2/6d.  Dancers are quite satisfied because they are now provided with a type of entertainment that has always been popular with them.</P>
      <P>Income tax and sur-tax constitute a rather thorny problem and one which must be dealt with rather carefully, lest what I say should be misrepresented.  However, at the risk of being misrepresented, I do say it was time concessions, even if they were slight, were made to income tax payers, and that the rate of taxation generally applicable to incomes and to wage earners was reduced.  The value of money is diminishing and the average person in receipt of £5 or £6 a week if he was a single person&mdash; had to pay income tax.  He found it difficult to pay the few pounds demanded of him and, even thought the concession in this case is rather slight, it is an indication that the Government are alive to this problem. It is a start in what I regard as the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>So many Deputies <Col N="1075" /> have related this current Budget to the Budget of two years ago&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;that I find I have to take a similar step.  Deputy Moloney has referred to the impact of the withdrawal of food subsidies at that time and more or less issued a challenge to somebody on the opposite side to take him up on the points he raised.  I shall be glad to do it because my constituents are very similar to those of Deputy Moloney, as well as being neighbours.  They live a similar type of life and they have been hit in similar ways in both areas.  In the time available, however, I do not feel I could deal completely with those points and ignore the other facets of the budgetary provisions.</P>
      <P>No doubt, Deputy Moloney thought in 1957, as so many other people did, that this item of £10,000,000 that had to be found in taxation to meet the subsidisation of food was an item that could be cut off our taxation structure, and that we could reduce taxation by that amount if we could dispense with the subsidisation of food. In 1952, there was a partial cutting away of food subsidies and the consequence at that time were an expenditure by the State and by the private sector of the community in excess of what was then supposed to be saved, in trying to compensate the organised sections of the community who were so seriously affected in their standard of living by the impact of the increased cost of the necessaries of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a lesson which appears not to have been learned and so, in 1957, we had the present Minister in the Budget of that year, as well as imposing certain other additional taxation, withdrawing the food subsidies completely.  Let me ask Deputy Moloney, in retrospect, whether in the two year period that has elapsed since they were completely withdrawn, the efforts of the Government have been completely successful in cushioning the people against the impact on their incomes by the withdrawal of the food subsidies?  Perhaps some of the speakers who follow Deputy Moloney could tell me what the small farmer <Col N="1076" /> in North Kerry and North Cork got to meet what he has to pay to-day for essential commodities.  I am leaving out the luxuries and am not talking about tobacco or drink.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Deputies whether they are satisfied the wage earner in their constituencies is now as well off as he was two years ago, whether every single one got increases in wages or salaries or pensions to meet the impact of the increased cost of living and, if he did, where he got it and who is paying it?  If you put together all the increases in salaries voted by this House, all the increases voted by local authorities and which have to be met from rates, and add on again what the private sector has agreed to pay in increased wages&mdash;which they are passing on to the Irish consumer in the price of the goods they are manufacturing or retailing&mdash;how much is left of that £10,000,000 which was supposed to be cut off the expenditure side of our budgetary provisions? Why is it not reflected in a reduction in taxation?</P>
    <P>There were people outside the Government Party who were concerned about that item of expenditure, people who thought that could be done and that a strong Government could do it where possibly a less strong Government could not do it.  They supported the Fianna Fáil Party at the time because they thought there was a Government that could withstand any demand made by organised labour, a Government strong enough to withstand any demand from the Civil Service.  There was a Government and a Party so strong that they could do this thing.  They were certainly strong enough to have done it.  But in the interests of equity and justice, they could not have done it.  They found that out because, having said that we would be trotted into these Lobbies to prevent any increase in wages or salaries, as small a body as the Dublin dustmen brought the Government to their knees on the question of wages arising from the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Since then, every time the people in rural parts of the country turn on Radio Éireann they hear of some <Col N="1077" /> organised section getting an increase. That is going on and on.  The withdrawal of the food subsidies in 1957 sparked off that round after round of wage increases.  We find in this Budget reverberations of that.  As a result of the widespread demand that, even at this stage, the Government would do something to alleviate the conditions of the aged, the blind and the widows, we have this paltry penny per meal which will be payable to those who are still alive next August.</P>
    <P>I regret that Deputy Haughey&mdash;who, I must say, made a very reasonable speech&mdash;said, perhaps he did not mean it, that there would be some jubilation on the Opposition benches if the Government had failed to do something for the old people.  I certainly would not agree with that.  I would take the Deputy back to the time when those same people were obliged to go to a relieving officer and prove that their means were so little that they could not exist on the 10/- they got from the State in order to get another half-crown.  That was away back in 1947.  The old age pension was as low as that at that time.</P>
    <P>At that time, the Party on this side, again in Opposition, tabled a motion to grant a 5/- increase.  It was outvoted by the over-all Fianna Fáil majority.  On our accession to office a few months afterwards we stood by what we had demanded in opposition.  The first action of the inter-Party Government in 1948&mdash;we put them first in the queue&mdash;was to give the old age pensioners an increase in their allowances, and that was at a time when the cost of living had not risen to the point it is at to-day. That was done within a matter of weeks.  At a later date, when a similar increase was granted, it was found that, administratively, payments could be made within a fortnight of the Budget being announced. We had the post office staffs of the country changing the books to be in a position to pay the increased allowances within two weeks of the Budget statement being made.  In this case we find that, for some mysterious reason, it is being held in suspense <Col N="1078" /> until August.  We are entitled to ask why.  The people who have waited for the last two years for some assistance to meet that impost on them should not be obliged to wait until next August to get the 2/6d.</P>
    <P>As other Deputies have said, it was necessary to grant that increase.  It was the very least the Government could have done; and they should have done more.  These people live on bread, butter and tea.  At a time when external causes brought about an increase in tea prices, we met them by a double payment at Christmas. This cushioned those people for the entire year against the impact of the increase in the pound of tea.  For the last two years they have had this miserable shilling a week.  It has been accepted by the Labour Court and by employers throughout the country that 7/6, 10/- and 12/6d. per week was a reasonable increase to grant their employees to meet the impact in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also found it possible to give percentage increases to certain classes of pensioners and to I.R.A. pensioners.  A percentage increase is not a just increase in this case. When there is an increase in the cost of living surely it costs the person with the lower award as much to make ends meet as it does the person with the higher award?  In fact, it costs them more.  We have granted in this House &mdash;and there was some justification for it&mdash;increases in salaries to people with £1,000 per year to meet the increased cost in living.  They are people who have meat three times a day and who do not have to live on the commodities from which the food subsidies were withdrawn&mdash;bread, butter and tea&mdash; which constitute the basic diet of the unfortunate people in the lower income groups.  Surely it would have been a better thing to have granted a flat rate increase to all recipients?</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin pointed out that unless some action is taken by the Minister for Finance, many old age pension recipients in this city may have deducted from what they get from their local authority a sum equal to the increase the State may give them.  That may be rectified; it <Col N="1079" /> should be.  If the State feels it has to supplement their old age pensions, that should not be done at the expense of a reduction in what they get from the local authority.</P>
    <P>Another inequity arising from this increase is that unless administrative action is taken in relation to the recipients of special allowances, their allowances may be affected.  The old age pension of the recipient is not taken into account in the annual means test, but the pension of the spouse is taken into account.  I know of an instance where an increase of 2/6d. was granted in the old age pension of the wife of the recipient of a special allowance.  The special allowance was then decreased to a greater extent than the increase which the wife had received in the old age pension. If this is permitted, it will completely <Col N="1080" /> nullify the intention to improve the lot of such persons.  Speaking generally, these are small things; but they are very important things when you come to consider the individual and the person it is intended to assist.</P>
    <P>I should like to come now to the general principles of the Budget.  In 1947, when the subsidies were withdrawn, Deputy Costello, the Leader of the Opposition, said it would appear that the Taoiseach had again resorted to his old source for inspiration.  He had at one time advised a young politician coming into public life to study <i>The Prince.</i></P>
