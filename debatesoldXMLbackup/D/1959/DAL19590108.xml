    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Section I makes the formal arrangement for the deletion of existing matter and the insertion of new matter in the Constitution. The details of the new matter are contained in the Schedule.  A <Col N="154" /> debate on Section I would inevitably be repeated to a very large extent in a debate on the Schedule.  The Chair cannot permit duplication of debate. Accordingly it is proposed that the question on Section I should not be the subject of debate but that on the question &ldquo;That the Schedule be the Schedule to the Bill&rdquo; debate should cover the proposal to delete the existing matter and to substitute the provisions contained in the Schedule.  The Schedule is selected rather than the section since a number of amendments are tabled to the Schedule.  I presume this course is agreeable to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <P>Might I make this point?  Section I proposes particular amendments and the insertion of other things which appear on the Schedule.  If Deputies feel, as I feel, that there should be no amendment surely I am entitled to make that case on Section 1?  I do not want Section I to go through and I do not want to be put in the position of Section I being passed and then having to see what form of Schedule is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to prevent and what I am sure the House wants to prevent is that there should be duplication of debate on the section and on the Schedule, and it seems to me that it would be impossible to avoid that if we are going to discuss Section I and the Schedule separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, if we pass the section, the House is faced simply with the question as to what form the Schedule will take?  In other words, the House is put in the position of having agreed that there must be an alteration in the Schedule.  I do not agree that that should be the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Chair please indicate at this stage whether or not the Schedule can be discussed section by section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no &ldquo;section by section&rdquo; procedure on the Schedule.  It is a unit, like a Schedule to any Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but people may take exception to particular sections in the Schedule, whilst being in favour of other sections.  Is it suggested, therefore, that all the discussion on the Schedule should take place at one time, rather than move from section to section, giving those Deputies opposed to certain sections an opportunity of speaking on them, while not requiring them to take up the time of the House on other sections?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Schedule will fall for discussion after the amendments have been discussed, that is to say, the Schedule will be put to the House and can be discussed as a Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 1, I feel it is necessary to elicit certain information. First, I believe it is necessary for us to get it clear as to whether the omnibus proposal in Section I would bring about certain circumstances in which, for example, in the case of a constituency where an election takes place and, let us say, the Fianna Fáil Party got 8,000 votes.  Fine Gael got 6,000, Farmers got 5,000, Labour got 4,000 and others got 2,000, then the people who got 8,000 votes out of 25,000 votes would get the seat and be the representatives here.  I want to get a clear statement as to whether that is so or not.</P>
      <P>Secondly, Section I here, in dealing with the whole Schedule, deals with a certain number of composite things, that is, the wiping out of the multiple seat constituency, the wiping out of the single transferable vote, the importing into the Constitution of a formally set out type of commission with powers that are removed from the majority control of the Dáil and removed from the courts.  I want to know whether these things are not proper to be elicited by question and answer and by a certain amount of argument on Section 1; and that Section I can be voted against without interfering with the normal discussion of the proposals to amend the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Section I can be voted on, of course, without interfering with the procedure for discussion on the Schedule or the amendments to the Schedule.  Anything that may be discussed on the section will fall for discussion on the Schedule.  I am not limiting the discussion at all. <Col N="157" /> What I am anxious to prevent is a duplication of discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>I want to know from the Chair&mdash;when we come to Section I, and with the Chair clear in its mind as to how the discussion on the Schedule and on the Bill generally should be approached&mdash;am I precluded by the Chair's ruling, or by the proposal which the Chair wishes to make on the matter, from asking any such question as I have put now with regard to the effect of the general proposals in Section 1, first, that it brings about a situation in which the 8,000 votes cast for Fianna Fáil in a 25,000 poll can get the seat, and that that fact, by the form of the Schedule and the way in which it is being presented to the voter, is mixed up and obscured with other matters which have nothing at all to do with that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not preventing the Deputy from asking a question.  What I want to prevent is a duplication of debate&mdash;a somewhat similar debate on the Schedule as there is or would be on the section.  If the Deputy wishes to ask a question and the section then is allowed to be put without debate, all the debate that would fall on the section will take place on the Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Norton, you said that the Schedule is to be taken as one question.  You have already ruled that you will not accept amendments to Clause 2 of the Schedule.  Therefore, having refused to accept the amendments to Clause 2 of the Schedule, if we are to have the <Col N="158" /> whole Schedule taken as one Schedule, it means that we can discuss that only in the context of the whole general Schedule.  That seems to be an entirely unsatisfactory method.  Surely, if we are to pass from Section I, apart from the point Deputy Michael O'Higgins makes, the method should be that we take the Schedule clause by clause.  If we do not do that and you have already ruled in relation to amendments on Clause 2, there will be a chaotic debate on the Schedule itself.</P>

      <P>May I direct attention to this, Sir?  Last night, on the Referendum Bill, we discussed the way in which the whole machinery of the Bill was being changed in order to suit this Bill.  This Bill was drafted apparently to put us in the position in which we find ourselves to-day, that is, that we cannot take the separate items here in this proposal and discuss them in Committee, because, if a principle is passed in the Bill on Committee Stage, it brings us to the point in which we face one another here and, by question and answer and looking into the whites of one another's eyes, can discuss what exactly is proposed by the principle of the Bill and what the effects will be.  Here we have this proposal to go before the people and, if your judgment is carried out, we are put in a position here that we cannot discuss the various issues involved.</P>

      <P>I understand.  Sir, you have ruled that there are two principles in this Bill: one, the single seat constituency and, two, the abolition of the non-transferable vote.  May I suggest, with respect, that, having made that ruling, your ruling that you will not accept amendments to Clause 2 of the Schedule means that Deputies who might be in favour of one but against the other are not being given an opportunity of segregating their opinions?  The House should be given some opportunity of expressing its views on every principle. <Col N="160" /> One point of view on a principle against me was expressed and there must be an opportunity of expressing the other view.</P>

At what stage can we take a decision with regard to the setting up of the commission? At what stage can we take a decision that that commission's works and actions will be outside the jurisdiction of this House and outside the jurisdiction of the courts?  If this is a Parliament, then it ought to know at what point on Committee Stage it can take decisions on these three separate and unrelated items, however they may be related by the Government's policy.</P>

      <P>May I put this point, Sir?  If a Deputy wants to vote against a particular section of the Schedule, surely he ought to have an opportunity of doing that separately, without having to vote against the whole Schedule?  He may be in favour of the bulk of the Schedule but opposed to one particular section.  If it is ruled he must vote against the whole Schedule, then he is being asked to vote against something, with a substantial portion of which he agrees, in order to indicate his opposition to one particular section of the Schedule. This is a most unusual Bill.  This Schedule is the Bill.  There is no Bill here at all except the Schedule.  It is most unusual.  I have never heard a decision of the kind now given offered to the House before: that we cannot discuss the Schedule in separate sections seeing that the Schedule in this case is the vital part of the whole Bill.</P>

      <P>Have Deputies ever been put in the position that in order to avoid duplication, they are not allowed discuss or consider the first section of a Bill?  I understand that the basis of that ruling is the fact that the substance of the Bill is contained in the Schedule.  We are being <Col N="162" /> put in a position that, when the House pass Section I of the Bill, we are then unable to alter the Schedule. We have to take the Schedule as a whole or reject it as a whole, notwithstanding the fact, as Deputy Norton very properly put to the House, that there may be Deputies prepared to accept portion of the Schedule but not other portions of it.</P>

      <P>On the section, I wish to make some observations not in any way relevant to the question of the principles which have already, in accordance with your ruling, been established by the vote on the Second Reading, but on the form of the amendments.  I want to register a protest on the particular form in which this Bill has been drafted, has been put before this House, and will be put before the people at the referendum. The House should recognise the fact, and recognise it very seriously, that this is the first time in which the people will have experience of a referendum.  Up to this, they have had no experience whatsoever. This is something entirely new and we are, in this procedure, creating a precedent now, not for the House but for the country.  I understood the object of the rules of order was to keep debate in order, but not to prevent discussion.  Be that as it may&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Be that as it may, I want to put before the House the result of that when the people come to vote.  Because of the form of this Bill and because of the precedent it will create, not merely in reference to legislation dealing with referenda but in reference to all Bills and, in particular, to the Bill we discussed <Col N="165" /> yesterday, certain results must ensue.  There is a schedule here in relation to which amendments to the Referendum Act of 1942 are made by way of reference in that schedule. All that the Government has to do now to avoid discussion, in accordance with this ruling, on details of repeals, amendments, alterations or changes in legislation is to put those into a schedule and that schedule will have to be discussed as an entity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton has referred to the position.  Take the case of the Housing Acts from 1919 to 1952; suppose it is decided to amend, all that need be done is to say that these Acts shall be amended in accordance with the Schedule and one will then be compelled to vote for the whole Schedule even though one may only approve of nine-tenths of it.  It seems to me that is reducing order to a state very closely bordering on chaos.  It is for that reason that I protest against the form. I am not protesting against the principles.</P>
      <P>What should have been done, if the intention were to inform the House, and not merely the House, but the people, so that they might have a proper understanding of what it is proposed to do, was to introduce three separate Bills amending the Constitution instead of just one and, in that one, putting all the amendments of the Constitution into a schedule.  I understand that the ruling has been made that there are two principles in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I ruled only one principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In our opinion there are three: (1) the abolition of P.R.; (2) the electoral system of the single non-transferable vote; and (3) the setting up of this boundary commission. Those are the three principal matters in the Bill.  As I understand the ruling, we are not permitted now to put down an amendment to the effect that, while being in favour of the abolition of P.R., we want some other principle such as the transferable vote in the single member constituency.  I understand we are precluded from putting down an amendment to that <Col N="166" /> effect.  I understand there is quite a volume of opinion in favour of the transferable vote if P.R. is abolished.</P>
      <P>An elector coming to vote on this referendum will find himself in the position that, although he is in favour of the single transferable vote, he must vote in favour of the abolition of P.R. and the non-transferable vote. He cannot therefore express his view properly.  He cannot show that he wants another system within the proposed system.  In that state of facts, there ought to have been, in my submission, three Bills.  Putting all this into a schedule is merely evading the entire issue and creating a precedent for future legislation, a precedent against which I enter a very strong protest.</P>

      <P>This Bill is so drafted as to make it virtually impossible to amend.  If this Bill were being dealt with in the ordinary way, what would happen is, there would be a number of different sections, each proposing the appropriate <Col N="169" /> amendment to Article 16 of the Constitution. The Leader of the Opposition has already pointed out that, under Article 16 of the Constitution, various provisions are made: there is the provision for the multi-seat constituencies; the provision for the single transferable vote; the provision regarding the revision of constituencies and the number of persons who will be represented by each Deputy in the Dáil.  All of those are separate and distinct matters, which should and could be discussed and considered as separate and distinct matters in this House if this Bill were framed in the way in which I suggest it should have been framed.</P>
      <P>I suggest that it is quite wrong that we should be met with a Bill drafted as Section I is drafted, which lumps all of those things together into a schedule which is referred to in Section I and having regard to the ruling of the Chair&mdash;the ruling which the Chair feels it must give in accordance with Standing Orders and precedents of this House&mdash;Deputies are put in the position where they are not allowed to do anything except discuss the Schedule as one unit, notwithstanding the fact that various amendments to Article 16 of the Constitution are being proposed.</P>
      <P>I think, and I cast no reflection on the Chair when I say this, the blame lies entirely at the feet of the Government who have introduced this legislation in this form.  It is quite unfair to the Dáil and it will be quite unfair to the country that the country should be put in the position of having to accept or reject a block proposal which contains within itself several different ingredients, all of which are of importance to the people of this country.  I do not think it is good enough that the Government should be allowed to get away with this kind of thing.  Would the Taoiseach give any explanation of the extraordinary drafting of this Bill?</P>

If, because the Opposition have no amendments that they would stand over&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If they are in favour of it as a block, they will vote in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all logic-chopping and nonsense <Col N="171" /> with regard to a lot of this matter here. The same thing could be brought up in regard to practically any Bill in which there is a schedule.  The principle of the Bill was decided here, that the Constitution should be changed so as to substitute for the present arrangement of multiple-member constituencies and the transferable vote a system in which there will be a straight vote, under which, when it comes to the voter to act, instead of putting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, on the ballot paper, he will select the candidate he thinks best and put an X in front of his name, or after it, according to the arrangement on the ballot paper.</P>

      <P>Of course. It goes from the Government for drafting, as any Deputy who has any experience of Government knows, and as the Taoiseach knows well.  It is from the council chamber that it goes to the draftsman to be drafted.  Here we have a Bill affecting the fundamental law of this Republic, a Bill which contains two sections, one operative section, which merely provides that the Constitution shall be amended in accordance with the Schedule.  Because the Bill takes that form, we in the Opposition here are presented with a ruling, which we must accept, that we cannot discuss the details, the different portions of the proposed amendment, section by section.</P>
      <P>I protest, Sir, that in this Dáil this form of Bill should be introduced.  I feel that it lays down a most undesirable precedent, that henceforth we may be faced with similar Bills affecting the lives of the people, wherein a section seeks to enact a schedule and that discussion in this House will be stifled.  The Taoiseach said it is the usual form.  That is a great phrase of the Taoiseach's but it means nothing. I assert that in my short experience in this House over the last ten years I have never seen a Bill presented in this form.  I have never seen a Bill presented in this form with the entire Bill in the Schedule.  Of course, schedules are in many Bills but they are details and the Schedule to a Bill is designed and intended to deal with details that may not properly be dealt with in sections in the Bill.</P>
      <P>A Bill of this kind, where everything effective in the Bill is in the Schedule, is in my short experience, I agree, unusual.  I feel it is something that should be taken note of in this House.  It suits the Taoiseach and apparently the Fianna Fáil Party at the moment but they will be in opposition again.  Let there be no mistake about that.</P>

      <P>If I do not say <Col N="173" /> it, the people will say it.  May I remind the House that here to-day a precedent is being established which, if persisted in and followed, may in future stifle worthwhile discussion in this House?</P>
      <P>We were conscious of the dilemma which faced the Chair when we were considering amendments to this Bill. The Taoiseach says no amendments were put down.  The Taoiseach knows well that there were difficulties about putting down amendments.  We put down an amendment.  It was an indicating amendment to Section I of this Bill that the section should be amended in accordance with the amendments proposed to the Schedule. It was indicated to me by an officer from the office of the Ceann Comhairle, who was considerably helpful in this difficult matter, that he did not think an amendment should be printed.  He would regard it as being handed in to indicate the spirit in which the Opposition were facing this Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>We were perfectly prepared to put down any number of amendments to Section I of the Bill.  We would have done so but we felt that, by indicating to the Chair the manner in which we were putting the amendments to the Schedule, we could ensure a full Committee discussion on the Schedule. I think by reason of the attitude taken by the Taoiseach that the Opposition is being treated in a scandalous manner in this respect and that the House itself is being stifled.</P>
      <P>I oppose the form of Section 1.  It is wrong.  I think the form it takes contains nothing but danger to future discussions in this Parliament.  I do not think the Taoiseach can get out of it by acting Pontius Pilate and saying it is the fault of somebody else.</P>

      <P>There is a lot of little tricky argument that because there is more than one section in this Schedule the people will not be able to make up their mind about it.  They want not one referendum but three or four referenda on the subject matter of the Schedule.  On that basis we would have had 101 referenda on the Constitution. The people will make up their mind as to whether they see in this proposition sufficient merit to warrant the Constitution being changed.  I make a present of all the arguments that the various members of the Opposition can raise against any one or all of the sections of the Bill.  Let them get as many people as they can to vote against the constitutional amendment because they object to one or two clauses.  We will make them a present of that advantage. We with our responsibilities are prepared to put to the people this proposed change if and when it passes through the Dáil.  We are prepared to put it to the people and say to them: &ldquo;The Constitution should in our opinion be amended in this way.  Are you prepared to accept the change or not?

The Minister has said that so great is their confidence in their position he is prepared to face. defeat on one of them as defeat on all three.  If that is his case, surely I am entitled to say that his case is thoroughly rotten and fraught with great dangers for this country.  Far from having confidence in it, he should, by his own experience, know that the case he is taking to the country is disastrous.</P>
      <P>I want to put it to him, to you, and to the House, that my information is, that the Government have decided within the past week that they are not prepared to face the country on one of these issues or on three of them on their merits.  I am told that the Taoiseach is to be thrown into the fray.  I am told the Tánaiste and the Minister for Health have decided to put him up as a candidate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Did he discuss the merits of the issues to be put before the country or did he not?  It sounded here as if he did.  What was the purpose of his intervention?  What did he intend to say?  I think he ought to tell us because, apparently, some obscurity has arisen and we should all like to know.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Chair is doing so, but never before in my fairly long experience of this House have we had a Bill of this kind in which there are two insipid sections constituting the Bill and the real worth of the Bill is in the Schedule.  If this procedure is to be permitted as a guide for the future, we may in future get a Bill dealing with, for example, our housing legislation in which there will be one or two sections saying that the purpose of section so-and-so is to amend the Housing Act and the amendment will be set out in the Schedule and the Schedule will amend the whole code of housing legislation.  In the ordinary way, we have an opportunity of dealing with such an amending Bill section by section.  With this new device, we may get a one-section Bill with a long schedule, a schedule amending the whole code of previous legislation, and Deputies will be deprived of the rights which they have now to express their views on the separate sections of the amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> Why the House should be committed to approve that kind of procedure merely because the Government have chosen to draw up a schedule in the way this has been drawn is puzzling to me.  All Parties in the House who are concerned with having this Bill thoroughly debated have asked that they should be allowed to discuss the Schedule section by section and in the end get a vote on the entire Schedule and they ought not to be deprived of an opportunity of getting an individual vote on each section of the Schedule, in the same way as they would get that individual vote, if in fact the Schedule were sections of a separate Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, there are two ways of dealing with this matter.  One is the way suggested by the Taoiseach, namely, if it is at all in the power of the Ceann Comhairle, to allow this discussion to take the lines as suggested by the Opposition or. <Col N="183" /> alternatively, that the suggestion of Deputy Mulcahy should seriously be considered by the Taoiseach.  I appreciate that the Ceann Comhairle has, to a great extent, to go by precedent and practice in this House.  However, when the Taoiseach has made it clear in his remarks on two occasions here this morning that the Government are anxious to allow discussion upon all aspects of this Bill, and when we find that the rules of procedure are such that individual Deputies are stymied in their attempts to pick out and have certain aspects of the Schedule dealt with, the trouble in my opinion then lies with the drafting of the measure.</P>
      <P>I have always understood that it was not correct or fair practice in this House to criticise officials or civil servants.  I have always understood that when it came to a question of criticism of that nature the Minister responsible for the Department or the Government &mdash;the political heads&mdash;took responsibility for any blame that could be laid with regard to amendments not being properly drafted, or legislation generally. In this case, I should not like to have it agreed upon or suggested in this House that the fault in connection with this measure could be thrown on the parliamentary draftsman.  I should like it to be clarified by the Taoiseach whether or not that was his intention when he suggested that the members of the Government had no part in the drafting of the Bill and that it was drafted by the parliamentary draftsman. If that is the case then I think the Government and the Taoiseach should at this stage accept Deputy Mulcahy's suggestion, that is, withdraw the Bill and put it again to the parliamentary draftsman so that it can be drafted in a manner which will make it possible for Deputies to discuss the provisions in a satisfactory manner.</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  I have been unable to find anything in Standing Orders which provides that a schedule must be taken as a whole and not section by section as in the Schedule.  I accept the ruling of the Chair that the procedure of the <Col N="184" /> House is that the whole Schedule goes <i>en bloc</i> to the House.  However, I would refer you to paragraph 136 of Standing Orders which provides as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any Standing Order or Orders of the Dáil may be suspended for the day's sitting, and for a particular purpose, upon motion made after notice: Provided that in cases of urgent necessity, of which the Ceann Comhairle shall be the judge, any such Order or Orders may, with the unanimous consent of the Dáil, be suspended upon motion made without notice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I respectfully submit that you have power to accept the motion from the Taoiseach&mdash;that, if there is such Standing Order or precedent that requires the Schedule to be taken <i>en bloc</i>, the Standing Order be waived and the Schedule be taken section by section.  That appears to be the unanimous wish of the House now in view of the fact that the Taoiseach has accepted our view in opposition.  I would ask you, Sir, to accept his motion and to take the Schedule section by section.</P>

I do not think there was blame. I said it was suggested it was a Government trick&mdash;that we had specially gone out of our way to design it so that we might present a difficulty to the Chair.  We did nothing of the kind.  The draftsman drafted it in the usual way and the Chair was dealing with it in the usual way.</P>

      <P>In the countries whose system we know and whose conditions we understand best, it has proved to be satisfactory.  The main purpose is to prevent the multiplication of Parties which brings democracy to disaster ultimately, to try to see that there will be stable Government in this State.  The electors, when they are voting, will take note of that and, <Col N="188" /> instead of bargains being made behind the people's backs, efforts will be made before the election to try to ensure that cases such as Deputy Mulcahy has been suggesting could happen will not happen.  The Parties will know the state of public opinion and will soon find out whether or not they have got the majority vote.</P>
      <P>The whole principle is contained in the fact that you have a single vote by the individual and that in looking at the names of the candidates before him, the voter will decide which one of these, in all the circumstances, it is desirable to have, and you may be perfectly certain that you will not have voting such as that imagined by Deputy Mulcahy.  I do not think we ought to go into this again because, as I have said, the whole principle of the Bill was decided on and passed by the House.</P>

I have asked for a simple clarification as to whether I am right or wrong in saying that, if Section I is passed with the Schedule, and single member constituencies are set up, in a constituency in which 25,000 votes are cast, with 8,000 cast for Fianna Fáil, 6,000 cast for Fine Gael, 4,000 for Labour, 5,000 for Farmers and 2,000 for any other Party the Fianna Fáil candidate with 8,000 votes will be elected.</P>

I think it is of considerable significance that the Taoiseach has not made reference to the experience in South Africa for this reason: that in the 1953 election the United Party got 598,685 votes, 49.6 per cent. of the votes cast, and they got 92 seats.  The Nationalist Party and Labour got 608,166 votes, 50 per cent. of the votes cast, and got 43 seats, and that experience in South Africa has justified the fears which we have experienced.</P>

He should not speak as if he were in the presence of ghosts; there are no ghosts abroad and, if everybody would pipe down a bit, things would sort themselves out.  It was the Taoiseach who, in avoiding the giving of a direct answer to Deputy Mulcahy's question, drew in, for the purpose of avoiding a direct answer, what happened in Canada and what happened in New Zealand and elsewhere. Now, he is an old, shrewd, Machiavellian practitioner and he <Col N="193" /> would not want to go on the records of Dáil Éireann as saying that a person with a minority of votes would get the seat Therefore, he brought in Canada and New Zealand and held them up, without saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or. &ldquo;no&rdquo; in answer to the question put to him.  That drew from Deputy Declan Costello the remark that the Taoiseach was careful to take the cases which suited his own case, and to omit all reference to the cases that did not.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that that discussion is likely to expand very widely, but the important thing is that it should not be terminated on the ground that Deputies have not the right to discuss Section I of this Bill.

      <P>On a point of order, I am sorry to have to interrupt the Taoiseach, but I think the House would not care to see this debate get completely out of hand.  The Chair has ruled that there should not be a debate on Section 1.  That does not prevent Deputies from asking questions with regard to Section 1.  The Taoiseach was asked a question in relation to the section and, in reply to that, he proceeded to make a speech which might be relevant to Part II of the Schedule.  If such a speech is made, it is implicit that a speech of that kind must be replied to by Deputies on this side of the House.  Accordingly, it appears to me that the course adopted by the Taoiseach is leading to a departure from the ruling the Chair has made.</P>

      <P>The Chair has ruled that it is permissible for Deputies to ask questions of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach replied that he was not obliged to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  But the whole authority for this debate is to give the people an opportunity of expressing their views, and the Taoiseach is going to ask them to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  He himself will not say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;. We spent all day yesterday dealing with the Bill to set up the machinery to get the people to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Can the Taoiseach explain his consistency in refusing to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the House, while he looks to the electorate to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I implore you, Sir, to pause before you do what you are doing.  What Standing Order is there which prohibits debate on a section in Committee of the House?  These are desperately grave matters.  The whole individual liberty of our people depends on Parliament functioning. We all know that Parliament is a difficult system to operate, but it will operate only if we all obey the rules. I put it to the Chair that one of the rules is, and I know how difficult it is to administer it in Committee, that the humblest member of the House can speak as often as he likes, provided, firstly, that he is relevant and, secondly, that he does not repeat himself.</P>
      <P>I beg of the Chair not to make the ruling that nobody can speak further in Committee on a section of the Bill because, if that ruling is made, it will become a precedent of the House and an appalling abuse of the parliamentary privileges of Deputies. It shocks me that Deputies do not realise where we are going.  I must say it is a shocking thing that in a matter of this kind, which, after all, is fundamental, we have managed to get ourselves into a procedural dilemma which suggests that the Government are in a state of bewilderment. My fundamental and urgent point is: I admit that repetition must be avoided, but I want to submit that repetition cannot arise in anticipation. The Chair cannot rule that nobody else can speak on Section 1.</P>
      <P>In my submission, any Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party or on the Independent benches is entitled to address a question on Section 1, and nothing in Standing Orders, and no power which anybody has, can stop him.  Might I urge on the Chair not to make such a ruling?  If it is made, it will become a precedent of the House and, in my submission.  Parliament will no longer be Parliament. Does no other Deputy feel the gravity of the matter?</P>

      <P>With reference to the incident which occurred earlier in the debate here today, I wish to make it clear to the House that I did not give any ruling that was intended to curtail in any way discussion of Section I or indeed of any other section of the Bill.  During the course of the debate, I made it clear to Deputies that I was not curtailing debate, nor did I wish them to <Col N="204" /> refrain from referring to Section I in an orderly way.</P>
      <P>When I took over the Chair, I understood that general agreement had been reached to deal with Section 1 formally, and my understanding was reinforced by the knowledge that the Taoiseach had earlier given a big concession regarding the type of debate that would take place on the Schedule.  The concession, however, may have led to misunderstanding, and Deputy Mulcahy may have misunderstood my ruling and my motives in the matter.  This statement is made in order to remove any further doubt in this question.</P>
      <P>I would repeat that there was no question of curtailing debate or of not allowing Deputies to make any statements they wished on Section I, so long as the Chair felt that those statements were made according to the rules of order.</P>
      <P>I may say, a Cheann Comhairle, that I have no wish to have a member penalised if there has been a genuine misunderstanding in the matter.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I wish to make it clear that the objection from this side of the House to the ruling of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was not in reference to curtailment of debate but in reference to his having put the section to the House and having announced he was not going to allow any further discussion.  I gather now from what the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has said, that there was a misunderstanding about that in his mind.  We therefore accept that explanation and hope that no further trouble will arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the statement made by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I was present in the House when the incident took place.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle said that he was going to put the section.  He put the section and called for an oral vote and had declared the section carried and then agreed that there would be a division on it.  I take it now that that process has been reversed, that the right of Deputies to discuss Section I is now reopened and that the limitations <Col N="205" /> imposed by the premature closing of the discussion will be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we shall get ourselves into a further muddle if we are not careful.  My understanding was that the Schedule would be discussed and dealt with, clause by clause, as if the clauses were sections of the Bill.  I understood also that the Chair did not want to have repetition.  It seems to me that the only way that could be done is by postponing the decision on Sections 1 and 2 until the Schedule has been dealt with, if that can be done.  If we deal with the Schedule and then have a discussion on Sections 1 and 2, it seems to me that that discussion will mean going over the principle of the Bill again. When the matter will have been dealt with, if it is permitted to be dealt with in the way I suggest, it would be repetition to deal with it again on Section 1 of the Bill.  Consequently, it seems to me that the proper way of handling this, from the point of view of order, is to deal with the Schedule first, without coming to final decisions with regard to Sections 1 and 2; and when we come to Sections 1 and 2 it will be understood, as it has often been understood in regard to other matters in this House, that when a matter has been fully discussed it is merely a formal question when it comes to the section and a division is taken upon it.</P>

    <P>Section 4, sub-section (1), proposes to give to the commission power to determine and revise the boundaries of the constituencies.  In other words, as I understand it, it is intended by this proposed amendment of the Constitution that the only body that will have the right to decide on the size of the constituencies is this proposed commission.  As the Constitution stands at present, it would be possible to arrange the constituencies in such a way that this House could consist of a minimum number of 96 Deputies and a maximum of 144.  In the first place, I feel that far too wide discretion is being given to this commission. Secondly, I feel the maximum number of 144 Deputies, which we have tended to keep since the State was established, is far too great in present circumstances. I believe there is a general feeling throughout the country that the representation in the House should be reduced to a more sensible and realistic number.</P>
    <P>Various reasons are put forward for this opinion.  One, which I do not support very strongly, is on the grounds of economy.  The argument is that, if we had fewer Deputies, the taxpayer would be saved a substantial amount of money.  It is true there would be a saving to the taxpayer if the allowances of Deputies were to remain at the same figure; but, having regard to the general overall cost of running the country, I do not think the cost of Deputies, as such, can be regarded as very high.  There is another body of <Col N="209" /> opinion which believes that, for the amount of service and time they give to their constituents.  Deputies are not overpaid.  I do not hold very strongly with that argument.  There is a further point of view that a smaller Dáil would be a more efficient Dáil and I agree with that.</P>
    <P>I have had only short experience of Leinster House, but I do not think I am casting aspersions on any side when I say that the average attendance at Dáil debates is, to say the least of it, disappointingly small.  Possibly, there may be a good reason for that&mdash;that Deputies are about their constituents' business.  But as I understand it, the primary purpose of a Deputy is to legislate, and legislation is, or should be, enacted in this House.  The first duty of a Deputy is to represent his constituents here and contribute to the discussion of the various Bills, or other Government business, that come up for debate here.  If we had a smaller House, I think we would have, from that point of view, a better and more efficient House and probably a better attended House.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the belief that a smaller number of Deputies would lead to a higher standard of representation. That may or may not be true, but it is an argument that has been advanced, and I think there are certain grounds for the argument.  It is interesting in relation to other countries &mdash;in putting this forward, I appreciate that comparisons are not always effective arguments&mdash;to compare the representation in other countries with our representation.  If we take the larger countries,' our representation looks almost ridiculous; but obviously there is a minimum number below which one cannot go and to hold that-we should be represented on the same percentage basis or the same ratio as the United States of America or Great Britain is to reduce Dáil representation to an absurd figure.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain, with a population of some 50,000,000 people, the 600 odd Members of Parliament each represent roughly 80,000 of the population.  The United States of America, which has a population of some 170,000,000, has 436 Members in the House of Representatives, <Col N="210" /> or roughly one member for every 400,000 of the population.  In Metropolitan France, there is roughly one Member in the Chamber of Deputies for every 120,000 of the population. We then come to the smaller countries comparable with our own. Holland has 225 Members in its Lower House, or roughly one to over 48,000 of the population.  In the case of Belgium, there is one representative for every 42,000.</P>
    <P>In smaller countries still, the comparison is even more interesting. Finland, which has only one Chamber, has 200 representatives for a population of 4.3 million, giving a ratio of approximately one to every 21,000 of the population.  In Denmark, which has only one House and a population of roughly 4,500,000, there are 179 representatives, giving a ratio of roughly one to every 25,000 of the population.  Finally, in Dáil Éireann, with 147 Deputies, the ratio is a little over one to every 19,000 voters.</P>
    <P>There is the strongest case for reducing the maximum number of Deputies and I suggest in my amendment that we should dispose of the minimum and maximum number and fix a maximum number only.  The suggestion has been made that the present arrangement will allow the commission to vary the size of the constituencies so as to allow for greater representation in the rural areas and possibly lower representation in urban centres like Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  If my amendment is adopted, it will still leave the commission free, if they so desire, to give bigger representation to the rural areas, but it will definitely limit them to drawing the boundaries in such a way that this House cannot consist of more than 115 members on the basis of the last census of population taken in 1956.  The present time offers a suitable opportunity to limit the size of this House.  If we fail to avail of the opportunity now, it may not easily offer itself again.  Even if there were no question of the abolition of P.R., constituencies would have had to be revised before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate this morning, Deputy Mulcahy, I think, <Col N="211" /> gave the example of 25,000 people voting in a constituency.  I did not want to interrupt the debate for various reasons this morning, but, according to the Constitution, one could not possibly have 25,000 people voting in any constituency where the maximum number is 30,000 and assuming that some 60 per cent. would be over the age of 21.  In order to get away from the argument that a large number of people will be disfranchised if the maximum number is limited to 25,000, of whom 10,000 to 12,000 would be voters, that would give an opportunity to an Independent or to the member of a small Party to secure election.</P>
    <P>I believe my amendment is a reasonable one and the proposed alteration could be incorporated in the Bill.  I am prepared to accept any alternative suggestion the Taoiseach may have along the lines I have suggested.  My idea, quite frankly, is to reduce the number of Deputies, because I believe, and so do many others, that we are over-represented at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands the position.  It is not the commission that is to determine the number of Deputies.  That is to be determined by law, and the Commission will have to work within the limits fixed by law.  What we are doing is, indirectly, fixing a maximum and a minimum.  Taking our population at round about 3,000,000 people, the proposal in the Bill would give a range from 150 members down, roughly, to 100 members.  The question is, is it desirable to leave that latitude for the Legislature to determine what the exact number should be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been, of course, time after time, suggestions that the number in the House should be reduced. Those who suggest that have done so, mainly, I think, on economic grounds, but the Deputy does not seem to want to base his proposal on economic grounds.  On whatever grounds you may base your argument for a reduction, you have always to <Col N="212" /> bear in mind that you have to get a Government from the House and, if you divide the House into two parts, assuming that there would be two groups.  Government and Opposition, and that they are approximately equal, then, out of half the total number you have to get a Government and Parliamentary Secretaries.  It would be undesirable to have the number of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries too high a proportion of the side of the House that would support them.  Therefore, we have to take a number of considerations into account when we are determining that matter, but we are not at the moment determining but simply leaving limits.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's intention appears to be to narrow the limits and to lower the maximum.  In my rough calculation of the population at 3,000,000, the maximum under his proposal would be 120.  Is that not right?  He wants to limit the number of members to 120.  I do not think we should do that in this Bill.  That would be a matter, undoubtedly, for consideration when the question comes up as to what would be the number of constituencies in the country and, therefore, what would be the number of members.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Deputy to leave the possibilities between the number 100 and 150 open.  My own view would be that, when the Dáil would come to consider that question, you would bear in mind the various things that have to be borne in mind and you would try to limit it to the smallest number that you think would be effective.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has very properly pointed out that there would be no point in taking proportions, that our numbers here should be reduced to the number we would have if we had the same proportions as they have in Britain or the United States of America or elsewhere.  Obviously, you want to have a sufficiently large number in an Assembly like this to make it representative and to enable it to do the national work properly. One consideration, undoubtedly, that <Col N="213" /> has to be borne in mind is the necessity to get, let us say 12&mdash;take that number as a rough number&mdash;at least 12 Ministers and a few Parliamentary Secretaries out of one-half of the House.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Deputy, therefore, not to press this amendment.  It is not the commission that will decide the number of members, but the Legislature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Russell's amendment.  I think it is reasonable.  In reply to the Taoiseach's remarks on the amendment, I would point out that we are the most over-representative parliamentary democracy of the known democracies to-day and, in our limited circumstances, I cannot see why there should not be a very considerable reduction in the numbers attending this House.</P>
      <P>First of all, there is the question of economy, which Deputy Russell has mentioned.  That is important. But, what is more important, is the lack of confidence the people have in this House.  That lack of confidence arises from the over-representation here and the fact that Deputies, because of the numbers attending here, can take their duties rather casually.</P>
      <P>Again, a Deputy's main function is to take part in the debates on whatever legislation is going through the House but the greater part of a Deputy's time, when he comes to Dublin from the provinces, is taken up doing things that are necessary for his constituents but which he should not be asked to do.</P>
      <P>This is an opportune time to discuss this matter and to try to get the Taoiseach and his Ministers to encourage a direct approach between the people and the Departments of State so that a Deputy will not be asked to do the errands that he has to do every day that he attends here and which preclude him from attending full-time in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first impressions of this Parliament were very disappointing because of the very sparse attendance from <Col N="214" /> hour to hour.  The average hourly attendance of Deputies here is startlingly low.  I am as guilty as anybody else.  I admit that readily.  That is because a Deputy's time is broken up and taken up with matters outside his real functions as a Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell's amendment, if accepted, would reduce the number of Deputies to about 115.  The Taoiseach says that the number of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries very considerably reduces the number of the rank and file.  With a House of 115, allowing for 15 or 16 Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries there is still a big number of Deputies available to take part in debates or to be back-benchers.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that this matter has to be discussed on a Bill of this kind. Paragraph 3º of Section 2 of Part II of the Bill says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The number of constituencies shall be determined from time to time by law&rdquo;...</P>
    <P>These words alone are sufficient for the Constitution.  Since the number of constituencies shall be determined from time to time by law, it would be the function of the House, then, to go into this matter occasionally outside the Constitution altogether and to decide what the number of constituencies will be.  That would be the more businesslike way.  Once the fact is inscribed in the Constitution, that they should be determined from time to time by law, that should be sufficient and it would be more in keeping with common practice and practical measures and realism if all the other words were deleted and those words remained so that this House could take up the question of the revision of constituencies at any time.  That would be the sensible thing.</P>
    <P>I do not see the sense in having the rest of this section enshrined in the Constitution.  There may be many other views, but at all events we are very limited in our circumstances here. It is now common knowledge that the expenditure on administration in this country is abnormally high.  If we <Col N="215" /> are ever to make any impact on that high proportion of expenditure, I think we would strike a very effective blow by starting with this House itself. I should not like to see any Deputy lose his seat in this House.  Many will certainly lose their seats if this Bill becomes law and we go back to the single seat constituency.  It is an opportune time now, as Deputy Russell says, to make this reduction because it will be less hurtful now perhaps than at a later period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must disagree entirely with this amendment. I think the Taoiseach was perfectly right in what he said concerning the numbers in the House.  I, in company with every Deputy, have read from time to time in the papers and I have heard it said that 147 Deputies compared very unfavourably with the numbers in the American Congress. I have forgotten the numbers in the American Congress, but at any rate, on the basis of a percentage per head of the population, they represent far more people per head than we do.</P>
      <P>When we are considering a Parliament, we must realise that there is an irreducible number of members who can carry on the functions of Government and the functions of the Opposition. You must have on the Government side Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.  On the Opposition side, in the various Parties, you must have Front Bench members who have the time and the skill to carry out that work.</P>
      <P>It is very onerous work on both sides of the House.  It is not easy to find good Ministers for a Government. It is not easy to find good Front Bench members of the Opposition Parties.  If you cut down the number of Deputies sitting in this House, you will run the risk&mdash;a very grave risk, in my opinion &mdash;of making the Parliament a very inefficient instrument for carrying out the wishes of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which every Opposition has been up against is that there are various committees which, by <Col N="216" /> tradition and so on, have sometimes as their chairmen members of the Opposition.  Also by tradition, a certain proportion of those committees are Opposition members.  If you cut down representation of the House, in the case of the Opposition, if it is a small Opposition you may make it impossible adequately to man those various posts and the whole question of democracy will be imperilled.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that there seem to be too many Deputies in the House and that that costs a certain amount of money.  It does, of course, but the whole establishment here must be kept up.  No matter what number of Deputies you have in the House, the building must be maintained and so on.  You would have a great number of overhead costs which would not be reduced, if you reduce the number of Deputies.  By doing so, you would very gravely imperil democratic institutions and parliamentary life in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to agree entirely with Deputy Dockrell and to express my agreement with the Taoiseach.  I feel it would be entirely wrong and not in the best interests of the country in general to reduce the number of members of Dáil Éireann, to restrict or cut down in any way. Deputy Manley referred to the fact that there was a certain loss of respect for Deputies in the country.  A Deputy leads a very strenuous and difficult life. Most of us in this House have been cut out for that life and, according to the old saying, the back is made for the burden.  I feel that if there has been a certain loss of respect in the country for Deputies, it has been brought about by ourselves and particularly by Governments.  We place such a low valuation on ourselves that we cannot expect the people to have respect for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether P.R. is abolished or not, I hope that whatever Government is in office will focus special attention on the activities and the duties of the members of this House, particularly with reference to the allowances paid to members of the House, in view of the fact that the chief rat-catcher for the Dublin Corporation is probably <Col N="217" /> better paid than a member of this House and any builder's labourer in the City of Dublin, or even a casual builder's labourer down the country, can earn more in a week than any member of this House receives.  I do not see how the general public can have respect for us because of the low valuation we place on ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach realises that to be a member of Dáil Éireann one must be a person of independent standing or should be a person of independent standing.  Yet I venture to say that the right type of person will not be available to stand for Parliament in the years to come.  The reason the right type of person will not be had to stand for Parliament is that the people who would be interested and who would like to offer themselves for Parliament are not able to afford it.  There will be a return to the days when only the well-to-do classes and those who can afford to come up here for two or three days a week on their own incomes can sit in Parliament, take part in the debates, read in the library and answer correspondence, if they think fit to do so.  Being people of independent means, they will not care whether they will answer their correspondence or give service or not.</P>
    <P>I think we are heading in this Parliament for a very dangerous time. Within the next ten or 15 years, I venture to say that the lifetime of most of us in the public life of this country will have ended.  We will not be replaced by the same energetic type of Deputies as we now have on all sides of this House.  I am afraid that the Government in office now, the Governments of the past and those of the future must accept responsibility for that.</P>
    <P>There are many Deputies to-day who are here at great financial loss to themselves.  There are Deputies to-day who are in debt and who are in this House at this very moment on borrowed money.  There are Deputies who are giving service to their constituents and the people at great financial loss to their own families and with loss to their business.  They are losing business connections.  I think that is wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> Now that there is a stocktaking of the Constitution with reference to the election and the establishment of Dáil Éireann, I hope that the Government will take some steps to make the member of Dáil Éireann an independent individual.  Whatever his allowance is to be, it should be a decent, substantial allowance, so that he will not have to come here at a financial loss to himself, and at the risk of ruining his own business by having to leave it to come here, with the result that when that happens, or the electors get tired of him, he has neither his business nor this House to look after.  That is why so many ex-Deputies have died in workhouses.  That cannot be denied&mdash; the records of the House are here. Collections had to be made for their wives and families and I subscribed to them.</P>

      <P>The Government should see to it that whatever number of members are elected, they will be independent and that a decent, substantial allowance will be given, because I am very sorry to say that whereas the duties of Deputies are primarily to deal with legislation and the making of laws, a system has now grown up where the Deputy is a pennyboy for the people, a twopence-half-penny &ldquo;lap-trap&rdquo; to give people lifts to Dublin, to answer correspondence, and to be at the beck and call of every Tom, Dick and Harry in his constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know quite well that no member of the House of Commons would be asked to do the things we are asked to do.  We are here to legislate and to pass laws for our people and not to be penny-boys for them.  I am afraid that Governments, and particularly the present Government, must take the entire responsibility for the atmosphere that has grown up with regard to Deputies since 1932, because they have given rise to a feeling in the electorate that people <Col N="219" /> cannot get what they are entitled to under the laws of this land, unless they use the influence of a Deputy. That is entirely wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask, then, when this is receiving further consideration by the Government, that these matters be borne in mind. It would be wrong and dangerous to limit the numbers of members in this House because the only manner in which the views of the people can be expressed is through their elected representatives.  It would be entirely wrong and not in the best interests of any democratic institution that members of Parliament should be tied down to any particular number.  It should vary in accordance with the population.  If the numbers are reduced, the ordinary people are deprived of the only means they have of expressing their views, that is through their elected representatives.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the amendment. In my opinion, it is not in the best interests of the country.  The whole Bill is not in the best interests of the country, but nevertheless I hope no steps will be taken by the Government to implement the terms of Deputy Russell's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one factor which should be borne in mind in examining the points that have arisen on Deputy Russell's amendment. There is no doubt that he is reflecting a certain volume of opinion in the country, but as he pointed out himself in fact, most of that opinion was advanced on economic grounds and, on examination, there is not much substance to be found in that contention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that this is still an infant State.  We have not got the traditions, the long period of government, which those other nations have whose representatives are fewer in number in their Parliaments in proportion <Col N="220" /> to population than ours.  After all, it is only a little over a quarter of a century since the first Government in this State had to start, without any precedents whatever, with no existing laws, to build up the whole administrative machinery of the State from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is only natural after a period such as that from which we are only now emerging that the country should call upon a greater number of its population so as to find within that number the type of representative who can come into Parliament and do the work which is so essential so that the backlog in the framing of legislation, the amending of legislation and the administration of the laws can be dealt with.  Consequently if we had as those other countries like Denmark, Holland and others had a long period of calm atmosphere in which to build up the whole structure of legislation, then there would be something in Deputy Russell's amendment.</P>
    <P>It is true, as other Deputies have said, that the members of this House are now, and have been for years, frustrated by the fact that so many people regard them as their private secretaries, that they are obliged to do these people's errands when they come to Dublin which these people could do themselves.  Who is to blame for that?  Are we not ourselves to blame, because in three out of four cases, is it not a fact that a person who applies for a grant or seeks assistance is entitled to it by right but the practice has grown up of members of this House implying to the people that unless they go to a Deputy, and unless the Deputy goes to a Department, they will not get it, and when they get it, the Deputy claims that it was he who got it?</P>
    <P>That has grown up and that is why you have the situation to-day in which the Deputy who makes his name in a constituency is not the man who sits in these benches and applies himself to the business before the House, but the Deputy who slips out the word that somebody is to get a grant.  He is the man who builds up the reputation. If we are not progressing here <Col N="221" /> as legislators, that is contributing to it.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to that fact. May I also refer to another?  Not only is a Deputy expected to do that type of work as well as giving his attention and consideration to the various Bills introduced here, but he is also expected to be a member of a local authority.  Is that not a reflection on the public life of this country, that so few are obliged to carry so much and that more are not prepared to attend to local politics?  Is it not an awful load to place on the shoulders of any member of the Dáil? He is required to do all this trotting to Departments, plus attending to his primary duty, which is giving attention and devoting himself to the work of this House, and as well, he is expected to be a member of a county council, corporation or urban council.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, when we are examining this question, it is true that if the members of this House were permitted to devote their entire attention to the important work which is done here, which we are not permitted to do at the moment, we could possibly carry on with some slight reduction in the membership.  I would agree with the amendment if that state of affairs existed, but in present circumstances I think it is desirable that we should permit that elasticity as between 20,000 and 30,000.</P>
    <P>I quite sympathise with the Taoiseach in his contention that having to draw upon the membership of the House to fill the various Ministries and Parliamentary Secretaryships, one could come up against a situation in which it would be difficult to find the personnel to fill such Cabinet posts.  After all, it is not long since the Taoiseach, with the greatest membership any Party ever secured in this House, had to go outside the House in order to secure a member for his Cabinet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether any agreement has yet been made or is contemplated with any external group in reference to the exploration for or development of oil resources; and, if so, whether he will give details thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to a similar question on the 4th December last.  I expect that the formal agreement to which I referred on that occasion will be executed very soon. On the execution of the agreement I will publish a summary of its main provisions and I will present copies of it to both Houses on the occasion of the introduction of a Bill amending the legislation relating to mineral development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negotiations which have led to the agreement were commenced in November, 1957.  At that time, while I had before me a number of proposals from external interests for the carrying out of a comprehensive programme of exploration for oil in Ireland, no similar proposals for a comprehensive programme had been submitted by any Irish interests.  In the absence of proposals from an Irish group I considered the proposals which had been put forward by external interests which had the necessary financial resources and technical capacity to undertake a comprehensive scheme of oil exploration. In accordance with the requirements of the group with whom negotiations were initiated I undertook not to grant prospecting facilities to <Col N="229" /> any other party during the currency of the negotiations and of any resultant agreement.  As a comprehensive Statewide investigation was desired such an undertaking was clearly required for the achievement of this purpose.</P>
    <P>I think I should point out that the fact that negotiations were in progress with this group was public knowledge, by reason of frequent Press reports, and the reply to the Dáil question to which I have referred disclosed that the negotiations had been successfully concluded and that an agreement was about to be signed.  An application has since been received from an Irish resident to prospect for petroleum over a limited area.  I believe, however, that there will be general concurrence in my view that it would be in the national interest to avail of the opportunity which has now presented itself of having a comprehensive investigation carried out on the basis of the agreement which has been negotiated for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, before questions, I was dealing with the Taoiseach's intervention, where he pointed out the factor of having to draw upon the membership of this House for personnel to fill Cabinet, Ministerial and Parliamentary Secretaryship rank.  Those critics who feel that the House is over-represented, of course, also contend that there are <Col N="243" /> too many Ministries.  The answer to that point would be that it would be possible to combine certain junior Ministries and so meet that contingency.</P>
      <P>That, to my mind, has a lot to commend it, but another point I would wish to make is, as I said already, the State being still in its formative years we have to experiment somewhat with the personnel of this House, in order to find the persons best fitted to lead the various Departments of State. Even the public are inclined to experiment and it is another argument in favour of postponing any decision to reduce the membership when one recalls that even at the last general election one-third of the outgoing House failed to secure re-election.  Consequently, if we are to have experienced legislators in this House, in order to give time to its newcomers to learn more about the administration of the House, it would be well worth while to maintain the present numerical strength at least for another decade. It would be well then if we did maintain the membership at least for another decade.</P>
      <P>Comparisons have been made with smaller countries having a very heavy density of population.  They can, of course, afford to have more members in proportion to population than can our country which, unfortunately, is not as populous as it was 100 years ago.  We must bear the geographical point in mind, as it has been borne in mind even in Britain where they have a very dense population and where they have a representative on their commission who is an authority on the geographical set-up in that country.</P>
      <P>Consequently, it is vital that we should have taken into account not alone the factor of population in deciding the outlines of constituencies and the membership of the House, but also that we should bear in mind that in rural constituencies Deputies are called upon to do a great deal of travelling in order to maintain that contact with the electorate which is desirable, if they are to reflect public opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of economy has been mentioned and Deputy Flanagan has <Col N="244" /> made a point in regard to the impact on Deputies from the point of view of expenses and the difficulties they have to contend with.  Those people who are critical of the allowances which Deputies receive pay no cognisance to the fact that in other countries members of Parliament are assisted in many ways which we here cannot afford.  Yet no credit is given to us for that fact.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by referring again to a point mentioned by Deputy Russell, and every other Deputy who has spoken since, in relation to the demands on Deputies by their constituents to maintain frequent contact with various branches of the Departments about matters which, in very many instances, are completely unnecessary. How often do we find, when we go to a Department, say, in relation to a grant for the reconstruction of a house, that the person has even neglected to inform the Department that the work has been completed? It should not be left to Deputies to do that kind of work.  How can it be possible for a Deputy to devote attention to proposed legislation and listen to and participate in debates, if, at the same time, he realises that the man who is representing the constituency with him, having no interest in the legislation, is visiting the Departments for his constituents? The following week when he returns to his constituency, he will be told that he is the man who is most active.  Worse still, is the man who attends periodically and the person who gives more attention at local authority level.  He is a better representative in many parts of the country than the man who specialises in the work of this House.</P>
    <P>These are the defects which exist at the moment, but they have been caused in no small measure by the fact that for a long period the public have been misled into the belief that they have not got rights unless they go to some Deputy to secure what is a right for them.  If Deputies are overloaded with that type of work to-day they have brought it on to their own shoulders.  In our present situation, it is desirable to <Col N="245" /> maintain our present membership, but I do not think that in the years to come such membership would be desirable. A time at which we are emerging from a formative period of our history is not the time to reduce the numbers in the House.  You might be affected in the personnel available to fill Cabinet rank and the attendance in the House and attention to legislation.  There is also the very important point mentioned by Deputy Dockrell in regard to getting the best type of Deputy to sit on the various committees of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Russell for drawing my attention to my figures.  I am encouraged to realise that my figures made an impression on him because we will be returning to figures of that kind in their proper proportion when we come to deal with the article as a whole.  It only shows how little I have been prepared to receive the idea of the reduced size of the constituency which Deputy Russell contemplates and which he upholds in his general support of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would ask him to realise that, as Deputy Manley said, in the first place, this is not the time to deal with a question of this particular kind.  I would ask him to appreciate the remarks that Deputy O'Sullivan made on this matter, because a time when you are proposing to take from the people the chance of a fairly reasonably wide selection of Deputies, and forcing the person who is anxious to be a member of this House on the one hand, or the person who is anxious to have a say in the membership of this House on the other, to belong to and support one of two monolithic political groups, a time when it is proposed to do that by law, contrary to the whole spirit of our people, and the spirit of our country, is no time for saying that as well as restricting their choice, we will create further difficulties with regard to representation by reducing the numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been very definitely and pointedly underlined by both Deputy Manley and Deputy O'Sullivan what the objections are in relation to tampering with numbers.  So far as the <Col N="246" /> terms of the amendment are concerned, it deals with the question of the acceptance of the one-member constituency. I suggest to the Deputy that in asking us to accept the one-member constituency, he should not ask us to accept a reduction of the numbers and a restriction of the people's choice as well, and that whatever interest he has in the general question of the numbers of members in this House, it should be left to a more suitable occasion for discussion.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the House that any suggestion I might make, or any amendment I might propose, is certainly not designed to imperil the democratic foundation of this State, as suggested by Deputy Dockrell.  I think we could usefully reduce the numbers of this House by at least 25 to 30 Deputies and at the same time secure our democratic foundations, provide an adequate and competent House and provide for sufficient Ministers.  I think we have too many Ministers at present.  As the Taoiseach has pointed out, an opportunity for discussing this question will be given, I presume, when the Minister for Local Government introduces the necessary legislation to decide what in fact will be the number of constituencies and I am quite prepared to wait until then to put forward my views in regard to the question of maximum representation in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section in the Schedule which proposes in two of its paragraphs to effect, if accepted by the people, a fundamental change in the electoral system we have known in this country for the past 36 years.  It is proposed in this section to abolish <Col N="247" /> the system of proportional representation as we know it and to abolish the multiple-member constituencies which are implicit in P.R., and instead of that system, which is purely Irish in its tradition, which is pertinent in every respect to our traditions and outlook over the past 36 years, it is proposed to introduce a system which is purely English in its tradition, historical association and its outlook.</P>
      <P>We are asked in this section to undo the things done by successive leaders of Governments here in the past 36 years and in place of the system of P.R., to adopt a system which is current in England.  Politics certainly make strange bed-fellows.  It is pertinent, perhaps significant, that the Taoiseach is now doing what Craigavon did in the North some 25 years ago and doing it, I suggest, for precisely the same reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the House realise that, in 1922, Ireland, north and south, east and west, elected its public representatives under the system of P.R. freely adopted by our people?  From 1922 on, the Parliament in the South of Ireland and the Parliament in the North also were to be elected by P.R. P.R. was scarcely tried in the North: a few years sufficed to convince the Unionist Party that it just would not do and steps were taken in the middle Twenties in the North to abolish P.R. and to adopt instead the British system.  One of the first people to object to that was the Taoiseach and he was joined by every other leader of public opinion in the South. We said to the North&mdash;I think with sincerity, certainly with vehemence&mdash; that the abolition of P.R. there was an effort to establish dictatorship in that part of our country by a political junta.  How well the charge has been proved in the years that have elapsed! The same political Party has remained in office in Stormont for the past 36 years, immutable, unchangeable, a fixture in the northern landscape.  Do we say that kind of immutability is desirable?  Are we now to eat bitter bread here and slavishly follow the <Col N="248" /> example set for us by the northern leader a quarter of a century ago?</P>
    <P>It has been said that this proposed change is in the interests of stability. I wonder when people use words like that, whether they realise what they say or attach any particular meaning to such words.  Is stability to signify no change in Government or should it mean stability in the institutions of the State itself?  There has been no change of Government in the North in the past 36 years, but I do not think we would regard the set-up in the North or the Government experience which they have had as being good.  The change in the North has had the effect of enshrining in Government offices there the same Party, the same men, the same outlook and the same leaders.  Were it not for other matters behind the Unionist Party, that kind of regimented rule would long since have led to disruption.  Down here, if we are to have, with this change, the entrenchment of a political Party and the banishing from this House of legitimate political movements, then I fear that disruption will very quickly follow.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has talked about stability.  Even using that term in the same way as he does, let us remember that over 36 years here in the South, we have had only three Prime Ministers, Mr. W.T. Cosgrave, the present Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition.  There is an experience of stability, if you like, in the Taoiseach's terminology, which certainly must make us the envy of other countries, notably Britain, where in the same period&mdash;I forget the exact figure&mdash;I think they have had some seven different leaders of Government. In fact, over the past 36 years P.R. has stood the test and has proved its worth, so far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>This proposal in this section of the Schedule is, in my view, a very dangerous one.  We can understand that all of us may have differences in opinion or in views as to what is best for the country.  That is understandable and legitimate in any democracy.  No matter what differences we may have had in the past in this country, there <Col N="249" /> was surely one thing that we all appeared to be agreed upon&mdash;that P.R. was the best system of election for this country.  It was put in the 1922 Constitution freely by the Irish Constituent Assembly sitting to enact that Constitution.  In 1937 it was put by the present Taoiseach into the present Constitution and proposed by him to the people and enacted by the people. Accordingly, in so far as that particular system was concerned, up to last August or September all sides of this House and all shades of political opinion were agreed that this was the best system for this country.</P>
    <P>The first indication of a change came with the inspired leak in the Press last August, followed by the Taoiseach's Press interview.  Many of us thought that that was just a bit of midsummer madness induced by the lack of sun at the time.  But there it was, the first indication that any political personality here had very serious views challenging the system of P.R.  Now, the Taoiseach was entitled to change his mind.  It is one of the rights of all of us to do that and it is a right that the Taoiseach has frequently exercised. He was entitled to change his mind, and he was entitled to say that in 1937 he made a mistake and that he made a mistake in 1925 when he protested against the Unionists taking this step.  I wonder can he be so certain now, when he proposes to the people in this Bill not only to remove P.R. from the Constitution but to put in its place the English system of election.</P>
    <P>Could he not have salved his changed conscience by merely removing P.R. from the Constitution and leaving it to the Oireachtas, as representing the people, to define the manner in which its membership should be elected and to change its mind from time to time?  Why should the Taoiseach, having proven that he wobbles on this issue, having demonstrated that he has held different views, suggest now that out of the Constitution should come P.R. and in its place should be put this English system?</P>
    <P>Let us see what is involved in this. If this referendum is accepted by the <Col N="250" /> people and if the British system is written into our Constitution, it will never be changed again, no matter how it works&mdash;and we do not know how it will work.  No matter what the experience may be in the future, no Government elected on the single member constituency, on the English system, will change from that to P.R.  Therefore, let us see what is involved in the Taoiseach's proposal, the proposal of a man who has had two views on this, a man who for all his political life up to this has fought and stood for P.R.  That man is proposing now that, instead of the present system, we should enshrine something that he regarded as hateful up to this. I think that is going too far and that, as the Leader of the Opposition already described it, it is asking the people to take a leap in the dark.  We have no means of knowing how the British system would work here.  We have had experience of P.R., but no means of knowing how the alternative might work.</P>
    <P>We could have understood the Taoiseach saying that it was a mistake in 1937 and in 1922 to fetter and tie our hands in relation to our electoral system; and if he merely suggested removing fetters, taking P.R. out of the Constitution and letting the people, by the manner in which they elect a Government decide through the legislation passed by the Dáil the manner in which the electoral laws should be framed, that would have been an understandable case to make.  Instead of that, we are asked to enshrine something in the Constitution about which we know nothing.  We are asked to do so while we on this side of the House have the gravest misgivings with regard to the possible results.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance or the Tánaiste or others who have said soft words about this proposal, to assure us that they intend others no harm.  That is just not good enough. We know that this change, since it is proposed by the Leader of a political Party, must be intended by him to benefit his political Party.  We know <Col N="251" /> well that if this proposed change had operated in the last election or the previous election or recent elections, this Dáil would be composed now almost entirely of Fianna Fáil Deputies.  We know that no one can control the future and we know well that future contests have yet to be decided.  If the last election ur previous elections were fought on this system, here in this Dáil, those looking down from the gallery would think they were at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The misgiving we have in relation to a system which could produce that kind of result is the effect it may have on the country itself and on the people outside.  This is Ireland, with all its faults, all its weaknesses and all its magic.  It is not England or America or France or anywhere else. We have no large concentrated centres of population.  There are very few areas in the country that historically stand for any political side of the House.  Generally, what the people are thinking in Donegal they are also thinking in Cork and if the political wind is blowing in a particular way in Dublin it is also blowing in the same direction across in the West.  Accordingly, under the British system, a win by a political Party in this country is likely to be a clean sweep everywhere.  Now, that does not happen in England, because British history, British geographical features and distribution of population ensure otherwise.</P>
    <P>Ever since the days of the Wars of the Roses in England there have been clearly defined areas where the Whig and the Liberal&mdash;now the Labour&mdash; outlooks are enshrined.  The same remarks can apply to well defined Tory &mdash;now Conservative&mdash;areas in Britain. The result is that in British general elections, although a strong tide may be flowing in favour of the Labour or Conservative Parties, the defeated Party has a minimum representation of some 150 members in Parliament. It is because of that peculiarly British circumstance that this kind of system <Col N="252" /> grew up in Britain.  It is English, dyed in the wool, red, white and blue, nothing else.  We are asked to mix the colours and run the green, white and gold into the red, white and blue. It cannot be done.  To apply it to this country may set a spark to a fuse, and the explosion may harm more than the Taoiseach's political opponents.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach, even at this eleventh hour, not to go ahead with this final step, to have second thoughts about it, to realise that if this Dáil were ever composed of some 90 per cent. of one politcial Party, outside the Dáil there would be an angry tumult, growing gradually. Decent minded people, representing decent sections of opinion, who are denied admittance into Dáil Éireann, people whom we should encourage to regard this House as the centre of their political existence, decent movements of this kind denied admittance into the Dáil, will be driven underground to the detriment of the nation.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to the trade union movement, represented in this House to a large extent by the Irish Labour Party.  The Irish Labour Party was in this House before Fianna Fáil.  It played its part in the formation of this State and was at one time the constitutional Opposition here, helping in dangerous days to build this Dáil and the institutions of this State. The Irish Labour Party have had their leaders in the past speaking on behalf of the workers of Ireland.  There is no need to mention great names, but the names of their leaders are enshrined in the reports of this House&mdash;leaders fighting here the fight they believed in and the cause they worked for.</P>
    <P>I want the Taoiseach to consider what the position might have been in the formative years of the '20s if we had a system which banged the gates of Leinster House on &ldquo;Big Jim&rdquo; Larkin and all the other fine leaders of the Irish Labour Party.  If they had been denied admission here and forced by our electoral laws to disregard the Irish Parliament, does the Taoiseach believe that this House would now be accepted as it is by those who at that <Col N="253" /> time were arrayed against it?  What could have happened then can happen in the future if this disastrous step is taken.  If now, some 36 years later, at the instance of a man who admits he was wrong in the past, at the instance of a man who produces this as his own idea, the country were to adopt a system known only elsewhere, the effect of which might be to deny adequate representation to legitimate political movements in this country, then I feel our own institutions would very rapidly be endangered.</P>
    <P>Political stability does not merely mean a saneness in Government.  Political stability means, as Edmund Burke defined it once, change in continuity and continuity in change, the Deputies over there taking their place in due course on this side of the House and the Deputies here going over there&mdash; orderly change, fashioned in accordance with the wishes of the electorate, but the same institutions and organs of the State continue.  That is proper political stability and that is the kind of stability we have had in the last 36 years.  If an electoral system is so designed to produce the same team, the same Government, the same political oligarchy in charge, then disruption and explosion will occur.  I would suggest to the Taoiseach in the interests of the country that, if he does not have any regard to the past 36 years, let him think of the future.  This Dáil must continue and those who serve it must continue to work for it.  The Taoiseach should have regard to the years that lie ahead.  I would urge him now not to take a step which is potentially disastrous for the people of this country.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy O'Higgins thinks he is going to make every Deputy who supports this amendment of the Constitution run away and hide his head simply because the Deputy elects to describe it as the English system.  The British people have many good things.  A number of them have roofs over their heads.  I do not think we should refuse to put roofs on our houses simply <Col N="254" /> because the British have them.  We should drop that sort of childish argument. Let us approach this proposition on its merits like reasonable men and not try to close a discussion or prevent people talking by cheap propaganda of that kind.  The fact is that we are proposing to change the proportional system to the direct voting system which is in operation in Great Britain, the United States, Canada and a number of other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>And the North of Ireland. Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, and I wish he would draw the proper conclusions from this fact, that under the proportional system, Fianna Fáil as a political Party has succeeded in forming the Government for 21 or 22 years out of the last 27 years.  We know that one of the things the proportional system does it to slow down the rate of change.  We know that if a Party gets 50 per cent. on one occasion under the proportional system it is not likely to go below 45 or above 51 or 52 per cent. on the next occasion. The rate of change is slowed down.  As Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, the direct voting system has the effect&mdash;this is something we must all admit&mdash;of exaggerating the change in the pattern of the people elected.  With a slight shift in public opinion there may be a very big change in the percentage of members elected for the various Parties.</P>
      <P>One of the things the direct voting system does above all others is to make for reasonable stability in Government. It does not throw up Governments that can never be changed and Governments so weak that they can never act effectively in the national interest.  Such Governments ultimately go out of existence and the people grasp at something that will give them effective Government.  Perhaps they may even grasp at dictatorship in the hope of stability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the proportional system a number of Parties can be elected.  If the proportional system operated here as it has operated in many countries <Col N="255" /> on the Continent, we might have not two or three main Parties but eight, nine, ten or 11 almost equal Parties. The difficulty of such Parties forming a Government can be seen from the experience we have had ourselves on a couple of occasions.  We remember all the trotting around there was in order to achieve the necessary compromise for the formation of a Government. We have seen that, too, on the Continent in the last ten or 12 years. We have seen the very stable and unemotional Dutch without a Government for four or five months.  We know that the situation became so bad in France that the whole institutions of State simply collapsed.</P>

      <P>That is quite true.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We always understood that the real defect under any system of P.R., and particularly the system of the single transferable vote, was that it led, in circumstances where there are no big economic issues before the country, to a large number of small Parties being returned, making for instability in Government.  That is inherent in the system of P.R. and the single transferable vote.&rdquo;</P>

      <Col N="258" /> Take my own constituency, County Louth.  Roughly, the situation is that at the last election there were 12,000-odd votes for Fianna Fáil and there were 14,000 votes against Fianna Fáil.  It so happened that even though Fianna Fáil got only 12,000-odd votes, Fianna Fáil got two out of the three seats.  If anybody can divide the County Louth constituency so that Fianna Fáil, with 12,000 votes, will get three seats as against 14,000 Opposition votes, I should like him to try his hand at it. In County Louth there is a certain number of Labour votes, a certain number of Fine Gael votes and a certain number of Fianna Fáil votes.  If Labour and Fine Gael, after an election held under the direct system, are prepared to coalesce, they can come to an election agreement.  Let us, for ease of reference, call the constituencies, North Louth, Mid-Louth and South Louth.  In County Louth there would be three Fianna Fáil candidates. Naturally, being the large Party, we would put up three Fianna Fáil candidates, one in each constituency.  It could be agreed that Labour would put up a candidate in either North, South or Mid-Louth and that Fine Gael would put up a candidate in each of the other constituencies.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello, as I quoted before, did not believe in the <Col N="261" /> system of the transferable vote.  Deputy Costello said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We always understood that the real defect under any system of P.R., and particularly the system of the single transferable vote, was that it led, in circumstances where there are no big economic issues before the country, to a large number of small Parties, etc.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon thought that P.R. was a fraud and a cod; he believed in the single member constituency with the transferable vote, so that the man who gets the support of the largest number of people living in the constituency will represent the constituency.  In that same speech he said: &mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under that system you would get a clear majority in this House, with a good strong Government, and with no doubts about it after a general election.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan said, as reported in column 1070, Volume 67:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was always held that with regard to P.R., which this country adopted, we had adopted the worst possible system.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How does Deputy O'Higgins square those statements, made by leaders of his Party, with his statement here to-day that all Parties here had agreed that P.R. was the best possible system?</P>
      <P>That was only in 1937.  In 1927 the Fine Gael Party, then Cumann na nGaedheal, issued advertisements which were quoted here by the Taoiseach in his concluding speech on the Second Reading showing what they thought of coalition Governments which are inevitable, as Deputy Costello pointed out, under the system of P.R.  Those election advertisements, that were issued by Cumann na nGaedheal in 1927 and quoted by the Taoiseach here, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Your fight in this election is a fight for Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They go on to say that the people should vote for a Government.  It indicated that if they voted for small Parties they would set up a Coalition. The advertisement pointed out what a coalition meant.  &ldquo;Bargaining for <Col N="262" /> place and power between irresponsible minority groups&rdquo; was one of the things it would lead to.  &ldquo;A weak Government with no stated policy.&rdquo; There would be &ldquo;frequent changes of Government and consequent depression in trade and industry&rdquo;.  There would be &ldquo;no progress.  Security and credit would be in constant danger.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We believe that the direct voting system will get rid of a multiplicity of small Parties in the Dáil: that it will force the existing Parties to combine so that the natural tendency will be a reasonably strong and stable Government opposed by a reasonably strong and integrated Opposition.  If this country wants to make progress, political discussions must be carried on in a responsible atmosphere.  No one can discuss any question of great political importance to the future of our people if there is only one responsible Party in the Dáil&mdash;one Party that must, because of the fact that it is going to be the Government or hopes to be the Government on its own, take responsibility for everything it says and every piece of policy it proposes.</P>
    <P>It is a disastrous situation&mdash;we know it here over the years; it is known in other countries&mdash;that when you have one responsible Party, two or three irresponsible Parties will attack you from the extreme right and the extreme left and you cannot hear your ears with the clatter.  The best thing for effective and healthy political discussion in any Parliament here or elsewhere is that there should be two responsible Parties or one responsible Party and two or three Parties that can coalesce and which are a natural Coalition.  During elections, they should let the people know they are going to coalesce so that when a member of the Opposition speaks, the people can have some assurance that they are not just making a petty point against the Government in order to give it trouble.  They should really mean what they say.  They will be expected to make some effort to put their policy into operation after an election.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that if we had the direct voting system at the last general election, the Dáil would now look like a Fianna Fáil Party meeting <Col N="263" /> I can give him the figures in relation to my own constituency where we have, under the system of P.R., two seats with 12,000 votes and the combined Opposition got one seat with 14,000 votes.  I have no doubt that in many other parts of the country something like the same thing happened.</P>

Let me take the case of Louth which I know pretty well. We got 12,000 votes and two seats and the combined Opposition got 14,000 votes and one seat.

      <P>&ldquo;The system we have we know; the people know it.  On the whole it has worked out pretty well.  I think that we have a good deal to be thankful for in this country: we have to be very grateful that we have had the system of P.R. here. It gives a certain amount of stability, and on the system of the single transferable vote you have fair representation of Parties.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The speaker went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think we get, probably, in this country more than in any other country, better balanced results from the system we have.  If you take the countries where P.R. exists, you get better balanced results than you get in the other countries.

There is a statement of political faith from the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time, and yet in the face of that positive statement, the nailing of the flag to the mast, as it were, the Minister for External Affairs put on some buffoonery act here and said that the Fianna Fáil Party never believed in P.R. and, in fact, it was a danger to the country, a danger to the future of the country, after the Taoiseach had assured the country, with all the responsibility of his office behind him, that we get better balanced results from P.R. than from any other system, that we should be thankful for having better balanced results and better balanced legislation and that we would have nothing to do with a proposal to wipe out minority representation in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it was from a poem.  The Minister at one time talked about birds' nests and I have quoted that often in this House.  So the very Party that has told us that P.R. is the sheet anchor, that it gives us such excellent results, better balanced results, that we get more out of P.R. than any other country of which the Taoiseach knows and gives us better balanced legislation, now comes along and says exactly the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can we trust a Party that does that?  In 1937, they say these are the virtues of P.R., and in 1958 or 1959, they say: &ldquo;Look, all we said then was really a pack of lies.  We do not believe it now.  We are completely opposed to P.R. and never seriously meant that P.R. had all the virtues which we then alleged it had.&rdquo;  How can we trust a Party like that?  Surely it is not unreasonable to say that people who have changed their minds in such a devastating way, and have gone from a <Col N="267" /> northern position to a completely southerly position, are reliable advisers for any section of our people?  The fact of the matter is, and the Tánaiste let it out during his contribution to the discussion and the Taoiseach hinted the same, and the Minister for External Affairs is now being thrown into the vortex to make it clear that so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can put &ldquo;clear&rdquo; in inverted commas.  So far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, they believe in a two Party system of parliamentary representation.  They want to maintain a permanent Fianna Fáil Government, and they want to try to maintain a permanent Opposition, and the permanent Opposition, in my view, they want to maintain, is a Fine Gael Opposition.  They do not want to see an independent Labour Party survive in this country.  They do not want to see an independent Farmers' Party survive in this country.  They do not want to see any kind of Independent Party.  Anybody who rears a Party and sustains a Party down through the years, does not get the admiration of the Fianna Fáil Party. Their attitude is: &ldquo;Forget about your principles; get into the crowd; get into the herd; it does not matter if you do not agree with those you are advised to join, if your political principles are different, if your whole philosophy is different&mdash;get into the crowd, into the herd.  Try to get seats.&rdquo;  That is the mentality of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>The clear purpose of the Fianna Fáil Party is to try, as I said before, to rivet themselves in office so long as they can, to hold on to the power to dispense favours and hold on to power to look after all their political friends, and keep complete control of the reins of Government.</P>
      <P>The net situation that suits them is one Opposition and in that one Opposition, they do not want two Parties.  They want only one, and quite clearly they want a Fine Gael Opposition Party.  As I said I do not believe the Fianna Fáil Party want an independent Labour Party or an independent Farmers' Party.  Their attitude is: &ldquo;Get into the herd; try to get seats and stay there, but do not try to rear a third Party with an independent point of view in this country.  You have to take your stand under either of two umbrellas. You must be elastic in your views and try to fit yourself into either of these Parties, but you cannot form a third Party.  In the view of Fianna Fáil, you are not wanted in this House.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs quoted at length what Deputy Costello and Deputy Dillon said in 1937.  I am not concerned with what they said in 1937 and it is not my business to explain their point of view in 1937 or to-day.  Apparently, however, they were wrong in 1937.  The Government then said they were wrong but, in spite of the weaknesses which they alleged flowed from P.R., the Government nevertheless inserted <Col N="269" /> the full P.R. system of election in the new Constitution.  At that time, the Taoiseach commended P.R. in the fulsome words I have just quoted.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister for External Affairs, having been a member of the Party which rebuked Deputy Costello and Deputy Dillon for what they said, allegedly unreliably, in 1937, discovers because it suits the book that what was said by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Costello in 1937 was perfectly correct.</P>
    <P>The allegation is that P.R. makes for a multiplicity of Parties.  There is no foundation whatever for that under the method of P.R. which we operate in this country.  With such a preponderance of three member constituencies, nobody has a chance of securing a seat in Parliament, unless he can command, in a constituency, at least 25 per cent. of the electorate's votes and that is not a very small minority&mdash;25 per cent. of the votes.  What number of Parties have grown up here as compared with 1922 under P.R.  In that year, we had a Fianna Fáil or a Sinn Fein Party outside the House.  We had a Cumann na nGaedheal Party inside the House.  We had a Labour Party and we had a Farmers' Party.  You had four Parties in 1923.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>In 1923, 36 years ago, we had four Parties in the House.  After 36 years of P.R., has the number of Parties increased very substantially? You can count the number of Parties in the House to-day and you can see what multiplication has taken place since 1923.  P.R. has not produced a multiplicity of Parties here.  If you rate a Party as a body with, say, at least ten members, then there has been no increase in the number of Parties in 1959 <Col N="270" /> as compared with 1923.  In face of that, how can it be alleged&mdash;I see that the Minister for Health is bursting to say something.  Everything he says comes from the Book of Revelations so I will defer to the profundity of his knowledge.</P>

      <P>I was saying, before this infantile interruption, that, if you judge Parties as bodies which constitute not less than ten members, and compare Parties to-day on that basis with the Parties which existed in 1923, how, in face of the position as we know it to exist to-day, can the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs allege with justification that P.R. produces a multiplicity of Parties in the sense in which Ministers of the Government have sought to portray a whole variety of Parties, every one of which had been created out of misuse of P.R.?  The plain fact of the matter is that that argument will not render any service to whatever case the Government want to make for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs talked about a situation in which you get a Government Party elected and you have an Opposition.  He thinks that will be the result of the single non-transferable vote.  But suppose you get a situation under the single non-transferable vote in which a third Party holds within its grasp the sufficiency of votes necessary to elect one Party to the Government.  What is to be done in these circumstances?  The Minister for External Affairs wants to know what everybody will do, but he will not tell us what the Fianna Fáil Party want to do.  In these circumstances, <Col N="271" /> are the Fianna Fáil Party to refuse to take office, unless they get a guarantee that they will be allowed to function and that votes will never be used against them to unseat them whilst they are in Government, or is their attitude to be: &ldquo;Unless we get a majority, the other two Parties can get together and form a Government&rdquo;? But apparently, according to the Minister for External Affairs, that would be a sinful, shameful practice. If three or four independent Parties fight the election, once an election is declared, and if, as a result of the election, no single Party has a clear majority, then a Government has to be elected or you can have another election. What will the Minister for External Affairs do?</P>

The purpose of this Bill is to endeavour to wipe out all independent Parties, except the Fianna Fáil Party and the Opposition Party.  I believe that the Government desire Fine Gael in Opposition rather than any other Party.  That is the whole purpose.
