      <P>What the Tánaiste says now is a contribution towards doing things in a reasonable way.  This is Wednesday and the polling date is only three weeks from today.  Surely the question of passing an Act to validate the matter could be decided between now and lunch-time or this afternoon and the Dáil, if necessary, could assemble on Friday for the purpose of passing the Act in all its stages.  Once we knew that was the Government's intention, we could proceed with our business within the very limited space of time at our disposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last night, I was dealing with the general improvement in regard to the disposal of claims for unemployment benefit and disability benefit.  I think I had indicated that the number of claims investigated in the year under review had fallen considerably and that these claims had been disposed of in the meantime.  I am glad the Departmental organisation has been able to achieve that because in the previous year when we were dealing with this Estimate a number of Deputies complained particularly about the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister can now safely assume that, by and large, the measures which have been taken by his Department over the past two or three years have given claimants a proper realisation of what they may expect from the various sources of social assistance.  It is generally accepted, particularly in rural areas, that an employed person may no longer have stamps affixed for spurious employment.  It is a very good thing if we have succeeded in establishing that only employment that is properly insurable may be insured. Therefore I suggest to the Minister that he could now safely be content with investigating a fewer number of claims than in the past.  I do not know why claims are referred for particular investigation; perhaps it is when the local Branch manager of the employment exchange, in the case of an employed person, believes there is reason to doubt the number of contributions coming to credit and refers <Col N="533" /> a claim of that kind for investigation. In a case of social disability benefit I take it that these would be investigated on the initial representations of the local officer or agent of the Department.</P>
    <P>I believe there is less reason for special investigation of claims under the social welfare disability code than there is under unemployment.  I suggest the Minister should try to ease off in the general trend of investigation.  I am sure he will find, having reviewed the position in recent times, that quite a large number of claims now referred for investigation come through successfully from the applicant's point of view.  That being so, it is not unreasonable to expect that this investigation would not be carried out as thoroughly in the future as in the past.</P>
    <P>A point I wish to put very strongly to the Minister concerns claims which are found on investigation to be improper and in which the Minister has to refuse benefit.  The persons concerned have the right of appeal and that is advised to them in a circular letter indicating the Minister's decision in the case.  In quite a large number of such cases it happens that the appeals officer at headquarters in Dublin will decide on the facts before him that the case is one which he may decide summarily and will not require a local hearing.  There may be clear cases of that type but I have found that in quite a number of cases where the appeals officer decides not to give a local hearing, that decision is somewhat unreasonable from the facts known to me.  In such cases I think the claimant should at all times be entitled to the benefit of the doubt.  Naturally the claimant, rightly or wrongly, feels aggrieved by an unfavourable decision and that being so I think the disappointment and resentment could be considerably eased if he were given an opportunity to have his case heard at a local hotel or clubroom.</P>
    <P>Most people feel they can make their own case best and a local hearing gives them that opportunity.  I regard the appeals officers who deal with such appeals as very efficient, independent men.  There is a feeling abroad that <Col N="534" /> these men are officers of the Department and that they have not the independence necessary to make a decision. I do not think that is right; I think they are selected from the point of view of suitability and that they are completely independent.  I find that at all times their decisions are reasonable.  If there is a doubt they are inclined to give the benefit of it to the applicant.  That is as it should be.  That being the case I feel the Minister could inspire more confidence in the appeals machinery if arrangements were made for as many appeals as possible to be heard locally and disposed of after hearing the local evidence of the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>A large number of cases nowadays are appealed in connection with the question of insurability where the Department, after investigation, come to the decision that the employment is not insurable and disallows the contributions. The aggrieved parties are entitled to appeal to the Minister and in these cases particularly I think there should be a local hearing.  If there is to be any conflict of evidence it is desirable that it should be in the open and that each party should know the statement of facts made at a hearing of that kind.  I do not want to labour this point unduly but I have previously suggested that the Department's policy in that regard might be adjusted so that appeals of any kind should if possible be heard locally in a place convenient to the aggrieved parties.  If that were done, everybody would get an opportunity of making his case and, whatever the decision, there would be a general degree of satisfaction.</P>
    <P>One speaker yesterday pointed out that here we are dealing with one of the most important series of Estimates in the State.  That is pretty obvious considering the size of the Vote.  The Parliamentary Secretary, when introducing the Estimate, indicated that expenditure under all headings approximated to practically 25 per cent.  of total State expenditure, outside of capital services.  The organisation embraces a very wide field.  One aspect that strikes me very forcibly is the fact that this is one Department which seems to do its work over a wide <Col N="535" /> range of services quietly and unobtrusively.</P>
    <P>The general attitude in the debate so far has been reasonable.  There are, however, a few points with which I am not in accord.  I should like to deal with one of those now.  We know that the Minister has appointed two more representatives to the special commission set up to inquire into workmen's compensation.  I was glad the Minister intervened last night to clear that matter up for the benefit of the House. He dealt with the point at issue very frankly and I, for one, am in entire agreement with his decision.</P>
    <P>One speaker argued that the Minister has done something which more or less loads the dice.  I do not think he has done anything of the kind.  If anything, the dice were loaded under the original set-up against an interest very vitally interested.  All the Minister has done is to even up the representation on the commission.  I see nothing wrong in that.  First of all, each interest is given an opportunity of making their case as effectively as they can from their own point of view. Secondly, when the report comes before the Government and the Minister, the Minister has pointed out quite rightly that he is under no obligation of any kind to accept the report. Naturally, he may be guided by certain recommendations; if the general picture, however, is not depicted in the best national interests the Minister is a free agent and is at liberty to decide the most practicable course to adopt in that set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who have believed for many years that the system of one card and one stamp to cover all risks is a good principle.  When I had the privilege of being an agent for the old National Health Insurance Society, I advocated the introduction of that principle.  The policy at that time was most conservative and for years the decision to adopt a combined card for sickness, disability and unemployment benefits was delayed.  Since 1953 we have had a combined card; not alone was one card introduced but that one card was made the sole card to cover the entire year.  Prior to that, there was <Col N="536" /> a half-yearly card collected at half-yearly intervals.  Most of the risks involved in social welfare are covered now in the one contribution.</P>
    <P>I have always thought that that card should also take within its scope the risks attaching to workmen's compensation, risks at present administered by private undertakings.  Undoubtedly part of the risk attaching to workmen's compensation carries a considerable liability and it would be impossible to measure out what that liability may be on State resources without a proper investigation into all aspects of the matter.  For that reason, the previous Government decided, in their wisdom, to set up a commission of inquiry.</P>
    <P>One speaker last evening said there was considerable profit to be made from workmen's compensation and that profit could very usefully be employed to supplement the existing sources of income to the social welfare fund generally, thereby leading to an increase in benefits generally.  I do not agree with that point of view.  If the State were to take over liability for workmen's compensation they should not take it over for the purpose of making a profit.  The people who meet the charges for that liability are, generally speaking, the employers.  The employed person makes no contribution. Why, then, should an employer be obliged to pay a premium greater than the actuarial determination of the position indicates?  That would be quite wrong.</P>
    <P>The first reason governing the undertaking of workmen's compensation by Social Welfare should be that of convenience.  Secondly, it should be undertaken on the basis of making a normal profit only <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other activities in which the fund engages. A very competent body has been appointed to deal with this matter and there is, therefore, very little point in going too deeply into it now.  In due course we shall have the report of the commission.  No doubt some very interesting facts will be made known.</P>
    <P>Unemployment generally and unemployment assistance have been adverted to in this debate.  To what extent one can deal satisfactorily with <Col N="537" /> the relevant figures of unemployment, it is very hard for me to say.  We have heard different views in the matter. The actual experience is that, whilst large numbers are alleged to be unemployed, it is almost impossible to get anyone from the unemployed register to take on certain forms of work. Every Deputy knows the forcible complaints made in connection with unemployment in town, village and district. It is the general experience, too, that if an employment scheme offers, and the prospective employer approaches the local exchange, he will find a fair number of seemingly suitable men but a day or two later&mdash;this has happened on a number of occasions&mdash;these men are not available and are not forthcoming. It strikes me therefore that we have, among the number of people unemployed, a very large proportion of persons who are not suitable for work in the strict sense of the word.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that aspect of unemployment arises on this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering if it did, but if you rule that it does not, I shall leave it and raise it again on a more suitable occasion.</P>
      <P>I shall now deal with the Department's policy in connection with the suspension of the local agency posts in the Department of Social Welfare. I have some experience of the work those agents are doing as I did it myself for nine or ten years.  I have always held the view that you cannot do very much about it and what can be done about it now I do not know but I have told the Parliamentary Secretary that by and large those agents are not paid an adequate wage, a wage which I would consider satisfactory for the work they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been made on many occasions that most of them are part-time officers and that they have other sources of remuneration.  There are certain side-lines they can carry on. We know that a number of them have small businesses of their own but so far as I know only certain types of businesses are permitted to them.  The <Col N="538" /> agent is not allowed to have a shop on his own premises or to operate a shop directly himself.  Neither is he allowed to engage as an agent for a general insurance company.  There may be other occupations which have been excluded in recent years&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I have reason to know that any agent of the Department under whose charge there is a membership roll of around 3,000 has a full-time occupation.  If he is to carry out his duties in accordance with the requirements of the Department, I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary that that officer will be engaged full-time.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary, and I am quite sure he has done so, looks at a list of the average salary paid to an agent with that membership roll, he will find that, generally speaking, it is less than £6 a week.  These agents have to maintain an office in their own homes or elsewhere and until a few years ago they had to pay their own postage, as had members of this House. Since the Department of Social Welfare took over Cumann na nArachas Náisiúnta um Shláinte, I understand that the envelopes are franked.  I am quite sure that is a relief to those people who are paid only a small wage because it involved an expenditure of 7/- or 8/- a week for a person who was paid only £5 or £6 a week.</P>
    <P>I am labouring that aspect of the matter to show that the proposed suspension of those posts is, in my opinion, a good policy.  I always felt it was like the one card and the one stamp and that the service organisation should be controlled at one central point.  I hope I am correct in assuming that it is the Minister's intention, where the agency has been suspended, to have the work which was carried out by them now diverted to the local employment exchange.  That would be a good arrangement.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Corish, who is competent to speak with some authority on the matter, has agreed that it is at least worth a trial.  The people as a whole will not be inconvenienced and with transport and communication as efficient as they are nowadays, in my opinion, the people will have a better service if the amalgamation <Col N="539" /> proposed is possible, and it may be possible to give higher remuneration to whatever officer is then appointed in the local exchange.  I take it there is no intention of terminating these posts except when they normally become vacant and that there is no question of possible complaints that people will be put out of employment by the arrangement.</P>
    <P>In dealing with old age pensions, I make one point to the Parliamentary Secretary.  By and large, the whole arrangement with regard to the investigation of means is satisfactory.  There is, however, in the Department of Social Welfare what I might describe as an obsession as to the genuineness of transfers by farmers to members of their family.  I must say the method by which some of these people dispose of their affairs piecemeal is not to be in any way recommended for general acceptance, but it seems to be a tradition and it is very hard to break it down.  The farmer disposes of his property or his holding in the first instance to a son, or to a daughter, if he has not a son, and when there is something over for the other members of the family, he wants a breathing space before making the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>That type of arrangement creates a suspicion in the Department of Social Welfare that the claimant is disposing of his money for the purpose of qualifying for a pension.  They may be right in a number of cases but not in all. Unfortunately, the general attitude in the Department with regard to that matter is very conservative and I always found it difficult, when making representations, to break down what I regard as the very strong feeling that every one of those cases is wrong in the Department's view.  I found that when a farmer disposed of his property and his money at the same time that arrangement commended itself very strongly to the Department, but if he does it piecemeal, it causes trouble eventually.  There are quite a number of genuine claims in which the old age pension is not being paid because of that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> Most of the anomalies that have existed have been cleared up and that is the one remaining obstacle of any importance which seems to be standing in the way of genuine applicants.  It should be obvious to the officials of the Department who are dealing with the matter that the time has now come when farmers' families will not stay on the land without knowing exactly where they stand.  There was a time when it was possible to keep them working day in and day out waiting for the day on which the father or the mother would be in a position to donate some money to them.  They will not do that any longer.  They are now prepared to seek alternative employment from other sources, if the position is not made clear.</P>
    <P>In my experience of many cases in the past, if promised employment did not materialise, they insisted at the earliest possible moment that whatever measure of help they were to get from the parents should be forthcoming in a definite way.  I do hope that the general over-all position with regard to the obtaining of old age pensions having improved, as it has in recent years, the Minister will see fit to relax and modify considerably this difficulty which, as I said already, seems to be the only one of any importance causing trouble to claimants for old age pensions at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House any longer.  I have said quite a lot on the matter but finally I would like to mention a problem in connection with the verification of weekly claim dockets for unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit in rural areas.  I have made representations to the Minister in connection with this matter with a view to having more just alternative arrangements made in certain isolated districts surrounding a Garda station.  I did suggest to the Minister that a Garda from a station in such a district might be asked to visit a suitable local point, a post office, a school or a community centre, one day a week, for the purpose of enabling local claimants to verify the dockets which they have to put forward in order to receive unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> I appreciate that the co-operation of the Garda authorities is necessary in that direction.  I also know that in areas in part of the county I represent, and I suppose the same is applicable to other adjoining areas, there is an insufficiency of personnel in the Garda at the moment to deal with any extra duties.  However, I do feel that a little push from the Minister might be helpful on this matter and the Garda authorities might agree to take special steps to co-operate.  To put it plainly, the arrangement that has been suggested cannot be implemented except that the Garda authorities are in a position to make a man available for a few hours, one day a week, to do this work.  They take up the attitude that they have not the necessary personnel to do that job but I feel that the Minister might make further representations in this matter.</P>
    <P>I am also inclined to suggest to the Minister, though I am reluctant to do so and though I am quite sure that for obvious reasons the Minister will be reluctant to accept my suggestion, there might be a way of making alternative arrangements.  I see no reason why officers of other Departments might not be used, if they are willing, to do the needful.  The reason this arrangement is sought is that unfortunate people, particularly those on unemployment assistance, have to travel several miles once a week to attend the local Garda station.</P>
    <P>Deputies living in rural areas see those people going along the roads every Tuesday or Wednesday, and it usually takes them the whole day. They have to leave their homes at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning and quite a number of them have no way of travelling except on foot.  They may get a seat on a passing cart, or in a motor car, and be able to return home in a few hours but quite often they have to walk the journey as many of the roads in these isolated districts carry very little motor traffic.  It is a common thing for a man to walk five or six miles to a Garda station and the same distance back again.  He comes home hungry and, though he might be in receipt of the maximum amount of assistance, he will have to spend an entire day walking for the good of his <Col N="542" /> health to obtain that assistance.  I think it is time some alternative arrangement should be considered and I would strongly urge on the Minister to endeavour to do something in that connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>I want to avail of this Estimate to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether any fresh thought has been given by himself and his Minister to the question of altering the basis on which old age pensions are at present paid.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that old age pensions are at present based on the social assistance concept that the entire sum is paid by the State, with the result that old age pensions have always been appallingly low and they are still appallingly low, especially in the light of present price levels.  In fact, it has been established recently by statistics in this House that the purchasing power of the old age pension to-day is approximately the same as in 1938 and, perhaps, about the same as it was in 1908, so that though the standards of living of most sections of the community have increased that of the old age pensioner is lower.  It is as bad to-day as it was when he was first awarded a pension of 5/- a week by the British administration in 1909.</P>
      <P>I think it was a fatal mistake for the present Government to have dropped the retirement pension provision in the 1952 Social Welfare Act. It would be much better from the point of view of the State, of the State's finances and of making provision for elderly workers in retirement, if the State were to introduce the retirement pension ideal which was dropped, as I said, in 1952 because in that way&mdash; that is by the introduction of a retirement pension scheme&mdash;you can provide pensions for elderly workers who are compelled to cease employment for one reason or another.  You cannot make that provision adequately for them by reliance on the payment of an attenuated old age pension payable only at 70 years of age, and then under an acute means test.</P>

      <P>I am trying to find out if the Parliamentary Secretary will come into the second part of the 20th Century and provide retirement pensions in this country instead of, or side by side with, old age pensions, because something obviously will have to be done to provide retirement pensions for workers.  The State is obviously the best agency to initiate proposals in that connection.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us his views on the matter when he is replying, and I hope they will be progressive views, Retirement pensions must come and the sooner they come the better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moloney to-day, and the Minister for Health last night, indulged in some self-praise on adjustments which were made in the personnel of the commission dealing with workmen's compensation.  The Minister for Social Welfare apparently thought he saw that there was a deeply hatched plot to secure from this commission a recommendation in favour of the taking over of workmen's compensation from private insurance companies and the administration of that scheme of compensation by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister last night, and his colleague, Deputy Moloney, to-day, indulged in some sense of joy at what they called adjusting the dice which they felt were loaded against the insurance companies.  There is no question of the dice being loaded against the insurance companies in this matter. In fact, the dice are loaded in favour of the insurance companies.  Anybody who looks at the statistics, who can read English and understand figures, will see from the annual returns <Col N="544" /> published by insurance companies how, out of every £ which an employer pays to provide workmen's compensation for his workers if they are injured in the course of their employment, about 10/- is gobbled up in administration, professional and legal charges by and on behalf of the insurance companies.  The unfortunate injured workman gets, on an average, about 10/- out of every £1 that is paid. The insurance companies, by administrative charges, professional people and legal people all come in to gobble up the other 10/-.</P>
    <P>In face of the fact that the employer has to pay £1 to these three segments of our workmen's compensation administration, namely, the insurance companies, the legal people and the professional people, it is a bit thick to talk about the dice being loaded against the initiator of that subtraction of 50 per cent of premium paid by the employer.  The two parties primarily concerned in this matter are the employees and the employers required to pay workmen's compensation in order to cover their employees.  That is a legal obligation on them.  Their desire is, I take it, that when a workman is injured he should get the maximum value possible for the payments they make but the employer has the melancholy satisfaction of sitting down, looking at the returns of the insurance company and finding that out of every £1 he has paid to cover his workman for workmen's compensation, the workman gets 10/- and the collection of people who have nothing to do with the injured workman walk away with over 10/-.  Loading the dice has a strange connotation when used by the Minister for Social Welfare and Deputy Moloney in that connection.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary when we are likely to get this report from the Commission on Workmen's Compensation.  They have sat long enough to produce it.  The issues are simple and I think the Department of Social Welfare could have provided all the statistical data necessary.  All that is needed on this matter is a decision as to the wisdom, the propriety and the social justice of administering a scheme of that kind by the State which is costing approximately <Col N="545" /> 50 per cent. of the income to administer.  I should imagine&mdash;this is a rough calculation&mdash;that the administrative charges of the Department of Social Welfare are not more than about 12 per cent while it costs the insurance company 50 per cent to administer workmen's compensation, which is about three or four times more than the cost to the Department of Social Welfare of administering the complicated code of Social Welfare services throughout the entire State.</P>
    <P>In any case it is high time that the whole question of the payment of workmen's compensation was taken away from the courts and that some cheaper and much more expeditious method of paying that compensation was provided for the injured workman. The court is only a clog so far as the injured workman is concerned.  The insurance companies and employers who can carry their own insurance can simply break the heart of the worker when he comes to make a claim for workmen's compensation by resorting to all the legal devices available to them in an effort either to dodge the payment of the compensation or to force the worker back into employment before he is able to go back to such employment.</P>
    <P>There are a few administrative matters I should like to raise in connection with this Estimate.  One is the question of payment of benefits to insured persons whilst in hospital.  The present position is that, if an insured person is ill and has to go to hospital, the benefit is withheld whilst he is there but may be paid to him in full when he is discharged from the hospital, or he may on application be able to get portion of the benefit which is used to provide some little comfort to the person whilst he is in hospital.</P>
    <P>I can quite easily see the necessity for proceeding prudently in a matter of this kind.  The workman may want to have something available when he comes out of hospital in order to meet problems which have arisen while he was there but I do think the Department of Social Welfare use the microscope too closely and too frequently in ascertaining how much they will give the workman for the provision of <Col N="546" /> additional comforts while in hospital. The most they are prepared to give is a few shillings per week and one would need to make representations to them a few times to get an adequate sum from his accumulating social disability benefit.  That is even so where the insured person himself is prepared to collaborate in the assignment of portion of his benefit to his next-of-kin at home, perhaps to his widow, perhaps to his wife or other members of his family for their benefit or for his own benefit.</P>
    <P>I came across a case recently in my own constituency where an aged woman, about 80 years of age, was living on an old age pension and had a son in a mental hospital.  The son's benefit was being held up.  As a result of representations I think 10/- was granted to this boy's mother to help provide additional comforts for him. It was increased to about 15/- and then the Department said, after one or two representations, it could not go further.  They finally gave £1 to this person but the position now is that the son is detained in a mental home with as bleak a physical outlook as anybody could have.  His mother is 80 years of age and, on my reckoning, the son has about £300 to his credit in the Department of Social Welfare from accumulated benefits which have not been paid to him.  The Department cannot give the mother more than £1.  His mother is likely to die one of these days and will get no benefit out of the £300 but will die in penury, and if the son is never cured, his £300 is gone as far as he is concerned. I do not know who the next-of-kin are.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of the Department of Social Welfare making itself such a Shylock banker as in this case? Why do they not give something to this unfortunate woman who is living in penury, as can be seen by any Social Welfare officer who visits her and do something perhaps to brighten in some way the life of the unfortunate person who is a patient in a mental hospital, who has been there for years and may be there for the rest of his life, whether that life be long or short?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary ought to examine this case sympathetically. <Col N="547" /> I do not want to make any positive recommendation in the matter.  I want to see the mother dealt with in a balanced and sympathetic way by people who know human problems.  If something is done in that case, the Department will not be a banker with £300 while the insured person is suffering all the austerity of detention in a mental home and the mother living in a dilapidated cottage at 80 years of age assisted only by an old age pension in these days of high living costs.</P>
    <P>Another question I wish to raise is in relation to what is described as the second doctor.  Cases come to my notice where a person submits medical certificates.  After a while that person is examined by a medical referee.  The medical referee recommends the person as not unfit for work, and therefore benefit is stopped.  Notwithstanding that, the injured person continues to go to the local doctor whose medical qualifications are probably as good as the medical referee's, except that the medical referee is on the payroll of the State.  The local doctor continues to furnish evidence that the person is ill and unable to work.  In that case the appeal of the person in the form of the continued submission of the certificate is sent back to the medical officer and in cases which have come to my notice have been sent back to the same doctor.  How does that constitute an appeal when the person who gives the decision in the first instance is again consulted as to the reasonableness or justification of his first decision?</P>
    <P>If there is an appeal by way of the continued submission of evidence that the insured person is not able to work, it is unfair to send that appeal to the first doctor.  It should be sent to some other doctor.  It is quite natural that the first doctor will say that he believes he was right in his first opinion.  I should like to see the statistics of cases in which they change their opinion between the first and second decision. It is obviously wrong that, where there is an appeal against a first doctor's decision, the case should go back to that first doctor again.  A second doctor should be found on the panel of referees to deal with the case in which <Col N="548" /> an appeal has been made in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I want to call attention to a difficulty I have experienced.  I make representations about a case to the Department of Social Welfare.  The ones in relation to which I make representations to the Parliamentary Secretary seem to take longer to get a reply than the ones I send to the Department in the ordinary way.  Cases have come to my notice in which, having made representations to the Parliamentary Secretary, having after lots of reasonable time, called for a reply, I finally get a notification from the insured person concerned that he has been paid benefit and probably, a few weeks after he has been told about it, I get a letter from the Department saying that the matter has been adjusted.</P>
    <P>It looks stupid that a situation should arise in which I call for a reply to the Department at a time when, in fact, but unknown to me, the insured person concerned has already got a decision.  It is also stupid that the Department should have the file on hands and not finalise at the stage at which the person has got the decision. Is there any reason why, when a case has been cleared in the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;it does not matter who makes representations or what Party he belongs to&mdash;a decision is taken not merely to pay benefit or refuse benefit, as the case may be, but to communicate with whomever made representations in the matter?  It seems to me that there are nuts loose somewhere in the Department if you have a situation in which, so far as the claim is concerned, it has been paid and, so far as the Department is concerned, it is a current file still because no reply has been sent to the person who made representations in the matter.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that matter and take steps to avoid that kind of administrative sluggishness which does not accord with efficiency.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether we have not reached the stage at which it would be possible to give the local agents and the local employment exchanges much more authority than they have at present.  One finds from time to time that there is a good deal <Col N="549" /> of delay in sending cases to Dublin for decision.  I appreciate the necessity for the co-ordination of decisions and to ensure that whatever the case law is in particular cases should be the same all over the country, but there seems to me to be a considerable amount of remitting of cases to Dublin for decision where they get into the maelstrom of administrative work there and then the problem is to get the decision out and back to the people.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we have not reached a stage at which some consideration should be given to the possibility of further decentralisation, at least on a zone basis, so that, for example, cases in the Cork region need not necessarily come to Dublin?  I wonder if it is not possible to give the local manager power to deal with the matter himself? Could it be dealt with on a local zone basis where there would be some administrative officer to take these cases and so remove them from the bottleneck of the administrative machine in Dublin?  I agree that there should be co-ordination in the matter of decisions but the Department of Social Welfare is now old enough to have worked out its own code of case law.  I imagine it should be possible at this stage to provide for greater decentralisation and instead of sending cases to Dublin, to have them dealt with at local level.  However, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into these matters.</P>
    <P>Last night, in a flight of customary fancy, the Minister for Social Welfare came in here and made a speech.  I do not know where he got the brief to tell us what he thought about the number of people in employment and the number of people out of employment and the number of people emigrating.  He slung statistics around here last night which had that basis only in his own imagination.  The fact of the matter is that, contrary to what the Minister said last night, there are fewer people insured today and in employment today than in 1956 and 1955 and 1954.  That fact has been published in an official publication released recently with the authority of the Taoiseach by the Central Statistics <Col N="550" /> Office.  There is no purpose in trying to gainsay that fact.</P>
    <P>There are fewer people in employment today than there were in those days.  One of the reasons for that is that there are fewer jobs available today due to a considerable mechanisation of agricultural work.  There are fewer people in agricultural today and the cities and towns are not able to provide alternative employment for those displaced from the land. There are fewer people in employment today because of the recession in industry and the general mechanisation which is constantly in operation in farms up and down the country.  The Minister had to take some satisfaction in the fact that there are fewer people registered as unemployed today than last year.  That is so and it is probably so in respect of the year before.</P>
    <P>There are more people registered as unemployed today than there were in 1955.  There are more people registered as unemployed today, I think, than there were in 1954.  The outstanding fact is that there are far too many people registered as unemployed in each of these years.  The number would be still greater, were it not that there is always the chance of getting a job in Birmingham, London and Bristol.  But the statistics of unemployment afford no grounds for consolation or complacency for anybody.  They are disturbing. They remain so.  You may use them as political weapons to throw across the floor of this House.  Today, per head of the population, we have a larger number of persons unemployed than any of the free democracies in Europe.  I think the Minister for Social Welfare misconceives his whole function and misconceives an adequate approach to this problem when he finds satisfaction in the fact that there are a couple of thousand fewer persons unemployed today than there were last year and ignores the fact that there are well over 60,000 persons unemployed today in an underdeveloped country like this and that that is a much higher rate per head of the population than it is in Britain or even in the Six Counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Liam Mac Cuinneagáin Liam Mac Cuinneagáin">
      <NameTxt>Liam Mac Cuinneagáin</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá cúpla poinntí go mba mhaith liom a phlé ar <Col N="551" /> an Meastacháin seo a bhaineann le gnéithe éagsula de'n gcód soisialach. The first point I want to deal with concerns delays in coming to a decision where a person has a certain number of contributions and claims unemployment benefit.  It is very important that decisions should be given quickly in rural areas in such cases.  It is very unfair to have delays for as long as three months.  Not all people who have employment contributions are aware that when they apply for unemployment benefit, it would be wise at the same time to apply for unemployment assistance, lest, after a delay of three months, their application for unemployment benefit should be turned down.</P>
      <P>I am aware of very long delays in quite a number of cases.  I would not mind so much if it were something unusual or something that happens very infrequently, but many of my constituents have approached me about the matter in the past six months. Their general complaint is that they made application three or four months earlier, that the case was sent to Dublin, that a decision has not been reached and that a very long delay has taken place.  There is no good reason for that state of affairs and it is something which should be remedied, especially in the rural areas because the people there cannot be running to the social welfare offices every day of the week annoying the people there until some decision is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to deal with is the investigation, or the re-investigation, of the means of applicants for unemployment assistance.  I think that the Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary, would De very wise to standardise this whole thing because there seem to be many discrepancies or unevenness in the application of the means test throughout the country.  I have in mind one case where the alleged income from a small farm of £12 valuation was, in the eyes of the Department of Social Welfare, equal to the income which a person who had £7,000 invested in the National Loan would get.  I do not think there is any farm of £12 valuation in Donegal, or <Col N="552" /> anywhere else for that matter, that can provide an income equal to the income from £7,000 invested in the National Loan.  In particular, I do not think that, when a person in that category also, applies for an old age pension such an income should be attributed to him.</P>
    <P>Our county council has a standard whereby they say that every pound of valuation equals an annual income of £12.  In that way a farm of £12 valuation would give roughly £144 per year.  In that case, where a married applicant, an old age pensioner, applied, the income was divided between himself and his wife and a substantial amount would be granted. The same standard does not apply where the Department of Social Welfare is concerned and it is due I think to the lack of uniformity in reports of social welfare officers.  It is something which should be adjusted and instructions should be given to these people as to what figure they should place on valuation, on conacre, or cattle values.</P>
    <P>Recently, in my area&mdash;that is over the last four or five years&mdash;a large number of re-investigations of unemployment assistance cases has taken place.  Heretofore, when an application was made by a married son living on his father's farm, or his widowed mother's farm, where the farm was owned by somebody else other than the applicant, he received unemployment assistance.  The same applied to a son-in-law.  Now in the case of all married applicants for unemployment assistance, if they live on a farm&mdash;it does not matter how many other persons are living on that farm of £2, £3 or £4 valuation; it does not matter who owns that farm or how many own it.  The total income plus the valuation of the farm is, as they say, &ldquo;put against&rdquo; those applicants irrespective of whether the father, mother, brothers or sisters live on the farm or whether or not they are getting anything from that farm.  The applicant who is married and living there has the whole means and the whole income in that farm&mdash;and in cases as I have mentioned an exaggerated income&mdash; put against him.</P>
    <P>The result is that we have, in parts of Inishowen especially, wholesale reductions <Col N="553" /> in the number of people who, on and off, have been getting the full amount of unemployment assistance for a number of years.  In very many cases, indeed, we have had names wiped off and no benefit at all granted, although these people are people who are genuinely seeking work.  While it is true to say that the unemployment figure has been reduced, if over the last three or four years this has been one of the means of reducing it then I feel that the reduction is one which is not to be welcomed as gladly as it would have been otherwise.  I would advise the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that no outlandish income should be placed against a farm of £3 valuation amongst the hills of Donegal, at least no income such as that in the specific case I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The third point I should like to deal with is that of branch managers in sub-employment exchange offices.  I shall mention a case in point.  This person receives something like £700 a year.  Out of that he must have a suitably furnished office of adequate size with counter shelves and so on. He must have the service of a deputy branch manager.  He must provide any clerical assistance considered essential for the efficient performance of the work of the Department, and all that must be provided out of something over £700 a year.  He is paid on the basis of cases, that is, 437 per week, but it so happens that this man has 1,500 per week.  In order to deal with 1,500 per week, he must employ a good number of clerical assistants.</P>
    <P>I understand that some minor revision of the ordinary cost-of-living bonus was granted recently.  I should say that many of the delays in investigation and payment of unemployment benefit and assistance complained of are due to the fact that no man with an income of £700 a year, and having to have a sub-manager and other assistants, can afford to do the work efficiently on that scale of salary.  Down through the years I have heard Deputies advocate that the salaries of these people should be increased.  If a good case could be made for it four or five years ago, the case is stronger still today and should merit the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Col N="554" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement of the Minister for Social Welfare last night that the lot of our people, in particular, their salaries, has improved might be true of a certain section, but I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a group of our people who can be classified as destitute.  As one who has given service as the Minister's representative on the Appeals Board for over 20 years, I can speak with some degree of accuracy on these matters.</P>
      <P>The question of the powers of appeals officers has been mentioned. My experience of the appeals officers has been that they endeavour to do their job, not only efficiently but in as kindly a manner as possible.  However, they are governed at all times by the provisions of the Act.  There is the matter of people who are indirectly affected by a strike.  When a strike takes places on the quays, for instance, those employed in firms other than the affected firms, are disemployed and not eligible for any benefits.  That matter merits consideration.  During the war years, up to five hours a day were sometimes spent dealing with these cases.</P>
      <P>The question of the local officers getting more power was raised by Deputy Norton.  I think some of our local agents are inclined to use their powers in a manner which no Deputy or Parliamentary Secretary would approve.  Deputy Norton quoted a case and I should like to quote a case also.  I was pleased by the Parliamentary Secretary's assurance recently that if a Deputy contacted him in regard to cases of difficulty or delay, he would deal with the matter.  That has been my experience.  But, before quoting the case, I should like to say as an employer here for a number of years, that Dublin cases have no relation whatever to the cases submitted by Deputies from the provinces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal particularly with the building industry.  Take the case of a person unemployed and on assistance. There is the deduction; he makes an appeal and comes before the appeals officer.  He is expected to have written proof of the employers he has approached to secure employment.  But you can appreciate the position of a builder's foreman endeavouring to get <Col N="555" /> a large housing scheme or hospital job completed when someone comes along asking him to confirm that this person was there seeking work as a labourer. It is possible that because of circumstances, physique, general health and disposition, the applicant might not be suitable for the foreman, even if he had employment to give.  However, the appeals officer must find out what endeavours the applicant has made.</P>
    <P>Then there is the particular case I want to quote.  This is the case of a person who has been unable to get employment for a number of years because of physique and general disability. He was hospitalised, but, having been discharged as unfit for work, he returned and was met by the local agent.  That agent, without recourse to doctor or anyone else, told him that in his opinion he was fit for work and to report to the labour exchange.  I hope we shall be able to find out the details of this.  The man signed three times a week for weeks and weeks and eventually received the large sum of 1/- a week.  I think there is need for revision in regard to both these matters.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now, again speaking of Dublin, to the moneys allocated to those on unemployment assistance or who get work under that heading.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that that applies only to married men?  The result is that we are forcing the unmarried man out of the country.  He has no alternative.  As well as being married, those entitled to benefit must have four or five children.  Is that not ridiculous when you consider the number of married people who in the dispensation of Providence, may not have five children or any children?  It is a matter I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of.  It is criminal that the unmarried men of Dublin are not given an opportunity of working on these schemes.</P>
    <P>I am not anxious to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on effecting reductions in social welfare benefits. The idea should be to alleviate poverty and unemployment.  Increases in remuneration have been given to those <Col N="556" /> engaged in productive employment. The Minister has never questioned any demand for an increase in their case, whether approved by the Labour Court or otherwise.  In the case of old age pensions, the ceiling was fixed in 1952. In Britain, the ceiling was raised recently to meet the increased cost of living.  It is proposed to increase the pensions in this country as from August next.  In 1952, a figure was laid down as the maximum income of an old age pensioner.  If the pensioner gets an increase of pension seven years later, of what good is it if the cost of living has also increased?</P>
    <P>There is need for revision in the case of appeals by persons whose applications are disallowed because of a dispute or strike, not in the firm in which he is employed or even in the particular trade in which he is engaged. It means that a good craftsman who can get employment will go to England because he fears the strike may last a month or two months.  He should not have to go to England.  I am not suggesting that he could live on what he would get.</P>
    <P>If the matter of the ceiling fixed under the Act of 1952 in relation to old age pensions and the other matters to which I have referred were considered favourably, I should be perfectly satisfied with the Estimate and with the Department generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to protest against the delay in investigating applications for old age pensions in the country generally and especially in my constituency.  Yesterday I received a letter from a constituent stating that he applied for an old age pension on 10th March last and that the pensions officer has not investigated the claim, although he resides within 12 or 14 miles of the applicant.  The applicant has written to the Department and received an acknowledgment stating that the pensions officer will arrive in due course.  That applicant has been waiting since 10th March for the pensions officer to arrive.  I consider that that is too long for any applicant to be kept waiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports sent anonymously to the office of the Parliamentary Secretary or <Col N="557" /> the Minister regarding recipients of unemployment assistance or old age pensions should be thrown into the wastepaper basket without being read. I feel that anonymous reports that are sent to the office are investigated.  In my opinion, such reports should not be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton that more power should be given to local exchange managers.  That is long overdue. A section of men may get cards to report for work.  One or two are found unsuitable and get a discharge paper from the ganger, supervisor or engineer in charge.  When they report back to the labour exchange, they are further questioned.  That should not be the case.  In several cases the matter is referred to the Department and the appeals officer has to investigate. That should not be.  The person concerned should be paid unemployment assistance or whatever social welfare benefit he is entitled to without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, we were very agitated because there was a motion on the Order Paper by the then Deputy Murphy who, I believe, is now in Canada.  Perhaps one of the reasons why there is less unemployment is that large numbers of people were, like Deputy Murphy, forced to go to Canada and elsewhere for a livelihood.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that there is a saving of £139,000.  That is effected at the expense of widows on non-contributory pensions and persons in receipt of unemployment assistance.  It is stated here that the fact that they had secured significant reductions in the Estimates was a sign that the country was improving both as regards employment and the economy as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past year there was a regular inquisition throughout the country.  Every case was reopened and every excuse was made either to reduce a person's income or refuse him.  I dealt with numerous cases of that kind. One man came to me and told me he was signing three days a week for a shilling.  He said his wife had a small job and, because of that her small pay was taken into account and he was <Col N="558" /> signing for one shilling.  Another man whom I know and who sells newspapers on a Sunday was completely cut off.  Perhaps those facts and the fact that there has been wholesale emigration account for the saving.  The saving is not due to any improvement.  Yesterday I met a friend who, I knew, had three of his children in England.  I asked him how he was.  He said he was O.K. and that all the children were in England, meaning his whole family of six.  That accounts for the decrease in respect of those in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dig up the past&mdash;I have referred to this matter before&mdash; but the Taoiseach once said that he did not see why 20,000,000 people could not be maintained in this country. That appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 5th February, 1932.  It is a sad reflection that after all that length of time we can be cynical in regard to improvements as evidenced by the fact that people are still being driven to England.</P>
    <P>In regard to the extra 2/6 granted to certain classes.  I think that these people should have obtained this 2/6 right away without having to wait until August.  I argued the case before the Board of Assistance last Monday as to what the withdrawal of the food subsidies cost each individual.  It was generally admitted that what I said was correct.  It cost each individual at least 2/9.  It was worked out that an unemployed man or an old age pensioner buys at least six loaves of bread per week.  Most poor people consume bread and tea four times a day.  There is a cheap loaf and a dear loaf.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the cheap loaf, if a man ate six loaves there was an increase of 1/6 in regard to bread alone as a result of the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  It cannot be denied that it would take at least a pound of butter to cover the six loaves and the increase there was 9d.  The price of tea was increased.  Here again there are various classes of tea.  There is a cheap tea which can be bought for 9d. a quarter.  You could get it even cheaper but there would be no colour in the tea.  A man would buy at least a quarter of tea and the price of that was increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not, Sir, but the Minister congratulated himself upon the benefits provided.  In any event, it cost those people at east 2/9 and they received 1/- so that the recently granted addition of 2/6 was merely something which covered what those people lost two years ago.  They should not have to wait until August for the 2/6.  They are entitled to something restrospectively.</P>
      <P>There are a few other points I should like to mention.  One is in connection with complaints in regard to widows' non-contributory pensions.  An old age pensioner is allowed to earn approximately £52 per year and get his pension but if he earns more he gets less. If he has £104 a year he gets nothing. Old age pensioners complain that because they have a small pension of £2 per week they get nothing.  They state that the amount allowed to qualify for a pension should be increased.</P>
      <P>The case is similar in respect of a widow.  A person told me that she offered to work for 22/6 a week although she could get twice that amount but if she got twice that amount she got no non-contributory widow's pension. Quite a number of widows do slave work to make up enough to live because they could not live on 22/6 a week.  The problem is one which is not the fault of the Minister.  There are widows working as slaves for a small amount just to get enough to live.  They know that if they earn more than a certain amount their application for a non-contributory widow's pension will be refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least 30,000 people in this country are in receipt of home assistance.  That is in addition to the State assistance. They get it by reason of the fact that they have to pay a substantial rent.  It is towards the rent they get this assistance. I thrashed the matter out with the home assistance authorities in Dublin.  They said they were prepared to consider the matter.  In other words, it was the intention of the home assistance. <Col N="560" /> people to reduce whatever assistance they granted by 2/6.</P>
    <P>There are 3,000 persons likely to be affected in Dublin and 30,000 people in the country as a whole.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should indicate it is not his desire that the home assistance authorities should take that 2/6 into account.  If he gave some indication of his wishes in this connection, I am sure no action would be taken.  The assistance given is only in relation to the rent.</P>
    <P>There are two classes of people.  You have the person residing with his family and the person who has to keep a home himself.  It is only for the purpose of helping towards the rent that this assistance is given but there is a danger that the assistance authorities may deduct the 2/6 from the small amount granted in home assistance.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to keep that in mind.  I should like him to indicate that it is not his desire that that 2/6 should be deducted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years I have been interested in cases of people receiving mental hospital treatment prior to reaching 70 years of age and people who have reached that age and are maintained in mental hospitals.  This matter I think was raised some years ago in Clonmel Mental Hospital and we found it involved great hardship on the persons concerned and also on the ratepayers.  The old age pension is not stopped in the case of a man or woman in a county home or a hospital.  The health authorities treat them decently generally and a certain amount of old age pension is allocated for maintenance and a certain amount is returned to the person concerned to buy extra comforts.  But in the case of a patient in a mental hospital, under legislation which, of course, goes back many years, such persons do not qualify for an old age pension at all. The county ratepayers must meet the full cost of treatment and the individual patient gets no benefit from the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary would agree that it would be a very good thing if such patients could qualify for old age pensions.  It may <Col N="561" /> be said that mental hospital patients have not their full faculties but the same case can be made in regard to patients in other hospitals.  It would be of great help to mental hospital patients and to the ratepayers if the present situation could be changed as I have suggested.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have pointed out the delay in dealing with old age pension claims.  Much of this arises when old age pension committees in various counties must wait a certain length of time until a certain number of claims come before them.  I do not know if they are obliged to have a certain number of claims before they meet or whether they make those rules themselves. It happens frequently that old age pension committees wait three or four months before a claim is considered by them and sent back to the authorities.  There should be no hard and fast rule about this and, if there is a regulation preventing the holding of a pension meeting until a certain number of claims come forward, I think that should be changed so that even if there is only one claim within a certain time the pension committee should meet and deal with that case. The pensions officer would then be able to investigate the case sooner.  I would say that 90 per cent. of the pensions officers treat every case with consideration and in making the point about delay I do not lay any blame on these officers.  I find they treat people fairly but, while they are inclined to do so, they discover snags.</P>
    <P>I want to quote the case of old county council workers.  I had a case quite recently of a county council worker who had reached 70.  For a long time prior to that he had not been employed by North Tipperary County Council and he had no means whatever.  When he came to 70 he claimed an old age pension and to everyone's amazement he was granted 10/- a week.  We could not understand how any pensions officer could grant a retired county council worker in very poor circumstances 10/- a week. Investigating the matter with the Department, I discovered that, since the Superannuation Act was introduced, <Col N="562" /> until county council workers get some sort of agreement or statement signed by the county manager or county secretary that they are not entitled to any superannuation, the pensions officer has to play safe and will not give the full pension.</P>
    <P>This man has no pension but my word or the word of any other Deputy or the man's own word will not be sufficient.  I think that is completely wrong.  If a county council worker makes a claim and states that he does not expect to receive any pension, the pensions officer concerned should take the man's word.  A pension cannot be hidden and if it is discovered, as would easily be the case, that a man is getting a pension from a county council the State has the means to get back any money paid or to make an example of the individual concerned.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary has far more experience of county councils than I have and that he realises how slow councils are in allowing pensions under the Superannuation Act when they must check back possibly to 1925 to find out where the man worked and whether he worked a full 200 days per year.  That takes a long time.  Meantime, the man concerned is not getting his full pension.  In the case I have in mind the man is in very poor circumstances and is getting no pension from the county council.  There is certainly room for improvement in that system.</P>
    <P>There is another point I want to make in regard to a person who is drawing the old age pension and also drawing an Army pension or some other small pension from a former employer.  If the former employer, in his generosity, increases the pension, whether the employer is the Irish Government or the British Government in the case of ex-servicemen, the pensions officer will reduce the old age pension by the same amount.  About 12 months ago a number of British ex-Army men who were each receiving £1 a week here from the British Government got a 5/- increase, but within a few weeks their old age pension was reduced by the same amount.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,178,400 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and Sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The net Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce of £1,758,400 for the year 1959-60 shows an increase of £100,120 compared with the provision for last year.  The principal increase arises under subheads which are directly related to the programme of economic expansion, that is to say, in the Grants-in-Aid to the Industrial Development Authority, to Córas Tráchtála Teo., and to An Foras Tionscal.  There is a reduction of £41,672 in the Appropriations-in-Aid mainly on recoupments from the American Grant Counterpart Fund.</P>
      <P>Industrial production and employment showed a continued recovery from the setback suffered in 1956.  For the year 1958, the provisional index of the volume of production of manufacturing industry was four per cent. higher than in 1957.  The average number of persons engaged in manufacturing industry increased in each quarter of 1958 as compared with the corresponding periods of 1957.  The improvement in the volume of industrial output last year extended over most of our industries, although some of the food processing industries were affected by the bad harvest.</P>
      <P>The recovery in production and the expansion in employment which were recorded were very welcome, but it is fairly obvious that development is still much too slow in relation to the country's needs.  The development of industrial activities, however, appears likely to accelerate.  I know that figures of new factories do not mean very much because they do not reveal the scope, size or development prospects of the concerns enumerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> In the last financial year, that is, the 12 months ended 31st March last, the records of the Department show that 95 firms either commenced manufacturing operations or extended the range of their production.  At the present time, there are quite a substantial number of proposals for new industries, or for new lines of development by existing industries, before the Department and the Industrial Development Authority.  A count I had made last week indicated that there are at present 180 such proposals under consideration.  Some of these relate to projects of considerable magnitude by Irish standards.  It would, of course, be optimistic to assume that all of them will proceed but, if a reasonable proportion go ahead, then it could be that the country is on the threshold of another major break-through in industrial expansion.  As Deputies are well aware, however, there are factors in the international situation which could possibly act as a delaying process.  Certainly the interest which has been shown in Irish industrial possibilities is satisfactory and justifies expectations that our progress will continue.</P>
    <P>The White Paper, on Economic Expansion, which was published last November, has given rise to widespread and very realistic discussion of our economic future.  That is very welcome. Indeed, the Government, in adopting the rather unusual course of publishing the economic survey which Mr. Whitaker, Secretary of the Department of Finance, prepared at the Government's request, aimed at provoking and providing material for a discussion of that character.  As the House is aware, we have been endeavouring to provide suitable conditions for development. We have recognised that progress in the industrial field must depend to a considerable extent upon the enterprise and skill of business people and upon the co-operation of employers and employees.  That applies particularly to Irish firms and to those of our own people on whom our main reliance for industrial expansion must be placed.</P>
    <P>I have stated here on earlier occasions that there are no facilities of any kind available to non-residents for <Col N="565" /> promoting industry here which are not equally available to Irish citizens. Soundly conceived proposals for the expansion of existing industrial concerns, or for the establishment of new industries by Irish interests either on their own account, or in association with external capital and technical participation, are very welcome.  As I have stated in the past, a large part of our hopes for the realisation of industrial expansion depends upon their being forthcoming.  Those who promote projects of that character can be assured that their proposals will receive not merely sympathetic consideration on my part but also all the practical assistance which it is within my power to give.  The aim will be at all times to co-operate fully with them in securing the implementation of their projects.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on economic expansion indicated that various interests in the country&mdash;employers, management, labour and so forth&mdash;were forming a committee to promote productivity, with special reference as to how this country might most effectively participate in the work of the European Productivity Agency and take full advantage of the Agency's services and resources.  That committee is now in existence and one of its immediate aims is to ascertain the requirements of Irish industry in relation to European productivity agency products and to sponsor the formulation of suitable Irish projects for consideration by the agency as well as to promote Irish participation in other projects initiated by the E.P.A.</P>
    <P>Personally, I regard the establishment of this National Productivity Committee, with the active and enthusiastic support of the representatives of the trade union movement and the employers' organisations, as an event of major significance in the country's development and, indeed, one of the most encouraging events recorded in the past year or, indeed, for many years.  Apart from the activities which come under the review of the National Productivity Committee, we have been giving consideration to the adequacy and suitability of our arrangements for facilitating industrial research.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> A complete review of the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1946, is now being undertaken, with the object of determining what changes should be made in the functions, powers and resources of the Institute, to enable it to co-operate more effectively, and to give very active attention to the problems which face our industrialists. The present statutory limit on the amount of the grant-in-aid payable annually to cover the expenses of administration of the Institute will clearly require to be raised, in any case, to cover the cost of operating the new laboratories which are now being constructed, and which will be used for testing materials of all kinds, and which will represent a considerable addition to the facilities of the Institute.</P>
    <P>During the year, Foras Tionscal approved grants amounting to £733,895 for industrial projects located in the undeveloped areas, bringing the total grants approved for that purpose to date to £2,232,740.  Of the total amount of grants approved to date, approximately £1,110,684 has been paid out, leaving outstanding commitments of £1,123,056.  These approved projects assisted by Foras Tionscal, under the provisions of the Undeveloped Areas Act, represent a total capital investment of £5½ million, and are expected to employ about 4,000 workers; 38 of the projects assisted by Foras Tionscal are in production, and there are also 22 further projects for which assistance has been promised, for which the amount of grant has been determined, but which have not yet reached production stage. Among these further 22 projects yet to reach production stage are a substantial number which are related mainly to export trade.  Grants under the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, were made to 17 new projects representing commitments in grants amounting to £439,350, of which £145,415 has been paid, leaving £293,935 to be discharged in respect of a number of projects not yet completed.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that the Industrial Grants Act provides for the granting of financial assistance, subject to certain limitations, to industrialists in that part of the country to <Col N="567" /> which the Undeveloped Areas Acts do not apply.  This is administered by the Industrial Development Authority and, as was announced in the White Paper on Economic Expansion, it is intended to introduce legislation, I hope, during the present session of the Dáil, to transfer the administration of the Industrial Grants Act to Foras Tionscal, thereby enabling the Industrial Development Authority to concentrate on its promotional activities, and for certain other reasons as well, which, perhaps, I need not elaborate at this stage.  The proposed legislation will also provide for changes in the scope of the Act, to make it, I hope, more effective without, at the same time, weakening the policy of inducing industrial development in the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say more about that intention at this stage because, as I have said, a Bill is being drafted and the Dáil will be considering it in this session.  In the case of legislation of that kind, once the intention to promote it has been announced, it is desirable that there should be no undue delay in proceeding with it.</P>
    <P>The scheme for providing grants for industrial firms towards the cost of engaging industrial consultants and technical experts with a view to improving efficiency and productivity has been yielding very encouraging results indeed, and for that reason is being continued.  Grants to firms for the purpose of employing these experts and consultants are now made on the basis of one-third of the cost of each technical assistance project.  The interest in this scheme which has been displayed reflects the growing appreciation within industry of the necessity for maintaining efficiency at the highest level, and of keeping in line with technical changes occurring elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In the course of some public statements this year I referred to the attitude of foreign life assurance offices operated in this country towards the investment of a reasonable proportion of their funds here.  During the course of the past week, a preliminary discussion on the matter took place in London with representatives of the <Col N="568" /> Life Offices Association and it gave prospects of a satisfactory outcome. A further meeting to discuss the matter in greater detail is being arranged and will be held when certain statistical matter which is required has been collected.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware of the drive which has been launched under the auspices of the Industrial Development Authority to encourage external investment in industry in this country where it contributes to the country's economic expansion and the establishment of industries of a kind which we are not likely to secure without external aid.  Members of the Industrial Development Authority have visited a number of continental countries for the purpose of bringing to the notice of industrialists in those countries, who may be interested in setting up factories abroad, the many facilities and substantial advantages this country has to offer to such industrialists.  The response to these efforts has been quite encouraging.  A number of factories have already started production while others are being planned as a result of that campaign.</P>
    <P>Early last year I arranged for the Industrial Development Authority to appoint a representative in New York whose functions it would be to put before United States industrialists the attractions this country has to offer as an investment centre.  As the House is aware Cyril Count McCormack was appointed and a branch office of the Industrial Development Authority was opened in New York as his headquarters. I recently received the report of the Industrial Development Authority upon the operations of that office and it indicates there are good prospects for a number of industries, as a result of these efforts and that a number of proposals have reached an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the efforts of the resident representative an advertising campaign was pursued in suitable American publications and there are plans laid for intensifying these efforts in this year.  In order to pursue the campaign in European countries more vigorously I have agreed to the appointment, by the Industrial Development Authority, of a travelling <Col N="569" /> representative in Europe.  That appointment has recently been made and an advertising campaign in suitable European papers is being planned in connection with the appointment. May I say that the possibilities of such a campaign were brought to my notice forcibly following on my visit with an economic delegation to Italy on the invitation of the Italian Government?</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity there of speaking to a meeting of industrialists, organised by the Milan Chamber of Commerce, on Irish industrial possibilities and, as a result, two or possibly three industrial enterprises will be established here with the assistance of an Italian firm, the director of which emphasised in the course of conversation with me last week that he had not been aware of the facilities and advantages available here prior to that visit, and who expressed the view if they were more widely publicised others, beside himself, would be interested.  It will be appreciated this country cannot afford to maintain an organisation and to conduct a publicity campaign on a scale which would ensure that direct contact would be made with every industrial firm in Europe but the new enterprise of the Industrial Development Authority in the appointment of the travelling representative, and the publicity campaign which will support his work will, I am confident, be productive of quite useful results.</P>
    <P>The highlights of the year, as far as mining was concerned, was the commencement of production by St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd. at Avoca. It went into production, as Deputies know, in October of last year.  Having overcome certain production difficulties, which emerged in the early stages, the company are now working up to full capacity and are employing about 500 workers.  The copper concentrates and pyrites are being exported through the port of Arklow.  Fortunately, copper prices which had slumped for a time have returned to a more satisfactory level and are now near, or at, the figure of £240 a ton.  They have remained, indeed, at that level for quite a considerable time.</P>
    <P>The collapse of lead and zinc prices <Col N="570" /> involved the suspension of production by the Silver Mines Lead and Zinc Company and by the Abbeytown Mining Company in Sligo, but both companies carried on exploration, the former on the extent of barytes deposits in Tipperary and the latter on Sligo lead and zinc resources.  Indeed, the Sligo Company reorganised as the New Abbeytown Mining Company Ltd. resumed production in January of this year on the conclusion of a successful drilling scheme towards the cost of which a State grant was made available.</P>
    <P>The Allihies, West Cork, exploration was continued by a subsidiary of Can-Erin of Toronto and exploration has reached a point where a decision will shortly have to be made by that company in respect of major development and production.</P>
    <P>In January last year, as the House was informed, I concluded an agreement with the Texas Oil Company which proposes to undertake a comprehensive programme of exploration in Ireland.  Prior to concluding that agreement I had received a number of proposals from international groups for the granting of facilities for oil exploration and, having appraised the merits of the various proposals, I decided those made by the Ambassador Oil Corporation of Texas offered the best prospects of a competent and comprehensive scheme of exploration being undertaken by private enterprise. Legislation to give effect to the agreement with the Texas firm, and to provide a practical basis for oil exploration and development, is being prepared and will be introduced shortly.  I think I should stress again that the prospects of oil resources being discovered in this country are very doubtful.</P>
    <P>The first stage of the technical assistance project for coal exploration in the Leinster and Connacht coalfields commenced with the placing of a contract with a British firm of drilling contractors who began drilling operations last March.  That scheme will be financed by an E.C.A. grant of £80,000 from the Counterpart Fund.  The scheme, which will take about three years to complete, will be carried out in three stages, the first of which has <Col N="571" /> now begun.  It is hoped it will reveal new deposits of coal, both in the vicinity of the existing coal mines and in virgin ground, as a result of which we may eventually be able to produce from home sources our total requirements of anthracite coal and, perhaps, even have an exportable surplus.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the White Paper Programme for Economic Expansion a scheme is being prepared for the granting of financial assistance to persons, undertaking by private enterprise, schemes of exploration or development of the country's mineral deposits.  The aim of that schemes will be to encourage the development by private enterprise of such schemes as have apparent economic possibilities.</P>
    <P>I am considering the question of having legislation prepared in respect of mines and quarries and in respect of explosives and other dangerous substances.  The legislation would be concerned primarily with questions of safety, health and welfare. The existing law dealing with these matters is scattered over numerous enactments, some of which go back nearly 100 years, and it is obviously desirable to consider the extent to which the law needs to be codified, amended and generally brought up to date.  I should mention, too, that I am arranging for the setting up of a small <i>ad hoc</i> committee representative of employers and workers to consider whether, and, if so, to what extent the Truck Acts require to be revised in the light of modern conditions.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Estimates last year, I mentioned that construction had commenced on the refinery at Whitegate, County Cork, and that it was anticipated that the refinery could come on steam about the middle of this year.  Deputies will have learned from the newspapers that the first cargoes of crude oil arrived recently at the refinery and that production has commenced.  The expedition with which the work of construction was carried out has merited a very well deserved tribute from the promoters to the Irish workers employed on the <Col N="572" /> construction, whose efficiency and productivity contributed to the completion of the operation in advance of schedule.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware from the White Paper, the Government have approved in principle proposals of the Board of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd., for major extensions to the steel works at Haulbowline, County Cork.  The Board are preparing detailed plans and estimates for further consideration by the Government.  I anticipate that their firm proposals will be ready for submission to the Government in the very near future.  The development proposals include the extension of open hearth furnace capacity, the casting of large ingots which will be rolled in a new mill into a wide range of finished and semi-finished sections, the adaptation and mechanisation of existing steel-making and rolling plant to meet the requirements of the larger and more varied production and the eventual manufacture of sheet steel from bars produced in the new mill. The primary purpose of the proposed development is to increase the output and the efficiency of the mill and thereby reduce production costs and selling prices.</P>
    <P>With the closing of parts of the former Great Northern Railway Company's lines and the taking over by C.I.E. of the portion of the remainder of that Company's undertaking within the State, the prospect of extensive unemployment amongst the employees of the G.N.R. Dundalk Works was foreseen.  To deal with that situation a company known then as the Dundalk Engineering Works, Ltd., was formed for the purpose of taking over and developing those works.  An independent commercial organisation, in which virtually all the capital so far issued has been taken up by the Industrial Credit Co., Ltd., has been built up consisting of five manufacturing companies and a holding and development company.  The manufacture of light motor cars and certain agricultural machines, mainly for export, is proceeding. Work is also being carried out for C.I.E. and for Board na Móna.  The construction of equipment for foundry operations and the manufacture and <Col N="573" /> servicing of heavy road vehicles are proceeding.  It is the hope and intention that when these companies have been successfully established the shares will be offered for public subscription.</P>
    <P>Due to these activities it has been possible to avoid so far any permanent dismissals.  As I informed the House recently, they have temporarily laid off at present fewer than 100 while, at the most recent date for which I have figures, 852 workers were in employment.  I am sure the House will agree with me in expressing appreciation of the efforts of those who were given what appeared at the time to be a very difficult, if not an impossible, task and to express the hope that their plans will fructify as they intend and that these very important new industrial enterprises in Dundalk will continue to grow, giving still further increased employment for the benefit of that locality and the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, the Government have agreed to reimburse the company for the weekly ex-gratia payments which they have been making to those temporarily laid off and also for ex-gratia severance payments which may be made to workers whom it is not found possible to re-employ. The company are not yet in a position to say whether there will be any such workers.  The use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in my previous sentence relates to that prospect, not to the intention.  Any workers whom it is not found possible to re-employ for any reason will, of course, receive this ex-gratia payment.</P>
    <P>In view of certain discussions which have been proceeding in Wexford, and particularly a recent debate reported in the Press at a meeting of the Wexford Corporation, I think I should make it clear that these plans for Dundalk involve no conflict with Wexford engineering firms.  Certain of the statements made at the meeting of Wexford Corporation were misinformed. There is, of course, as the House knows, no subsidy of any kind for the Dundalk undertaking and it is not intended that there should be a subsidy.  There is no Government capital invested in that undertaking. The enterprises there are financed by <Col N="574" /> share capital subscribed initially by the Industrial Credit Company and by loans negotiated in a normal way. Indeed the Bonser Company at Dundalk, which is the concern which has an interest in certain types of agricultural machinery, has also substantial private shareholding.  There are certainly no advantages or facilities available to that Dundalk company which are not equally available to all other firms in the country.</P>
    <P>There have been some discussions with the management of the Dundalk concern and with the representatives of the Wexford engineering undertakings regarding development possibilities in relation to agricultural machinery generally.  A meeting which I had hoped personally to attend has been arranged between them in order to inform each other of the development possibilities that are foreseen.  It is a matter of some concern that there is still a very substantial importation of agricultural machinery on which duty is chargeable&mdash;types of machinery which it is contemplated could be manufactured in this country on a scale which would meet the country's full requirements.  Discussions I had with the representatives of the Wexford engineering firms were directed towards consideration of the possibility of securing an expansion of their production so as to eliminate that unnecessary item from our import statistics.</P>
    <P>To avoid any misunderstanding, I think I should make it clear that the Dundalk concern is primarily concerned with exports.  The scale of its operations and the type of equipment it is proposing to produce would not make production for the home market alone an economic proposition.  The Dundalk concern does not propose to engage in the production of dutiable agricultural machinery which is the main output of the Wexford firms and in the production of which they have the most immediate prospect of expanding the scale of their operations.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to an important development which took place during the year in the repair and shipbuilding industry.  Contact was made with the large shipbuilding firm, <Col N="575" /> Verolme United Shipyards of Rotterdam, who became interested in the development of the Cork Dockyard. Negotiations with the firm resulted in an agreement whereby the Cork Company has been acquired and is now being reconstructed to enable vessels of up to 47,000 tons to be repaired.</P>
    <P>It is the intention to undertake the building of vessels up to 50,000 tons. Deputies will have seen the announcement from the Company that their development programme is being expedited so that it is now contemplated that they will be in a position to take orders before the end of this year for new ships to be built at Cork.  That will be of great benefit to that locality. It is contemplated that when the development plans are completed some 1,800 workers will be employed at the shipyard.</P>
    <P>As already announced, the Government have reserved the Blackwater bog, County Offaly, as a source of milled peat for an ammonium nitrate fertiliser factory.  Further investigations are being undertaken on the Government's direction in order to bring the matter to the conclusion stage as soon as possible.  I have set up a committee to examine the merits of various proposals which have been received from firms of international standing in the chemical and fertiliser industries in regard to the erection of the proposed factory.  When the committee's report has been received, I shall then arrange to bring the matter before the Government for a final decision.</P>
    <P>Turf development has recently been before the House in the matter of the Turf Development Bill passed last March.  It is probable that additional capital will be required by Bord na Móna in 1961 when the House will have a further opportunity of reviewing the position.  The generating capacity of the E.S.B. on 31st March, 1959, was 668.5 megawatts.  Of that total, 399 megawatts were based on native resources and 289.5 megawatts on imported fuel.  That latter figure for imported fuel includes 95 megawatts at the Pigeon House, Dublin, which is now operated only as a stand-by <Col N="576" /> station.  A further capacity of 120 megawatts, based on milled peat, has been approved.  Of this, 40 megawatts are at Bellacorick, County Mayo, and 40 megawatts are at Rhode, Offaly.  These stations are under construction. A further 40 megawatts at Rhode are expected to come into commission in 1964.</P>
    <P>The generation from native resources in the last financial year was 64 per cent. of the total.  That figure would have been greater had it not been for the very bad weather which drastically reduced the output of Board na Móna. The demand for electricity which became almost static in the early part of 1957 resumed expansion later in the year.  In the past financial year, it was approximately 7 per cent. more than in the preceding year.  The average rate of annual increase on which plans are now being based is 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>Rural electrification is proceeding according to plan.  Forty-five areas and 1,600 new rural consumers were connected during the year.  The subsidy of 50 per cent. was restored from 1st April last and the scheme is expected to be completed in 1962.  A Bill to provide for increased capital expenditure by the Board and for other purposes will be introduced in the course of the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>This year, Fuel Importers (Éire) Limited is being wound up.  As the House will recollect, that company was formed in 1940 at the beginning of the second World War for the purpose of acquiring supplies of coal then available from Britain in larger quantities than importing merchants could handle.  In the following years of fuel scarcity, the company was given the task of maintaining supplies of fuel and handled in or about 6,000,000 tons of turf, firewood and charcoal.  In view of the fact that no shortage of coal was likely to occur in the foreseeable future it was decided in December, 1957, to liquidate the company's stocks which then amounted to about 100,000 tons of coal dumped in the Phoenix Park.  These stocks were finally cleared in April last.</P>
    <P>On the winding up of the company, I think the Dáil will expect me to <Col N="577" /> pay tribute to those who undertook its direction during that protracted period of 19 years.  There were changes, no doubt, in the Board over the period but during all the time that the company was in existence a number of public-spirited-men undertook to give their time and attention to its affairs without fee, without even travelling expenses, and thereby did a public service for which they deserve commendation.  I have often felt that we in this country lack something in having no established procedure by which public service of that kind can suitably be recognised.  If we had such a procedure or arrangement, the directors of this company would certainly qualify.  As it is, they have nothing to show for all their long years of unpaid labour except the usual formal letter from the Minister at the end of it, thanking them for their services.  I am sure it will hearten them to know that the Government and the Dáil do recognise the value of the contribution they made to the solution of the country's problems during a very difficult period.</P>
    <P>During 1958, exports, which stopped slightly short of the exceptionally high figure of 1957, the highest ever recorded in the history of the State, came to £130.7 million.  That figure, as I have said, was slightly below the 1957 record but it was reached not withstanding a setback of over £7 million in cattle exports.  Substantial increases in the export of bacon, frozen beef, mutton and lamb, chocolate crumb preparations, beer, glass and glassware, jewellery, personal clothing and pharmaceutical products, helped to make up that decline in cattle shipments.</P>
    <P>The increase in the adverse balance on visible trade was more effected by an increase in imports than by the slight decline in the export figure.  As the Dáil will have surmised, the bad harvest made it necessary to bring in much more than the usual quantities of grain.  Heavy purchases of plant and equipment for the new oil refinery and other industrial undertakings, together with the purchase of new ships and aircraft, also contributed to the increase.  In spite of the higher <Col N="578" /> deficit on visible trade, the net balance of payments deficit for 1958 is estimated at round about £1,000,000 when invisible exports are taken into account.  As the balance for 1958 was on the credit side, £9.2 million, it can be said that for the past two years the State has at least been on an even keel.</P>
    <P>On the capital side, the country's external resources have increased and there was an increased inflow of capital on foreign account during the past year.  The incentives in the way of tax remission on exports are now showing their effect.  There is noticeable a growing sense of optimism spreading through industrial and trade circles which it is hoped will continue to activate managements and penetrate also to the ordinary industrial workers on whom, in the final analysis, the whole export drive depends.</P>
    <P>During the year, Córas Tráchtála extended its activities in the field of export promotion, market research and development and a further extension of these activities is planned in the coming year.  I hope shortly to be in a position to introduce the promised Bill to establish Córas Tráchtála as a permanent State agency for the promotion of exports.  The current advertising and sales campaign in the United States which commenced in February, 1958 was reflected in the last quarter of 1958 when exports of Irish whiskey increased by 12.8 per cent. over the exports for the corresponding period in 1957.</P>
    <P>More significant, perhaps, is the fact that for the same period the American importers of the principal brands of Irish whiskey recorded a sales increase of 52.73 per cent. over the corresponding period for 1957.  To continue and extend that campaign a sum of £80,000 is being provided this year.  From available information it is fair to say that a situation has now been reached which is highly favourable to the establishment of Irish whiskey as a permanent dollar earner.  The situation needs to be vigorously exploited while the opportunity is there.  It is essential that the extended campaign which will be conducted by Córas Tráchtála should be supported by intensified <Col N="579" /> brand advertising by the individual distillers.  The needs of home industry necessitated the continuance of control on the export of certain materials and control is also applied to certain items of a strategic character.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will join with me in congratulating the Irish Trade Union movement on the successful culmination of its efforts to achieve unity. The movement can now give expression to a united view on major national problems and with little doubt this will add immensely to its strength and prestige.  Those of us who have had the opportunity of personal contact with them know that our trade union leaders are very responsible people.  I feel sure that they will ensure that the movement will exercise its newly found strength with intelligence and forbearance and thereby contribute materially towards the success of the Government's plan for national economic expansion.</P>
    <P>It is satisfactory to be able to report that we have enjoyed a year of comparative quite in industrial relations. That is due in no small measure to the work of the Labour Court and to the fact that employers and workers continue to secure the assistance of the court for the peaceful settlement of trade disputes.  During 1958 the court made recommendations in 136 cases and the vast majority of these recommendations were accepted by both employers and workers.  In addition to contributing towards the settlement of trade disputes by the issuing of recommendations, the court was able to arrange for the peaceful solving of a considerable number of disputes by means of conciliation conferences.  At my request the court is continuing its efforts to evolve, in consultation with the interests directly concerned, a satisfactory solution to the dispute in connection with the container traffic in the port of Dublin.  That dispute has been with the court for over a year and has proved to be a most thorny problem.  I am not without hope, however, that the court will be able within the next few months to promote a reasonable and equitable solution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> I mentioned last year that I was co-operating with the European Productivity Agency in setting up a body to carry out research work in connection with human problems arising out of technological advances.  The committee, which includes social scientists as well as representatives of workers and employers, has since been established. Members of that committee recently attended a seminar in Zurich entitled &ldquo;Fitting the Job to the Worker&rdquo;, which was organised by the European Productivity Agency.  The committee is now actively studying the whole subject and its application to industry in this country with a view to determining the most suitable lines for research work.</P>
    <P>I think that it would be appropriate that I should refer briefly to the International Labour Organisation this year as it is the 40th anniversary of the founding of that organisation.  As the House is aware, the object of that organisation is to secure improvements in the conditions and living standards of all workers.  In its earlier years, the emphasis was on the preparation of international standards in the form of conventions about hours of work, safety, health, the protection of women and young workers, and so forth.  These conventions are open to ratification by the member States, and ratifying States are required to ensure that their domestic legislation and national practice are in accordance with the provisions of the conventions ratified. Since the end of the last World War, there has been a shift in emphasis in the I.L.O. from standard-setting towards activities of a more advisory nature.  It is now spending a considerable amount of money on technical assistance for undeveloped countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as the House knows, has been a member of the organisation for a very long time.  Every year we send a tripartite delegation, representing Government, employers and workers, to the annual conference.  These delegations have always taken a very active part in the deliberations of the conference.  In all, the I.L.O. has adopted 111 conventions and Ireland has ratified 39 of these.  Many of those we did not ratify relate to matters not <Col N="581" /> applicable to our conditions at all&mdash; conventions dealing with colonial territories, plantation workers and the treatment of indigenous populations. Furthermore, while the principles underlying many of the conventions are fully accepted and indeed practised in Ireland, we have not been able to ratify them because our domestic legislation differs in some minor details from the provisions of the conventions, or because the matter of wages arrangements and similar matters are handled in this country by the process of collective bargaining.  Nevertheless, our record in regard to ratification is quite satisfactory.  Only 14 of the 80 member States of the I.L.O. have ratified a greater number of conventions.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to take an active part in the activities of the organisation.  We regard it as a most valuable way of ensuring that the Government and both sides of industry will keep in touch with international thought and practice in labour legislation and relations.  In modern conditions, it is essential that this country should not become isolated from the most up-to-date trends in these fields.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I recently made an Order bringing the Office Premises Act, 1958, into operation as from 1st of last month.  The Act provides in a general way that the occupiers of offices employing more than five persons must provide suitable and adequate conditions in their premises for the safety, health and welfare of their workers.  I am also empowered to make regulations setting out the minimum standards to be observed in regard to various aspects of office accommodation.  I have made such regulations as regards the minimum space to be allowed to workers, the minimum temperature to be maintained in offices and the minimum sanitary, washing and cloakroom facilities.  These regulations will come into operation on 1st September next. Regulations dealing with the standard of lighting in offices are at present being prepared and they also will come into operation on 1st September.  A summary of the main features of the Act and the regulations has been prepared <Col N="582" /> in my Department and is available to the public free of charge.</P>
    <P>I should like to take the opportunity of expressing appreciation of the valuable assistance given to me by the advisory council established under the Act in the formulation of these regulations to which I have referred.  That Council has held 13 meetings since it was established in April of last year. It includes representatives of workers, employers and sanitary authorities under an independent chairman.  Its function is to advise me on matters relating to the administration and enforcement of the Act.  They have not had an easy task.  As Deputies are aware, the legislation is very largely a pioneering measure, and the Council were breaking new ground in the consideration of the recommendations which it should submit for standards dealing with the well-being of office workers.</P>
    <P>During the past year, activities under the Factories Acts were also maintained at a high level.  Factory inspectors carried out almost 15,000 visits to about 9,000 factories.  It will be appreciated that some factories had to be visited more than once to determine whether defects noticed during earlier visits had been put right.  The inspectors have reported to me that they are continuing to get the co-operation of the vast majority of factory occupiers in their task of achieving the highest possible standard of safety, health and welfare in factories.  The regulations under the Factories Acts are being revised and modernised and I hope during this year to promulgate new regulations for the building and dock industries in relation to the use of electrical plant and equipment.  In the preparation of these regulations, the advice of the factories advisory council will be available.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that progress in regard to the establishment of safety committees by workers continues to be slow.  So far, these have been established in only about 20 factories.  At my request, the Congress of Irish Trade Unions is now considering what steps can be taken to promote a livelier interest by workers and their trade unions in this matter.  Experience, <Col N="583" /> both here and abroad, has shown that very worthwhile results can be achieved by safety committees in reducing the incidence of accidents in factories.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the new Apprenticeship Bill received its Second Reading towards the end of last year. Since then, the detailed provisions of the Bill have been exhaustively examined by a joint committee of employers' and workers' representatives under the chairmanship of an officer of my Department.  The joint committee have made 32 agreed recommendations for the amendment of the Bill. Amendments to give effect to all but two of these recommendations are being circulated.  Where conflicting recommendations were made, the existing provisions of the Bill will be allowed to stand for the consideration of the House.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act has been in operation now for six years and I think it is true to say that in that period it has enabled substantial progress to be made in eliminating the most objectionable features of restrictive practices in many trades. Practical experience suggests that some modifications of the Act are desirable in relation to the scope of public inquiries which may be undertaken by the commission and the procedure for the review by the commission of the operation of Ministerial Orders made under the Act.  I have accordingly decided to promote legislation to amend the 1953 Act in these respects, and I hope to bring that measure to the House later in this year.</P>
    <P>In this country, the law with regard to hire purchase was amended and brought up to date by the Hire Purchase Act, 1946.  Primarily designed to protect the interests of persons who hire or acquire goods under hire purchase or credit sale agreements, that Act establishes and defines the rights and liabilities between sellers and buyers of goods and also deals with the powers of the Courts in legal proceedings arising out of hire purchase transactions.  A detailed examination is being made of the manner in which the 1946 Act is operated.  That examination <Col N="584" /> reveals that certain changes in the law are desirable.  A new Bill, incorporating the amendments which I consider to be necessary, is at present in course of preparation and will, I hope, reach the Dáil this year.</P>
    <P>I think I should refer at some greater length to the situation which has developed, or looks like developing, in regard to the European Free Trade Area.  The negotiations for the establishment of the European Free Trade Area which had been going on from early in 1957 continued throughout 1958 under the supervision of an inter-governmental committee comprised of Ministers representing the 17 O.E.E.C. countries.  The negotiations were suspended in December last, following a statement by the French Government that the Free Trade Area on the lines which had been under discussion would not be acceptable to them.</P>
    <P>At that meeting of the Council of the O.E.E.C. in December, the British Paymaster-General, who had been chairman of the inter-governmental committee, reported to the Council of the O.E.E.C. that the committee had been unable to secure the establishment of a European Free Trade Area to take effect parallel with the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Rome, which set up the European Economic Community, was, of course, not affected by the suspension of the Free Trade Area negotiations.  Under that Treaty, the six signatory countries reduced their customs duty by 10 per cent. in favour of one another on 1st January last and, likewise, they enlarged their industrial quotas by 20 per cent. and raised all their small or nil quotas to figures representing three per cent. of their national production of the goods concerned.  These are the first of a series of tariff reductions and quota increases which each of the six is committed to operate until 14 years from now, at the outside, all the trade barriers between them are removed and the six countries of the Community will, in fact, be a common market protected against the outside world by a common tariff and operating a common commercial policy in <Col N="585" /> their relations with other countries. Some of the O.E.E.C. countries outside the Community were deeply concerned at the emergence of what they regarded as trade discrimination against them by the Community countries, particularly in goods subject to quota.</P>
    <P>Between January and April last, discussions went on between Britain and France to see if, pending the conclusion of a satisfactory multilateral agreement, increased quotas could be negotiated for goods of special interest to the two countries.  When these discussions were started, the intention was that any arrangement made between these two countries could be used as a pattern for other bilateral arrangements and also to operate until some form of long term European Economic Association to replace the Free Trade Area would be negotiated.</P>
    <P>The official Anglo-French talks finished in April and finished with agreement for increasing certain quotas by each country in favour of the others. Details of the agreement were conveyed confidentially to us and to the Governments of the other O.E.E.C. countries outside the Community, in accordance with the understanding which was reached within the O.E.E.C. some months ago.  Certain other of the O.E.E.C. countries have also been negotiating with France for the purpose of making temporary bilateral arrangements on the pattern of the Anglo-French arrangement.  Discussions with France concerning our trade arrangements with that country are, in fact, in progress this week.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that I went, yesterday, to London to discuss with the British Paymaster-General, who represents the British Government in Free Trade Area matters, proposals which have been put forward by the Scandinavian countries for a Free Trade Area embracing six or seven West European countries outside the Common Market and that my aim in arranging these discussions was to ascertain the British attitude to these proposals and to discuss their implications in relation to Anglo-Irish trade. I should, perhaps, make clear that these Scandinavian proposals, if I may <Col N="586" /> so describe them, have not yet been the subject of serious negotiation, although we understand that detailed discussions of them at official level is about to begin in the early future.  It is, of course, by no means certain that an agreement will be found to be possible at all, but I understand that the intention is that, if these discussions at official level should reveal the likelihood of agreement, further negotiations at Ministerial level will then be arranged.</P>
    <P>Deputies, perhaps, may have seen in some of this morning's British newspapers statements which indicate that the British Government have decided to participate in these negotiations and intend to work for the conclusion of an agreement for the establishment of a limited Free Trade Area embracing these six or seven countries.  I have stated that it is not certain that an agreement will be found to be possible, but I think that in our consideration of this matter at this stage we must assume that agreement will be reached.  All that exists at the moment, I understand, is a series of proposals prepared in Sweden, which have not yet been subjected to any very critical examination, but the general nature of the proposals is known and the general intention of those who will be sitting down in the near future to consider them.</P>
    <P>These proposals contemplate a complete dismantling of industrial tariffs at a much more rapid rate and to be completed in a much shorter time than is visualised in the European Economic Community or is provided for in the Rome Treaty.  The proposals relate only to industrial tariffs and it is apparently contemplated that, between the countries participating in this agreement, all such tariffs will be completely eliminated within five years, that some of them will be eliminated over a much shorter period and, indeed, in other instances, that tariffs will be removed immediately on the completion of the agreement.  It is clear, also, that the proposals involve the retention by each of the countries participating in the agreement of their full commercial freedom; that is to say, there is no intention to establish <Col N="587" /> a common external tariff or to concert their economic policies.  What is intended is a Free Trade Area, by and large, much the same in character as was being discussed in Paris for the whole of Western Europe and not an economic community such as the Rome Treaty aims to establish.</P>
    <P>I found that the British Government hold the view, which I expressed in the Dáil last week, that the ultimate objective should continue to be the conclusion of an agreement covering all the 17 O.E.E.C. countries, concluded under the auspices of the O.E.E.C. They apparently share the opinion, which has been expressed in many quarters, that the objective of a comprehensive agreement under O.E.E.C. auspices is more likely to be attained by the formation of a second trading group, as is envisaged in the Scandinavian proposals, than by any other method now open.  Indeed, Mr. Maudling, the Paymaster-General, expressed himself to me as fairly optimistic about the eventual outcome of these events.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear here&mdash;and I think I should reiterate&mdash;that we would much prefer that all these negotiations could be brought back under the auspices of O.E.E.C. and, indeed, would like to see that done forthwith but I must be realistic and say that does not seem likely to happen.  It seems, I think, clear that the whole trend of events throughout the world is towards the formation of economic groupings between nations.  Indeed, it appears likely that, in the future, small nations like ours will have difficulty in maintaining viable economies outside the ambit of wider economic combinations.</P>
    <P>That conclusion, if it is correct, must have considerable implications for this country, and must obviously influence our economic thinking, particularly in the field of external trade relations. However much we may regrete the emergence of what may prove to be two competing economic groups in Europe, there is nothing we can do to prevent it beyond expressing the hope that the belief which has been expressed that it will be eventually possible to <Col N="588" /> bring them together and get back to a comprehensive Western European agreement will prove to be well-founded.</P>
    <P>At first sight and in advance of further progress in the negotiations, it does not seem that we have any interest in these Scandinavian proposals.  They offer us no advantage in the British market which we have not got already under existing trade agreements.  The opportunities for increasing our trade to the Scandinavian countries, to Austria or Switzerland, do not appear to be considerable and a recent survey carried out by Córas Tráchtála in Sweden would support the conclusion that we could not hope to get in a free trade régime with these countries increased trade on a scale which could come near to compensating us for the consequences on our industrial development of rapidly removing all our protective tariffs and quotas on industrial products from these countries including Britain.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of our participation in the initial negotiations on these proposals at Stockholm, that does not appear to be desirable.  I presume that we would be invited if we requested it but it would not seem right that we should request an invitation to attend at the negotiations if we do not seriously contemplate joining the agreement, and the implications of such a request, the suggestion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister pardon me?  I want to ask a question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>The implication of making the request, the suggestion that we could seriously contemplate entering into an agreement which would involve the immediate removal of some tariffs and the rapid dismantling of all the rest, could have a very disturbing effect on our industrial development. It would be wrong to give, either abroad or at home, the impression that we could consider such a course.  In our thinking on this matter we are keeping in mind the fact that this new, <Col N="589" /> smaller free trade area contemplated in the Scandinavian proposals does not involve any concerting of economic policies and that separate trade agreements, if needed, can be negotiated by us with each of the participating countries and, of course, that could also be considered at the appropriate stage with the six-country European economic community.</P>
      <P>I know that some question has been raised in the minds of Deputies by the presence at the earlier negotiations in Oslo and the probable presence, at the resumed negotiations in Stockholm of the representatives of Portugal.  Everybody knows that at Paris, during the negotiations on the Free Trade Area plan Portugal indicated that she could not accept the full obligations contemplated and was, in fact, seeking modification of the obligations in a manner not very dissimilar to our own ideas in that regard.</P>
      <P>It has, however, been quite definitely stated by the British Paymaster-General and on behalf of the Scandinavian sponsors of the proposals that in this new agreement, if it is made, there will be no modification of the agreement for any country and that only those will be permitted to participate in the arrangement who are prepared to accept the full obligations from the outset.  The possible consequences of the conclusion of an agreement on the lines suggested by the Scandinavians on Anglo-Irish trade is now the subject of intensive study. It is our intention that there will be further discussions on that aspect of the matter in London in the not far distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken at considerable length and there are still many activities of the Department to which I think Deputies will expect reference in my introductory speech.  I shall run over them as quickly as possible.  The Estimate for Aviation and Meteorological Services shows an increase of £468,530 as compared with the sum granted last year.  The principal reasons for these increases are the constructional works which are in progress at Shannon Airport, the provision for the new Cork city airport, provision <Col N="590" /> for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and increased contributions to international aviation organisations consequent on our emergence as an operator in the transatlantic field.</P>
    <P>In the case of Shannon Airport, aircraft landings last year at 11,600 represented an increase of ten per cent. on the number of aircraft that used the Airport in 1957.  The number of passengers handled there was almost 500,000 which was in excess of the corresponding figure for 1957. In addition to Aerlinte, B.O.A.C., K.L.M. Lufthansa, P.A.A., Seaboard and Western Airlines, Swissair, T.C.A. and T.W.A. operated scheduled services through Shannon.  Total capital expenditure at Shannon to date amounts to £3,250,000.  In the last financial year for which the figure has been computed, the year ended 31st March, 1958, the total revenue at the Airport was £598,500, and the expenditure was £520,500, the operation of the Airport in that year showing profit of £78,000.</P>
    <P>The Sales and Catering Services also had a record year.  Their turnover was substantially greater than in the previous year.  Total dollar income was almost three million dollars.</P>
    <P>Work on the construction of runways to accommodate jet aircraft was commenced in August last and the runways will be ready by the time the new jet aircraft come into operation generally.  Other complementary works have also been undertaken.  Some have been completed and work is at present in progress on a scheme of extensions and improvements to the terminal building.  A contract has been placed for the erection of an aircraft hangar and it is expected that will be completed towards the end of the year.  It is intended to lease the hangar to Seaboard and Western Airlines who propose to transfer their European maintenance activities to Shannon.  The hangar was badly needed at the Airport and it is expected that it will be of considerable benefit.</P>
    <P>Plans are being prepared for a new freight building as it is necessary to encourage the use of Shannon for freight traffic and for that purpose <Col N="591" /> modern freight facilities are desirable. I do not propose to speak at any length concerning Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  As the Dáil is aware, a Bill to establish that company on a statutory basis will be coming along and we can deal on that occasion with the intentions behind its establishment and the scope of its activities.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport also had a successful year with an increase in the number of aircraft landings and a 12 per cent. increase in the number of passengers using the airport.  The main terminal building at Dublin is no longer adequate for the volume of traffic and a new terminal building has been constructed.  It is now almost completed and will be in use in the next few weeks.  Cargo traffic also increased at Dublin Airport by about 100 per cent. over the past five years and to provide for the present volume of traffic and to cater for future foreseeable expansion, a new cargo terminal building has recently been completed.</P>
    <P>The Cork Airport site at Ballygarvan covers about 500 acres, all of which has been acquired from the former owners and contracts have been placed for the preliminary site preparation work.  It is anticipated that the airport will be in operation in 1961.</P>
    <P>As I anticipated in my statement last year, Aer Lingus suffered a financial set-back in the year ended 31st March, 1958, when a number of factors including the participation of other operators on routes formerly served by Aer Lingus and the opening up of new services to the Continent combined to reduce the surplus on operating account of £226,700 in 1956-57 to £33,719 in 1957-58.  I am happy to be able to report that the position improved considerably last year.  In the first half of the year, the surplus on operating account was almost £100,000 in excess of that for the corresponding period of the previous year and it is hoped that when the accounts for the full year become available, they will show that that improvement was maintained.</P>
    <P>The Aerlinte transatlantic service between Shannon and New York was <Col N="592" /> inaugurated last year and was extended to Boston in October.  During the coming summer, the service will operate daily in each direction.  The service, in conjunction with the services operated by Aer Lingus, provides a link between New York and Boston on the one hand and points in Britain and on the Continent, on the other. During the first 10 months of operation&mdash;which ended on 31st March&mdash; Aerlinte carried 14,781 transatlantic passengers.  As the House knows, the Aerlinte service is operated with aircraft and crews leased under agreement with the American airline, Seaboard and Western.  That operation is limited by order of the United States Civil Aeronautics Board to 1st May, 1960.  The long-term future of the service was considered by the Board of Aerlinte and the conclusion was reached that the service should be continued eventually by aircraft owned and operated by Aerlinte and they recommended that the aircraft to be acquired for that purpose should be three medium-sized jet aircraft.</P>
    <P>They considered that the most suitable type for the needs of the service would be the Boeing Model 720 aircraft.  Following discussion of the proposals of the company in my Department, they were approved by the Government.  It is expected that the jet aircraft will be delivered in time to permit of their introduction to the service at the end of 1960 and consideration is at present being given to the arrangements to be made for the operation of the service from the period 1st May, 1960 to the end of that year.</P>
    <P>In order to meet the future financial requirements of the air companies, the Government have decided to introduce legislation to increase substantially the authorised share capital of Aer Rianta and that legislation will come before the Dáil shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given a very lengthy review of the activities of his Department. I do not know whether this might be regarded as his swan song as Minister for Industry and Commerce. If it is, it is only natural that he should attempt to paint as attractive a picture as possible of the state of our economy.</P>
      <P>While the Minister dealt with a great number of matters that come within the ambit of his Department, there was one notable exception.  The Minister made no reference to the present extremely high cost of living, to the fact that over the last two years, and particularly over the last 12 months, there has been a further rise in the consumer price index and to the fact that the cost of living is now pressing heavily on all sections of the community. From the figures published in <i>Economic Statistics</i> issued prior to the Budget it was apparent that the cost of living continued to rise all during last year.  There had been a further increase in the consumer price index from 111.5 in 1957 to 117 in February of this year&mdash;ten points higher than it was in February, 1957, before the change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That increase affected in particular the prices of essential commodities.  I should have thought that there would have been some explanation offered as <Col N="594" /> to what has happened to the level of prices, particularly prices affecting essentials such as bread, flour and butter.  In that context it has to be remembered that during the same period less was paid to our producers for wheat and to our milk suppliers for milk supplied to creameries.  Simultaneously with these imposts, the people have had to bear the additional burden of increased bus fares.  Those who had the misfortune to fall ill had to bear increased hospital charges.</P>
    <P>In so far as domestic prices are concerned, the relevant factors are within the control of the Government, particularly in relation to the price of home-grown wheat and milk supplied to the creameries.  At the same time the Government have had the advantage of a continuous drop in import prices.  On average, import prices over the last two years show a five per cent. reduction as compared with the price level in February, 1957.  That reduction has been available to the advantage of the Government.  Although that is so, and although we are paying our own producers less for the two commodities I have mentioned, there has nevertheless been a rise in the cost of living over the last two years.  That rise has continued right through this year and up to the time of the last published figure.  That figure, of course, does not include a variety of extra burdens that our people have been obliged to carry both directly and indirectly.</P>
    <P>In so far as the figure reflects the economic indices and the existing price level of commodities in general use, there has been&mdash;this has continued right up to the present time&mdash;an increase in the cost of the ordinary commodities used by all sections of the community.  The ordinary necessaries of life&mdash;food, transport, what are termed &ldquo;health charges&rdquo;&mdash;all cost substantially more than they cost a year ago and substantially more than they cost two years ago.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that industrial progress has not been sufficiently rapid to provide employment for those seeking work each year or those who leave the land.  Despite the very considerable inducements offered by successive <Col N="595" /> Governments the rate of progress is disappointing in many respects.  It is quite inadequate to absorb the numbers who come either fresh on to the labour market or who leave other occupations.  The present and the past rate of emigration indicates the magnitude of the problem. On the basis of the figures which have been compiled and published in recent publications&mdash;notably that by the Secretary of the Department of Finance and the normal statistics&mdash;it appears that the average annual rate of emigration is something in the region of 40,000.  The numbers absorbed into industry over a lengthy period stand at about 4,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>It is true, as the Minister remarked, that there was last year an increase in the numbers employed in industry&mdash; that is, in industry as defined in the industrial census.  In relation to the figures for insurable industrial employment statistics of the actual numbers employed present a less satisfactory account.  In Table XII of the <i>Economic Statistics</i> issued prior to the Budget it will be seen that in 1958 there were 32,000 fewer people employed as compared with 1956.  A considerable drop took place not only in those employed on the land but also in building and construction work.</P>
    <P>The actual numbers employed in manufacturing industry showed an increase of 2,000 over the figure for 1957, but the figure of 188,000 was the same as that for 1956.  The over-all picture showed a drop of 32,000 persons in employment in 1958 as compared with 1956.  If the figure is taken for the total number in the labour force&mdash;that is, those not currently at work as well as those actually employed&mdash;the drop is still 25,000, the difference between 1,216,000 in 1956 and 1,191,000 last year.</P>
    <P>When account is taken of the fact that, according to a reply given in the British House of Commons last year, for the first ten months of 1958, 48,000 new employment permits were issued to persons from this country who had gone to Britain in search of work&mdash; which I suppose in round figures shows that about 50,000 new applicants for <Col N="596" /> permits were employed in Britain last year&mdash;we have some idea of the magnitude of the problem which confronts the country.  For that reason, the publication by the Government of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, and the booklet entitled <i>Economic Development</i> which was prepared by the Secretary to the Department of Finance in collaboration with officers of other Departments, must be welcomed.  It is, in many ways, a tribute to the work of the previous Government in so far as it catalogues a number of schemes which were initiated by the previous Government, as well as by this Government.  It shows what is being undertaken and what schemes are under way, as well as generally indicating Government policy.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it appears from figures that have been published recently, from the general impression given by those figures, that something more requires to be done in order to stimulate greater economic activity, and to encourage the further expansion and development of industry, as well as a further expansion of our economy generally.  One of the useful conclusions which can be drawn from the various examinations conducted by this economic survey carried out by the various Departments is that they spotlight what has occurred in several instances.  In the course of my remarks I want to refer to particular industries and generally to spotlight what has occurred in certain cases, and to see if there are any proposals for expansion in those cases as well as an explanation of what has occurred in so far as there has been a decline in some.</P>
    <P>One of the matters referred to in <i>Economic Development</i> is the decline in what were regarded as traditional exports.  Reference is made to biscuits and cakes and certain very significant figures have been produced.  Chapter 17 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The biscuit industry was once one of our strongest export industries, sending its products all over the globe.  In 1929 exports of biscuits exceeded £500,000 and imports were only £11,000.  Exports had declined by 1940 to £298,000 while imports <Col N="597" /> increased to £19,000.  In 1957, exports were valued at only £86,000&mdash;</P>
    <P>of which the bulk went to the Six Counties&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;while imports were valued at £120,000.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The substitution of an import trade for a once flourishing export trade is most regrettable.</P>
    <P>Later, mention is made of the fact that if capital is a limiting factor, the Industrial Credit Company should be able to provide the necessary facilities. It is satisfactory to note that the published figures of what is, I suppose, the largest biscuit factory in this country, show an improvement, but it seems to me that, very often, in our search for new industries, and our desire to promote industrial undertakings, inadequate attention has been paid to existing industries.  If there is an explanation for that, I should be glad to hear it and whether the Department of Industry and Commerce, as a result of discussions or information&mdash;not necesarily the details of new firms, but generally&mdash;consider there are factors which militate against the maintenance of what was once a valuable trade and if any steps can be taken to develop it.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the other specific case I wish to mention, which the Minister referred to in the course of his remarks.  In pre-war years, the exports of spirits amounted to an average of 230,000 gallons per year and that included exports to Britain, the Six Counties and the United States.  That refers to the three pre-war years 1937, 1938 and 1939.  After the war, exports grew steadily from 1948 to 1951 and reached a peak in the latter year of 438,000 gallons, valued at £558,000. Here is the significant point.  &ldquo;They declined steeply in the next three years but have since begun to recover.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe that the decline in our exports of whiskey is a direct result of the heavy taxation on spirits which was imposed in the 1952 Budget.  I know that the rate of taxation does not affect the exports, but it has a limiting effect, in so far as once the trade becomes <Col N="598" /> depressed here at home, and once heavy taxation is imposed, it causes a reaction, and one of the features of the distilling trade is that the distillers are obliged to carry very heavy stocks for lengthy periods.  It seems to me to be unsound Government policy, and unsound national policy, so to raise taxation as to cause that effect.  There can be no other conclusion but that the heavy taxation imposed by the 1952 Budget had an effect on the export trade.</P>
    <P>We find that last year a special sum of £25,000 was given to C.T.T. for the purpose of developing a trade which was at least going in the right direction up to 1951 and which then declined. It is gratifying to note from the figures given by the Minister that there was a rise of 12 per cent. between the last quarter of 1957 and 1958.  I believe it is bad national policy to allow taxation to reach a level at which it has a reaction on a valuable trade, a reaction which, according to all economic experts as well as those who consider this matter but who might not come within the category of experts&mdash;it is a trade which is based on home-grown raw materials which produces an article second to none and provides male employment&mdash;brings us back to where we were seven or eight years ago, and which even this year involves further expenditure in order to stimulate development in that direction.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which come within the responsibility of the Department of Industry and Commerce is the tourist trade.  The income derived from tourism is considerable, but, for some reason or reasons, it always appears to me that there is little national consciousness of the importance of the tourist trade to the economy.  To a certain extent, I feel that may have been due to the ineffectiveness of the old Tourist Board which, for many years, had an unenviable reputation.  While this is not so now, and has not been so for some time, the legacy may still hamper the exploitation by Bord Fáilte of the country's tourist potential.  In that connection, I believe that sufficient inducements are not yet offered to <Col N="599" /> hotel keepers and others to provide accommodation, that the taxation relief which is available is not sufficient because of the shortness of the tourist season here, and that serious consideration should be given to providing further inducements, either by relief or by the provision of whatever loans or other facilities are necessary.</P>
    <P>One of the disappointing features is the lack of initiative in the matter of resort development, in many cases. I understand from recent statements that it is proposed this year to provide a substantially larger sum for resort development, for the provision of amenities at seaside and other tourist resorts.  In that connection, I believe that while the major resorts are obviously the most important, consideration should be given, wherever possible, to the provision of facilities in smaller places.  In some cases, these smaller resorts or areas have no other industry, no other means of attracting business, and anything that will encourage development, in the sense of bringing visitors and providing a stimulus to trade by the influx of visitors, whether from here or abroad, is to be welcomed.  Very often because of the mere size of a proposal, because it was a small proposal, it did not attract attention and was not considered adequate to warrant development by Bord Fáilte and the authorities concerned.  It is for that reason I believe that the use of the moneys which are now being provided should be dispersed as widely as possible.</P>
    <P>I especially want to urge on the Minister to press forward with the scheme for the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour facilities, a scheme which has been under consideration for a considerable time.  It is one of the main gateways to the country, a gateway through which a great number of visitors come and, whilst facilities there have been improved, it is obvious, if we are fully to exploit the potentialities of the tourist trade, much greater development is necessary.  That scheme for proper development should include, if necessary, facilities for a ferry service.  In any case, it is a <Col N="600" /> matter of urgency.  Because of the nature of the work it will take a considerable time and, for that reason, discussions and arrangements between the authorities concerned should be pressed forward with the maximum speed.</P>
    <P>During the course of the Minister's review, reference was made to grants provided by Foras Tionscal for the establishment of industries under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  In that connection, I wish to refer to the proposals concerning Shannon Airport.  It may well be possible to have a fuller discussion on this when the measure is introduced here, but it does seem to me that despite the very satisfactory figures of landings and activities generally at the Airport last year, we should carefully consider the future prospects of all those who are employed at Shannon.  Reference has been made in the publication <i>Economic Development</i> to decentralisation.  It says, at page 159, paragraph 10:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been general policy for many years to favour the decentralisation of industry with the aim of bringing to areas away from the larger centres of population some share in the employment and other advantages resulting from industrial development.  It is time to consider whether this is a correct policy to maintain in the conditions which we are now facing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe that a striking case in point is Shannon.  While everyone is anxious to see employment maintained at Shannon at the highest possible level, technical development in aircraft, with the possibility of Shannon being overflown, has, for a long time, agitated the minds of all concerned, as well as the possible consequences of such an eventuality on employment there.</P>
    <P>While attractive inducements have been offered for industrial development, so far these inducements would appear to have had small returns.  I want to stress the point: is it not time to look at this afresh, to consider whether this policy has achieved, or is likely to achieve, the aims desired?  Would it not be better to offer these attractive arrangements to anyone who is prepared <Col N="601" /> to establish an industry, or industries, either at Limerick or Ennis, where advantage would be taken of existing facilities and where, for the most part, all those at present employed at Shannon already reside? In addition to the labour force available, housing, schools and other facilities are in existence.</P>
    <P>It seems to me this is the realistic approach to the problem, that unless the raw materials for a specific industry are imported by air, or unless the manufactured commodities produced there are exported through the Airport, then of itself there is no attraction in establishing an industry at Shannon, or of endeavouring by artificial stimuli to induce people to establish industries there.  It seems to me that the obvious solution to the problem is to provide at either or both of the two places mentioned, the city of Limerick and adjacent to it or the town of Ennis, the same inducements to industrialists to establish industries in either of these places as are offered at the Airport.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which come within the ambit of this Department is mining development.  The satisfactory account which was given of the developments at Avoca and elsewhere justifies the decisions taken to exploit the mineral deposits there.  One of the matters referred to in the course of the survey of economic development is the geological data available at present and which were considered in many cases out-of-date.  If there are any prospects of further development here it is considered necessary to have up-to-date data available.  A recommendation was made in the course of this survey that if necessary additional funds should be provided so that an up-to-date survey might be made of the resources and of the potentialities.</P>
    <P>Because up to the present no minerals have been found in many parts of the country or because there is a general impression that our mineral resources are not considerable there is a somewhat pessimistic approach to it.  Nevertheless changed conditions, modern methods, and so forth, have made it possible to exploit commercially some of the existing <Col N="602" /> minerals and it is for that reason I believe our geological survey should be developed to such an extent that a modern survey could be conducted to establish whether or not minerals exist or, if they do exist, whether it is possible to exploit them on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>The reference which the Minister made to the present stage of the free trade negotiations shows that the whole question is still at an inconclusive stage and it is difficult in the absence of anything like full information to express any opinion on the trend of these negotiations.  It always seemed to me that the prospect of anything like a Free Trade Area coming into being as was originally understood or envisaged in early references to this matter was far too optimistic. However, no matter what trend these negotiations take our anxiety should be to see that none of our existing trading arrangements is affected adversely. We have certain traditional arrangements.  Some of them may not be as important as formerly but we have arrangements, particularly in the case of Britain&mdash;they were formerly under Imperial preference, which I think is now known as Commonwealth preference, with members of the British Commonwealth&mdash;which offered us certain advantages.  In addition we have new trade agreements with continental countries and these bilateral agreements have been negotiated over a number of years.  Some of them run for a yearly duration while others run for longer.  It is time to consider the results of these trade agreements.</P>
    <P>In most cases our trade with the continental countries is heavily adverse and while we have advantages in relation to certain specific exports, we should, when these agreements come up for revision, take care to see that we utilise any powers available to us to penalise those who, for any reason or by whatever means, seek to avail of the advantages of the agreements and leave this country in the position in which we are buying substantially more from continental countries while our exports to those countries remain more or less constant.  It is true that we have had over the years an increasing <Col N="603" /> trade with the Continent but although an increase has taken place, there is side by side with that a heavy adverse balance.  We should consider the revision of these agreements and certainly any action which can be taken to correct that adverse balance will have the support of the House as well as the support of those directly concerned.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce is responsible to a very considerable extent for most of the State companies.  In the main, the attitude of these State bodies to the public and to individuals amongst the public is satisfactory, whether it is at a high level or a low level.  Occasionally, however, events occur which show an intolerant or a dictatorial attitude in dealing either with individuals or with groups.  It should be impressed on the directors, who in turn should pass it on to the staffs of these bodies, that they are in a privileged position by virtue of legislation passed by this House and that while they have the responsibility to ensure that the affairs of the body concerned are not adversely affected by people exploiting individual grievances, and so on, the maximum courtesy should be extended in all cases.  There is a far greater obligation on State companies to show an example in this regard, more especially when they are in most cases dealing with individuals, many of them simple people who have not available to them the contacts or in some cases do not know how to go about raising a problem or having it dealt with.</P>
    <P>While in the main the directors, the management and staff of all State companies display an admirable attitude in these matters I believe that is not so in some cases which come to mind, whether they are dealing with individual cases, with a group, with a large number of residents in a locality or with particular interests.  Every care should be taken to ensure that, while the company, the directors or the individual, as the case may be, maintain and are in a position to maintain and safeguard the welfare of the undertaking concerned, full consideration should be given to the interests of individual <Col N="604" /> persons whether they are seeking advice, seeking to have some problem settled, seeking an additional service or whatever may arise in the course of their business with the undertaking.</P>
    <P>The fact that there has been a lack of confidence in the capacity of the Government to solve the problems which confront the country is, I believe, due to a considerable extent to the propaganda which this Government carried on when in opposition, that, if elected, and if there was a change of Government, many of the problems then affecting the people would be solved.  It is not possible by a mere change of Government to solve some of the problems we have been discussing today and to surmount many of the difficulties which affect the economy, particularly the difficulties of providing employment.</P>
    <P>If the figures made available just before the Budget and if the general picture presented by economic statistics of various kinds as well as the publication of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> indicate that there is a realisation generally of these problems, then it may do something to help in solving them.  One is struck by the impression that the Government are complacent about conditions and about the general state of the economy. The figures I quoted today and the fact that, despite favourable conditions last year, despite stable economic conditions, despite the fact that the terms of trade were in our favour, despite the fact that we had for over two years the advantage of falling import prices, comparing the figures for last year and 1956, the gross national product showed a reduction of about £2,000,000 are a warning that the efforts made so far and the policy adopted so far have been insufficient to provide remedies necessary to solve the problems, if we are to provide a better standard of living for more of our people.</P>
    <P>I have never held the view that Government action alone can solve these problems.  I feel that one of the greatest disservices that can be rendered to a country is the belief that a change of Government, or Government policy, or Ministerial action will provide a remedy.  It will require the <Col N="605" /> co-operation not only of the Government but of all sections of the community if we are to provide a better standard of living for all our people. According to available evidence, it seems we have fewer people in employment and fewer people in the country.  It may be that some of those who are here are getting a better standard of living but, whatever the reason, the general lack of confidence may be attributed to the propaganda that a change of Government could solve problems.  Despite the fact that the Government have a majority in this House, stable economic conditions and a constructive Opposition, nevertheless these problems exist.  Unless a maximum effort is made by all sections &mdash;by the Government, by other Parties in this House, by employers and trade unions&mdash;unless we can utilise the combined wisdom as well as the combined strength of the country to develop the economy, then all plans and proposals, the various schemes referred to in the different publications, will not achieve the objectives which all sections of the community and all sections in political life desire to achieve in order to provide a better standard of living for more of our people.</P>
    <P>The fact that attention has been paid to the publication of these programmes is itself satisfactory, in so far as it denotes a realisation of the position. From the proposals contained in <i>Economic Development</i> as well as the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> are concerned, it would appear that the Government have adopted plans and proposals and existing schemes which were operated both by the previous Government and by this Government and that on general lines of economic policy there is a large measure of agreement.</P>
    <P>That agreement should as far as possible be widened so as to develop to the maximum extent the economic potential of the country, with a view to ensuring that when economic policies are decided, there will be no sudden or rapid changes such as occurred in the cases I mentioned&mdash; particularly in the case of taxation of spirits&mdash;which have a retarding effect and an effect which it takes not merely <Col N="606" /> years but money and time and effort to overcome.  For that reason, it is satisfactory to find such a wide area of agreement on the Programme for Economic Expansion and in the survey which accompanied it on aims on economic policy as well as on the practical measures which must be taken if the full development which is desired is to be exploited properly and effectively.</P>

      <P>We listened today to a speech from the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the activities of his Department for the past 12 months.  He spoke for about one and three quarter hours.  He referred to many of the activities of his Department. At the end of his speech, I felt we had probably listened to one of the dullest and most pedestrian reviews of the Department of Industry and Commerce I have ever listened to here.  The Minister read at length.  The most one could listen to was that such and such a thing was under review, such and such a matter was considered, such and such a thing was receiving attention.  The only two bright spots in the long and dreary review were that the Whitegate Refinery would be in production in about two months' time and that the Avoca Mining Company is now apparently about to move to the crest of the wave.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that we have already pledged the sum of £5,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees over the next three years of which the first third has already been paid.  We now hope to be able to awaken the interest of the public in this project on a large scale and we are confident that the Irish people will respond generously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. The prices of fat and store cattle in 1959 have been well above the levels of previous years, there being, of course, a normal seasonal decline <Col N="613" /> about this time each year.  I do not think I should attempt to make any forecast as to the outlook for this trade for the months ahead.</P>

Surely the Minister can give us an indication as to the trend?  If he reads the market reports, as I assume he does&mdash;if not his advisers read them&mdash; he must know that the price of cattle has been falling steadily during the last four or five weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress, I said that while the Minister had made a long statement, he had not made a statement which imbued anybody with any enthusiasm, nor did he give the impression in any sense that there was in operation in his Department any vigorous drive or any great or high-level ambition for the purpose of energising many fields of potential activity which would provide possible sources of employment for our people.  The Minister ran along for 1¾ hours in a rather pedestrian kind of statement, such as could be read at the meeting of any non-essential body throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Nothing in what the Minister said gave the slightest indication that the White Paper, <i>Economic Expansion</i>, was seriously in the forefront when that statement of his was prepared. Nor was there any effort by the Minister in his statement to repair the serious omission by the Minister for Finance in the course of his Budget statement when he too read a long statement but failed to give the House and the country the slightest indication as to what the impact of the Budget would be on our economic development and expansion.</P>
      <P>Here we have the two chief Ministers in the Government.  The Minister for Finance says nothing whatever as to what the effect of the Budget statement will be on national productivity, economic progress and our national well-being generally.  He is followed later by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who reads a long statement, which could be prepared by a perusal of the various files, saying: &ldquo;Such-and-such a thing has happened since last year; we shall do such-and-such a thing this year; we are examining this, that and the other thing and we hope to come before the House at a later date with some legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that has a queer ring and flavour compared with what the people were told in the month of February, 1957. <Col N="620" /> They were told then that the only thing necessary was to get the inter-Party Government out of office, that immediately the country would hum with activity and that women would witness the glorious spectacle of their husbands going back to work.  The gentlemen down in Cork issued on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party a leaflet saying that the moment the inter-Party Government went out of office, Fianna Fáil would put into operation a plan for putting 100,000 people into new jobs in the next four years.  Two years have gone by and the Minister for Finance has not told us where the 50,000 new jobs which should have been available by now, in accordance with the Cork promise, are to be found.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce made no reference whatever to the effect of anything he said today on the prospects of greater employment in the country.  In between the two statements made by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes the little grey book, issued with the Taoiseach's benediction by the Statistics Office, which tells us that there are fewer people in employment today than there were in 1957, 1956 or 1955, that less and less employment is being provided on the land and that opportunities in industry or elsewhere for new employment are not sufficient to take up the serious sag in employment on the land.</P>
    <P>When one considers the Minister's statement against the background of the promises made in February, 1957, that the entry of the Fianna Fáil Government into office would immediately transform the economic face of the country and provide abundant employment for unemployed people, one can see no evidence in the statement of any serious effort to redeem the promises then made.</P>
    <P>The two main promises then made were that Fianna Fáil would find 100,000 new jobs in four years. Deputies will remember the famous posters indicating that when Fianna Fáil got into office, they would &ldquo;get cracking&rdquo;.  It now looks as if they have &ldquo;got creaking&rdquo; because there is no evidence of the 100,000 new jobs. On the contrary, there are fewer <Col N="621" /> people in employment today than there were when the promise was made that they would &ldquo;get cracking&rdquo;.  It is now only a memory, if it is not, as it was intended to be, an illusion.</P>
    <P>There were two bright spots in the Minister's speech.  One was that the Whitegate Refinery will be on stream, to use the vernacular of the petrol world, in a month or two and that then we shall have in this country, for the first time in history, an oil refinery, into which went an investment of approximately £12,000,000 of foreign capital.  When the agreement was negotiated with the three groups which established the refinery, during my time in the Department of Industry and Commerce, I was badgered by questions in this House as to what agreement was made with them, what were they promised, what concessions were to be given to them, were we not selling out, as if the whole world were bursting to locate an oil refinery in Ireland.  In spite of all those embarrassing questions and in spite of many of these foolish and irresponsible statements, we completed the agreement with the Whitegate oil people and the oil refinery is in operation to-day, notwithstanding the fact that it was the aim and object of the Fianna Fáil Party at the time to play down that achievement.  They have lived now to find an honoured place for that achievement in the Minister's Estimate speech and it is one bright spot on an otherwise pretty bleak horizon.</P>
    <P>The next bright spot is the Avoca Copper Mines.  When I came into office in the Department of Industry and Commerce, there were about 60 people employed in the Avoca Copper Mines.  Forty of them were to be sacked and the other 20 were to be kept on as caretakers to prevent the mines flooding.  The 40 were never sacked and the other 20 were never employed as caretakers.  We kept them going at production work and, finally, after long negotiations with mining groups in different parts of the world, we were able to conclude an agreement with the group which is now operating the Avoca copper deposits.</P>
    <P>The copper deposits have been <Col N="622" /> exploited; the mineralised area has been explored as never before; a formal opening of the new company has been made; a first class location plant is installed there.  There are more people employed at Avoca today and at better rates of wages than ever before and Avoca becomes another bright spot in the Minister's speech today.  These are the two bright spots in the Minister's statement and the fact that they are there is due to the negotiations, the ingenuity and the progressive outlook which characterised the inter-Party Government in these fields of endeavour.</P>
    <P>So far as many of the other matters mentioned by the Minister are concerned, I do not think they are even worthy of comment, except to say that they have been noted, because they indicate no progress of a kind which would justify comment, certainly no progress of a kind which would justify commendation.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister said that, under the Industrial Grants Act&mdash; another progressive Act which was introduced by the inter-Party Government&mdash;grants have been made for 17 new projects.  The Minister has now indicated that certain amendments, the nature of which he did not disclose, are to be made to that Act in respect of the administration of the Act.  I hope that, in the interest of fair play, the Industrial Grants Act will not be repealed or so emasculated as to be useless in the areas in which it was intended to operate.  At present, very substantial grants are given in respect of industries located in undeveloped areas.  The State makes a grant of the entire cost of the factory and 50 per cent. of the cost of machinery and a further grant in respect of the training of labour.</P>
    <P>In the rest of the country, outside the undeveloped areas, no grant whatever was payable from State sources for the establishment of an industry. As many Deputies who represent areas which are not undeveloped areas know, there are many small towns throughout the country in which there is no industry whatever and which are as denuded of industry today as they <Col N="623" /> were 40 years ago and which are not likely to get an industry, unless there is some means whereby potential industrialists can be assisted to establish industries in them.  In some of the undeveloped areas, because of the operation of the Undeveloped Areas Act, a number of industries have sprung up and in the urban areas, in the so-called undeveloped areas, there are now more industries and more people in industrial employment than there are in many towns of equal size situated in areas which do not come within the scope of the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    <P>The previous Government felt that steps should be taken to provide some measure of assistance for those small towns and rural areas in the south, the east and the middle of the country for which no grants were available for the establishment of industries.  We put through the House the Industrial Grants Act, the purpose of which was to make grants available to the extent of two-thirds of the cost of a new factory, subject to a maximum of £50,000, provided the factory was established for the production of goods which were imported and would give substantial employment.  The passing of that Act did something, and can do something more, to redress the balance between the generosity extended to the undeveloped areas and the complete absence of any grants in the eastern, southern and central parts of the country and I hope that the Act will be maintained so that many small towns in the east, the south and the centre of the country, which are not within the under-developed areas, may be able to get, under that Act, a reasonable grant where the industry to be established fulfils the purpose for which the Act was designed.  I hope there will be no effort to strangle the Act because, of course, I know it was not loved by the Fianna Fáil Party when it was introduced in the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the E.S.B. and its generating capacity. Apparently, reality has been reached in this connection.  I remember here in this House having long acrimonious <Col N="624" /> discussions when we discovered something which apparently was not intended to be conveyed to us as a Government that the E.S.B. had more plant than they could use and that, in fact, it was proceeding to construct more plant than it wanted and that between 1954 and 1957 they had plant which, without any addition whatsoever, was sufficient for its needs up to 1961, 1962 and 1963.  Still the Board were going along merrily installing plant which they could not use.  When that was examined, it was discovered that the Board had based their policy on an estimate by the direction of the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce that it should construct its plant on the assumption that the demand for electricity would double, I think, every 5½ or 6 years.</P>
    <P>Of course, in the light of the facts, that was a fantastic estimate.  The demand for current never doubled at anything like the rate of every 5½ or 6 years.  At no time between 1954 and 1957 did it look as if it would ever double in anything less than from 11 to 12 years.  But the Board were allowed to create new plant which they did not want on the mistaken basis that the demand for electricity would double itself every 5½ or 6 years.  That estimate that it would double itself in that short period was higher than the increased consumption of electricity in any country in Europe.</P>
    <P>I defended then the fact that the E.S.B. were directed to cut down on the installation of plant which they did not want and which they could not use and that they could erect the plant whenever they saw the need for new plant arising.  The result was that we delayed the installation of certain plants because they were not required by the E.S.B.  We said that all these optimistic estimates in regard to the demand for current doubling itself every 5½ or 6 years were completely unrealisable.</P>
    <P>The Minister now tells us apparently that for the past year the increase in the demand for electricity was at the rate of 7 per cent.  It would be nearly 14 years before the demand for electricity could double itself at that rate.  This has been evident and has been evident every year since we told <Col N="625" /> the E.S.B. to delay the installation of their plant, even though at that time the Fianna Fáil Party denied that the E.S.B. was over-planted and wanted to contend that there was justification for basing a development programme on doubling figures which were never realised and could not be realised in this country any more than they were realised in any other country in Europe.</P>
    <P>I remember, too, the time when the invitation to people in other countries to invest their money or to bring in technical know-how was not as popular as it appears to be nowadays.  The Minister is now glad to welcome foreign industrialists here with technical know-how and with financial support to back that technical know-how. I think that is good.  It is an intelligent appreciation of what we need here.  There was a time when that was rank heresy, if it was not, indeed, treachery.</P>
    <P>In the world in which we live, we have begun to wake up and see that other people not less nationalistic or less patriotic than we are find it necessary, where they have not got the technical know-how, themselves, to seek that technical know-how, whatever it is, and to use, explore and exploit it for the benefit of their own country without any loss to their patriotism or to their high conception of nationality.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference in the course of his speech to the finances of Aer Línte, though he did give us some glimpse as to the finances of Aer Lingus.  We might have been told at this stage of the financial situation of Aer Línte.  I want to say at the outset that if Aer Línte is to stay in the skies, I believe it has got to get into the business of the jet aircraft.  I say that because of the fact that we are in 1959 without any adequate appreciation of the extent to which air travel will be used in the years that we cannot see and that, therefore, if we are to stay in that business, it is essential that we should employ the most modern aircraft in order to get and maintain good customers.  Good customers will not chance Atlantic flights on craft which they regard as less than the most modern.  That can be a sobering <Col N="626" /> thought when you reflect on the finances of aeronautics.  I hope that, whenever the story of Aer Línte is told, it will be in sober language and that we will not be given the impression that this is a new wonder which is being established by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I looked recently at the accounts of Scandinavian Air Services which is an air company catering for the three Scandinavian countries.  It carried last year 1½ million passengers, much more than any of our craft are capable of carrying.  The income from its activities last year was £38 million.  It never made a penny on last year's activities, so that, in the air, apparently, you can have an income of £38 million in an aircraft company and still not make one penny.  The fact that the company has an income of £38 million from 1½ million passengers shows it has a pretty good long haul of money on its passengers.  I think the Minister might have told us something more about Aer Línte.  I do not think we will get anywhere by not recognising what exactly we are up against in the air. The competition not only by advertisements but by other companies in other countries is such that it will make it a difficult job for us to stay in the air. We may have to face up to the fact that to stay in the air in the light of possible developments in the air across the Atlantic will be an exercise which will in the long run cost us a fairly substantial amount of money.</P>
    <P>I think that probably the most sobering feature of the Minister's speech&mdash;it is one for which I do not hold him responsible&mdash;was his reference to the discussions which are taking place in Scandinavia as to the possibility of setting up another trading group consisting of Scandinavia, Britain, Austria, Switzerland and Portugal. It is quite clear that this is a counterblast to the establishment of the Common Market in Europe. Apparently those responsible for the Scandinavian proposal believe they can in some way offset their losses due to the establishment of the Common Market by the establishment of a trading concern such as they have in mind.</P>
    <P>I think this Scandinavian proposal, apart from not having any ingredients <Col N="627" /> likely to be beneficial, has many ingredients that are dangerous from our point of view, I do not know yet if it has been definitely agreed that agriculture is to be excluded from the Scandinavian proposal but it will be ruinous from our point of view if the parties to the Scandinavian convention come together and make an agreement to dismantle tariff barriers and if that agreement covers not merely industrial development but agricultural development as well.  If that should happen, according to what the Minister said, the Scandinavian group want to complete the dismantling of tariff-barriers in a shorter period than did O.E.E.C.  They want all tariffs eliminated within five years.  In other cases they want tariffs removed immediately. Even if Britain were to associate herself with a Scandinavian agreement of that type and applicable to industrial development only, the position would be bad enough from our point of view, but if, in order that British industrial goods could get into the Scandinavian countries, Britain were to &ldquo;let up&rdquo; in any way on the protection which she now affords to her agriculture and in which we share very substantially, the consequences for us could be nothing short of catastrophic in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>Personally, I can see how the establishment of the Scandinavian group will possibly hasten the day of unity in the matter of the establishment of a wider Free Trade Area in Europe. Very often when organisations of this kind are created many faces have to be smudged in the course of unscrambling the egg, and, as we know from history, faces have become the most delicate piece of mechanism imaginable when somebody's feelings have to be hurt.  If the Scandinavian proposals reach the stage when they come to fruition and take definite shape, I feel I can say I dislike the ingredients within that group; I certainly dislike the British association with it because of our interest in the British market and because of the long-standing and mutually satisfactory arrangements which we have with Britain and conversely, which Britain has with us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> The Minister said&mdash;and rightly, I think&mdash;that the proposal is one which is of concern to us.  He added that in his view&mdash;and I think the view is shared by the British Minister with whom he had a discussion within the past 48 hours&mdash;that the world is moving towards great commercial blocs now as it has moved towards Great Power blocs.  We are living in that kind of world and if we have to make our way in it, merely to declaim that this is mother Ireland, it will not count for very much in the fierce competition in all classes of exports.  We must make up our minds whether the possible emergence of this second bloc from Scandinavia will inevitably hasten the day when we have to ascertain where we think we can do best from the commercial point of view and into which group we think we can best fit.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that we cannot hope to get into the European Common Market at present; it is quite obvious also that we cannot join the Scandinavian group because that group will allow only people to participate who can accept all the obligations of membership without qualifications.  According to what we have heard from the Minister that means the immediate abolition of some tariffs and the abolition of other tariffs more speedily than originally contemplated by O.E.E.C. and complete eradication of tariffs within the group after five years.</P>
    <P>We cannot contemplate that without committing economic suicide and so there is no likelihood of our getting in. We cannot get into the Common Market; and we cannot trade with Eastern Europe.  For a variety of reasons&mdash;transport, currency regulations and so on&mdash;there are large parts of the world with which we cannot trade in any way.  In a situation like that we must ask ourselves: &ldquo;What are you going to do?  Where does your best interest lie?  In what direction are you going to travel?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may be a very painful thing to have to review a policy that has been pursued for a long time but it would be a very stupid thing to pursue a policy when the reasons for pursuing it are no longer present.  If what the <Col N="629" /> Minister visualised to-day is likely to develop, a Scandinavian group side by side with the Common Market and no early likelihood of a Free Trade Area in Europe, we must seriously think of what we can do to sell what we produce at the best possible price and at the same time sell it in an organised and systematic way which will enable us to evolve a permanent industrial and agricultural economy. This may very well bring us close to reviewing our relations with our neighbours, the British.</P>
    <P>We have a trade agreement with the British that has worked to the benefit of both countries.  In the world in which we are now moving, one which is forming into blocs none of which appeals to us and from some of which we are excluded, it seems to me that the Government could do very much worse than sit down and ponder on the trade agreement of 1948.  In this changing world which now seems to be about to change more rapidly to our disadvantage, they should find out in what way we can extend that trade agreement so that it will provide wider opportunities in that market not merely for our agricultural and dairy produce but for aspects of our agriculture which have not yet been properly evolved because of the difficulty of getting a guaranteed market for them while at the same time preserving a right to export industrial goods the import of which is permitted so far as Britain is concerned especially as that import can have only a very trifling influence on the supply of industrial goods to the British market.</P>
    <P>It may well be possible to hammer out a deal with the British who are an industrial people, a deal by which we can get more and better facilities and over a long period for our agricultural and dairy produce of all kinds and under which we can maintain our right to export to them industrial goods because of the fact that we have the right to do so at present and because our exports do not impact very heavily on the British market.  If we can sell elsewhere overseas, we can try to do that also but selling elsewhere overseas has meant to us in the past that countries buy £1 worth of goods from us for every £10 worth we buy from <Col N="630" /> them.  That is a one-sided arrangement which may prove a very doubtful asset to our economy.</P>
    <P>In the new circumstances, it may very well be desirable to review our whole position.  Subject to safeguards for our industries&mdash;these are vital&mdash;it may very well be desirable to reopen the whole matter to see, in the new circumstances which confront us and in the more dangerous circumstances which lie ahead, whether it would not be possible to make at this stage a long term agreement with the British mutually advantageous, advantageous to them inasmuch as we would sell to the British as much as they could take at an economic but rewarding price and we, in turn, would, in appreciation of that action on their part, take from them goods which are at present bought in countries from which we have to buy £10 worth of their products before they will buy £1 worth of our products.</P>
    <P>I know that a review of our policy in that field will be very painful. Speeches have been made in quite the opposite direction.  People have talked, and invoked God's thanks and His blessing because the British market was gone and gone forever.  But it may well be cowardice at this stage to pursue a line of policy when the justification for it is no longer present. Confronted with that set of circumstances as revealed by the Minister's speech, I think what we need now is hard, tough and fresh thinking to ensure that whatever decision is taken will be motivated by doing the best we can in present circumstances.  We ought not to clog our minds because of vain regrets that the things we hoped for in the past did not come to maturity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate introduced by the Minister is of particular interest.  First, in introducing it, he is introducing one of the most important Estimates and one which covers a very wide field in relation to trade and matters dealing with employment.  Secondly, we may assume that he is to a large extent the mouthpiece of the Government.  He will probably be more than merely the mouthpiece of the next Government. It seems to be an open secret that the Tánaiste will in the near <Col N="631" /> future be the Taoiseach.  From that point of view, we must take particular heed of what he said to-day.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the general policy of the Department of Industry and Commerce, I should like to deal with a matter about which Deputy Norton has just spoken at some length. The Minister has played a part of paramount importance on behalf of his Government in the negotiations in relation to the Free Trade Area.  I cannot help feeling considerably concerned at his remarks to-day.  I understood him to say that negotiations are going on between seven nations and the result of these negotiations may lead to an alternative trading group to offset the effects of the Common Market, or what is now known as the Economic Community, originally founded by six important trading nations.</P>
      <P>Further, I understood the Minister to say that these discussions have been going on between Britain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria and Portugal.  The discussions have not actually reached official level but it is presumed that they will be taken up at Governmental level in the very near future.  He said that, as a result of his conversations with Mr. Maudling, the British Paymaster General, who has been connected with the negotiations which were unsuccessful in the Free Trade groups, the matters that were considered by these seven nations were full commercial freedom for every country&mdash;a very significiant pointer indeed&mdash;and the elimination of industrial tariffs over a period of five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Norton has very rightly pointed out, the major portion of our trade is with the United Kingdom.  Let us make no mistake about it: the United Kingdom stands to gain just as much from our trade as we do from hers.  Geographically she is perhaps more fortuitously placed than we are. At the same time <i>per capita</i>&mdash;let no one forget this&mdash;we buy more from Britain than does any other nation.  <i>Per capita</i> the quantity may be small, but what I have said is nevertheless true. We are under no economic compliment <Col N="632" /> to Britain, and it is in her interest that our economy should be viable and sound.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind then that Britain is carrying on negotiations with certain other countries and these negotiations are bound to have serious repercussions on our economy.  The Minister made two statements which must give us cause for concern.  I read in the daily papers to-day&mdash;the Minister did not advert to the matter in his statement this morning&mdash;that the Minister has had discussions with Mr. Maudling and both of them are perfectly satisfied with the way things are; there is no need for a further agreement. In the House to-day, the Minister said there was no need for us to be represented at the discussions taking place between these seven nations. Each of these nations will be in a position to make its own trade agreement. Probably in the course of the discussions each nation will be making a trade agreement.  The Minister has told us that these discussions will reach Governmental level in the near future. Simultaneously, he says, there is no need for us to be represented.  Has he such complete trust in British policy from the economic point of view in relation to this country that he is prepared now to leave everything entirely in her hands?  For what does he think the Scandinavian countries are negotiating with Britain?</P>
    <P>The Minister must know as much about the Free Trade discussions as I do.  He has been discussing the matter and attending conferences in Paris for many months past.  He must know that Denmark is considerably concerned about the setting up of the Economic Community.  He must know that Denmark has serious doubts as to whether her extensive agricultural imports into these countries will be maintained in the future.  From that point of view, surely any discussions that take place are of vital interest to this country.  Even if we are not going to take part in the discussions, we should have an observer there and we should know what is going on.  With full commercial freedom, we should be in a position to know what trade agreements <Col N="633" /> and what discussions are going on behind the scenes.</P>
    <P>Is it not quite obvious that if Britain can extend existing agreements and make certain trade agreements with other countries, it might be at our expense?  I am not referring so much to the industrial arena, because in the industrial arena, we have our imperial preference, but to the agricultural community.  It is of the highest importance to us that we should be represented at these discussions and that we should not be in the vicarious position in which we now are in relation to Britain, in which we will hear what is happening second-hand from them.</P>
    <P>If I am wrong in what I say, I shall be glad if the Minister will correct me, when he is winding up this debate, but from what I have been able to read in the papers, and from what I know of European negotiations, the whole set-up regarding the Free Trade Area, we should know what is happening at these discussions.  It may be necessary for us, to a certain extent, to play ball with Britain with regard to retaining the benefits we have, but at least we have the right to be in on these discussions and to know what is happening.</P>
    <P>Quite recently, the French and the British had negotiations.  The French were negotiating on behalf of six countries and the British were negotiating on behalf of the other nations in the Common Market.  I asked a Parliamentary Question in this House and I was told by the Minister that the British were acting entirely on their own behalf and not on behalf of other countries of the Free Trade Area. That was not my information.  I had heard Professor Erhard, a German economic expert, at a conference in Europe which I attended, saying that France was negotiating on their behalf and Britain on behalf of the other nations.</P>
    <P>The reason I want to mention that is that I do not consider our interests are being sufficiently safeguarded at these conferences.  It may be that the majority of the people in Ireland think <Col N="634" /> that the economy we have had over the years is the best economy.  People may think this vital change in the economic set-up in Europe as a whole will not occur but that is only wishful thinking.  We are living in an era now when with the political situation which exists throughout the world as a whole, no nation can afford to stand alone whatever happens.  There must be some form of economic agreement among the countries of Europe and if there is not, it is very doubtful that the free world can survive as an entity.  That is a sound indication that a small country like this whose interests are so vital should be fully represented.</P>
    <P>The Minister should regard the discussions going on now as being sufficiently vital to the interests of Ireland to participate in them firsthand. I ask him to direct his thoughts in that direction.  He may very well say in reply that the negotiations which are going on are really a counterblast to the Economic Community or the Common Market in Europe, that other countries find themselves divided in respect of the Free Trade Area negotiations which have broken down and unable to come to a communal agreement and that these discussions have been set up for the purpose of being used as a bargaining power against the other six.  That may well be.  If it is, it is all the more vital that we should play our part.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Minister's statement as a whole.  The Minister is very good at indicating to Dáil Éireann&mdash; I heard him before during the years I have been here&mdash;that everything is lovely around the corner, that plenty of legislation will be introduced, that there is an improvement in our economic position, that he has plenty of plans and projects and that he feels the economic outlook for the future is good.  We have got to accept the fact that emigration is running at a very high rate at the moment and we have also got to accept the fact that this White Paper, <i>Economic Expansion</i>, was written for the Government by their expert advisers as being the policy of the Government.  I understand a very distinguished civil servant was the prime mover in that paper, that he prepared it for the Government <Col N="635" /> and that he reviewed the entire economic programme, aided and abetted by other expert advisers.</P>
    <P>As I understand it that paper stresses the fact that agriculture is the foundation of our industry and that to ensure that we absorb our unemployed and keep our people at home in full employment, we must concentrate on the by-products of agriculture for industrial purposes.  I did not hear the Minister, in the course of his speech, give any indication whatsoever as to any hard and fast plan to absorb people into employment, nor did he really give us any economic policy whatsoever.  I would ask the Minister: Is he satisfied with our present economic policy?  If he succeeds in becoming the head of the Government in the future, and if he is assured of a long period of office&mdash;which I have no doubt he desires&mdash;is he satisfied that the present policy as it relates to industry will create the situation that is so necessary here?</P>
    <P>Is he satisfied that the inducements his Department and the Department of Finance are offering to industrialists to come in here will bring the requisite results?  Is he satisfied, when we have apparently so much to offer to other countries, with plenty of labour available, a fairly easy standard of living, an absence of industrial disputes and all the happy things he places before the public, that all these things are sufficient to build up our economy so that we may have a sounder and more viable economy than we have at the moment?  I did not hear anything at all in his speech to indicate that.  I do not think there was any indication in his speech that there was any likelihood of a number of new industries starting here.  As Deputy Norton so happily put it, the only note of optimism he struck was that the Whitegate refinery and the Avoca copper mine were coming into existence, both of which were instituted and brought into being during the period of the last Government.</P>
    <P>If we are to have any sort of viable economy here we want some sort of a policy.  People may wonder, when we offer all these benefits to industrialists <Col N="636" /> of different countries to come in here to set up industries, when we tell them we are prepared to build factories for them, that we have the labour available, that we have credit and everything else, why they do not come.  Two things strike me as the cause of that.  One is that taxation on industry, not so much the rate of taxation but the reliefs that are allowed on developed industries here, are very considerably less than reliefs in other countries.  The remissions of taxation that enable firms to plough back their profits into industry and to expand are not anything like sufficient in this country.</P>
    <P>Another object that strikes me is the lack of marketing facilities.  It is all very fine to talk about a policy for economic expansion but there is no reason why we should not economically expand here, except for the fact, as I say, that there is not sufficient relief in taxation to enable industries themselves to expand, and by themselves expand our economy, provide employment, and keep our people at home. One trouble is the fact that the market is not always very secure. It may be to a certain extent that that is a responsibility of the industrialists themselves.  Industries were a new feature in our life.  We had not very much in the line of industry when we set up a native Parliament.  Maybe new industries working behind a protective barrier may have grown easy, so to speak, assured that they are protected by this barrier and, therefore, can make sufficient profits selling on a protected home market, sufficient to enable them to keep their factories in full operation to ensure a profit. Surely, if that is the case it has not met our requirements in the industrial sphere?</P>
    <P>If this White Paper, <i>Economic Expansion</i>, proves anything it is that it says we can only hope to expand our economy, to increase our employment and to retain our emigrants at home by expanding industry.  Therefore, some serious thinking must be necessary in the industrial arena if it is on that area itself the expansion of our economy so vitally depends, and I believe that is the case.  I should like <Col N="637" /> to suggest to the House also that in endeavouring to build up industries here, we have not paid sufficiently close attention to the raw materials that we always have available.  The only raw materials we have available to any degree are the by-products of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Recently we have been fortunate enough in the South of Wexford to have an industry which is in process of starting, after prolonged and difficult negotiations.  It is a cheese-manufacturing factory.  That in itself is something that seems to be making for a viable economy.  A Continental firm is coming here to manufacture a particular type of cheese for which there is a considerable market not only in their own country, to which they propose to export the cheese, but also in the United States and Canada. There is a market in Britain for another form of cheese which they will manufacture.  That seems to me to be sound economy, the type of economy of industrialisation that is so essential to this country.</P>
    <P>Heretofore if anyone came in and got all the facilities possible, including protective tariffs, and a grant for the building of a factory and employed 50, 60 or maybe 100 people in one particular area, that was regarded as a terrific triumph on the part of the Government and on the part of those whose duty it is to promote industry in this country.  I think it has been proved over the years that that is not the case.  That is false economy because you start with importing the raw materials, and, by importing the raw materials, we utilise some of the money that would be available to us for other purposes.  In effect, what we have been doing over the years is that we have been relying on our exports to pay for our imports, and we have been importing raw materials for our subsidised and protected factories. That is where our economy has gone wrong and somebody in this Parliament, or the State servants who are responsible for promoting industries and looking after our economy, must do some serious thinking in the near future.</P>
    <P>We have had 40 years of self-government <Col N="638" /> now.  I have always felt that the first Irish Government, the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government which was so much criticised in this country, was not very far wrong in its policy.  They started industries, they imposed taxation but they imposed it with discretion and discrimination. They thought out their case well beforehand, and they relied, as the foundation and basis of our economy, on agriculture.  They were criticised by the Fianna Fáil Party when that Party came into power. The Fianna Fáil Party swept into office in 1932 and they entirely reversed that policy.  Their policy was to impose tariffs and, if anyone wished to come forward with a few hundred pounds in his pocket and had some kind of industrial know-how, or pretended he had, he was allowed to start an industry.  I submit to this House that many of those industries were parasitic on the State, and landed us in the unhappy economic position in which we find ourselves to-day.</P>
    <P>I did not hear anything in the Minister's statement to suggest he had a policy, or rather that he had a change of policy.  I do not suppose one can expect the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has been the architect of these things of which I am speaking, which I say were wrong, to admit that.  However, I think there has been some serious thinking amongst the Fianna Fáil Government and they have decided that their policy has been a wrong one.  That is why I say one would have expected that this senior Minister, introducing this Estimate, would have given us some indication as to what their future policy is, some indication as to what they intend to do to rectify the situation which is satisfactory to no one, no matter on what side of the House he is.</P>
    <P>We all know they promised jobs at the last election.  We know the promise that people would be brought home to work.  That was political clap-trap but that type of thing happens at election times, particularly when the Fianna Fáil Party are expressing to the electorate what they propose to do.  We know what to expect <Col N="639" /> from them when they make such statements.  However, that is not the point.  The point is that they are in power with a large majority.  They have had plenty of time, with no political worries, to formulate a policy but it is not in this Estimate that the policy is to be seen.  I have been extremely disappointed that the Tánaiste spoke vaguely all the time and laid down no hard and fast rule whereby any Deputy listening to him, whether behind him or on the opposite side of the House, could have any hope of any fundamental change in our economic system.</P>
    <P>Another matter that worries me is that the Government appear to think there is considerable expansion possible in the building of ships.  The economic trend in the world does not appear to indicate that.  The major shipyards of Europe, where people have been building ships over the centuries, and are past masters of their craft, are unable to sell their ships. There is a considerable recession of orders and at most of these shipping centres there is a great deal of unemployment. Notwithstanding that, we apparently, according to the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> have a considerable scheme for constructing ships.  There may be some sense in building tankers because they are scarce, but the present position is not as it was ten or 15 years ago when with the heavy losses in the war there was a tremendous demand for ships. If money is to be put into such a scheme, it will be money doubtfully spent.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to bear in mind that, whatever happens in Europe in relation to any agreements going on there, it is as important to us as it is to any country in Europe to maintain any arrangements we have with Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister's opening statement which dealt with the Common Market and various other markets but dealt very little with conditions in the home market.  The <Col N="640" /> Minister mentioned that during the past year there were 95 new industries or extensions to existing industries.  The Minister should have been a little more realistic.  There is a tremendous difference between a new industry and an extension to an existing industry. We take it for granted that a new industry will employ at least 20 people but an extension to an existing industry might not mean the employment of one extra person.  It might just transfer a person from one department to another or mean opening one new branch of the industry and closing another.  The Minister should have been more specific and told us how many new industries were established, how many extensions to existing industries there were during the past year and what would be the likely employment content of extensions to those industries.</P>
      <P>During the past two years we were all hoping the Minister would implement the plan which he had proposed at various meetings in Clery's Ballroom and elsewhere.  At that time he explained the blueprint for prosperity which was to give employment to 100,000 people during the four years following the change of Government, if there was to be a change of Government. It is hard to get away from the impression that that was just an electioneering stunt and that it was brought in for the purpose of swaying people on the eve of the election to vote for Fianna Fáil.  It was a plan apparently devised by a man who had occupied the office of Minister for Industry and Commerce for 16 years, a man in whom both industrialists and workers had a share of confidence. He was not just a member of one of the small Parties and they felt that if the Minister was confident in his plan for the employment of 100,000 people during the four years following his taking office, his Party deserved support and there was a lot to be said for the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are in office two years and, instead of 100,000 more jobs being provided, 30,000 fewer people are at work than when the Government took over.  That is very disappointing not alone to the workers but to businessmen <Col N="641" /> and industrialists because if those 130,000 people extra had been at work their wages would be in circulation and the shopkeeper, the industrialist and every other person connected with business, including the farmer, would have got a share in the wages which these 130,000 people would have earned.</P>
    <P>The Minister said today there was a slight improvement or increase in employment in industry.  That may be so. There are a few thousand more people working in Whitegate, Cork, due to the energy and interest of the inter-Party Government.  Those 2,000 people have been working during most of the past year in Whitegate; likewise in Avoca there are 500 people at work, not due to any plan of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  When the inter-Party Government came into office there were 60 men employed in Avoca and instructions were there from the previous Minister, Deputy Lemass, that 40 of these were to be dismissed within a reasonably short time, and 20 were to be left there as a maintenance staff so that the mines would not be flooded. As Deputy Norton mentioned, there are two solid points in the Minister's speech today relating to improved employment since their Government came into office.  However, it is not due to the policy of the present Government or anything like that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that 180 proposals are before the Government at present for new industries.  I can take it for granted that he does not expect that all these will materialise but he said that about 50 per cent. would.  Then he gives an estimate of employment in these new industries which, I gather, is 4,000&mdash;or was it employment in industries in the undeveloped areas?  However, 4,000 was the only figure he estimated for employment in new industries. That is very poor.</P>
    <P>We must realise our present emigration position.  During the past year, 50,000 Irish persons applied for insurance cards in Great Britain.  That meant that 50,000 persons left our shores.  Because of the policy of the present Government, many people were forced to leave our shores.  I did not <Col N="642" /> wait to hear the end of the Minister's speech but, up to the time I left, not one word was uttered by the Minister as regards our own people and the cost of living.  He did not utter a word about the increase of 20 points in the cost of living in the past two years.</P>
    <P>The position at present is that, between the high cost of living and high rents, a married man cannot exist on unemployment benefit.  Had the cost of living been established anywhere near where it was, there might be some chance for a man to exist but now, not alone can he not exist on unemployment benefit but he cannot exist on temporary employment.  Even with temporary employment, a man is practically forced, due to the action of the present Government, out of this country.  The cost of living is very high.  Rents are very high.  Fares have gone up.  Everything has gone up. Apparently the Minister just says: &ldquo;Let them find their top level and, when they do, they are bound to come back again.&rdquo; No effort is made to cushion anybody against the terrible increases in the cost of living which we have had to endure in the past two years.</P>
    <P>I hate to have to remind the Government of their election slogans.  I hate to have to remind them of &ldquo;Get Cracking&rdquo;.  Many of our people thought that, if they just changed the Government, if they put the inter-Party Government out and returned Fianna Fáil to office, they would have no trouble at all, that the key to prosperity was there and that all Fianna Fáil had to do was to turn it.  We were told about this plan and that the key to prosperity was there.  Could you blame the people for giving the present Government the greatest majority ever for that?  For two years the present Minister for Industry and Commerce was producing plans to put 100,000 persons in employment; that was while he was in Opposition.  Things were tough at that time due to the imposition of the levels, and so on. Things were tough on the farmers due to the dumping of Argentine meat in Britain.</P>
    <P>When a responsible man such as the present Minister for Industry and <Col N="643" /> Commerce paints a lovely picture for the people so that they are led to believe that there will be a substantial improvement in their economic position you cannot blame them for falling for it, and they fell in a big way. The present Government has the greatest majority any Government has had since the State was founded. Therefore, the Minister cannot argue that he is held up or frustrated in his efforts to implements his plans through not having a sufficiently large majority behind him.  He knows that any Bill he introduces here will go through. Even the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill to which so many people objected was passed because the Government had a large majority.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister is quite satisfied now.  He has a few thousand more employed in manufacturing industries. There is no reference to the 30,000 persons who left the land.  In a way, the Minister can be held accountable for the fact that quite a number of these people have had to leave the land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am taking about employment, not agriculture.  At present, people are applying for contracts to grow beet.  People are being refused these contracts.  That is happening at a time when the Minister for Industry and commerce is giving import licences for the importation of raw sugar.  If the Minister did not give these licences and if our people could get a few more beet contracts would there not be more employment on the land?  At present, the beet crop gives much more employment than any other crop&mdash;wheat, oats, barley or anything else.  Nevertheless, the Minister gives a licence to the Irish Sugar Company to import raw sugar while he denies our own people contracts for beet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know families who got lump sums <Col N="644" /> of £50 for thinking six acres in the past season.  Would it not be a great help to a man with a family, if he had a share of unemployment in the winter, if he could get £50 here and £20 there to maintain him and his family in this country rather than be forced to go to Britian?  The Minister is forcing that man to England. He is forcing more emigration on the people by refusing beet contracts and thus preventing the farmers giving employment.  As I have said, 30,000 people have left the land. The Minister's action is not helping to re-employ them and he should consider that point.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a wonderfully fine opening speech.  It was very nice to give bouquets here and there.  I do not deny that the directors of Fuel Importers (Eire) Limited, who gave their services free for so many years, are quite entitled to receive a bouquet. We do not deny that the trade union organisation were quite entitled to a bouquet for splitting their differences so that one union instead of two unions now goes to the Minister.  We are all delighted with that.  However, the Minister should get down to hard facts.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday a woman said to me: &ldquo;This is no poor man's Government.&rdquo; I replied: &ldquo;I could not say but you are right.&rdquo; She did not mention anything about industrialists or anything about funds for the referendum.  That appeal was not mentioned.  She made the point that the cost of living had gone very high.  She was not saying that the industrialists were behind the Government.  She said: &ldquo;Look, since they went into office, everything we have had to buy has gone up.  Even the Minister for Local Government sent word down that the rent on every house is to go up by 2/-.&rdquo; I think that woman's expression was like a slogan such as &ldquo;Wives, get your husbands to work.&rdquo; Her slogan was &ldquo;This is no poor man's Government.&rdquo; She made her point very well.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Electricity Supply Board.  We have a strong Government. If we had not, any Minister for Industry and Commerce would have taken some notice of all the protests, day after day, about the E.S.B. cutting off the power in practically every house in <Col N="645" /> the country.  In quite a big number of cases they had a special staff.  In the old days, the landlord had an eviction staff to evict people from their holdings if they did not pay their rent up to date.</P>

I was very glad to hear the Minister say that the Labour Court is handling that matter and that it is hoped to have it settled in the near future.  Then our industries, and particularly the agricultural industry, will be able to avail of that traffic.</P>
      <P>I would again appeal to the Minister to look into the question of the cost of living at home.  I know that he feels that he has let it go to the top, but it has not come down from the top and it is very hard on the ordinary people to carry on with the cost of living as it is.  This Government has, by deliberate action, brought about the high cost of living.  I would ask the Minister to look into these matters and try to give the people an opportunity of living in their own country.</P>

If I had stumped this country by calling on the women of Ireland to vote for me in order to get jobs for their husbands, and if I had to tell them that there were 30,000 fewer husbands working than there were on the day when the people were invited to help to beat the crisis by voting for Fianna Fáil, and implementing the Lemass plan designed to provide employment for 100,000 extra workers, I suppose I would be strongly tempted to absent myself from the debate on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>Not one single member of the Fianna Fáil Party has even offered to speak in connection with the employment for which the Minister is supposed to be responsible, but I do not blame them.  If I had promised the people a stable cost of living and was obliged to face them two and half years later with 4d. on the loaf of bread, 7d. on the 1 lb. of butter and 2/6 on the stone of flour, I would find it difficult to intervene in this debate. If I had to face the people after the declaration by the Minister for Finance on the Budget Resolutions that he assumed that the decline in the employment figures was due to emigration because the facts were that there was a substantial reduction in employment, if I were a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, I would be reluctant to participate in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has a great deal to answer for, for I think it was he who encouraged his colleagues to stump the country and to reassure the people that there would be be no removal of the subsidisation of food prices and that there would be employment for all if he were given a chance.  I think that we of the main Opposition Party have probably been remiss in that we have leaned backward in order to give the present administration an opportunity of showing what they were able to do.  It was not reasonable to expect&mdash;although this is what they promised&mdash;that overnight they could perform what they declared themselves as desirous of performing. They have had now close on 2½ years&mdash;two years in any case&mdash;and what have they to report?  That we <Col N="649" /> have 30,000 fewer men at work in the country than we had two years ago, that the cost of living has gone up substantially and is still rising, and that the Minister is still full of hope that if he turns enough corners and reaches the top of sufficient crests, something will emerge upon the other side.</P>
    <P>It is much too late for blatherskite of that kind.  The plain fact is&mdash;and the country might as well face it sooner as later&mdash;that the Minister's policy of economic self-sufficiency, inaugurated by him in 1932, has blown up.  It is dead, damned and discredited.  It has signally failed in the purpose for which it was inaugurated.  Remember what that purpose was.  It was to provide full employment over the then population and to bring home the emigrants to fill the vacancies the policy of economic self-sufficiency was guaranteed to produce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Maher, who has now honoured us by his company, was then in his cradle, and from the bosom of that cradle he looked forth upon a world in which, by the guarantee of the Tánaiste, there was to be employment in abundance for all.  The Deputy has got a shock, has he not? Economic self-sufficiency has not done for his neighbours what that hopeful infant hoped might happen.  The unemployment and emigration problem in this country today is more acute than the day when Deputy Maher first crowed in his cradle. Remember that is the only rational test of policy; not the promises with his proclamation, but the results after it has had a full and fair trial.</P>
    <P>Will anyone deny that the whole illusory fraud of economic self-sufficiency has had that full and fair trial?  Will anyone deny that it has signally failed to provide employment for our people in their own country? I want to ask this House are we to go on stumbling down this illusory path to economic self-sufficiency, or are we now ready to face the fact that it is a fraud, that it always was a fraud, that it has cost us dearly in the past and could encompass our ruin if persisted in?</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister a question. <Col N="650" /> He recently has been in Paris breast-high for the negotiations of the European Free Trade Area.  He was quite satisfied on his return that if certain concessions were made for the protection of some of the exotic industries he had established here&mdash; and which he said himself were, even after 20 years, quite unequal to the blast of free competition&mdash;the Free Trade Area would be a desirable development.  Those negotiations have failed and collapsed.  The Minister has now returned from London to tell us that as far as he can see as a result of his discussions with Mr. Maudling, the Swedish plan for a new Free Trade Area, comprising the Scandinavian countries, Denmark, Switzerland and Great Britain, has no attractions for this country.</P>
    <P>Apparently we were prepared to participate in the Free Trade Area plan, although there is little prospect of its materialising now.  But what will happen if the Swedish free materialises?  Ireland will be faced on the one side with the Swedish free trade area, in which we will not participate, and on the other side, by the Common Market of the Six European countries, in which we also have no party to play.  In the circumstances, what will this country do?  Are we to go on for ever tagging after the Common Market, tagging after the Swedish plan, tagging after everybody else's plan, or are we to try to take some initiative ourselves for our own protection and the employment of our own people?</P>
    <P>Surely if this Dáil has accepted in principle the Free Trade Area idea and if we agree with the Tánaiste that it is a matter of regret that that has not been pursued and must be for the time being laid aside, from our point of view, we ought to go to the customer dealing with us as to 80 per cent of our exports, and for whom we are the second biggest export market they have in the whole of Europe, and make the case to them: &ldquo;We were agreed with you in your interest in the Free Trade scheme.  Now that that has been abandoned, can we not sit down together, on a basis of relative equality and say we, as your second <Col N="651" /> best market in Europe, and you, as our best market, will negotiate a comprehensive trade agreement broadly along the lines of the Free Trade Area agreement which has collapsed?&rdquo; Can we not between ourselves hammer out a plan such as would have related us if the Free Trade Area plan had been adopted, subject to the concessions that it was broadly agreed should be afforded to Ireland, if we were to be a member of it?  Could we not give a demonstration to Europe of the mutual benefit that would confer upon both of us and give a demonstration not only to Europe but to the world that an intelligent trade agreement between a very powerful and wealthy industrial country and a relatively poor agricultural country could redound to the mutual benefit of both?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that instead of turning corners and climbing mountains that lead us nowhere, he should take his courage in his hands and do in 1959 what he did in 1948.  And remember, in 1948, there were a lot of dismal Jimmies to tell us that going to London was simply putting our heads in a halter and that we would come back with nothing.  I remember being told in the corridors of this House that if I went over to interview Sir Stafford Cripps in 1948, I would only break my political neck.</P>

      <P>It is proposed that the Dáil should meet on Friday, contrary to the decision already taken.  It appears that in order to repair this blunder made regarding the election circular, special legislation will be required, and with the consent of the House we could arrange to have that legislation introduced and passed through all Stages on Friday.  If that arrangement is agreeable to the Opposition, we shall proceed with that.</P>

    <P>NOTE.&mdash;Contribution rates were increased on the 3rd September, 1956, but some stamps at the old rates in respect of employment prior to that date were sold in the year ended 31st March, 1959.  The numbers of old rate stamps sold are shown separately except in the cases of the 2s. 6d. and 2s. rates.  It is not possible to segregate the stamps sold at those two rates between the different kinds of employment covered by them.</P>
