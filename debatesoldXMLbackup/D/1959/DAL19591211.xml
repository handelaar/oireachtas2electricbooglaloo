      <P>When the Minister for Agriculture claimed last year that the Fianna Fáil Government had been given a blank cheque by the electorate in the last general election, I suggested that, if so, the blank cheque had been obtained in return for some fairly substantial promissory notes.  I want to suggest now that a number of these promissory notes are still outstanding and unredeemed. Speakers on this side of the House have said sufficient on the question of unemployment to convince anyone, including the Taoiseach, that the promissory <Col N="1434" /> note given to the electorate, as far as unemployment is concerned, is still unredeemed and is approaching the position where it will be practically unredeemable.  The redemption date has long passed and only a short period exists for this Government to do anything to redeem that note.</P>
      <P>When I was speaking yesterday, Deputy Booth seemed to be in some doubt as to whether the Fianna Fáil Party, at the general election, had entered into any commitments with the electorate so far as the cost of living was concerned.  I do not intend to delay the House for any length this morning.  I suggested yesterday that the Government have failed all along the line and I listed eight or nine items in regard to which I thought they had failed.  I do not intend dealing with all those.  I dealt with unemployment and I want to say a few words about the cost of living.  Deputy Booth, as I say, seems to doubt that any commitments had been entered into by Fianna Fáil with the electorate. I want to remind him and the House of some statements made in the course of the general election campaign by the Taoiseach and the former Taoiseach, now President of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Speaking at Waterford on the 28th February, 1957, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 1st March, the Taoiseach had this to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Some Coalition leaders are threatening the country with all sorts of unpleasant things if Fianna Fáil becomes the Government&mdash; compulsory tillage, wage control, cuts in civil service salaries, higher food prices and a lot more besides. A Fianna Fáil Government does not intend to do any of these things because we do not believe in them. How definite can we make our denial of these stupid allegations? They are all falsehoods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day before yesterday I got a reply from the Taoiseach's Department which told me that out of 197 items used to calculate the cost of living index figure since Fianna Fáil came back into office, there have been increases in 149.  There have been decreases in only 42, and six <Col N="1435" /> of them remain unchanged.  I want to suggest to Deputy Booth that the Taoiseach, when speaking at Waterford, handed out a very definite promissory note to the electorate in the general election that there was to be no increase in food prices if Fianna Fáil got back to office.  In his usual positive, assertive manner he emphasised and underscored that commitment by asking: &ldquo;How definite can we make our denial of these stupid allegations?  They are all falsehoods.&rdquo; Within a period of less than three years&mdash;partly under the leadership of the man who went on record to deny in advance any intention of the Fianna Fáil Government to increase food prices&mdash;we find the cost of living has increased and that out of 197 items, comprised in the cost of living figure, 149 have been increased in price.</P>
    <P>It did not rest only with that commitment made by the Taoiseach at Waterford.  Speaking at Belmullet the former Taoiseach said this, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> also on 1st March, 1957:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Coalition Parties were urging the people not to vote for Fianna Fáil because there was hell around the Fianna Fáil corner.  You know the record of Fianna Fáil in the past.  You know that we have never done the things they said we would do.  They told you that you would be paying more for your bread.</P>
    <P>Taken in the context of the sentence which went immediately before that, would any simple voter listening to the former Taoiseach not be justified in assuming that what the former Taoiseach had just said to him was: &ldquo;If Fianna Fáil get back into office you will not be paying more for your bread&rdquo;?  I suggest to Deputy Booth that that was also a commitment by the Fianna Fáil Party leader to the electorate in the last general election.</P>
    <P>It did not end there.  The Minister for Justice was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 1st March, 1957, speaking at a meeting in Dublin, as describing as a &ldquo;blood-curdling story&rdquo; the warning <Col N="1436" /> by Deputy Norton in an election broadcast that Fianna Fáil, if elected to Government, would withdraw the food subsidies.  The Minister for Justice said that &ldquo;the Coalition groups, having no further promises to make for themselves, had switched to making sinister promises on behalf of Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Lynch, speaking in Dublin, is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 23rd February, 1957, as saying:</P>
    <P>A Fianna Fáil Government is the housewife's choice.  It must be; there is no alternative.  The housewife, the mother of a family, has been the greatest victim of Coalition bungling. Housewives, use your intelligence, your practical experience and your sound reasoning.  Vote in strength for the Fianna Fáil candidates.</P>
    <P>There we have a selection from the many speeches made on behalf of Fianna Fáil during the general election campaign on the topic of the cost of living.  Of course those speeches were merely the culmination of the propaganda which had been going on for months, if not for years, before that, all giving the impression to the voters that at any rate Fianna Fáil would not increase prices if they got back to office.  Whether or not it was implicit in that that prices would be reduced I am not claiming, but I do claim there was a commitment not to increase the price of food and that commitment has been broken by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Fianna Fáil have failed on the cost of living; Fianna Fáil have failed on unemployment; Fianna Fáil have failed on emigration. It is quite clear that they are in the process of failing in connection with the balance of payments.  They have failed on the question of illegal activities.  I do not want to say anything which could be misinterpreted or which could embarrass the Government, but I think it is due to the House and to the country that the change of policy in relation to that matter should be explained at some stage.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government are now on the right lines.  I think they were right to drop the policy which they pursued when they came into <Col N="1437" /> office first and changed just before the Presidential election.  I think it right that these matters should be dealt with under the ordinary courts of the land in accordance with ordinary legal process. If there is anything on which I feel I can compliment the present Government it is on having jettisoned their own policy and adopted the policy pursued by the inter-Party Government in relation to that matter. But I think some responsible Minister should explain the Government's change of policy and the reasons for it.</P>
    <P>I think the Government have failed in their treatment of agriculture.  They have been a disastrous failure in the field of external affairs and when we hear Ministers or Government back-benchers talking about confidence in the Government&mdash;as I said already it is necessary to distinguish between confidence in the Government and confidence in the country; there is every reason for confidence in the country and very little reason for confidence in the Government&mdash;Ministers and Government back-benchers must realise that sooner or later&mdash;possibly much sooner than any of them expect &mdash;they will have to render an account of their stewardship to the people. They remind me in their recent speeches of frightened schoolboys whistling to keep up their courage when passing a graveyard when they talk about confidence in the Government. There is no evidence of any confidence in the Government among the people.  The sooner the Taoiseach and Ministers realise that, the better for themselves and the country and the more realistic will be their approach to the country's affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I should first like to apologise to you, Sir, for my interruptions yesterday afternoon.  It is something I do not think I have ever done before and something I do not admire but I felt it almost impossible to refrain.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth yesterday submitted that the building industry had improved to such an extent that a builder was so busy that he was unable to take on tenders for, or be interested in, any building work in 1960.  I wish Deputy Booth would use the same privilege and let us know what builder in this country, no matter how busy, would not be in a position to tender for work. Deputy Booth spoke of people making irresponsible statements.  I have no doubt regarding his integrity and sincerity but I did not think he was so credulous or gullible, assuming that somebody made that statement.  It is true that the industry has improved throughout the provinces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent statement the Minister for Industry and Commerce was reported as saying that Cork was to be the future centre of industry.  I have no doubt that is correct.  I might say that the only contract in which I am engaged outside of Dublin at the moment happens to be in Cork.  I hope the Minister is correct in his forecast because I have come to like County Cork very much in the last couple of weeks.  Deputy Booth also stated that Deputy McQuillan would not know whether people leaving from Collinstown or Dun Laoghaire were emigrating.  Surely it is not suggested that the huge numbers returning by Aer Lingus for the Christmas holidays and the many thousands coming by <Col N="1439" /> boat are tourists?  They are emigrants returning.  Most of them are members of the building trade who have been obliged to emigrate.</P>
    <P>I am not here just to criticise the Government.  I believe that it is the desire of the Government to have the best possible conditions and to bring about an improvement.  Another Deputy said last night that the Government should find £10,000,000 and, irrespective of whether it was productive employment or not, use that £10,000,000.  Laughable as it may seem, I would suggest that the Government should raise, by some means, £100,000,000 to bring about an improvement. I say that in all sincerity. I feel that the Government and the men of this country and of this century have done as much for the Twenty-Six Counties and for Ireland as a whole as they could have done and if we were to undertake such a debt and leave it for the next generation no one would say one word of disparagement about it.</P>
    <P>I do not know anything about agriculture but, apart from the subsidies given to farmers, I think the Government could set aside one million, or a few millions, to increase by 50 per cent the wages of agricultural workers.  Their low standard of living is undoubtedly responsible for their leaving the land and I can give an example of that from my own experience.</P>
    <P>A Dublin building contractor goes down to carry out a contract in a rural district and he is obliged to pay £7, or possibly £8 a week, to labourers. Within a few days he finds he has applications from local agricultural workers and, where he is obliged to employ local labour, he employs them. Is it not to be expected that those workers will be loath to return to the land for half the amount of wages they have been enjoying during the short period of the building contract? Another instance is the agricultural worker who comes to Dublin.  Once he finds employment with a builder, his classification is changed in the labour exchange and after one or two <Col N="1440" /> weeks he can then have the passport, the freedom, to emigrate.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Government for the increase in the cost of living, I do not think it is the desire of the Government that such an increase should take place.  I think it is due to the exigencies the post-war world is going through, and the wage demands that will be supported by each one of us, whether they be for judges, Deputies, or for people in the building industry.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point to which I should like to refer, namely, the fishing industry, which was mentioned by Deputy Booth last night.  I raised this matter before and asked that some inquiry or commission should be set up to find out why fish cost so much.  I think I am in order in bringing this matter to the attention of the House by virtue of the cost of living suggestion already made.  I am informed, whether truly or not, that fish caught in Galway is brought to Dublin, sold in Dublin, and then returned to Galway and other centres.  Be that as it may, it does appear to me that the price quoted for fish in this week's papers is far beyond the means of the people who, we wish, should buy and eat more fish.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Government will put every effort into improving present conditions, particularly in Dublin.  I want to state that I would not be a party to criticising the Government just because they are the Government. Neither do I contribute to the charge that there is general pessimism, or feel it is justified that such criticism should be levelled solely with the desire of effecting a change of Government.  As Deputies, we are representatives of the people, messengers of the people to this House, to do what we can to alleviate the burdens and the distress of those who sent us here, and it would be a far more admirable approach if all sides would recognise the exigencies we are passing through and, by collective effort, try to surmount them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that though time is limited many speakers are anxious to contribute to this debate, so I shall speak as briefly as possible. <Col N="1441" /> According to Press reports, during the weekend, the Taoiseach struck a new note when he stated it was now time to get out into the country rather than, as it were, spend time discussing so many problems here in the Dáil.  The people in rural areas apparently thought that this was a new note in relation to the possibility of future activities, but, having regard to answers given to questions in the Dáil, even during the present week, it would be well to remind the Taoiseach of the importance of this Chamber in order to correct erroneous impressions given to the people.  This Chamber at least is a safeguard for people in rural areas to prevent them being misled by some members of the Government, including the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach does go out into the country, I hope he will help to straighten out one important matter in regard to a question asked in the Dáil this week.  According to Press reports, a member of the Government last night considered it his duty to correct Deputy Dillon on statistics.  I know that members of political Parties can use statistics to suit their own views, if they so wish, but I am afraid I must now say to the Taoiseach that, in the Dáil on Wednesday last, he went out of his way to use statistics in reply to Question No. 4 to give an answer which I am convinced is completely at variance with the facts.  According to that reply on the question of employment, he stated:</P>
      <P>On this basis a better idea of the post-November, 1958, position would probably be gained by comparing insurance stamp purchases in the six months ending 30th September, 1959, with the corresponding period of 1958.  Stamp purchases were 11,719,800 and 11,276,400 respectively, showing an increase of 443,400 in the 1959 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Taoiseach's answer, this is equivalent to an increase of 17,052 in the average number of insured workers per week in April to September, 1959, as compared with the similar period in 1958. It is strange that the increase here is mentioned as 17,052.  It seemed good to the Taoiseach to give an answer on <Col N="1442" /> that line; it did help his Minister for Industry and Commerce who fastened on to that answer in the debate last night, and it did help the political correspondent of a newspaper to be able to take that line this morning, but what are the facts?</P>
    <P>Exactly 12 months and one day ago, on 10th December, 1958, in Seanad Éireann, a representative of the Government, in the person of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, speaking on the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1958 on Second Stage, explained to the members of that Chamber that with the putting into operation in January, 1959, of that Act&mdash;and, of course, it has been in operation since January&mdash; the ceiling for insurability was lifted from £600 to £800 per annum, that raising of the ceiling would bring in roughly 18,000 persons. From that statement, we know that approximately 18,000 more people have come into insurability, people who, prior to the introduction of the amending Act, had not the advantages of insurability because of their earning over £600 per year.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary, the passing of that Act brought in approximately 18,000 people.  Is that not a clear and unequivocal answer to the question as to how the increased sale of insurance stamps came about?  Is that not a clear and unequivocal answer to the statement of the Taoiseach that there are approximately 18,000 more people in employment?</P>
    <P>Let us be frank in our approach to these problems.  Let us be honest about our efforts to solve them. Perhaps I have gone out of my way on many occasions to bring responsibility home but, so long as I remain a member of this House, I shall continue to do so.  The problems of unemployment and emigration are problems for which successive Governments must take a certain amount of the responsibility.  It only aggravates an already bad situation when statistics are misrepresented, the more so when we remember how the Taoiseach went out of his way, when in Opposition, to attack the inter-Party <Col N="1443" /> Government and assert that unemployment was running at a dangerously high rate and emigration was a scourge to the country.  Of course unemployment and emigration are scourges in any economy.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, the Taoiseach replied to a question and, in my opinion, his answer to that question holds out no hope for the people of a realisation of the plans and promises made by the Taoiseach when he was in Opposition in this House. I do not intend to quote now statements made by anybody at a general election or at any other time.  Time is limited in this debate and there are other people who wish to speak. We have proved, I think, that there are not 18,000 new people in employment this year as compared with last year.</P>
    <P>As far as emigration is concerned, we have the statistics given by Britain.  The Taoiseach, of course, makes statements outside this House. He does not make them here because he knows they can, and will be contradicted. In the months 1st January, 1957, to 31st December, 1957, the number of insurance cards issued to Irish nationals from the Twenty-Six Counties, who had emigrated in search of employment to Great Britain, was 58,496; in the year 1st January, 1958, to 31st December, 1958, the total number issued was 47,869.  In those two years, the tragic total of cards issued to people from the Twenty-Six Counties entering employment in Britain for the first time was 106,365.  Is that the reason why the Taoiseach goes out into the country, away from the Dáil, to tell the people about the progress made in the past two years, or so, and the benefits that have been derived from this Government?</P>
    <P>I am not accusing Fianna Fáil or the present Government for the disastrous situation.  As I said, we all have a certain responsibility.  Perhaps all of us have fallen down in some degree on the job, but the misrepresentation and misinterpretation of statistics will help neither the people <Col N="1444" /> nor the State.  I accept the official statistics given in replies to Parliamentary Questions for many weeks back.  It is important that we should accept these figures as accurate official figures.  It is important that the Taoiseach should represent the true position.  It is important that he should realise that things are not as they should be.  They are certainly not as those of us on this side of the House would wish them to be.</P>
    <P>Time is limited now, but we may be able to go into these matters more closely after the Recess.  Meanwhile, I suggest to the Taoiseach that it is important for him and his Government to be accurate in assessing the true overall position in relation to emigration, unemployment and the cost of living.  It is more important to concentrate on fundamentals rather than endeavour to establish a new hierarchy, a political hierarchy which will not in itself give the satisfactory results which the Taoiseach and his Minister for Industry and Commerce claim it will give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters to which Deputies have addressed themselves in this debate with which I should like to deal.  As I have often said in the past, much of the discussion that takes place here tends to be repetitive.  The present debate has proved no exception to the rule, and many of the points mentioned by different speakers in relation to agriculture have been thrashed out here during discussions on the Estimate over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some few urgent matters affecting the country, and agriculture in particular.  One of the first priorities is the task of clearing our livestock of bovine tuberculosis.  The leader of the principal Opposition Party asked what were we doing about the eradication of bovine tuberculosis?  Were we really serious in the way in which we were going about the task?  I gave a reply here yesterday to a question addressed to me by Deputy Manley. It is not easy to understand why any member of this House, having heard that reply, should subsequently want <Col N="1445" /> to know about the Department's efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>I was asked to state the extent of the purchase of new reactors over the three years 1957, 1958 and 1959.  The figures I gave were 8,797 in 1957; 18,512 in 1958; and 68,113 in 1959. That latter figure of 68,000 odd does not include a further figure of almost 15,000 store reactors purchased in the clearance area.  The extent of the compensation paid for reactors under the scheme in the period mentioned in the question was as follows: 1957, £306,000; 1958, £726,000; 1959, £3,334,000.  I do not think it would be difficult to satisfy any reasonable person, having heard these figures, as to the anxiety of the Government in regard to this matter.  I have heard some other criticism, not only in relation to the anxiety of the Department or the Government to deal with this problem, but of the measures being taken to secure that end.</P>
    <P>I have heard some Deputies suggest that we were not sufficiently careful so far as the clearance area is concerned; in other words, that our controls were inadequate to prevent those who might tend illegally to take in untested cattle from other parts of the country from doing so.  We have controls. I suppose they are limited; I suppose they are, in a sense, inadequate, that is, of course, if we are not to receive the co-operation of the people in the clearance area itself.</P>
    <P>When I hear, not only from Deputies but from responsible, intelligent people outside who talk to me and write to me and tell me what is happening in certain instances, I ask myself the question: is it a matter of our being expected to have a policeman standing at the shoulder of every individual who is the owner of land in those parts of the country?  After all, there is an onus&mdash;and if we are to be successful, there certainly must be an onus&mdash;on the individual who is a land owner in those parts of the country to see to it that at this stage of the development of the scheme in buying stock and effecting replacements he will purchase only animals that have been tested and are regarded as free and in respect of which evidence is <Col N="1446" /> available that they are free from this disease.</P>
    <P>We have made provision for those who want to move livestock in those areas.  We have made provision in that regard too, inasmuch as we give to those who engage in that trade or business a per head payment to enable them to carry out the necessary tests before they attempt to move cattle into that territory.  I appeal to people who make use of public meeting places, county committees of agriculture, county councils, clergymen of all denominations and people who are anxious to give whatever assistance they can in this regard, to be reasonable and to help us to put the onus on the people concerned, and to ask for their co-operation in seeing to it that this area will be classified as accredited in a very short space of time.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and has been found to be such in every country in which it has been attempted, and in countries where it has been successfully concluded.  Not only have we the Shannon frontier to contend with but we also have the Six County frontier.  In addition to the western areas that are in part bounded by the Shannon, we have the counties of Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan, which are now clearance areas, and in a short space of time we hope to add Longford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the land frontier with the Six Counties and their scheme is different from ours.  The farmer there is given certain inducements which are different from ours and which I say are not as attractive as ours.  The farmer <Col N="1447" /> there up to a certain point&mdash;I think it is up to the point where he has 50 or 60 per cent. of the herd tested by his own effort with, as I say, certain assistance which it is not necessary for me to explain&mdash;is obliged to get rid of all reactor animals that appear in his herd.  It is easy to see how difficult it is, having regard to our agreement with the British, and the movement of livestock as between the two territories, to prevent the movement of livestock that have been found to be reactors from those parts into our clearance area.  What we expect and hope is that these areas in the Six Counties to which I have referred will become areas in which the reactor animals will be taken up as the reactor cows are taken up here on a valuation basis.</P>
    <P>It is, as I say, only a small part of the country but when you look at it, you see the difficulties with which you are confronted and the need there is for co-operation if we are to get speedily to the end of the road.  People who speak in public should realise the importance they should attach to their words, having regard to the danger of saying something which will discourage or deter those upon whose co-operation we must rely.  I have made this plea or these pleas before&mdash; whether wisely or not, I do not know &mdash;and I do not think one derives much benefit from too much repetition but as the matter has been raised here, I thought I should refer to them again.</P>
    <P>In addition to our efforts in regard to the area to which I have been referring, I was anxious to encourage, to the maximum extent, the export of store cattle.  For some months, I have been working on a scheme to enable those engaged in that trade to go ahead freely, to go ahead unimpeded, by offering to take what are described in the western areas as green tagged cattle in the clearance area.  Green tagged cattle are cattle that have passed two scheme tests, cattle which the British would not accept as accredited or attested because of the fact that the area itself was not accredited or attested.  They insisted upon what was a much more severe <Col N="1448" /> test&mdash;a 14-day test&mdash;and there was a probability that a fair percentage of these green tagged cattle would fail the 14-day test and, therefore, traders and others would have them on their hands and find it difficult to dispose of them. Their money was locked up in them. I saw that that could impede the movement of trade which it was necessary to put into motion after a very bad summer last year.</P>
    <P>It was no time until we discovered, after the scheme had been introduced, that either it had weaknesses or that it was being abused.  We were fortunate enough to detect the weaknesses fairly early ourselves.  I suspended the operation of that scheme, but I want to assure the House that we have since been working on an alternative scheme which I hope to announce in the course of a day or two in order to meet that problem.</P>
    <P>If you look at the figures I have given, not only is it clear that we are serious about this matter but the organisation which we have built up has been tremendously successful so far and, as I think I said on a previous occasion, if we could only get the fullblooded and wholehearted co-operation of the people in those nine counties, there is no doubt, because of the very low incidence of the disease in our livestock there, that we could have that very substantial area cleared in a very short time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick mentioned the fact that it was wise to concentrate on this area.  Of course, it is.  If we could secure a clean bill of health for an area like this, it would be a tremendous encouragement to take other areas and by degrees cover the whole country.</P>
    <P>I think that in our treatment of this very important matter, we have not shown at any time any desire to have a fixed and rigid mind or to adopt a fixed and rigid approach.  That is as it should be.  I had a deputation with me yesterday from Cork dealing with a scheme which we introduced for five Munster counties and one Leinster county.  I think it came into operation on 1st October.  The people from Cork apparently were not or are not satisfied with the way it is worked.  I <Col N="1449" /> was very anxious to give that scheme a trial because from the very begining I should like to see the man who owned the livestock selling this livestock, whether they be reactor cows or otherwise, in his own way by the employment of somebody else or by himself and that whatever the State would give by way of encouragement in regard to reactor cows should be given as a cash payment after he has done his best to secure the commercial value of the animals concerned.</P>
    <P>I am very far from being satisfied with the arguments advanced to me by this Cork deputation because, strange to say, I have not had any complaints, I might say, from any of the other counties.  The Cork deputation complained that, because of the lack of competition in the fairs and marts, they were not getting what, in fact, was the commercial value of these animals.  Yet, as I say, apparently farmers in the other counties who were disposing of animals under the scheme were able to do so.  The scheme did not get off to a good start inasmuch as we were asked to purchase, within a fortnight of the new scheme coming into effect, 12,000-odd animals, which had the effect of choking up the canning factory machinery and providing for a sort of flow-over from 1st October and into the end of that month.</P>
    <P>As we see it now, the number of cows purchased in that area is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 15,000. I feel satisfied that these things will rectify themselves and that the scheme itself will prove quite beneficial.  It does, as I say, give that freedom to the individual to which I referred and it relieves us of employing inexperienced people&mdash;I want to qualify that by saying that it is not their fault&mdash;to go out valuing this livestock and find, as a result, that the standard of values applied is very uneven as between one valuer and another and, therefore, a good deal of criticism results between farmers who, when they are assembling their stock, are inclined to compare animals, prices and so forth.</P>
    <P>I would ask for the co-operation not only of all members of the House but of all members of local bodies.  I would appeal to them that, when discussing <Col N="1450" /> such questions as these, they should endeavour to make themselves aware of the facts before giving publicity to something that might be harmful and might be found at a later stage to be entirely inaccurate.  I think it must have been the Leader of the principal Opposition Party who, when speaking about the cattle trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister departs from the question of bovine T.B. eradication, the Minister speaks of asking for co-operation.  Is it possible to particularise?  What does he want the people to do?  Is it just to refuse to buy any but green tagged cattle?  Are there any specific things that would assist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very particular in regard to the clearance area.  It is a very simple thing.  Some of our critics say: &ldquo;You are not protecting the frontier.&rdquo;  You have not a Maginot Line there.  What I am saying as Minister is that I cannot give that sort of protection to that area.  No Minister could; no Department could.  I shall try to give what is reasonable. However, even after giving what is reasonable, I know that those who want to beat the law can get into that area, if they try, with untested cattle. When animals in Ballaghaderren, Mohill, Carrick-on-Shannon and Sligo are offered for sale, they can be sold in the main only to feeders.  Unless the farmers and feeders in the area I am talking about show concern not to purchase animals that have not been tested, I do not think we could ever build a protective wall around them that would save them from this trouble.  That is my belief.</P>
      <P>In an area where you just have free testing, things are more lax.  They have to be.  However, in an area where our work has reached a very advanced stage, we must get the co-operation of the land owners or we cannot finish it.  That is what I am talking about.  I am saying that public men can, in their utterances in all the places I have mentioned, stress the importance of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some reference was made by the Leader of the principal Opposition Party to the cattle trade.  Extravagant <Col N="1451" /> talk is very foolish.  It is extravagant talk for any of us, whether Deputies, Ministers or leaders of Parties, to say, for example: &ldquo;The cattle trade at the present time is in a more catastrophic position than it was during the Economic War.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We shall see.  I think Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture in 1956&mdash;or am I fooling myself?  What were the prices for fat and store cattle in 1956 as compared with present prices?  Would the Deputy like to correct himself now on what he actually said?  I have here the price of fat cattle on 25th November, 1959.  It is given as 118/9d. and for 2nd December, 120/-. In 1956, the prices for the two weeks in question were 91/6d. and 90/6d. For stores, the prices in the same years were 127/- and 128/- and 91/6 and 88/6 respectively.  Would any person tell me that any advantage is to be gained in a political or any other sense in our talking like that? I would not have to consult these figures at all and thousands of farmers and producers would not have to look at them as they would know that what I am saying is true. They remember the facts.  May I give a wee bit of advice?  When we talk like that, we reduce this Assembly to a laughing-stock.</P>
      <P>The price of cattle at present is lower than it was last year but it is higher than that of the previous year and of the year previous to that again and for some years before that.  I shall not contend that the Deputy was not perfectly right in saying that in many cases those who fed cattle all this summer lost money.  I admit that.  Would a man, a Deputy, a Minister especially, not be a tremendous fool if he did not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We know the facts and give the facts.  No wonder some of us when we hear of a debate on the adjournment or of a debate dealing with agricultural matters always feel that there will be an air of unreality about it.  Deputy Dillon and I have been long enough in the world to know &mdash;I have far more reason to know it than he has&mdash;that there has not been, is not now and scarcely ever will be complete security for those engaged in farming, those producing turkeys, those producing most commodities on which they depend for a livelihood. There is an element of a gamble in it.</P>
      <P>We are told that the cattle trade has been ruined so many times during my life; that the farmers have been ruined; that our exports have been declining; that the balance of payments is against us, and so on.  We hear a lot of that sort of reasoning in this Assembly.  The man outside hears about it and reads reports of it in the newspapers.  He is tremendously disappointed he is not getting a profit on the cattle he bought last April and May and has fed since then.  We all have sympathy with him.  We all get the same knock.  With irrefutable evidence of the kind I have referred to, we should not have the sort of display put up yesterday by a former Minister for Agriculture on two occasions and the Leader of the principal Opposition Party who, just for the sake of lashing out some claptrap that everybody knows is foolish, made statements of the kind to which I have been referring.  How do you think you will get political advantage out of that?  If I could only get some of you into a place for a month where I could teach you something about politics and the sort of politics and politicians that will be accepted by the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The people outside are intelligent.  They know honesty and they know tomfoolery.  The Deputy to whom I have been referring had something <Col N="1453" /> to say about turkeys.  That was the best performance of all.  It took the hardest neck any man could have to make the reference he made in regard to turkey prices.  In saying that and in proceeding to prove that I was justified in thinking that last night and that I am justified now in publicly saying it, I admit he could not do one thing about it.  In 1956 I never said a word to the then Minister because I knew he could do nothing about it. The fact is that in 1956 the price of turkeys was 5d. per lb. less than it is in this very bad year, and Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture could do nothing about it, nor can I.</P>
      <P>I was taxed here with having received a report from the Advisory Committee dealing with marketing of turkeys and it was said that having received that report early&mdash;that means a couple of months ago&mdash;to enable me to take advantage of it, I had not been very active in that regard.  Before ever a committee was set up to deal with poultry and turkey marketing, there was a tremendous amount of information in my Department on that subject and when I receive a report dealing with the marketing of turkeys or any other commodity, I shall study it carefully as I did in this case.  I shall consult my colleagues about it, as I did in this case, and I shall have the fullest possible discussion with my senior officials and advisers, as I did in this case.</P>
      <P>In this case, too, I called in the members of this Committee and spent the greater part of a day in order to procure from them what I thought I should have, further evidence to justify some of the major recommendations contained in that report.  I am afraid I must admit to the House that I did not get that additional evidence and while a White Paper has been promised and will appear in the course of a very short time dealing with all these reports, I think I can say in this regard that I was apprehensive as to the wisdom of giving effect to some of the major recommendations in that report. Deputy Dillon, of all Deputies, should not be, if he did himself justice, too far from my line of thought in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to make changes just <Col N="1454" /> for the sake of making changes.  I have no flair for establishing boards unless I can see that there is work that only a board can do and do better than it has been done already.  I do not like this scheme of things where a board set up to market turkeys would proceed to employ wholesalers, who are now engaged in that business and have been all down the years, to make their purchases, to do the plucking, to engage in the packing, to do the financing, to look after the employment side, the board fixing a provisional price in August or September.  What was the provisional price to be?  Was it to be one that would inspire confidence among producers?  If the provisional price were exceeded in the realisation of the birds, what was the machinery by which the surplus would be distributed and at what cost?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If the export price is a provisional price, as it must be, where is the guidance then for those who buy for the home market?  I have examined that report very carefully with all the people I have mentioned.  I have set up a body to watch this year's trading, a body representative of the main interests concerned.  They have been helpful so far in trying to give the maximum information as to market conditions and the most recent information would seem to indicate that the tendency is for the market to firm somewhat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reasons for refusing to accept the <Col N="1455" /> recommendations in their entirety are sound and valid.  Whatever the leader writers or the public men have to say, I would have no hesitation in going before any jury fairly composed and justifying to the hilt my decision in that regard.  If there is anyone in this House who thinks I shall just accept a recommendation because it is made by members of a body behind whom I can shelter, let me say that is not the part I shall play while I am in this Department.  If our agricultural effort can be assisted in any way by the establishment of an organisation such as that recommended or by the future efforts of this <i>ad hoc</i> committee, I shall welcome it.  But I suspect that with a board of five, set up in the city of Dublin, with a staff, an office and a phone, phoning to Cootehill and to Bantry, relying upon wholesalers who have been in this trade all their lives, employing them to do their work, fixing compensation for the use of their premises, plant and staff and then giving them a margin of profit&mdash;I know the sort of wrangling that would go on between the board and the trading interests concerned&mdash;in the end, you would find the turkey producers paying for all that paraphernalia and getting very little in return. Without having any prejudices one way or the other, I shall have to be satisfied there is a reasonable chance of effecting an improvement before I will set up a board.  I do not regard boards as cure-alls for everything.</P>
    <P>We should talk in a reasonable manner about these important subjects. I do not say that because I want to stave off attack.  I do not mind.  As Minister for Agriculture, I can take it either way.  However, I think it is foolish to attempt to prove what intelligent people outside know is nonsense and untrue, that things were never in such a catastrophic state since the Economic War ended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say that.  I know it could not be a profitable business this year.  When Deputy Dillon was Minister in 1956, he had <Col N="1456" /> to pass through a period worse than this, to the extent that turkeys were 5d per lb. less.  I did not think he was responsible for that and I never accused him of being responsible for it; but he can keep on saying until the cows come home that I am responsible now.  It does not change my opinion, nor does it change the opinion of the intelligent people in counties Cavan and Monaghan who can look at the Six Counties and see that the prices there are exactly the same as they are getting, because there are no supports for turkey prices there.  I am doing better than I thought.</P>

      <Col N="1457" /> We had the matter of parish agents trotted out as if we had never heard it before.  I am entirely in favour of providing the farming community with all the scientific advice and assistance they require; but, on this again, I am entirely unlike Deputy Dillon, who in regard to the parish plan apparently went off at a tangent.  We had the parish agent plan without a thought.  It requires a little more than that.  The Minister, the Department and the Government have to ask themselves in a matter of this nature: what form will our advisory services take?  We already had the county committees of agriculture and their staffs.  Were we to depart from that and go on the basis of an agent for every two or three parishes controlled all over the country by the Department of Agriculture?  That is the first question that has to be answered.</P>
    <P>You cannot have two services, dealing with the same people and the same problems, growing up alongside each other.  There are only about 20 parish agents altogether and we discovered long ago the confusion caused by the lack of co-operation between them and the people employed by the county committees of agriculture. Does that not clearly show to any thinking person that that first question has to be answered before we can embark on any of these schemes? This matter of trying to be spectacular lasts for only a few months.  Whatever little advantage you get will all disappear.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that, as a practical step to stimulate increased production through the improvement of the fertility of our land by badly needed drainage schemes and at the same time help to relieve unemployment in rural areas the necessary moneys to put <Col N="1458" /> the Local Authorities (Works) Act into operation should be provided immediately.&mdash;(Deputies McQuillan and Dr. Browne).</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday night I had dealt to some degree with the terms of the motion, particularly inasmuch as drainage was being related to the call for increased agricultural production by the Government.  I endeavoured to point out that the wish of the Government was clearly exemplified in this regard by the measures which they have taken and continue to take in regard to drainage, particularly arterial drainage.  I pointed out that the recent five year programme envisages during these coming years an increasing tempo in arterial drainage, rising to an expenditure of around £700,000 in the year 1961-62, which will show a 60 per cent. increase on the expenditure before this five year plan was brought into being a short time ago.  I have shown in that context that the Government fully realise the necessity for and the usefulness of arterial drainage in relation to increased and improved agricultural production.</P>
      <P>I went on at that stage to outline the arguments and the resolutions that were being forwarded continuously by various local authorities calling for the restoration of Local Authorities (Works) Act grants and made the case that £7½ million has been spent over the years since Local Authorities (Works) Act grants of 100 per cent. were introduced, that this is very big money and that the decision to continue to spend in that order is not just a matter for local authorities to decide but a major question of national economics and that it must, of necessity, be left to the Government of the day to consider the demands for money under this head as against the competing demands for money for other more directly productive purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to reiterate that of the £7,500,000 spent under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, one-half was spent on road protection works, leaving the other half for the very laudable purpose of land drainage, which has <Col N="1459" /> been the subject of practically the whole of the debate so far.  Again, from my own examination and the examination carried out by my Department of the usefulness of works carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, I am quite satisfied that only a small fraction of the drainage works so carried out were really effective and represented good spending and that that fraction was so small that it certainly does not justify the expenditure of the £7,500,000 which we know to have been expended during those years.</P>
    <P>I have also made it quite clear that in the spending of these moneys, with particular reference to the schemes that did not represent good value, no one can blame the officers of the local authorities or the local engineers.  Drainage is not their field of operation and, indeed, they would be the last to maintain that it is.  The difficulties and complexities of drainage are problems which should properly be left to those who are experts in that field, who are skilled in dealing with such matters. Local authorities are not the people best suited to do that job if there is in existence any other organisation better geared to carry out the work. Naturally, officers and engineers of local authorities have a vast variety of other work to do which has prior call on their attention.  That in itself is a fairly strong argument why this difficult and complex problem should not be shoved on to them as it has been shoved on to them under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Proper surveys were not, in all cases, made of the jobs, with the result that the finished products suffered.</P>
    <P>The other very important point which has been adverted to by a number of Deputies on all sides of the House is the fact that no provision was made for the maintenance of drainage works carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It is quite true that no one prevents the local authorities from maintaining these jobs.  Far from the case being as Deputy O'Donnell seemed to give us to understand the other night, we are <Col N="1460" /> not in any legal difficulty in so far as maintenance is concerned.  His suggestion that maintenance of any work done in the past or of work carried out under the Act could in future be by way of another new job under the Local Authorities (Works) Act does not reach the point at issue at all.  Local authorities are not prevented from carrying out maintenance work but the fact is that there is no way of ensuring that it will be done and there is no evidence that, in fact, it has been done in the case of any of the drainage works which are now falling into the condition in which they were before considerable sums of Local Authorities (Works) Act moneys were spent on them in the recent past.</P>
    <P>All these considerations, of course, were foremost in the mind of the Government when, in 1957, they decided to cease the 100 per cent. grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the arguments have not been in any way rebutted or refuted by anything I have heard in this debate so far and they are as valid to-day as they were then.</P>
    <P>We are fully alive to the fact that drainage must be related to an overall plan.  That fact was recognised as far back as 1945, in the Arterial Drainage Act and by that Act and, from that time on, we have been trying to deal with drainage as a planned operation rather than a piecemeal job that will be done and forgotten about and the land allowed to revert to its former state.  When it is piecemeal it is bad enough but when it is piecemeal without maintenance, as has been the case under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, then it does appear that money so spent in any considerable amount is money that is to a very large degree wasted after a few years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne raised a question, as one might expect, related in some degree to the problem of drainage in the city areas.  Let me say at the outset that the Local Authorities (Works) Act grants were never availed of for drainage in the city area.  The possible reason for that is that the drainage problem within the city areas and around them, can be dealt with under the <Col N="1461" /> sanitary service grants and that they will continue to be so dealt with in the future, I have no doubt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick gave the impression that it was his sound and confirmed belief that the stopping of the Local Authorities (Works) Act grants in 1957 was merely for the sake of stopping work under that Act because originally it was sponsored by some Party other than that now in Government. He would seek to convey the impression that regardless of anything else, that was the only test applied before a decision was arrived at.  I want to tell Deputy Blowick and the members of the House&mdash;and there are some members who can bear out my statement&mdash;that so far as the Government are concerned, that type of charge is entirely groundless.  In so far as I am personally concerned, the considerations alleged by Deputy Blowick carried no weight whatever.  Far from my being in any way against the ends for which the Local Authorities (Works) Act would appear to have been introduced I, at no time, in my own local authority, did anything but utilise the amount of money which was available, and available as 100 per cent. free grants from the Government.  In my own county and in my own area, it can be seen from the records that so far as I was concerned as an individual councillor, representing a given area, I tried to get all I could out of the Act.  That is just the trouble&mdash;that was the type of system it was.  You had every county trying to get everything they could because it cost the county nothing.  I got all I could out of it in my area and I encouraged everyone in my area to do the same.</P>

      <P>It was not so limited the other night.  However, to get back to Deputy Blowick and his charge that this decision was taken purely because the Act was introduced by a Government other than the present Government, as I say, that has no foundation and so far as I, as Minister, am concerned, it is very far from the truth. Deputy Blowick, as well as other Deputies, admitted that there may be faults in the present system and together with other Deputies on that side of the House, advocated amendments of the Act in order to eradicate some of these faults.  The fact that amendments are being called for by the Opposition is surely an indication that all was never well with this Act.  I am not one of those who believe that an amendment can improve it to any degree, or remove any of the objections which we have outlined in the past and which I have endeavoured to outline briefly here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I have never taken any action to sabotage in any way the effects of this Act.  I have never denied that useful work could be done under the Act but the amount of useful work done under it is so small as not to justify the huge expenditure involved. I think I have on a former occasion, on an Estimate speech&mdash;I think even this year&mdash;mentioned the one type of work which would appear to me to have been possible under the Act and which could be regarded as useful, provided you had the adequate safeguard about maintenance, which does not seem to be possible, that is, the drainage of those rivers which lie between the listed catchment areas, as we know them, under the Arterial Drainage Act, right down to the level of the Land Project operations.  In other words, that would take in those catchment areas of under 25,000 acres down to the field drainage level.  It has been and still is a problem that would no doubt eventually be dealt with by <Col N="1463" /> the arterial drainage people when they had completed their listed catchment areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I had completely forgotten that.  In regard to this matter then, let me say that the type of scheme would fall within those limits.  The type of scheme would naturally have to be properly surveyed and designed and adequate steps taken for maintenance.  The proper people no doubt to do that, as we have our general administration, would be the arterial drainage people in the Office of Public Works.  Of course the Local Authorities (Works) Act operations would only be a second best.  We have found that in the past, in regard to this matter, that the arterial drainage people were faced with two big obstacles when undertaking this work.  There was the difficulty of expanding still further and the difficulty of not having sufficient skilled staff and insufficient machinery to do this type of work in conjunction with, and simultaneously with, the larger areas to which they have been devoting their time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings us to the point at which I can inform Deputies that arrangements are now being made with the Office of Public Works and they will, in the near future, take on a certain number of this type of intermediate rivers in addition to, and over and above the arterial drainage work they are now doing.  The details of this arrangement are not finalised and that, if I may now say so, has been the cause of my seeming reluctance to reply for or against this whole matter on various questions over the months to Deputy McQuillan and others.  I want to say now that the matter is in hands with the Board of Works and we trust that they will take care of many of the rivers not forming part of the larger arterial drainage systems which are running more or less directly to the sea.  In order to avoid a bottleneck and get over the difficulty of getting <Col N="1464" /> in more skilled staff and machinery, it is proposed to employ contractors to do these works under the supervision of, and after proper survey by, the Board of Works staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take up more time than I should.  I am referring to rivers that do not form part of a larger arterial system or those flowing directly into the sea and of course those of a non-torrential nature which the Board of Works and the arterial drainage people are much better able to define than I can define them here.  When these arrangements are in operation, the position will be that the schemes which I and the Government believe could usefully be done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act will be taken care of by the Board of Works and the arterial drainage officials and done better than they could be done by any other agency in the country.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I want to make it quite clear that the Local Authorities (Works) Act grants of 100 per cent. will not be revived by the Government and that the Government adhere to the decision arrived at in 1957 and, with the new relief that we now foresee coming into being in the very near future, under the Office of Public Works we propose to deal with these useful jobs of intermediate river drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government is the most courageous man I have heard in this House since I came into it because everyone from every side of the House who has spoken so far on this motion has agreed on the absolute necessity for implementing the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Cork County Council, comprised of 46 members of all Paries, <Col N="1465" /> were unanimous in their view that it was necessary to put this Act into operation.  The General Council of County Councils, made up of members of County Councils in every county in Ireland, were also unanimous in their belief that this Act should be put into operation immediately. I realise that there were abuses in the administration of the Act but I hold that the local authorities were not to blame.  If £7½ million were spent under the Local Authorities (Works) Act in the few years of its operation, it should have done a tremendous amount of good in the clearing of rivers all over the country and I have no doubt that the intention behind the Act was to clean the rivers which were doing so much damage to land, houses, roads and property generally.  But what do we find?  Of the £7½ million spent, half was spent in road construction and I am informed some of the money was spent even on making footpaths in villages.</P>
      <P>I feel that if the Minister who produced this Act were alive, that would not happen, that he would insist that there should be no regulations under which that money would be spent in that way.  I know also regulations are laid down which compel the local authorities to spend that money in the winter when it is practically impossible to clear the rivers.  The money spent in that way was wasted to a large extent.  If the best value is to be got out of money allocated for this purpose, it should be spent in the spring, summer and autumn and not in the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea behind spending it in winter was to provide employment without any consideration for the importance of the work to be done.  I know that money was wasted but I saw one good job done under the Act in the last year in which money was provided.  It was the clearing of a river, a work which was carried out in the month of March.  It was over one mile long and the job was done for £1,000 by machinery and a few men.  If we are to clean the rivers of the country, it must be done largely on that basis.  I know the members of the Labour <Col N="1466" /> Party will not like me to say that but the fact remains that it is waste of money to expect men to go into rivers in the depth of winter, because actually they would be swept away by the floods.</P>
    <P>Good work on rivers cannot be done in winter.  It must be done in reasonably fine weather and done by excavators and drag-line crawler tractors. That is how it was done in West Cork under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  If the Minister comes to West Cork I shall show him that scheme and he can see where the bed of the river was scooped up and laid out in the fields and the maintenance of that river will not worry the Department or the county council for many a long day because the job was done properly.</P>
    <P>I am not so worried about maintenance as the Minister and other Deputies who spoke because if the job is done properly, the river will keep itself clean in our lifetime but when it is done in a haphazard fashion by manual labour, men trying to do a job they are not able to do, it is bound to be a bad job and there is bound to be cribbing and grousing about the expenditure of public money.  I would not advocate spending public money in any foolish fashion.  I like to get value for every £ of public money spent but I should like to advocate spending public money on clearing rivers by machinery and men, clearing obstructions, blasting rocks, removing trunks of trees that are obstructing the free flow of water and blocking bridges, and so on.</P>
    <P>Serious damage has been done in my constituency in the past 12 months, damage running into thousands of pounds.  We had to pass supplementary estimates in Cork County Council to get over the difficulties caused by this disastrous flooding as a result of the choked conditions of the rivers of West Cork. If we drain these rivers, it will be money well spent.  It would be &ldquo;penny wise and pound foolish&rdquo; not to do so because in such circumstances the local authorities will be involved in very great expenditure. There was very serious flooding this <Col N="1467" /> year.  In Dunmanway, houses were flooded to a depth of four feet; bridges were swept away and roads torn up.  I saw roads that were impassable for motor cars when the rivers overflowed because they had never been cleaned for the past 100 years.  It is high time that something was done if we are to make any progress.  If I were asked how to allocate capital expenditure today, I would give the clearing of those rivers first priority.  That is what Cork County Council said when asked to make recommendations about capital expenditure.  They gave clearing rivers top priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Never was there greater need for this work and I am staking my claim now to at least £100,000 for County Cork, to be spent over the next two or three years on such work.  I hope the Minister in his Estimates which he is now preparing will provide money for this essential work.  If he does, and if he leaves the carrying out of the work to Cork County Council, I guarantee that there will be no abuses, that the work will be done and that the people will be satisfied with the results.  Let the reclamation be proceeded with and the fertilisers and the lime which are being put on the land at the present time will not be swept into the sea by the floods.  There is no use fertilising and liming land along the banks of rivers if the floods are to sweep the good results away in a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to think that arterial drainage is the solution.  I know very little about arterial drainage because in the whole of County Cork not one scheme has been carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act. I know that a scheme is being prepared at present for one river, but we have several small rivers the drainage of which would entail an expenditure of only a few thousand pounds.  They are entirely too small for the Board of Works to undertake their drainage, but the drainage in these cases could <Col N="1468" /> be profitably undertaken by the local authorities who could do the work, as was done when money was provided in the last year of the other Act, when the County Engineer was allowed to do the work in the month of March.</P>
    <P>I shall not detain the House much longer.  I know there are other speakers very anxious to speak on this very important motion.  I should like to see much more time devoted to it, if that were possible, because I look upon it as the most important motion that has come before the House, on a question where so much is at stake.  Even the health of the public is endangered by the flooding of houses and roads.  In my own district, last year, a man was drowned on a main road as the result of flooding.  He cycled into a flood on the road and lost his life.  That is a serious position and we cannot allow it to continue much longer.  This is more important than providing aeroplanes, aerodromes or anything else.</P>

I am prepared to give my views as an independent representative, and my view on this is that if money is provided for the cleaning of rivers it will be spent on very useful and profitable work.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision in the light of all the arguments, put up from every side of the House, and from every council in Ireland.  Put the machinery and the men into the rivers immediately, and thereby get rid of the very serious position that has arisen as the result of the serious flooding of lands, houses and roads, and as a result of the losses brought about by flooding.</P>

      <P>The suspension of the Local Authorities (Works) Act has been a bone of contention with councils all over the Twenty-Six Counties, and at every meeting of the General Council of County Councils some Council had a motion down to discuss it.  The last speaker mentioned all the good work done under it, and referred in particular to one great scheme that cost £1,000.  Considering that while it was in operation £7,500,000 was spent, there should have been many good works undertaken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one particular case in mind, a scheme on which £8,000 was spent in each of three successive years and, after £24,000 had been spent, the next mountain flood that came down destroyed all the work done.  The great fault that we found with the Act in Limerick was that there was no provision in it for maintenance of the work once it was done.  Is there any Deputy in this House, no matter to what Party he belongs, who stands over the expenditure <Col N="1470" /> of £24,000 on work that was soon destroyed?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I always felt that we all jumped at the Act when it was introduced to try to get something out of it, but I believe the main purpose of that Act was to relieve flooding of public roads and it was never intended to be applied, in any shape or form, to land drainage.  Its primary and principal purpose was to relieve flooding of roads and, therefore, the point made by Deputy Wycherley regarding the losses sustained when it was not in operation is not material.  I welcome the scheme announced by the Minister with regard to arterial drainage.  When it is operated, not only can we relieve public roads from flooding but we can tackle the problem of land drainage also, a problem which was never tackled in County Limerick because we had not the machinery to do that work.  The amendment of the Act and the transferring of operations under it to the Board of Works is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan asked if it would deal only with rivers flowing directly to the sea.  In my own area we have two main rivers running through the county, from north to south, to the Shannon, and in the first year of the Act's operation we had £70,000 paid to Limerick County Council for work on the upper reaches of the river Deale on the borders of north Cork.  The result was that the upper reaches were cleaned but, where the river joins the Shannon, every farm was flooded for miles round when the first floods came down.  When that cleaning was done the proper machinery was not available. That machinery can be provided only by the Board of Works.  Added to that, work should have commenced at the mouth of the river.  The way it <Col N="1471" /> was done was equivalent to building a house by putting the roof on first, instead of laying the foundations.  That is how we feel about all this in County Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only at yesterday's meeting but at all previous meetings I have supported any resolution for the re-introduction of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, but in an amended form. I specially emphasised the fact that if the Act is to be of any benefit to the people and the nation as a whole, provision will have to be made for maintenance.  That is the kernel of my argument every time.  That is what governs my support.  I have always spoken in favour and I would he happy to see the Act in force once more, but I should like to see the scheme carried out by the Board of Works.  The county councils have not the proper machinery.</P>
      <P>We have been told now that in future these schemes will be done by the Board of Works.  They have the skilled personnel and the machinery.  They can do these schemes independently of the Arterial Drainage Scheme.  From their surveys they know the rivers in the hinterlands which should be drained.  They can make their selection and, in making that selection, they will do a great deal to improve drainage over a very wide area.</P>

      <P>It is merely special pleading on the part of Fianna Fáil Deputies who have spoken for and against this particular motion.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act was the most popular and useful scheme ever introduced here.  It has been supported by all local authorities and by practically every Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party.  It has been supported very strongly by the Fianna Fáil organ.  As well as that the Minister for Local Government tells us that he was pleased, and he now has responsibility for the expenditure of public money, that he got every single penny he could get for Donegal and used it.</P>

      <P>There has been emphasis on maintenance.  Most of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who said the scheme should have been continued have also stated they would have supported it, but there was no provision for maintenance.  That is all tommy-rot.  It is tommy-rot to the extent that the Government gives money to private individuals and local authorities for the erection of houses.  Will any Deputy tell me what Government has been concerned about the maintenance of those houses?  Does the Minister for Local Government insist that cottages must be kept in decent repair by county councils?  Does he care?  I do not say that is something peculiar to this particular Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> Deputy Wycherley also spoke about waste of money.  Would he tell the House how much was wasted on land reclamation over the last few years? Would he tell the House if the Government have been concerned about maintenance of land reclaimed or drained under the Land Reclamation Scheme?  The scheme we are discussing here gave employment to about 9,000 rural workers per year. Many people, like Deputy Wycherley, believed that, because these fellows were down in a river with shovels and sprongs, they were wasting the ratepayers' and the taxpayers' money. The late Deputy T.J. Murphy who introduced the Act made no bones about it; he said it was to serve two purposes, and those two purposes were the draining of rivers, the alleviation of floods on land and roads, and the provision of employment.  The last objective is being conveniently forgotten.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Act was not all it should have been.  Deputies MacEntee, Burke and Moran were then in a position to put down thousands of amendments to that Act.  I happened to be in charge of the Bill on the Committee Stage.  I accepted any of the amendments I thought useful, so much so that, when the Fifth Stage was reached, the then Deputy MacEntee boasted: &ldquo;Now we have made this into a proper Bill.&rdquo;  He meant he had provided against the different disadvantages Deputy Collins and others said would accrue when the Bill was ultimately put into operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said here that local engineers are not equipped to do this type of work.  They are very well equipped.  They are general engineers. They are housing, road and drainage engineers.  I wonder if we had acceded to their request between the years 1948 and 1951 that they would get fees for doing this work, would there have been the abuses about which Deputy Collins talks now?  I have no hesitation in asking that question. They pressed strongly for fees and, in pressing for them, they accepted responsibility for doing the work.  They would have done the work if they had got the fees and would have been well equipped evidently to do the work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> It is, again, special pleading on the part of the Minister to say these local engineers are not equipped to do the work.  Who will now do the work heretofore done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act?  We have a river down in Wexford which has flooded every year in the last three years.  That position could have been relieved under the L.A.W.A.  The Dodder could have been done. Deputies have been talking about flooding, talking about the Dodder and the floods in Stillorgan over the last few years.  The Minister for Finance, his Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture all say they have no responsibility.  Moneys under the L.A.W.A.  could have been utilised to do the work necessary in these areas.</P>
    <P>The mover of the motion is perfectly right in asking that this sort of money should be restored.  The Minister has been pushed some distance and the thanks of the House are due to Deputy McQuillan for putting down this motion.  The Minister comes in and at the tailend of his speech he announces some airy-fairy scheme which will be undertaken by the Board of Works.  I may be misjudging him. He may not have had enough time to explain, but I hope it will not be like the airy-fairy promises given so lavishly by members of this Government over the last two or three years.  In view of what the Minister said we hope this scheme will materialise, and materialise quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>Eight months ago, in introducing his Estimate, the Minister pointed out that his Department had decided to try to bridge the gap existing as between major arterial drainage work and work to be done under the Land Project, and said that his Department had referred to the Board of Works the question of preparing schemes for the drainage of rivers flowing directly into the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He comes here now, eight months afterwards, and he is even more, shall <Col N="1475" /> we say, hazy about this scheme than he was at that time.  There can be no denial of the fact that if this minor type of drainage work is given to the Board of Works, it is the end of it so far as rural Ireland is concerned. Deputies have criticised the Board of Works for a number of years for lack of progress.  Surely the Board of Works have sufficient work to do in dealing with major arterial drainage without saddling them with extra work at the present time.  If it were possible to sabotage drainage, then this Minister has succeeded in doing so by suggesting that he intends to push the responsibility on to the Board of Works.  I do not like to be personal but I must confess to a strong suspicion that Donegal is one of the counties that will gain priority due to the fact that all the rivers in that county flow directly to the sea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has suggested that when the Local Authorities (Works) Act was in operation, even though he felt work might not be of the highest quality, he was prepared to grab every pound in order to bolster himself up as chairman, or a member, of the Donegal County Council.  His words in his speech today were that he never took any steps to sabotage the scheme while he was Chairman of the Donegal County Council, but he did since he assumed responsibility as Minister and he will be charged with that on the hustings &mdash;whenever that will be&mdash;and will have to answer to the public and to his own supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy who has spoken, whether a Fianna Fáil Deputy or a Deputy from the opposite side, every county council in Ireland and the General Council of County Councils, have, time and again, requested the Minister to restore the grants under this Act.  Yet the Minister tells us that a county council is an irresponsible body and he is joined in that by the Fianna Fáil back benchers who suggest that the local authorities are no longer capable of carrying out drainage <Col N="1476" /> themselves.  It is suggested that the engineers, the county surveyors and the assistant county surveyors, are incompetent to carry out this work.  The Minister has suggested that they are overworked and that they would not have a chance to do this work.</P>
    <P>We know the housing situation has eased all over rural Ireland and we know that the main roads do not need the same treatment so far as building or maintenance are concerned so that the engineers now have plenty of time to prepare schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The argument of the Minister that the engineers are incapable of doing the work is a very serious charge against the efficiency, the competency and the responsibility of the local authority engineers.  Deputy Collins said that some £24,000 was wasted on a river in Limerick.  If that is true, then his county council must carry responsibility for it.</P>

      <P>In a motion which affects the entire country, it should not be the usual thing for a Deputy to refer specifically to his own constituency but in this debate I must point out the serious position which exists in my own county.  On one side we have the River Shannon flowing the full length of the county and on the other side, we have the River Suck. When these rivers are in full spate, they flow right across our narrow county.  There is very little hope of main drainage work being carried out in the near future on either of these two rivers.  There are four rivers in the county which could come under minor drainage schemes and if those four rivers were drained, it would be <Col N="1477" /> of immense benefit to the north and south of the county.</P>
      <P>One of the rivers I refer to is the Crannagh, near Athlone.  Roscommon County Council have expended money under the Local Authorities (Works) Act for the past four or five years. The Minister and his Department must confess that excellent work has been done.  There is no question of wastage and no charge of wastage has been levelled against Roscommon County Council.  That county council wish to finish the work and relieve flooding on the lands of small farmers on the upper reaches of that river but they have been turned down, and the Minister has even refused to receive a deputation no fewer than a dozen times in the past 18 months.  The people whose land is flooded by those rivers recognise the need for getting their lands drained.  I wonder what it means to the people in Dublin and to the people in the Civil Service who seem to control this Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people concerned with the Crannagh river have no hope of finishing the drainage work. They are small farmers who go in in a big way for tillage and mixed farming. Some of them have not seen a particular acre of their land for years because, during winter and summer, it is flooded.  They wear Wellingtons the whole year round.  Deputies may not <Col N="1478" /> credit that, but I should like them to come and visit the locality and see for themselves.  The situation there is so bad that the farmers joined together to form an association and at present they are refusing to pay rent or rates.  The situation is that a seizure was made last week on a number of these farms. There was no question of seizing stock off the lands because they were flooded but an agent of the Government went into these houses and seized furniture. In some instances, they went to the houses when the owners were away and the womenfolk were left on their own.  That is what is happening in that part of the country and it is due to the refusal of the Minister to make money available in order that essential drainage work can be carried out.</P>
      <P>The statement of the Taoiseach and the Minister that they are anxious to have increased production from the land is sheer hypocrisy in the face of their complete contempt for the farming community in that they know perfectly well that unless the land is fitted for production, through drainage, increased production cannot be got.  We can only accept regretfully that all the promises of the Taoiseach that he is now giving priority to rural Ireland are merely promises made to be broken.  I hope that Deputies Corry, Collins and other Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who have expressed themselves outside this House in favour of restoring the Local Authorities (Works) Act will, on this occasion, walk into the Division Lobbies and support here a motion to restore these grants.  I think the Minister, even at this stage, should allow the Whips to be taken off and let us and himself see how many of his own Deputies are only too anxious to support the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was addressing my remarks to the subject of parish agents.  I was explaining the necessity for a decision as to whether we were to proceed in building up the agricultural advisory service on the basis of county committees of agriculture or on the basis of a service administered and controlled from the Department of Agriculture, Merrion Street.  We decided <Col N="1481" /> our advisory service should be built up on the basis of county committees of agriculture.  I could give dozens of convincing reasons to establish the wisdom of that decision.</P>
      <P>We have a number of parish agents. We have the problem of over-lapping with officers employed by local committees. When complaints are made against these officers, Inspectors from the Department run down from Dublin to see what has happened and why it has happened.  Files are accumulating, costing plenty of money.  At the same time, in each county, a Chief Executive Officer is employed by the county committee to supervise the technical people necessary to assist farmers by advice and instruction on the methods they should employ in running their business. We have decided that it is on that basis that our advisory service will grow up.  This talk, every time there is a discussion about a parish agent, is all out of place.  The parish agent idea was decided upon without enough consideration of all the factors I have mentioned.  I shall say no more on that.</P>
      <P>I have devoted my remarks mostly to those who, when addressing themselves to the all-important subject of agriculture, try&mdash;not for my sake or for my convenience&mdash;to be reasonable. So too, in relation to our trade with Britain and agreements made from time to time affecting that trade, we should be reasonable.  I am referring to the 1948 Trade Agreement.  I do not say that those who made it did not do their best.</P>

When you make an agreement with another Government and another country, you may take it that they do not want to concede that they have given you more than you are entitled to.  They have to defend themselves before their own people.  When we come back whether it be a Fianna Fáil or any other Government, and indulge in <Col N="1482" /> ballyhoo as to what has been secured, what good does it do?  If something has been secured, it is not so bad. Even if it has, why should we try to embarrass the other fellow?  There was ballyhoo about the 1948 Trade Agreement.  I do not say it is the fault of the Agreement itself.  Immediately after making the Agreement, the British changed their policy.  They were entitled to do that.  As a result of the change of policy, the introduction of subsidies and support at the expense of the British taxpayer, that Agreement, in the main, became meaningless.</P>

It is not their fault; it arose from the action of those with whom they made that Agreement.

It must be our aim, it must be the aim of any Government here, to try to secure from our trading neighbours in the other island, with whom we have the closest contacts in the movement of men, money and goods, a recognition of the advantages they can obtain here as well to harp upon the advantages they have to extend to us.

      <P>I could speak for hours but I do not want to take up too much time.  I am not disturbed by the interruptions but I wish to bring my remarks to a conclusion so that other Deputies may speak.  As far as agriculture is concerned, like most Deputies, I belong to the land; I have my roots deeply and firmly in the land and I deprecate the whining and wailing that goes on here about agriculture, that kind of behaviour that is designed to secure support and appreciation from people outside who are far more intelligent than those who are running after them in order to secure their votes and the favour of their backing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, there will always be ups and downs in agriculture. There is not the slightest reason for believing that because the prices of turkeys or cattle or any other commodities are disappointing we will not succeed in reversing that downward trend.  We will succeed in reversing that trend in regard to our milk supplies. There is no reason to believe that we will not succeed in rectifying the position in a very short time.  I <Col N="1485" /> remember when coming back from Britain in 1957 with the Taoiseach, having had talks with the British in regard to the surplus of butter, I said to him: &ldquo;Maybe, with all this clamour about such surplus the Almighty will intervene and settle this problem.&rdquo;  He settled it for more than us.</P>

For that reason we laugh when we hear the wails that seem always to go up from the ranks of the Opposition.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to intervene in this debate at a rather curious stage in the progress of the Government and in relation to their attitude to the matters mainly under discussion, emigration and unemployment.  We have just come through the Division Lobbies here to vote on a motion calling for the provision of money for the carrying out of schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The Government have just voted against the motion in the face of an effort on their part and on the part of their speakers to show that things are not as bad as other people represent them to be.  In the words of the Taoiseach in Limerick a week ago that &ldquo;is not enough.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not help contrasting the interjections of the Taoiseach in the course of this debate with the speech just delivered by the Minister for <Col N="1486" /> Agriculture.  I had felt like saying at one stage that if I were asked to select a target that might be more easily assailable than any other, I would select the arrogance of the obvious bluff associated with the Taoiseach rather than the cool, gentlemanly, love-my-neighbour, sweet reasonableness attitude of the Minister for Agriculture until he was scratched by Deputy Fagan.  Then we had the real article.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has spoken here for upwards of an hour and has said three or four things quite clearly.  The first is that he has selected the county committee of agriculture in preference to the parish agent idea. That is not of course inconsistent with what has long been the policy of Fianna Fáil, namely, a preference to increase rates rather than impose charges on the Central Fund.  The parish agent would be a Central Fund charge whereas the county committee of agriculture goes on to the rates; and the greater its ramifications, the greater addition it will be on the rates. That is the direct result, and will continue to be the direct result, as long as the policy enunciated by the Minister remains in operation.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister blandly tells us, in relation to the T.B. eradication scheme, that all he wants is co-operation. Co-operation, in my view and in the view of every reasonable person, is a reciprocal thing.  Without that necessary reciprocity, you might as well fly in the teeth of the wind as look for co-operation. The Minister says there is a situation with regard to the prices of the main agricultural products, cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, turkeys, etc.  He says that situation is there but that neither he nor any other Minister for Agriculture could do anything about it.  I interpret that as simply and solely a confession of failure in a situation which he freely acknowledges exists.  The Minister's last observation is not a bad thing, but we must remember that calling upon the Almighty to intervene is always best accompanied by the other phrase that &ldquo;God helps those who help themselves.&rdquo;  So long as the Minister for Agriculture and this Government remain in that static <Col N="1487" /> position in which they find themselves, and in which they say there is nothing they can do, I think without that helping themselves they are extremely presumptuous to call for the intervention of the Almighty.</P>
    <P>The 1948 Agreement has come under fire.  Every farmer knows the increased amount of prosperity it brought to him.  The real test is that since that Agreement was made, Fianna Fáil have come to power twice and at no time have they set about disowning or ignoring it in any way. In fact, anything they have tried to do has been an extension of it.</P>
    <P>Statistics are figures which purport to tell something.  If I were making a study of statistics&mdash;and I think this is what the average person would require &mdash;I would try, truthfully and sincerely, to find out what the lesson of those figures is.  What do these statistics mean?  Will I accept the situation in which they tell me that something is clearly good or something is clearly bad; or will I try, as the Taoiseach will undoubtedly try here from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. to-day, to juggle with those statistics in order to show they in fact mean what he wants them to mean and, consequently, that everything in the garden is beautiful?</P>
    <P>The figures available to us in relation to employed persons show that from the year 1956 to 1959, there has been a reduction of 40,000 in the number of persons in insurable employment. Those figures tell their own story. They are from the Taoiseach's office. I do not see how he can, but I know he will try to get around them in some way to his own advantage.</P>
    <P>Another set of figures was given here by Deputy Desmond which, I take it, nobody will deny.  They are answers to queries in the British House of Commons.  These answers reveal that, in the year 1957, 58,496 people from the Republic of Ireland applied for new insurance cards for the first time and in the year 1958, 47,869 people from the Republic of Ireland applied for similar cards for the first time. In the two years 1957 and 1958, therefore, from this country, seeking employment abroad for the first time, <Col N="1488" /> went 106,365 persons.  And then we are told that the trend is in the right direction.</P>
    <P>If it is meant that the trend is in the right direction because roughly 48,000 went in 1958 instead of 58,000 in 1957, I think that trend can be interpreted only in this way: that there were not any more old enough or sturdy enough to go in 1958.  Let nobody pooh-pooh the idea that people are leaving the country or that there is emigration to any extent, as Deputy Booth did in addressing Deputy McQuillan yesterday evening.  We all know that there is emigration.  Rural Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches know as well as we do that in their constituencies houses are being closed and that it is not one, two or three members of a family who are leaving but the whole family.

      <P>Here we have on the front page: &ldquo;Lemass pledges big marketing changes.  Farm produce to get new boost&rdquo; and then he talks of action in the campaign for progress having now to move out from the Dáil and the Government into every town and district in which development possibilities exist.  On the back page, the story of prosperity around the corner is continued and there is a picture, taken in Limerick, where the Taoiseach was speaking on the Saturday night, of fine healthy children with their father and mother and the caption is, &ldquo;Limerick family of 13 leaves for Birmingham.&rdquo;  Then the suggestion is that there is no emigration at all, that the trend is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Taoiseach to acknowledge, as I am sure the House and the <Col N="1489" /> country will acknowledge, that the figures given for emigration in so far as they are related to the number of persons seeking new insurance cards for the first time in Britain between 1st January, 1957 and 31st December, 1958 are correct and total 106,365 for those two years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that we are not entitled to criticise unless we have an alternative plan to put up.  I disagree with him in that and I think he will agree with my disagreement, because, in his heart and soul, he must know that it is the duty of a Government to govern and the duty of an Opposition to be vigilant and critical, that it is not the duty of an Opposition, and that there is no obligation on an Opposition at any time, to put forward suggestions that will assist a Government out of their difficulties, particularly a Government with such a strong majority as this Government have and a Government who secured the votes of the people by a false promise which they knew or ought to have known was utterly incapable of implementation.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that at the head of the Government to-day the three principal persons are the Taoiseach, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister for Transport and Power.  In Opposition days, the Taoiseach was the planner; the Minister for Industry and Commerce was the person who urged the speeding of the plans and the Minister for Transport and Power was the person who went up and down the country urging the implementation of the plans and the speeding of that implementation. Not alone did he use pious exhortations but he urged that there should be ruthless realism in pursuit of that objective.  They are in the driver's seat now and, with nearly three years of Government completed, not one item of the matters put before the electors as baits for their hooks has been implemented by this Government.</P>
    <P>If we were asked to put up an alternative scheme, we could be equally dishonest.  When the Taoiseach was speaking in Clery's ballroom on <Col N="1490" /> that famous night long ago, which he would probably like to forget now, he said that what was required was 100,000 new jobs over a period of five years.  If we were equally dishonest in our effort to get the suffrages of the country we would say: &ldquo;No. The Taoiseach was quite wrong at that time.&rdquo;  In his own words in relation to the levies of 1956, we would say: &ldquo;That is too little and too late.  Even acceding to the &lsquo;too late&rsquo; part, it is too little.  What you want is 200,000 jobs, 250,000 jobs or any number of any jobs.&rdquo;  You could say anything.  You could think of a number that would commend itself to a gullible public.  I think that is all there was in this plan at any time.</P>
    <P>On occasions here since this Government came into power, I have been engaged in many matters of dispute with them and with particular Departments.  In relation to what was my Department, the Department of the Gaeltacht, a few months ago.  I was at the most recent public performance given by the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  It was at Blacksod, in my constituency, where he had been asked to deal with certain grievances, genuine grievances.  I have been at more unreasonable meetings.  All that the Minister could tell them was to do a bit of deep, sincere thinking, to form themselves into committees, to speak Irish and he would remain their friend forever.  It was with that piece of advice and lack of any material help that he left the area, leaving behind him an atmosphere of gloom and disappointment.</P>
    <P>I do not know that anything has improved in any of the other areas over the past two and a half years but I do want the Taoiseach to tell us, between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. today, something about the progress of Gaeltarra Éireann, which was formed into a board, under legislation initiated by us and continued by the present Government.  I want him to tell us what the position is now.  Will he tell us why the chairman of the board of directors appointed by the Government has resigned within the <Col N="1491" /> past couple of weeks?  Will he tell us whether it was due to any irregularities inside, whether it was due to a policy to which he could not subscribe or what is the reason for the present upheaval in Gaeltarra Éireann?</P>
    <P>Considerable criticism, of course, can be levelled at the Department of Local Government in regard to the delay in bringing in road traffic regulations. With regard to housing and the payment of grants for completed houses or the completed reconstruction of houses, the position is far from satisfactory.  I would venture to say, speaking particularly for the west of Ireland, that the builders' providers are the people who are giving extended credit to the Department of Local Government.  That is a situation which should be remedied.</P>
    <P>In regard to social welfare and health services, the Taoiseach and the Government must know that there is considerable public discontent.  In regard to health services, the operation of the medical card is causing considerable confusion, disappointment and hardship in very many cases.  With regard to social welfare services I have come across a situation that never obtained in this country until quite recently, that is, that emigrants' remittances are taken into consideration for the purpose of assessing means of applicants for old age pensions.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact, not alone over the years in which native government has operated but even in the time of British Governments, that the parent at home, either one or the other, was the banker for the son or daughter abroad and it was a great tribute to the success of that system, by way of keeping the money for them, that never to my personal knowledge or research was there ever legal action necessary on the part of a son or daughter to get money back from a parent to whom it had been given for safe keeping.</P>
    <P>Social welfare officers are now chasing up and down the country taking every possible source of comfort that people might have, whether it is a post office deposit or a bank <Col N="1492" /> deposit.  The cause of the discontent is that in no case will the social welfare officer accept the word of the people who have this money in the bank or post office in their own names, but as trustees for their sons or daughters who are abroad.  Their word will never be accepted.  Recently in a town in my constituency a son came back from England specially to tell a meeting of an old age pensions committee that a certain proportion of money in the post office was his and he went and took it out with the consent of his mother.  The amount of money in the post office was £1,100.  The two old age pension books have been taken from those two people.  The revised half yearly annuity of the holding was a little over £1 and the rateable valuation £3-4.  Where would they get that amount out of their holding?  Further it will be readily admitted that that money was either the result of gifts on the one hand or given for safe-keeping on the other. The fact that portion of it was claimed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>While social welfare officers are chasing up and down the country trying to take the last shilling from the old age pensioners, the unemployed and so on, in the same area in my constituency the Government have a bunch of their henchmen chasing around the mountains with £200,000 in bags trying to grow grass on some bog if they can get it. I am not opposed to the provision of employment but I am opposed to the provision of employment which must necessarily involve the payment of henchmen as company directors and such like.</P>
      <P>There is, up and down this country, a disrespect for law and order, a disrespect for the officers of the law.  The people will not have to search too far into their hearts or examine their consciences too deeply to discover the origin of that disrespect for law and order and for the police force generally. On this motion, may I ask the Taoiseach to take away from whatever argument he proposes to use the atmosphere connoted by the phrase used by the Minister for Agriculture, &ldquo;an air of unreality&rdquo;.  If statistics are used, let the statistics tell the true story and not the story that you want to put across in defence of the Government on a gullible public.</P>
      <P>Facts are facts.  We see the people going.  We see the houses closed.  We know there are unemployed, not alone from personal observation but from our own correspondence.  The Government know all that but choose to deny it, to gloss over it by saying: &ldquo;Prosperity is around the corner; maybe we did not get it this year&mdash;but we will get it next year&mdash;because sets of circumstances which we could not anticipate impeded us.&rdquo;  These sets of circumstances which could not be anticipated happen too frequently.  The people are getting tired of them and the more tired they get the more bitter and the more cynical they become. Their answer is either disrespect for law and established institutions at home or to get out.  In order to obviate those two things happening and raising many larger problems, I think, in their own words, it is time that this Government &ldquo;got cracking&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Having listened to <Col N="1494" /> this debate and to the speakers from both major Parties, I wish I were a person of sufficient stature to act as an honest broker between the two sides in order to try to bring them back to the real seriousness of the position in the country today.  I listened with great attention and great admiration&mdash;that is with admiration from the viewpoint of the practical politician&mdash;to Deputy M.J. O'Higgins last night.  He made a very able, well prepared, well thought out, well delivered and extraordinarily well documented indictment of the Government and their activities over the last two and a half years.</P>
      <P>His main charge was concerned with whether the Taoiseach is right in saying that the responsibility for the 40,000 fewer people in employment, is the responsibility of his Government or of their predecessors in office.  I would plead with the Taoiseach that he should not preoccupy himself, in his answer to this debate, with an explanation as to who is in fact responsible for that very distressing truth.  I would ask Deputies on both sides, in both major Parties, to try to understand that we have entered a most heartening&mdash;in some ways&mdash;phase of political development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disappearance to a considerable extent of the more contentious leaders of the Civil War period has led to a completely different atmosphere in this House, which personally I more than welcome.  I think I should pay tribute to the Taoiseach for his attempts to reduce the level of acrimony and personal offensiveness which was so common here over the years.  At the same time this period could be, and I suppose in time must show itself to be, the beginning of a most important watershed of political opinion in Ireland.  The great differences of the Civil War which kept the politicians separated over the years are no longer there.  The differences seem to have disappeared and we must now discuss our political differences in terms of ideologies, on an economic or social basis of economic policies and financial ideas. <Col N="1495" /> It seems to me completely irrelevant which Party must take responsibility or blame for the achievements or the failures of our present position.</P>
    <P>While I am a strong critic of Governments and of Government policies I shall concede that there have been successes in some fields over the past 30 or 40 years for which both Governments may claim some credit.  I think it would be much more desirable if we could begin discussing here, not whether Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or the inter-Party Government was responsible for a particular failure or success, but whether a particular approach to the solution of a problem was more or less satisfactory irrespective of which Party put it forward.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputies on both sides to re-assess the picture of our progress in the last 40 years under our different administrations and re-assess the different methods used by Ministers from both sides of the House to try to find out which is the more successful or the more applicable to our way of life, the more likely to be successful in future, and which is most likely to be acceptable to the people, given their background, education, opportunity and general attitude to standards and values.  That is why I say that the 40,000 and the question of which Government were responsible for it is relatively unimportant.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputies to consider the more important figures which cannot be controverted and for which there is joint responsibility, such as the 750,000 people who have had to emigrate since the State was formed, the 8-10 per cent.  consistently unemployed and also the fact that no matter what Taoiseach is in office, if he is asked by his Minister for Agriculture or Social Welfare or Health to approve of certain proposals, he has no alternative but to say to him: &ldquo;I cannot afford to increase the 27/6 for old age pensioners; I cannot afford to let you have money to educate our children properly; I cannot afford to give you the money so that we would be able to put ourselves on the same level as our fellow-countrymen in <Col N="1496" /> Northern Ireland or Great Britain or any other country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason that money is not there is not that we are particularly meanminded, selfish, or disinterested about the hardship or unhappiness that all this degradation of one kind or another inevitably means in education, health services and the care of old people and of the under-privileged classes generally, but simply because our economic policies have failed to provide the State with money to assist these people and give them that modicum of comfort which most civilised communities have now come to accept as only their right.  In that way a discussion or debate need not involve any acrimony or abuse by one Deputy or Party of another Deputy or Party or by one group of Deputies of another group.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay has told us that it is not the duty of the Opposition to put forward solutions for problems.  I suppose that is substantially true but I think many people would be disappointed if the leader of the Opposition did not take an opportunity of more fully declaring the economic and social policies with which he felt he might like to replace existing policies. I do not think it is particularly original &mdash;it seems to me this is not an unfair capsule definition of Deputy Dillon's approach&mdash;to say that if you feed a four-legged animal it will get fat and you can sell it.  More things are required to run society than merely the fattening of sheep, pigs and cattle and exporting them.  It is an oversimplification of the policies of a large Party which hopes one day to control the destinies of this society.</P>
    <P>It also seems that, in the light of the disclosures made by the Minister for Agriculture, following the admirable 1948 Agreement, changes came in Britain that to a large extent invalidated that Agreement and certainly weakened the hopes that many people had for it.  The Minister for Agriculture conceded that these changes were legitimately made by the British in regard to their own internal policy, but hopes that we had of entering the British market with our agricultural produce came <Col N="1497" /> to little or nothing.  It seems to me that should bring home to Deputy Dillon that the British market is not a sufficiently substantial foundation upon which to build our hopes of prosperity or on which to depend for prosperity and that alternative markets for agricultural produce should certainly be more closely investigated by him and suggestions for alternative markets, where there is a failure of the British market, should at least be put forward by him from time to time.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the ephemeral qualities of demand in the British market have been clearly demonstrated over the years and, for my own money, I would not be satisfied with the consistent and persistent absolute dependence which the leader of the Opposition appears to have on the fat cattle and store cattle trade which is the basis of his policy.  I also feel that in his speech he might have made some reference to social matters generally.  However, he may take another opportunity of doing that.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach, probably the best informed Deputy in the House, some questions in regard to problems with which I am concerned because more than anybody else I suppose he could be considered as the breadwinner for our society for the best part of 30 years.  That is a compliment in a way and it must necessarily be a criticism also, because he who has had this responsibility for so long&mdash;and I think it must be emphasised that the present Taoiseach is no newcomer to his job&mdash;cannot be given all the grace that one might give to a complete newcomer to the very responsible post which he holds because he still must have the major responsibility of deciding how our money, our national income is to be created, increased and expanded.</P>
    <P>While the majority of the problems as such as would concern the appropriate Ministers as well as the Taoiseach, the Opposition Party has also played some part in the creation of our present position.  The early Fine Gael attitude I think could be summed up in the attempted retention of the entrepreneur in Irish business, with a failure to develop Irish industry, <Col N="1498" /> whatever its merits, whatever its faults.  That is a legitimate attitude for which, no doubt, they have a defence and, in the light of our later experience of the relative failure of Irish industry, it is possibly more justifiable now than then.  However, that appeared to be their main economic policy, but at the same time they can lay claim to the earliest development of the idea of public ownership in relation to the Shannon scheme and, I understand&mdash; though there seems to be some difference between the two Parties&mdash;in relation to the establishment of the Sugar Company.  It is on that problem that I should be very grateful to the Taoiseach if he would be clear and unequivocal in his defence or his repudiation of these conflicting questions, the merits of public ownership on the one hand, and the merits and demerits of what is called private enterprise on the other.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am prejudiced.  I do believe in public ownership and maybe the Taoiseach can persuade the House that I am not completely informed on the question in all its minutest detail.  But if we are to apply his simple test, a perfectly realistic test, to the record of these two attitudes to the organisation of a national economy, and the expansion of a national income in order to create the money with which one can care for the aged, look after the sick and provide education for children, then in the examination of these two attitudes, public ownership and private enterprise, that simple test which is suggested by the Taoiseach for politicians applies equally towards these economic processes, that is, their efficiency determined by the measure of employment and prosperity which they create for any particular society.</P>
    <P>No doubt private businesses create prosperity for the individuals who control them but I assume, as politicians interested in the national welfare, we are concerned only with the impact of private business against public ownership on the welfare of the nation as a whole.  I do not think there is any doubt at all that the development of native industries in this country was handed over to private <Col N="1499" /> enterprise.  Productive capital investment was left entirely to private enterprise; the State, with a couple of exceptions which I shall mention, confined itself to some magnificent enterprises like Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, the E.S.B., Irish Shipping, Irish Steel Holdings and, of course, the Sugar Company.  These industries developed on certain conditions which I think were reasonable at the time. It appeared reasonable to the Taoiseach at that time that infant industries must be protected with tariffs, and so on, from outside competition, but the development of those industries must have been a disappointment to him.</P>
    <P>They should have expanded.  They should have created export markets. They should have given us unlimited opportunities for employment, and they should have made available to the various Departments the money with which we could have created a socially just society, and a prosperous society as well.  I do not think anybody believed, hoped, or thought this wealth could have been created by the public utilities.  They are not expected to create wealth.  They are expected to serve a particular social function and nothing else, but these industries were intended to serve the needs of our people and, in addition, to create national wealth with which we could create a socially just society.</P>
    <P>I do not think it unfair to say that these industries were largely still-born. Most of the so-called Irish industrial tycoons are merely branch managers of subsidiaries of British parent companies. On the whole that is what they are.  All we have succeeded in doing is creating in Ireland an industrial little England, and the obvious consequence is that we have great difficulty getting into export markets against the British parent companies.</P>
    <P>The parent company is not particularly interested in our creating exports and making foreign contacts, and is satisfied that our small home market could be readily supplied by the use of out-dated machinery, antiquated machinery.  In fact, automation, mechanisation, time and motion studies can pass over our heads.  It is <Col N="1500" /> like as if we were to try to avoid the impact on industry of the evolution of the spinning jenny.  We simply cannot have all these developments that are taking place, automation, mechanisation, and all the other methods designed to increase the efficiency of industries, because our market can, be readily supplied by the present inefficient, costly, antiquated machinery of the small industries which we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that in regard to many of these industries, if we were to advance as most societies are advancing in the great new expansion of scientific knowledge applied to industry, our industries would work for possibly 24 hours, supply the whole national needs and then shut down.  We are dependent upon the fact that it is cheaper to have a large pool of unemployed and to use out-dated machinery.  It is safer to do that and so this industrial revolution, which is taking place all around us, is leaving us completely untouched.  With some exceptions that is generally true.</P>
    <P>Our industrialists have not had sufficient initiative to go out and look for new markets, even in the great expanding economies of the Afro-Asian countries and the Middle East countries, to try to develop markets which would make it imperative to modernise their industrial methods and improve equipment in industry generally.  They have had no need to do it, and that has been the fault of successive Governments.  I was in one of those Governments and I accept full responsibility for the few years I was there.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have failed to put a limit upon the time during which we would, to use again the Taoiseach's expressive phrase, keep them as a pet.  We have kept Irish industry as a pet for a great many years.  We are continuing to keep it as a pet despite very valiant efforts of the Taoiseach and other Ministers of State to try to kick them into activity by touring in America and financing tours on the Continent and various other countries to help Irish industrialists to sell their products in a competitive market.  Has that now been found to be impossible?  Have the Government decided that we cannot <Col N="1501" /> compete on these export markets because of obsolete factory equipment, because our industrialists have lived in luxury for years without any significant competition to goad them into activity?  Is Irish industry now in such a soft condition that it simply cannot compete against Western Germany, Japan, Britain, America and other countries?  It strikes me that that is the true answer.  Even with up-to-date machinery and modern methods it almost seems as if the position will still be hopeless.  Perhaps our geographical position is against us.  Perhaps we are using the wrong raw materials.  Perhaps it might have been wiser for us to have based our industries on agriculture rather than on textiles and imported raw materials.</P>
    <P>Today, the position is that we have not developed any export markets for our industrial products.  We are now in a situation in which we find ourselves touting all over the world asking the Swedes, the Danes, the Dutch, the Germans and the Americans to come in and join the British and help to &ldquo;make a go&rdquo; of Irish industry.  The frightening thing about the whole situation is that the Taoiseach said at a recent Ard-Fheis that our social services of one kind or another can only expand if there is, first of all, an expansion in our national economy bringing with it an increasing national prosperity.  That is, I admit, a reasonable argument but, taken with the fact that most of the new industrialists and industries are promised years of taxfree profits and that those profits will more than likely be taken out of the country, there does not seem to be much prospect of increasing the national income.  Even if people come in to save our bacon&mdash;I do not believe for a moment they will; why should they?; they have their own problems &mdash;I do not see where the money will come from to give us anything like comparable social or living standards <i>vis-a-vis</i> other civilised societies and communities.</P>
    <P>We have failed to develop an export market.  We are tied to a limited or restricted market.  Consequently, we are tied to a restricted or limited national income.  We are tied, therefore, <Col N="1502" /> it seems to me, to a stagnant, unchanging standard of living.  I do not think the Taoiseach can promise us any alleviation in relation to our health services, our social services and our educational services in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach depended on private enterprise to save the congested districts along the western seaboard.  He gave industrialists every possible encouragement.  He gave them every incentive.  As usual he gave them tax concessions, facilities in regard to factory buildings, and very good loans. All that has failed.  Certainly most people do not regard it as a success.</P>
    <P>The development of Shannon Airport has been given to private enterprise. This appears to be an attempt to help us cut our lossess on Shannon. This is a desperate attempt to save some money out of what is likely to become&mdash;my hope is that I may be proved wrong in this&mdash;within the next five or ten years the Shannon debacle.  Shannon represents a tremendous expenditure of money by a relatively poor country on an overexotic scheme; merely because we happen to be situated on the Atlantic seaboard we go gaily into jet 'plane competitive transport.  Most big countries are finding it very difficult to enter this business on their own, or stay in it on their own, and most of them are forming blocs to reduce costs and so on.  To me, it is, to put it at its mildest, very unwise to spend millions of much-needed money on this extension of that particular facet of our air development.  It would have been just as intelligent and just as reasonable to start building <i>Queen Marys</i> and <i>Queen Elizabeths</i>, huge Atlantic liners, because of our geographical position on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean <i>vis-a-vis</i> the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>There may be some aspects or some facets of our economic problem in which the Taoiseach thinks private enterprise has made a success of the job.  But I have another criticism to offer.  Having failed to develop export markets, and thereby failed to create consistent employment at good wages for those needing work, having been given every kind of protection <Col N="1503" /> at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer, the industrialists turn around and indulge in the meanest type of price rigging, restrictive trade practices and monopolistic practices of every kind.  One of the most dramatic illustrations of that is now being painted before the present inquiry into the petrol business.  It has got to the stage when I can no longer read the report of the inquiry because of the statements made by people there, people who are supposed to tell the truth.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested there that a restrictive practice is, in fact, a competitive practice.  It has been suggested that the Standard Oil Company has to buy petrol in the open market, getting 1d. or ½d. cut, and so on. This, and other industries which have been investigated by the Commission, disclose the presence of restrictive trade practices, practices which represent conspiracies against the consumer, neither more nor less.  These are conspiracies to inflate prices artificially, and retain inflated prices, as a result of agreements arrived at.  And, as was said in this present inquiry, there is nothing in writing.  They are too cute for that.  But they have to admit that agreements are entered into verbally and prices go up and down at the whim of half a dozen men.  The consumer and the country is held up to ransom.</P>
    <P>We had a recent experience of that in the petrol strike.  Petrol and oil affect practically ever facet of our economy.  I think most of us realised only recently how deeply oil and petrol have become enmeshed in our economy.  Hospitals, industry, factories of every kind, even the humble bread van and the milk delivery van, are all dependent upon petrol and oil. Yet, the people who control this industry can increase or reduce prices as, when and how they wish.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has admitted that he has no power to stop their doing this.  He said that in reply to a question tabled by me recently.  Because of that statement, I fail to see the purpose of the inquiry.  It appears to <Col N="1504" /> me these people are outside the law and they can fix any price they like. It is we, of course, who must pay for their inflated prices in the milk, the bread, or the factory product we consume or use.  I do not think it right that these people should be allowed to continue to get away with this persistent abuse of their privileged position in their tariff-protected industries.  They should be made to develop some form of competition and there should be a definite time limit set for the development of that competition.  The new European agreements may give them that time.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, I think the Taoiseach should long since have taken a more positive attitude and given them a definite time within which to develop an export market or else lose the protection of the tariff wall.  It seems to me, on the simple basis of prosperity and the creation of opportunities for employment, that the private enterprise economic system has failed to answer the demand made on it and expected from it by the Taoiseach. The strange thing is that we are still apparently putting all our money into the desperate situation in which we find ourselves at the present time.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach would he defend his decision in that regard and would he defend his decision to ignore the claims of the public ownership conception of operating any company.  We have seen the remarkable achievements of Aer Lingus and Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  I mention those two particularly because they are both industries which operate in open competition with industries in various European countries.  They have provided a magnificent service, a service second to none in Europe.  They have won prizes for efficiency.  We have found from amongst our own people the personnel and the managers. We have found the operators, the pilots, the service people and they have built up a level of efficiency and economy which has not been surpassed.</P>
    <P>In Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, we have a particularly interesting industry from our point of view, because it is primarily an agricultural one.  It is <Col N="1505" /> the organisation of agriculture in a rational way so that the farmers are guaranteed prices and assistance in relation to growing and gathering their crops.  They know where they are, unlike the admission which the Minister for Agriculture had to make in relation to the rest of the agricultural community.  I have the greatest sympathy for the farmer, the turkey farmer, the egg producers, the cattle, sheep and pig people.  I have seen them all myself and I know their terrible dilemma of keeping animals for a year or more, and then trying, and failing, to get a good price, particularly the small farmers.  The richer farmer can carry on but for the small farmer it means the upturn of his whole economy.</P>
    <P>Have those two industries, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and Aer Lingus, not got every aspect of the needs of an industrial system&mdash;the technicians, the capital we provide, the know-how, the ingenuity and the courage to take paths which they had not taken before, unlike private enterprise which has not anything like the same record?  One of the finest and, to me, the most heartening development in relation to Comhluct Siúicre Éireann is the suggestion that they will now process agricultural produce and export it against our own exporters to world markets. That is what I have read; I do not know the details, but I hope it is true. One significant development since that announcement was made was the whine from the leader writers of Independent Newspapers that it is a most undesirable development and that these matters should be left to the private producers and to private enterprise and so on.</P>
    <P>One of the things I have never understood is why these people who believe in private enterprise are so frightened of public ownership.  They plaster it with slogans of inefficiency, of inability to retain its dynamism, inability to go out and look for markets. One would imagine that if it is inefficient, there is nothing to fear from public ownership.  What are they frightened of, if it is inefficient?  If it is not to develop export markets and produce goods of high quality, if these goods are produced of a quality which <Col N="1506" /> is poor and are of a high cost or a quality which is good and a high cost, what are they frightened of?  If there are markets which these public companies can win in the world, what have private enterprise been doing for 30 years that they have not got them?  If it can produce goods at a cheaper price why have not private enterprise done so?</P>
    <P>What is the Taoiseach frightened of? What is his objection?  Is there a moral objection?  Is there an objection that there is a lack of personnel or which of these industries does he think has been inefficient&mdash;Aer Lingus, Board na Móna, the E.S.B. Irish Steel Holdings or C.I.E.?  Let us take C.I.E.  Quite clearly, C.I.E. has been smeared more than any other public enterprise in this State.  The facts, of course, are that C.I.E. took over from two bankrupt private enterprise companies which came to the Government on their knees asking to be taken over because they could not continue.  The public is still paying for their failure and we are still paying compensation for the shares of these companies and will pay it in the future to their heirs and successors until kingdom come.</P>
    <P>Would the Taoiseach say what he finds wrong, bad or inefficient in these State companies for whose establishment he must claim credit&mdash;credit which I give to him gladly?  In time of war, we established nothing but State companies because we felt in the circumstances that they would be most likely to act fairly and equitably and more efficiently by the consumer. I would say this is a critical time for politics in Ireland.  The Taoiseach has made his declaration in <i>Economic Recovery.</i> Something in the region of £31,000,000 is to be made available by the Government&mdash;but again made available to private industry and so far as I can see, in the greater part to agriculture, industry and the hotels.</P>
    <P>Why does the Taoiseach continue to place all his confidence in private industry in face of the facts of which he is much more aware and which he is much better able to assess than I could possibly be?  They are failures in relation to the major problems with which we are all concerned.  Out of a <Col N="1507" /> population of between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000, our emigration rate is threequarters of a million.  Unemployment is at the startlingly high figure of eight to ten per cent.  The extraordinary thing is that we have come so much to accept a figure of eight per cent. or ten per cent. that we quarrel about five per cent. or four per cent., here, there or somewhere else.  There is a crisis in Britain if the figure is two per cent.  It is enough to bring about a general election but we sit silently here with eight or nine per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not want at all to appear to take any advantage of the Taoiseach. I am asking questions.  In the face of failure, on the one hand and success, on the other, why does the Taoiseach, in his wisdom, think that we are likely to solve our very grave problems with dependance for the creation of employment on private enterprise?  In its operation within the country, it seems to me to be defective, inefficient and unjust in many instances.  It has made little or no attempt to expand our national economy.  It seems to me that the average industrialist is concerned exclusively with the advancement of his personal position.</P>
    <P>He cannot have the same interest as we, the State and the people, have in the promotion of the public interest.  He is interested in the promotion of his own individual ends. The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, seems to believe that we can get national prosperity and social justice as a by-product of having a prosperous farming community. If we have a whole lot of rich farmers, we shall get social justice and prosperity.  The Government believe that we shall get all these things as a by-product of the activities of a handful of industrialists pursuing their own special personal private ends.</P>
    <P>That is all right.  I do not think there is any doubt about that.  If it is the objective of the Opposition, on the one hand, and the Government, on the other, to see a group of privileged farmers and wealthy industrialists, a conflict in our political <Col N="1508" /> society will then develop between these two groups, with the industrial groups trying to make as much as they can out of society and a small agricultural group making as much as they can out of our society.  It will become a conflict between two privileged groups for their own special interest.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that it is the responsibility and function of the Government to concern themselves, not with the interests of any single section of farmers or industrialist, but with the people of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned recently in his statement on Partition the fact that we are going to offer people in the Six Counties equal status to that which they at present enjoy.  I hope I am not misquoting him.  They certainly would not in any way suffer as a result of coming into a united Ireland.  He admitted the other day that the cost of the social services subsidised by Britain was £10 million or £11 million.  He has got to find that money and the money presumably to give us here the same standard as will be enjoyed by the members of the Six Counties when they are in a united Ireland.  I presume we are not going to become secondclass citizens in a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>The objects of his own Party are, first, the revival of the language, which is the main one.  The next is the ending of Partition and the next is that the resources of the nation shall subserve the welfare of the whole community. Is it not clear that, as things are at present, there is absolute stagnation? Is it not clear that the methods which the Taoiseach is trying to use to create prosperity, the methods which have been consistently used by both sides over the past 40 years, have failed in the most disastrous way?</P>
    <P>When we started to operate our own society, the emigration figure was 16,000 a year.  It has moved up to 40,000 or 50,000 at present.  That is a disastrous record.  I am not interested in blaming anybody or any Party.  I am interested in blaming a particular social and economic policy <Col N="1509" />&mdash;the protection of a small minority at the expense of untold hardship and misery to the mass of our own people. I am not an economist; I am not a person of any great wisdom; I am not a person with anything like the ability of the Taoiseach.  He must see all these things very much more clearly than I can see them but they are incontrovertible facts.</P>
    <P>I would again ask the two major Parties to remember&mdash;and I think it is to their credit that they do&mdash;that the old differences are now irrelevant, but I would ask them to recall that the only problems which must separate us in the future are questions arising on the big issue of public control, public ownership of industry and the means of production and distribution. In short, socialism is the word for it.  We must concern ourselves with the welfare state, whether we want it or not.  People have a perfect right to feel as they like about it and believe as they wish about it, but it is a relevant issue.  It must become a relevant issue between the Parties in future.  The control of bureaucracy is the most important thing from my point of view as a socialist.  You must envisage an extension of bureaucracy and the method of the control of bureaucracy in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>These, it seems to me, are issues which must divide us in the future.  On them the Minister for Agriculture was right today when he said to Deputy Dillon that he did not think there was very much difference between them really on the question of the marketing of turkeys.  The main thing was the attempted centralisation of marketing facilities, on the one hand, and leaving it to the private wholesaler, on the other.  The attitude of the Minister for Agriculture was that things were all right as they were and were not so bad that they could not be remedied.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to try to think about these matters as coolly as possible and tell me if there is anything sacrosanct about the whole conception of private enterprise.  Why should it be the only thing preserved at the expense of so much hardship amongst the mass of the people?  It is <Col N="1510" /> quite clear that looking at the past 30 or 40 years of government from the effective point of view of the attitude taken by Ministers in relation to special problems of health, education, the control of banking policy and public ownership, there is a tremendous amount in common between the members of the two major opposing groups.  They are finding it harder and harder to highlight any differences there may be amongst them.</P>
    <P>I particularly admired the very good Party speech by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins.  Equally, I admired the very thoughtful speech by Deputy D. Costello who seemed to apply himself to fundamental problems which must concern us now.  The Government must exercise some control of banking policy or credit through the Central Bank.  That is the kernel of the whole problem.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will not devote himself entirely to repudiating charges about the missing 15,000 people who emigrated or who did or did not get jobs in the past five or 10 years.  The problem is very much greater even than all that.  From now on, the House should concern itself with the fundamental causes of those problems.</P>

      <P>I shall not delay the House as other Deputies wish to speak. It seems to me there is no obligation on Deputies on any side of the House to try to find points of difference. Rather, our responsibility and duty are to see where we can effect improvements and, by discussion, secure agreement on a policy that will generally develop the economy of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not matter greatly how the economy of the country is developed, whether by a system of private enterprise or public ownership or, as is <Col N="1511" /> generally believed to be the most practical, a combination of both systems.  I think no advantage is to be gained by emphatic declarations on one side or the other.  By pooling our wisdom and combining where possible to secure agreement we must try to evolve a policy that will provide improved economic and social conditions for as many of our people as possible.</P>
    <P>One of the important matters this debate has high-lighted is the significance of future trading arrangements. So far as the Free Trade Area in Europe is concerned, I understand Government policy is wedded to the idea of a European Free Trade Area under O.E.E.C.&mdash;a trading area embracing all member-countries including Ireland and granting this country, in common with some others, special treatment.  If this arrangement does not come into existence&mdash;and in view of recent arrangements at Stockholm it seems somewhat remote&mdash;we have elected not to join the proposed arrangements between the Six and the Seven.</P>
    <P>When discussing this matter by way of Parliamentary Questions recently, the Taoiseach said we had not elected to join.  From that, I conclude we are at present excluded, unless we elect to join, from the benefits of these arrangements. What do the Government propose to do in view of the rather rapid development which has occurred arising out of the Stockholm arrangement?</P>
    <P>Some months ago, the Deputy Secretary of O.E.E.C. spoke at a meeting in Dublin.  Even then, when it seemed that there was less likelihood of an arrangement such as that which has taken place at Stockholm, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It will be some time, I think, before the wider negotiations, in which Ireland can take part, will be resumed.  There will be some talks, but I do not myself foresee wider negotiations in the immediate future.  This is pessimistic; but one must be a realist in these matters.  It is no use fooling ourselves. You are not going to have <Col N="1512" /> a wider Free Trade Area this year or next year.  That is quite clear.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that he believed goodwill exists.</P>
    <P>Since then, the Six and the Seven have reached agreement on measures under which certain preferential arrangements will come into existence, starting, as I understand it, in July of next year and allowing, over a period, for a reduction in protection, and so on.  What view do the Government hold and what policy does this country propose to adopt arising out of this new development?  Is it still our aim to await the resumption of negotiations under O.E.E.C. or will we seek for attachment to or association in some form with the proposed new arrangements?</P>
    <P>The general consensus of opinion of a number of spokesmen from different countries who have addressed themselves to this problem at meetings here or elsewhere all tends towards the view that, unless we are associated in some way with these new arrangements, our trading interest and our general economic circumstances will be, if not worsened, at any rate without the consequential advantages which these new trading arrangements which have been agreed upon will have.  In that connection, I want to refer to some of the problems which have arisen in our trade with European countries.</P>
    <P>For a number of years, we have had trade agreements with continental countries.  With all these countries, I think we have had, over the years during which these agreements have been current, heavy adverse trade balances. We buy considerably more from them than they buy from us.  In recent months, we again had the experience that the French authorities refused to take sheep and lambs and we had the consequently adverse effect on prices here.  The time has come when we must reconsider our whole attitude to these trading arrangements.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly in taking out one specific item, an unduly pessimistic conclusion might be drawn, but the fact that over a number of years <Col N="1513" /> beginning, say, eight or nine years ago since these agreements or most of them were first negotiated, we have had adverse trade balances continually with these countries, is a justification for reconsidering the terms of these agreements and, if possible, where-ever our rights have been interfered with or discriminatory practices have been adopted, taking remedial action with the country concerned.</P>
    <P>A great deal of thought has been given to the problem of unemployment and to the problem of providing increased employment here as well as reducing or, if possible, eliminating emigration.  I have no desire to exaggerate the significance of the figures of emigration and the fall in the numbers in employment.  Over a great number of years, there has been a steady and continuous drain of people from the land, and no matter how these statistics are examined, the changes one way or another are small; there are some few thousand fewer on the unemployment register this year than last year but the changes are of no great significance.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach was in opposition, he estimated that a total number of 15,000 new jobs were required annually.  Some people would put the figure higher than that but for the purposes of discussion, no one will dispute that figure.  But if one looks at the numbers who have left the land over, say, a ten-year period in Table XIX of the <i>Irish Statistical Survey</i> for 1958, one will see that as between 1949 and 1959, although the figures for this year as not available, there are approximately 90,000 persons fewer engaged in agriculture.  Particulars have been given of the number of new employment permits issued in Britain in the past two years to new entrants from this country and taking the years 1957 and 1958, 106,000 such permits were issued to Irish people, that is, Irish people who, for the first time, secured employment in Britain.</P>
    <P>Figures are given in the <i>Statistical Survey</i> which show that each year for a number of years, probably with one exception involving a very small number, <Col N="1514" /> there has been a continuous decline in the numbers at work.  I understand from some figures given in reply to a question I asked this week that for the six months ended September last, there was a slight rise in the numbers in insurable employment on the basis of insurance stamps sold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving these changes aside, because I do not think there is any great significance in them, the general tenor of all the figures published and more especially of the figures for a definite period such as the ten years I have taken in respect of those employed in agriculture as shown in table XVIII of the <i>Statistical Survey</i>, indicates that over the years there has been a continuous decline.  That brings me to a matter which I believe is of great importance from this country's point of view whether we have ever adequately assessed the nature of that problem and the steps, if any, which can be taken to deal with that situation.</P>
      <P>Deputies from all sides deplored the drift from the land and figures can be quoted to show changes during the terms of office of different Governments. However, the definite conclusion to be drawn, a conclusion which is inescapable, is that over any lengthy period, there is a continuous drain from the land and, taking account of the statistics which I have mentioned of those at work, there is over a period a drop in the total numbers employed, as well as a very large number of new entrants seeking work in Britain, which is apparent from the statistics published there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Taoiseach adverted to this matter some years ago he dwelt on the need for 15,000 new jobs per year. With very few exceptions and those probably at a time when there was full employment in the building industry and a lot of construction work, as well as work on drainage and on afforestation, in addition to the industrial increases, I do not think anything like that number was added each year.  In fact, the general conclusion which must be drawn from all the figures available <Col N="1515" /> is that, even allowing for the numbers put into employment, the total numbers at work continue to decline and the numbers emigrating are fairly constant.</P>
    <P>During the past 12 months or so, I listened to a lecture by a well-known economist who had considered this matter fully.  He expressed the view that we could maintain or even increase, the standard of living here and have a further fall of 200,000 persons employed in agriculture.  These figures at first are alarming but when one realises what has happened over a number of years, the conclusions drawn from these figures may well be justified.  This economist said that on the basis of changed methods in agriculture, machinery, the scientific approach and so forth, there was no reason, with 200,000 fewer employed in agriculture, for our not having the same standard of living for those employed or, in fact, an even higher standard.  That obviously poses very considerable problems in relation to what can be done to provide increased employment in industry or in some other way to absorb, not all, but as many as possible of those who will over a period leave agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>I have read the statement issued by the Government on the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  I think it is no exaggeration to say it is a most disappointing document.  Many of the matters referred to in it were facts which were already available or statements of action taken or decisions reached which members of the Dáil or those in a position to inquire about them could have already discovered. But I note from this that there is no reference to the importance of providing here improved facilities for scientific and technical training for people who wish to avail of them.  As far as I know, there has been no realisation by any Department, or by the Government as a whole, of the need to take steps to equip people here with more scientific and technical knowledge. A great deal of emphasis has been placed, during lectures and discussions, <Col N="1516" /> both by economists and parliamentarians, on the need for improved efficiency, increased productivity and so forth, but generally, other than making that statement, no definite plans or indications are given, and there appears to be no appreciation of what is involved in improving our techniques and in providing for the needs which are obvious if we are to surmount the many difficulties that have to be overcome.</P>
    <P>One of the matters which has received considerable attention and which is emphasised by all people qualified to know&mdash;technicians, economists and others&mdash;is that we are far behind other countries in the numbers of people with scientific and technical training. That is not to say that those who have the training here are not comparable. In fact, many of them are superior and certainly equal to those trained elsewhere.  But, by and large, the facilities afforded and the encouragement provided here for scientific and technical training are inadequate to meet the demands of conditions and to meet the competition which we must meet if we are to provide an improved standard of living.</P>
    <P>Last night, the Minister for Industry and Commerce adverted to the need for industrial development which depended on craft industries and for development which depended on specialised products instead of trying to compete with countries equipped for industrial development on a mass-pro-duced scale.  If that is so, and I see no reason to quarrel with that view, we must endeavour to provide here personnel who have scientific and technical training and who have an opportunity of developing their skills and knowledge so that we can exploit their abilities.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason I feel we have never sufficiently adverted to the need for better facilities and greater inducements so that we can encourage people in scientific matters&mdash;and when I use the word &ldquo;scientific&rdquo;, I mean it in its broadest sense&mdash;train farmers to give them more skill and knowledge and train better scientists and technicians for industrial work.  If we provide the opportunities here, I have no doubt our <Col N="1517" /> people are just as capable&mdash;indeed, many of them are more capable&mdash;as anyone else, but that we lag behind in production compared with a number of other European countries is to a very considerable extent due to the fact that we have not here a sufficient number of people trained and equipped with the technical knowledge to fit them for the very competitive conditions existing at present.</P>
    <P>I understand that the trade discussions which have been taking place with the British Government were suspended because of the intervention of the British election.  That election is now over for some time and, in view of the very definite trading arrangements which have developed in Europe in recent months, and particularly the arrangements which have arisen out of the Stockholm Agreement, it seems obvious that we ought not to allow ourselves to be lulled into any sense of complacency about our trading prospects. I would hope that the Taoiseach will be able to satisfy the House and the country that there will be no avoidable delay in concluding a new trade agreement with the British.  The present agreement was negotiated in 1948 and many changes have occurred since.  Some of them alter very considerably the economic situation, but they all point to the inevitable conclusion that the time has arrived when we should negotiate a new trade agreement, an agreement which will take cognisance of the changes which have occurred since and which will endeavour to secure reciprocal trading benefits to enable the economy to be expanded and developed.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to refer, that is, the dispute between the Minister for Health and the Irish Medical Association.  I feel that, with reason and common sense, an arrangement should be arrived at between the Minister and the Irish Medical Association which would provide a solution of this dispute.  The general experience of all disputes is that many of them, if not all, are settled sometimes, somehow.  In the case of most disputes, the earlier a settlement is arrived at, the better. Without entering into the merits or <Col N="1518" /> a criticism of the attitude of either parties to this dispute, reason, common sense and the general welfare of the community would suggest that a settlement should be arrived at.  The Taoiseach might consider intervening in this matter, with a view to effecting a settlement which must ultimately be secured if the harmonious operation of the health services is to continue.</P>
    <P>This Government have advantages that few Governments have had for many years.  They have an overall majority and are in office during a period of relatively stable economic conditions.  There is nothing preventing the Government from implementing their policy if they have a policy capable of improving the economy and the social fabric of the country. The Opposition have co-operated to a very considerable extent in effectively securing the enactment of legislation and the passage of measures designed to help the people as a whole.  It is for that reason that we and the country look expectantly to the Government to implement the undertakings which they gave to the people during the last election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>One hesitates to intervene in a debate of this kind, in which the old story is dished up again.  I am rather surprised at the &ldquo;neck&rdquo; of the Opposition in this matter.  They are the people who have had two chances, two opportunities. What was the result?  They left office on each occasion two years before they had to.  Why? That is the simple way of looking at it.  The last time they ran away they were careless of the way in which they left things after them.  At column 896 of the Official Report for Tuesday, 7th May, 1957, the present Minister for Agriculture, who was then Minister for Local Government, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since assuming office, I have recommended the issue of £1,340,000 to liquidate the obligations of local authorities outside the cities of Dublin and Cork, to banks, to contractors and to persons awaiting payment of approved <Col N="1519" /> grants and advances for private housing.</P>
    <P>At that time £1,340,000 was due to banks, contractors and persons, by local authorities and there was no money to pay it, not a fluke.</P>
    <P>I have often heard it said that there are lies, damn lies and statistics. Let us take the statistics of unemployment given on the 6th December, 1956, to Deputy Galvin, in reply to a Parliamentary Question:&mdash;</P>
    <P>...the number of persons, resident in Cork City, who were on the register at the local employment exchange was 3,570.  On the corresponding date in 1955, the number was 2,164.</P>
    <P>We come then to Dublin City.  On the 26th November, 1955, the number was 11,671; on 24th November, 1956 it was 17,381.  Therefore, the 15,000 mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave were driven out of employment in Dublin City and Cork City alone by the fact that there was no money to pay anybody when that Party ran out of office on the last occasion.  It is just as well to get clear on those things.</P>
    <P>Then there is the disruption caused by a change of Government.  We had that experience.  Everybody has had it. We did our best to avoid it.  Under the present democratic system here it cannot be avoided.  I can foresee a period in the very near future when, as nearly happened before, two Deputies will decide who will be the new Government and surely one of the two will be Taoiseach.  He will be entitled to his price.  That is what will happen.  We did our best to avoid that when we tried to change the present system of proportional representation.  We failed. I belong to a constituency that was intelligent enough to back the proposed change.</P>
    <P>We hear now about unemployment. To be quite frank about it, I cannot see it.  I make no bones about it; I cannot see it.  I travel through my own constituency and am long enough there to know the position that has obtained there.  I am long enough there to know <Col N="1520" /> the scrap auction held every six months of machinery from Haulbowline.  That was all that was there in the old days. There was a change in 1939.  There was development there.  I have read the annual report of Irish Steel Holdings today and one can be proud of it.  There are 600 men in constant employment there with decent rates of wages and decent conditions.  On the last occasion that I asked the inter-Party Government a question about it, I was told that the matter was in abeyance. Everything was in abeyance then.  Now we have a report showing development and extension of the industry and the provision of employment.  That is the difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to the town of Fermoy is that it has woollen mills and I must pay tribute to the owners for extending their mills. But you have something here called the Industrial Development Authority whose activities cannot be questioned in this House.  We are anxious to find employment in country towns for our rural people but on two occasions recently I have come up against this blank wall in regard to the Industrial Development Authority.  Unless I find a change of tune, I shall get some means by which they can be brought in here and made answerable for their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You also have that type of closed door in regard to Irish Shipping Limited.  A pretty considerable amount of the Irish taxpayers' money has been invested by the State in Irish Shipping Limited.  Surely with the employment position as it is, and with two of our own dockyards endeavouring to get employment for our people, two ships of Irish Shipping Limited should not be sent outside the country for refitting purposes?  What is the good of talking about unemployment here <Col N="1523" /> if the ships of a State-sponsored industry are not to give employment to our own people but are sent to Britain for repairs?</P>
    <P>Those are the complaints I have to make in regard to industry.  There is one other matter which I should like to raise in regard to store cattle.  I should like to say this to Deputy Cosgrave and I have said it often enough before.  There will be this constant drain and all this cant about the flight from the land, whilst the maximum wage on the land is £6 per week when a man can get from £8 to £11 for his four bones in any industry in the country.  You will have that continual flight from the land while you have that position and nobody can blame the people.  That wage of £6 is the most a man can get out of the land at present and, even as things stand, it cannot yet be paid by every farmer.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem we have to face is in regard to bovine tuberculosis. It is a grave position and I should like to see some way of rectifying it.  We have had about six years experience now of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in a place called Bansha.  Yet there are more reactors in Bansha today than on the day we started.  Let us be frank about these things and tell the truth.  I found in the Cork County Bovine Tuberculosis Committee a return for some twelve months' activities on the part of the Department's valuers and this was the position.  They dealt with some 15,000 reactors.  The Department's agents bought 703 and 6,000 were sold privately.  There was a loss of £12 10s. per animal purchased by the Department on those 703 animals.  How anybody could try to persuade me that a farmer will sell for £12 10s. less than the Department gives, beats me.  But the facts are there and on that basis we went to the Minister.  We put up the case to him that the farmers selling their cattle whatever way they could, should get that £12 10s. as compensation. The Minister beat us and beat us hollow.</P>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;Sell your cattle whatever way you can.  I will give you <Col N="1524" /> a bonus of £15 per reactor, sold to a licensed cannery and in addition, when you are clear, I will give you £4 a head on your clean herd and £8 a head on your reactors.&rdquo;  So the Minister has not even done his part.  I do not know what machinery we have for dealing with the canning people.  Undoubtedly on the 700 odd cows, the canning people made a good fortune.  Ever since the new scheme was initiated they are endeavouring, by every means in their power, to collar the extra £15 the farmer is getting.</P>
    <P>While that state of affairs continues we shall have a continuation of trouble. Our time to get rid of reactors is limited.  It is time we settled down to work and got the job done, whatever the means we adopt to do it.  You are not going to do it on the lines of the Bansha plan which was brought in by Deputy Dillon and neither, as far as I can see, are you going to do it by saying, &ldquo;Clear nine counties.&rdquo;  If you do that tomorrow what is going to become of the other 17 and where are the cattle to go?</P>
    <P>Looking through this year's trade and shipping statistics I saw a most amazing thing.  To tell the truth I cannot imagine how it came about, in a year like this when we had a scarcity of grass and a scarcity of feeding stuffs, due to the summer we had, and when, unfortunately, our customer across the way was in the same position and could not buy, because he could not get anything either.  But yet we find that from January to August of this year we imported 50,987 cattle at a cost of £2,579,000.</P>
    <P>We have enough to do to find food for our own stock and I cannot understand why we should bring in extra stock.  In case that was not enough, we imported 92,991 sheep and lambs at a cost of £461,000.  These are extraordinary figures but we are meeting with extraordinary things.  The Minister and his predecessor today said they were very near each other&mdash;they represent adjacent counties&mdash;but unfortunately the agricultural economy in those countries is very different from ours in the southern counties and while both men might be all right there, they know &ldquo;hang-all&rdquo; about tillage or grain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> While we are looking for markets abroad, I find from the imports of cereals and feeding stuffs that for the first six months of this year we paid foreigners £10,157,000.  That is a market that exists here at home and if there is justification for putting on tariffs to prevent agricultural machinery and artificial fertilisers coming in there is justification for protection for the farmers who are entitled to that market just as much as the industrialists are entitled to protection.</P>
    <P>It was most amazing to learn also that we brought in oats from America costing £1 0. 10d. a cwt. and we exported oats at £1. 1. 0 a cwt.  We made 2d. on the transaction and doubtless we kept the shipping companies going. There is no justification at present for importing feeding stuffs into a country where the people are prepared to grow their own.  We are faced with that extraordinary condition of affairs which in my opinion should not exist.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up time but I want to be fair.  I have seen in my own constituency, and I know from my own knowledge, that the industrial drive is going ahead successfully.  We have made a rather marvellous recovery since the period when we had Deputy Sweetman and Deputy John A. Costello singing their swan song in December 1956.  Things have changed a lot since then.  People have confidence in the country and, I think, in the Government.  They are prepared to put their money into it; they are investing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pictured the situation as I found it.  We had talk about unemployment but when you look at the figures you find that unemployment went up by 7,000 in 1955-56 in Dublin City.  The same thing happened in Cork and these are only two centres out of many.  When you look for the reason, you find that Deputy Smith coming in as Minister for Local Government had to find £1,350,000 to pay to the local authorities the grants that Deputy O'Donnell was not able to pay.  I know the conditions in Cork and I know what we had to do in Cork County Council.  We were sending <Col N="1526" /> applications to the bank every other day begging for a few pounds to pay grants due to us by the Department of Local Government.  That Department had no money to pay them. Members of the inter-Party Government had two chances and muffed both of them.  The best thing they can do now is to shut up.</P>

      <P>As a new Deputy it is very interesting to listen to the debate but if one is in any way concerned one realises that there is a lot of bluff on all sides.  It is surprising how each side can get statistics.</P>
      <P>I should like to have the right to cross-examine in this House.  I am quite sure that would be right up my alley.  I could spend three hours in the Library making up figures and make a good case on the basis of statistics but I did not do so; I am more concerned about what is to be done.  I am concerned about Dublin. Deputy Corry spoke about the employment position in Cork but I want to refer to Dublin because it is the capital and its population is approximately one-fifth of our total population. While I am prepared to concede that the Taoiseach has made great efforts in that regard, and that at least he has checked the decline, I want to make clear that I do not say that the decline was due to any Party. It was natural that employment should decline with mechanisation and with the prosperity there is in England and with the many difficulties facing a country that has nothing much to offer in the form of raw materials except foodstuffs and cattle. I am prepared to admit there has been some improvement but nothing like what the Taoiseach promised.  It is all very well to listen to talk about the 100,000 jobs but I do not think that gets us anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in Dublin is very serious.  We are told there are 62,000 persons unemployed and of that number 20,000, I understand, are unemployed in Dublin.  Whatever improvements were made, I am not aware that they were made in the Dublin area.  I have certain figures which will give the House an idea of the position in Dublin.  Take housing, <Col N="1527" /> on which Dubliners depend very much from the point of view of employment. There was a peak year about five years ago when we had 2,000 persons employed and there is now actually a decline this year as compared with last year.  The figure I got from the Housing Department for the number employed in building is 387 this year, as against 686 last year, 946 in 1957 and 2,000 five or six years ago.</P>
    <P>About this time last year, there was a lot of talk about the amount granted for the construction of flats.  At that time, I mentioned that I did not think it would improve employment conditions because considerable fewer people are employed on the building of flats than on the building of houses. In Dublin only 387 are employed.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the Housing Manager a short time ago and in answer to a question, he said he expected there would be fewer employed.  Therefore, as far as Dublin is concerned there is not much hope, and on special works, there are fewer employed this year than last year.  I also asked the City Manager on Monday what was the total number employed by Dublin Corporation now as compared with five years ago, and the answer was that there are 900 fewer employed now.  There is no work for manual workers in Dublin.  What they want is constructional work, something to take the place of housing, and I ask: What does the Taoiseach offer?</P>
    <P>A short time ago, in reply to a question by me, he said he was prepared to support any schemes of economic merit.  Suggestions have been made to him since then and I must ask what he has in mind for Dublin?  The situation is very serious.  That is why I make so many complaints to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare when he disallows benefit to people on the grounds that they do not seek work.  Where is the work for them?  He has admitted that he disallowed the claims of 220 men in one month in Dublin, and yet the Taoiseach states that more people have been put in employment.  I am very much concerned about Dublin <Col N="1528" /> because I am a Dubliner.  It is where one-fifth of our population reside.  I know their troubles, and while there may be some employment for young girls, there is very little for boys.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I heard the Minister for Lands state that there were 17,000 extra persons in employment since the Government took office, but I should like to know how many of those are children?  How many are adult males, the fathers of families?  It would be no advantage to the people of Dublin if 5,000 men earning £9 a week lost their employment and 6,000 children got employment at 25/- a week.  I am prepared to admit that the policy of the Taoiseach of building up industries is the only chance we have because although not a farmer, I know very well that the tendency is for fewer persons to be employed in farming.  Farming can be done by mechanisation and all that sort of thing and it was always the practice of farmers to employ nobody but their own families, except for part-time employment. My complaint is that the Fianna Fáil Party exaggerate a lot. Of course, they all do.  The Taoiseach, so to speak, has high hopes but what has he in mind for Dublin, for the 20,000 unemployed who have no hopes?</P>
    <P>A national school teacher, who is also a secondary school teacher, spoke to me yesterday and said it was a shame, it was criminal, that young people do not get their Leaving Certificates just because they have no Irish. Even though they are qualified in all other subjects, they are denied these certificates on that one ground.  In many cases, these young people could get good employment if they had certificates but many firms have no time for boys without them.  There are forms to be filled up and if the answer on the form is that the applicant has no Leaving Certificate, that ends the matter.  The Taoiseach should consider that problem, and I suggest there ought to be first-class and second-class certificates.  If a boy had a second-class certificate, it would indicate to business people that he had a high standard of education.  It is a serious matter for many thousands of young people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> I have a motion on the Order Paper about Partition.  I know that is a subject which is not very much discussed here.  It is perhaps, considered dangerous and I am not going to dwell on it further than to mention that I am disappointed that throughout the whole debate there has not been one word about it.  I think this House is entitled to some kind of discussion on the subject.  The Taoiseach should not go to England and discuss it there, discuss it at his Party's Árd Fheis and then, as it would appear, object to any discussion of the subject here.  I flatter myself that I know a good deal about it, even though I am prepared to admit I am not so well informed on other subjects.  It is a serious matter.  It is as important as unemployment and is responsible for a great deal of tension, north and south.</P>
    <P>There are several hundred young men in jail in the North and, judging by the votes cast in the second last election, and in the recent election in the North, they must represent from 250,000 to 300,000 people in this country.  Are these people to be left to rot in the North and are they to be treated as if they were lepers?  I think some reference should be made to Partition but I shall reserve what I have to say about it until the motion in my name comes before the House.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to say except that I want the Taoiseach to indicate to the people of Dublin&mdash;as I said before, they represent one-fifth of the total population&mdash;what hopes they have of securing employment?  What constructional works does he propose of any large dimensions to absorb three or four thousand manual workers, not children?  The Taoiseach ought to have some idea now.  He invited local bodies to make proposals and by now he should have some idea of what he can do for Dublin.  It must be remembered, as I said before, there are 20,000 unemployed in the city and I would appeal to the Taoiseach to put a brake on the action of the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1530" /> to the Minister for Social Welfare in disallowing the benefit claims of people on the ground that they are not seeking work, when, in fact, there is no work for them.</P>
    <P>It should suffice that they are registered at the labour exchanges. Firms now apply to the labour exchanges for workers and it should suffice that they are registered there. If they refuse employment when offered it by the exchange, that would be good enough, but to disallow them at the rate of 220 a month, including 73 married men in one month, is a shame.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The first fundamental for any improvement in the economy is that the truth be told.  The Taoiseach and the whole Fianna Fáil Party broke that in 1956, and it was because the people realised in 1957 that the promises they made were entirely without foundation that we had the wave of despair and despondency that swept over the country in 1957 and resulted in the highest ever emigration figure.  That is the truth.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach yesterday&mdash;somewhat unfortunately from the point of view of the high office he holds&mdash;failed to tell the truth to the House.  His was a disgraceful performance; when dealing with insurance stamps, he failed to tell the House that there was an increase in the number of people buying stamps, not because of any extra employment but as a result of the enactment of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act of last October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not matter a hoot whether the correct figure is the whole 18,000 people brought in under the Act or whether a proportion of them were established civil servants, or a proportion temporary civil servants, who, incidentally, buy stamps.  No matter what the figure was, at least 9,000 extra people, on the Taoiseach's own admission, are now buying stamps as a result <Col N="1531" /> of the raising of the level from £600 to £800.  For the Taoiseach not to disclose that to the House yesterday shows the same spirit of deception which has always characterised the policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>The facts relating to the national economic position are neither as cheerless nor as discouraging as many Deputies opposite asserted during the debate, and as some of them apparently believe.  I should make it clear that the Government have no desire whatever to minimise or to conceal the magnitude of the tasks facing the country or the distance we are from the realisation of our present economic and social objectives.  We do not think that there is any advantage in exaggerating them either.  I realise that it is a normal and natural activity for any political Party in Opposition to seek to undermine public confidence in the policy or the competence of the Government.  I do not complain about that.  That is the stuff, the warp and the woof of Party politics; but, as we play our Party game, I suggest that we should try to avoid playing it in a way which may damage the vital interests of the country.</P>

      <P>Criticism of the Government is, of course, quite valid. Indeed, I have emphasised again and again that we welcome rather than resent it.  As I have said before, it can be as vigorous as any Deputy likes to make it provided it is directed towards the constructive development of sound national policy.  When the policy of the Government is being criticised, however, I think that those who attempt it are not likely to carry conviction to their listeners unless they endeavour to indicate the precise manner in which they think that policy can be changed and improved.  Fault-finding without the submission to examination and criticism of alternative proposals regarding policy can merely lead to the growth of an atmosphere of defeatism and despondency throughout the country.  That is a development we must all seek to avoid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> Contrary to what Deputy Sweetman has just said, I think that the most encouraging feature in the national situation at the present time is the disappearance of the clouds of despondency which hung so heavily over the country only a couple of short years ago.  I think it fair to say that in the course of this debate no attempt was made by any speaker opposite, not excluding Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the principal Opposition Party, to formulate any constructive alternative to the policy the Government is now applying.  I realise that all politicians are accustomed to concentrate upon the facts which seem to support the particular conclusions that they are endeavouring to put across and to ignore the facts that do not. As a politician, engaged at the moment in defending the policy of the Government in office, I realise that any facts I produce will be open to suspicion for that reason or, at least, will be capable of successful misrepresentation to some people as being tendentious.  I urge on Deputies and members of the public who want to get an objective statement of current facts relating to the national economic situation to study the reports published by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies will agree that the Central Bank Board have never been famous for the cheerfulness of their reports.  If the Central Bank Board say that economic conditions are improving, then our experience would suggest to us that they have checked, and double-checked, the data available to them before committing themselves to that unusual and infrequent opinion.  When, therefore, the Central Bank Board in their most recent report published at the end of last October begin by saying that &ldquo;monetary incomes, employment and activity in general continue to expand&rdquo; we can be reasonably certain that it is so.  Indeed, we have little difficulty&mdash; at least, those of us who want to get the facts and base our judgment on the facts&mdash;in finding evidence to support that conclusion of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>In the case of manufacturing industry it is a fact that in the September <Col N="1533" /> and June quarters the level of production was the highest ever recorded in this country in those periods.  That fact alone, while encouraging, is not the most encouraging part of the industrial production figures available to us.  The significant feature is the trend, and the trend is shown by comparing the output in each quarter of this year with the corresponding quarters of last year. In the first quarter of this year industrial output was one per cent. higher than in the same quarter last year.  In the second quarter it was 11 per cent. higher.  In the third quarter it was 16 per cent. higher.  There is, I think, every reason therefore for us to take heart in the knowledge that the plans which have been made, the inducements which have been offered to bring about an expansion in industrial output, are beginning to pay off.  We can hope they will continue to pay off and that the trend which these figures disclose will proceed apace.</P>
    <P>As regards agriculture, the Government are very much concerned about the fact that farm incomes have not risen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for the past two years, due primarily no doubt to the abnormal weather conditions prevailing, but also to other causes, including a downward movement of some farm prices.  We recognise that the country's economic progress can never be regarded as secure unless farm incomes rise in line with incomes in other economic sectors.  That must come about mainly by increasing output and improving the efficiency of production, thereby lowering costs. Government policy is, as was indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, directed to those ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank in its latest report also pointed out that the most marked change which has occurred during the present year concerns prices.  Every Deputy knows that for over 20 years the price level has been continuously moving upwards and in each year the cost of living index number showed an increase over the previous until this year.  For the first time in twenty <Col N="1534" /> years, the upward movement in prices has been checked and indeed reversed in this year.</P>
    <P>The mid-November cost of living index number, which has been released by the Central Statistics Office to-day, shows that the index number for mid-November this year is 144, that is, two points below the index figure for the corresponding month last year.  It is true that that decline in the cost of living is, in part, attributable to a fall in farm prices and is, therefore, of mixed benefit to our economy.  The gain to urban dwellers is offset by a loss to farm producers. It is perhaps a disturbing fact that, simultaneously with that fall in farm prices and the contraction in farm incomes, urban workers are seeking and obtaining increases in their wages.</P>
    <P>Unlike prices, industrial earnings have continued to move upward during this year and there is, now in progress another round of wage increases which can be fairly described as being the only factor now in sight which could operate to cause prices to rise, or to start rising again.  It is important, therefore, to know&mdash;and indeed it is encouraging to record&mdash;the comment of the Central Bank Board that simultaneously with this increase in output and rise in earnings, there has been a slight, but encouraging, improvement in labour productivity.</P>
    <P>In regard to external trade, the underlying upward trend of imports has been sustained and exports this year did not expand to offset that trend.  There was a rise in invisible receipts but precise estimates relating to them have not yet been prepared. In their October report, the Central Bank estimated that the over-all deficit on external payments this year would be about £20,000,00.  There are now some reasons to think that it may be somewhat less than that.  This has to be said about that deficit, however: first of all, the effect of the deficit on the country's external financial reserves has been offset to some extent by an inflow of capital and, secondly, increased stocks and increased capital asset formation account for a considerable part of the deficit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon expressed concern <Col N="1535" /> about the re-emergence of this fairly substantial deficit on our external payments. The Government share that concern.  We appreciate that there is always a danger of our economy moving into a situation somewhat like that of 1955 when the expansion of production and employment was based upon an insupportable balance of payments deficit.  We know this country is always vulnerable to recurring balance of payments crises.  It is in the light of that ever-present danger that we have to take note of what is happening in the economy and particularly the present round of wage increases.</P>
    <P>If there is not a substantial rise in total production and a substantial improvement in productivity, that could well bring about a situation in which the Government would be forced to take action which could operate to check the present rise in employment, little as we would like to see that happening.  Therefore, the trade unions which are promoting the present wage demands have a special duty to co-operate in measures to expand output and improve productivity. That has to be done if the effect of this increase in wages on the level of employment and prices is not to become a matter of serious concern to many workers.  If their products should get priced out of their markets, then the effect upon the employment situation could be grave enough.</P>
    <P>Might I say that there is evidence that the responsible leaders of the trade union movement are fully aware of the dangers inherent in the situation and their active participation in the work of the National Productivity Committee and in other measures adopted to bring about an offsetting improvement in output and productivity cannot be too highly praised.</P>
    <P>Another crucial factor in our situation is the state of the cattle trade. We have a much larger number of cattle now than we had a year ago. That is due, in part, to increased output in this year and, in part, to a decrease in exports to date.  All the expert advice available to the Government suggests that trade will improve but we clearly see that the long-term prospects <Col N="1536" /> depend largely upon the speed at which our bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme is carried out.  I shall not cover again the ground so ably covered this morning by the Minister for Agriculture but I want to say, in respect of one remark made by Deputy Dillon, that I have no doubt, and never had any doubt, as to the fundamental importance of the cattle trade in our national economy.  It is because we recognise its fundamental importance that it is obtaining and will continue to obtain the predominant attention of the Government and the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The present situation as I have described it is one which calls for considerable restraint in consumer spending.  The dangers inherent in our situation, the dangers to which Deputy Dillon referred, can be greatly minimised if there is a higher level of personal saving.  I want to say that I have no cause to grumble on that account.  There has been, indeed, in this year, a very considerable improvement in the level of savings.  So far as the Post Office Savings Bank and the Savings Certificates are concerned, the increase in the net input this year averaged £300,000 a month and that, notwithstanding the fact that the level of investment in Prize Bonds is about £14,000,000.</P>
      <P>This round of wage increases, as I have said, carries benefits for the workers who will participate in it, but there is also danger for other workers and the whole national economy, that could be greatly offset if the workers concerned, who are, for the first time, getting an increase in wages which is not designed or required to offset an increase in the cost of living, could be encouraged to save the whole or a considerable part of the increases they are obtaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our national situation, notwithstanding the emergence of this deficit on external account is, as I have said, <Col N="1537" /> sound enough.  There has been no necessity yet, because of that external payments situation, to contemplate a curtailment of bank credit or other measures.  Indeed, bank advances this year are running some six per cent. higher than last year and, therefore, there has been a most significant development, a most encouraging development, and one to which I particularly direct the attention of Deputy Dillon in view of his observations regarding the place of agricultural credit in the Government's Economic Programme.</P>
    <P>By July of this year, as compared with last year, advances by commercial banks to farmers had increased by 55 per cent., the actual amount of cash involved being £10 million.  Having regard to the new attitude of the banks to farm credit problems, it is now possible to say with confidence to each individual farmer, as we have said to each individual industrialist, that no person with enterprise and sound ideas for expanding production need be deterred from going ahead by lack of financial resources.</P>
    <P>We accept that the whole test of our economic policy is its effect on employment.  Then the need of this country is to widen the opportunities of employment available to its people. Unless we succeed in doing that, no matter what other outcome there may be from the operations of our plans, we will have failed.  We do not need to increase our financial reserves.  We want to see these plans putting more men to work and enabling more families to enjoy economic security.</P>
    <P>We are not trying to conceal&mdash;in-deed, we are trying to publicise&mdash;the fact that the most serious aspects of the country's economic position is this continuing decline in the nation's labour force and the country's total population which has been going on for very many years.  It is that downward trend of population that economic policy must be designed to reverse. Employment, as any sensible Deputy knows, is not something that the Government can turn on or off like a tap.  All of us are concerned to increase the opportunities of employment. Nobody, I am sure, will doubt that the desire to increase employment <Col N="1538" /> lies behind all our thinking and planning.</P>
    <P>But let us get down to the elements of that problem.  I said some weeks ago, when speaking to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, that the essential fact is this&mdash;that the country at the present level of production is not earning enough to maintain its present population at the standard of living they expect and desire.</P>
    <P>How are we going to rectify this? Deputy Sweetman, speaking to a Fine Gael meeting last Friday in Limerick, said that &ldquo;in due course and at the appropriate time the aims and objects of their policy would be declared by Deputy Dillon.&rdquo;  Anybody can state aims and objects.  That has never been a difficulty for any political Party.  One can express the most grandiose aims and objects but how are we going to realise them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly never worried the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite Deputy Dillon, when he comes to fulfil this commitment which Deputy Sweetman made on his behalf, to devote his mind, not to stating aims and objects, but to put forward constructive means to realise them.  Deputies spoke about the speeches I made while in Opposition. They were widely publicised as representing the thinking and policy of Fianna Fáil at that time.  Whatever were the merits of these speeches, they at least were an indication, when we were in Opposition, that we were not content merely to be negative critics. We put forward our proposals and ideas related to the economic position which then existed.  We did not mind if the then Government adopted them. We felt that our duty, as members of the House, irrespective of our place here, required us to publicise our ideas and proposals.</P>
      <P>The ideas then formulated limited though they were by the inadequacy of the statistical or other data available to us, nevertheless, constituted the foundation upon which the Government <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was subsequently based. That programme, initiated twelve months ago, is having a stimulating effect on employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> The facts cannot be denied. Deputy Sweetman mentioned some statistics.  I do not want to get involved in an analysis of statistics.  I do not want to &ldquo;wrap my mind round&rdquo; statistics like Deputy Dillon.  All the available information shows this trend.  At the beginning of 1956 employment was rising slightly.  That rise tapered out and stopped.  By the middle of that year employment began to fall.  It went on falling and reached its maximum acceleration in the first quarter of 1957 but the fall continued right through to the middle of 1957.  From the last quarter of 1957 to the first quarter of this year the position remained more or less static but from the second quarter of this year a very pronounced upward trend has happily appeared.</P>
    <P>I gave the figures relating to the number of insurance stamps sold since the 1st April.  These figures show that on the average in each week since then 17,000 more stamps were sold than in the corresponding period last year.  Deputy Sweetman said that that increase in the sale of stamps was explainable by the effect of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1958.  To the knowledge of the Department of Social Welfare the number of persons to whom new cards were issued after the enactment of that measure last year was 6,040. Even if we assume that all the persons to whom cards were issued because of the enactment of that measure remained in continuous employment since the first year, the rise in employment this year, though less than what we expected to bring about, is, nevertheless, quite substantial and encouraging.</P>
    <P>We can, in any case, check the conclusions drawn from these statistics by reference to other sources of information which are open to us.  We know that there has been this increase in manufacturing industry.  We know that there are 5,000 more people employed in manufacturing industry now as compared with a year ago.  Deputies will note the fact to which I referred previously that the rise in employment tends to lag <Col N="1540" /> behind the increase in output just as in other conditions a fall in employment tends to fall behind a fall in output.</P>
    <P>We know that commercial activity is running at a higher level than a year ago.  The daily average of bank debits, which is accepted as the index of business activity, is substantially higher than a year ago.  We know that this year we have a record tourist trade. Apart from State-aided housing, there has been a very welcome recovery in building on constructional work by commercial interests.  Indeed&mdash;and this may be of interest to Deputy Sherwin &mdash;I have been informed by prominent contractors in Dublin that the number of construction jobs going to contract by commercial interests during next year is very substantial and the prospects for the building trade in Dublin next year, are, therefore, reasonably good.  We know that the unemployment register shows a reduction.  It may be that the reduction this year as compared with last year is not as great as we would have wished but it is a fact at the moment it is 30,000 less than it was in 1956.</P>

      <P>The decline in the number of people on the register is not explainable entirely by emigration. We have not got precise figures for emigration but the information available to us suggests that the level of emigration this year was very substantially below what it was in the peak years of 1956 and 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne spoke of unemployment here being eight or nine per cent. of our insurable population.  The exact figure at the moment is seven per cent.  But in fairness to the country, I think it should be pointed out that that percentage figure is not comparable with the figure for Great Britain. A far higher proportion of our population than in Great Britain is usefully and profitably employed in occupations not insurable under the <Col N="1541" /> Social Welfare code, particularly of course those engaged in farming as landowners.</P>
    <P>All the information is that the economic trend is upward at present. I will repeat, what some Deputies said, that it is not nearly enough as yet to ensure that the country's economy will continue to expand at a rate which will absorb the whole of the natural annual growth in population.  The Government are not trying to say otherwise.  Indeed, all members of the Government in all their public utterances are urging a still greater effort in all economic sectors towards expansion.</P>
    <P>I believe we have settled the main features of our policy in a way which will give results.  That policy is not carved upon stone.  We are prepared to extend and improve it whenever the opportunity of doing so presents itself. Deputy Dr. Browne asked us to define our position on the issue of public ownership as against private enterprise. I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that that is an unnecessary exercise.  In that respect, Deputy Dr. Browne's speech had little relation to reality. Why should we take an ideological decision between public ownership or private enterprise?  Each has a part to play in the country's development. The decision as to which is the more suitable is one to be taken at the time in relation to particular development problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish inquired about the results of a circular sent by the Government through the Minister for Local Government to local authorities asking for their suggestions for possible openings for productive investment.  The idea in sending that circular was twofold&mdash; (1) to get these local councils as such and the individual members of them thinking in terms of opportunities of expansion and (2) to get a picture in a comprehensive way of the ideas prevalent amongst members of these bodies as to how the State could help them in developing their localities.</P>
    <P>Many of the proposals were outside the scope of the circular.  They related to the improvement of civic offices and other works of that kind <Col N="1542" /> that local authorities had been wishing to go ahead with but that would, I think, earn a very low priority in any investment list any sensible person was preparing at this time.  A very large number of the proposals related to water supply problems and sewerage schemes. Having noted the needs in that regard and the interest of local authorities in proceeding with schemes, the Government decided to extend and improve the grant and loan facilities available to local authorities for these purposes.  The announcement was made some weeks ago and so far as that category of schemes is concerned the decision on the proposals has been taken.</P>
    <P>Many of the proposals related to developing amenities and facilities for tourists.  Some of the proposals came within the scope of the existing arrangements of Bord Fáilte and the £1 million Resorts Development Scheme announced earlier in the year. There emerged from these proposals a residue of novel ideas the economic merits of which are being examined in the relevant branch of the Department of Finance and on which the Government have yet to take decisions.</P>
    <P>I said at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis that all economic progress must be designed to serve social ends.  The aim of our efforts in the economic field is to make the people better off, to improve their living conditions, to give them greater security in the enjoyment of reasonable living standards. That social aim has inspired the policy of this Government from the beginning. But if we attempt to move too fast in that direction we can defeat the over-all plan.</P>
    <P>We cannot burden production with increased taxation for the purpose of improving our social welfare arrangements and at the same time expect production to go on increasing which is what we must bring about if we are to achieve a permanently satisfactory and useful arrangement of social security.  Every increase of 2/6d. in the old age pension costs £1 million. Deputies must keep that fact in mind. We should like to be able to increase the old age pension a great deal more <Col N="1543" /> and we would aspire to do so as soon as the resources are available to the Government to permit it.</P>
    <P>We have twice increased the level of our social welfare payments since we came into office in 1957.  We hope that expanding production and increasing revenue will permit a further improvement in the existing arrangements at some future time.  The Minister for Social Welfare is planning to bring before the Dáil early next year legislation to provide for a contributory retirement pensions scheme for insured workers and for other improvements in existing contributory benefits.  The extent to which we can go in a scheme of that kind will depend upon our judgment as to the increased contributions which workers can bear.</P>
    <P>The intention is to lay the foundation of a sound scheme now and then to build up on it as conditions permit. The main effect of this scheme will be to confer upon all former insured workers who are now beyond their labours a substantial improvement in their existing resources.  I hope personally to see the day when the social welfare arrangements in operation in this country will equal those in neighbouring countries.  That cannot perhaps be realised until we have so developed our economy that the income per head of our population has moved nearer to the income per head in Great Britain.  We must not blink our eyes at the fact that at present income per head here is just about half what it is in Great Britain.  The aim I have expressed will not therefore be realised in the early future but we intend to keep moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>Deputies have spoken about the existing position affecting European trade.  The developments which have taken place since the collapse of the European Free Trade negotiations have been causing us very great concern. We are keeping in close touch with events as they occur.  We are receiving regular reports from our diplomatic representatives in all the capitals concerned as to the thinking that is going on there and the ideas <Col N="1544" /> that are being formulated for improving the existing situation.</P>
    <P>As Deputies have mentioned, there are now two trading groups in Europe into neither of which this country can enter, accepting the full obligations of membership, without taking what most of us would regard as an undue risk.  This country is predominantly agricultural.  That fact must determine our thinking and our policy in this respect as in all others. Balancing our external trade with the world depends mainly on finding increased outlets for agricultural goods. That is the overriding consideration. Neither the European Common Market nor the European Free Trade Association offers us prospects for increased agricultural trade.  It is true that the Common Market will at some stage complete arrangements for the marketing of the agricultural production of their members so as to absorb the whole of it.  Britain, which is our main trading partner, the main outlet for our agricultural produce is not a member of that group.  The European Free Trade Association Agreement contains little relating to agriculture but expressions of good intentions.</P>
    <P>As was said here by Deputies during the course of this discussion, we considered joining the European Free Trade Area when it appeared likely to emerge in the form proposed to the Maudling Committee which met under O.E.E.C., but our consideration of that possibility was based upon two assumptions: first, that Britain would also be a member, and, secondly, that some modification of the requirements of membership would be allowed in our case.  Five other European countries, Portugal, Italy, Turkey, Greece and Iceland also sought special terms of entry to that original Free Trade Area.  Spain, which has since joined the O.E.E.C. would presumably have been a sixth.  Of these countries it is reported that Greece and Turkey are negotiating for association with the Common Market.  It is probable that Spain will also be negotiating to that end at some time in the future. Portugal, as Deputies know, has <Col N="1545" /> elected to join the European Free Trade Association and has secured some modification of the membership rules.  Iceland is a special case being solely dependent upon fish and fish products.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is to our disadvantage that Portugal obtained special terms in the European Free Trade Association and we shall certainly watch with interest the developments which may take place with Finland which also desires, as we understand it, to obtain some limited association with the E.F.T.A.  In the case of Portugal we were given to understand that there would be no question of conditional admission to E.F.T.A., that only countries that were prepared to accept the full obligations of membership would be admitted to that arrangement.  Our decision not to seek to participate in these negotiations or even to apply for observer status there was based largely upon that understanding, although there was also a desire on our part to avoid even to that extent giving an impression that we were prepared to consider accepting membership of that Association on the terms which had been outlined before the negotiations began.</P>
    <P>The position of this country in Europe is, therefore, unique in respect of these trading associations.  Our principal trading customer, Britain, is in the European Free Trade Association and that precludes our considering the possibility of joining the Common Market with its obligation to maintain a common external tariff against non-members.  On the other hand, the E.F.T.A. offers, as I have said, no prospects of trade expansion to this country commensurate with the price we would have to pay in increased competition in our internal market.</P>
    <P>It was in these circumstances that we initiated trade negotiations with Great Britain.  It would, I think, be improper and certainly undesirable to refer now to these negotiations other than to mention the fact that they are in prospect and the background circumstances against which they were initiated.  We had, of course, some <Col N="1546" /> question amongst ourselves about the wisdom of trying to speed up or to postpone these negotiations.  The changing pattern of trading in Europe has counselled us not to be in a hurry.  Any trade agreement which we may make with Britain may last for many years.  The last principal trade agreement negotiated in 1938 has persisted for over 20 years.  We should like certainly to have some knowledge of the long-term prospects for trade with the rest of Europe before finalising our arrangements with Great Britain.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made here to the possibility of an arrangement between the Common Market and the E.F.T.A. and the indications are that that is not likely to happen soon.  A meeting of the O.E.E.C. council at Ministerial level has been summoned for the middle of January but neither the E.F.T.A. agreement nor possible contacts or negotiations between the two trading groups are on the provisional agenda circulated.</P>
      <P>All the chief spokesmen of the European countries, except perhaps France and Italy, appear to desire that any negotiations between these two groups which may occur in the future should be under the auspices of the O.E.E.C.  If Britain were likely to enter into new commitments in the O.E.E.C. or as a result of direct negotiations between E.F.T.A. and the Common Market, then there would be a case for trying to hurry up our bilateral talks, but as matters now stand that does not seem to be probable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from immediate trade interests, there is I know among members of the Dáil as well as members of our business community a certain <Col N="1547" /> sense of insecurity and a fear of possible future trade disadvantages by reason of the fact that we are not formally within one or other of these trade groups.  I do not think we should take any final decision regarding E.F.T.A. until our negotiations with Britain are concluded and then only in the light of the prospects of a wider European trading system being negotiated.  The world trend, however, is towards freer trade and we must not blink our eyes to it.  The Common Market is already making gestures towards a world agreement.  Whatever may be the outcome of the negotiations with Britain or the E.F.T.A. or anyone else, we must face up to the fact of our having to reduce our protective measures at some time and not too far ahead at that.  Indeed there is a case for doing it in our own interests apart from external arrangements.</P>
    <P>Everybody concerned, whether in management or as workers, in industry must face up to that prospect and prepare for it.  I am sure that most of our responsible trade union leaders appreciate that many of the wage increases which are now being negotiated for workers engaged in industry would not be possible if it were not for protection.  We want to see these workers retain their higher earning power but their leaders will have to teach them the lesson that it can be done only by higher efficiency and greater output.  I am sure that the central executive body of the trade union movement, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, participating as it is with the National Productivity Committee, can be relied upon in a general way to preach that truth.  But it is necessary to get below that central authority and down to the branch level in order to get a higher understanding of the fact that the maintenance of workers' present earning power and its possible increase in the future is conditional, in the circumstances likely to develop, upon an increase in efficiency and a raising of output.  If we all can get that realised now, it will make the process of adjustment to new conditions less painful when we have to face it.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to general <Col N="1548" /> external trading policy and there are just a few observations I want to make in that connection.  First of all, it is true that we have probably the most non-discriminatory trading regime in Europe, apart from the British preference tariff, which in any case only applies to about one-third of our total imports.  On the other hand, we do not need to discriminate in our import arrangements for the purpose of achieving a trade balance with each individual country so long as our overall trading situation is all right. But we do need export outlets.  We consider we are entitled to use our bargaining power for the purpose of gaining such outlets where it seems to us to be to our advantage to attempt it.  Our policy, therefore, in respect of these matters is being reassessed at present in a fairly fundamental way.  Again, it seems to us to be good sense not to attempt to finalise our decisions regarding it until after the British negotiations because of the outstanding importance of our trade with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>There is one further point I want to make in concluding this limited review of economic conditions which I am attempting to make in the time available to me.  The <i>Programme of Economic Expansion</i> published by the Government last year aimed at bringing about an increase in national income of two per cent. per year.  If that target is to be met in this year, the national income must rise to £490,000,000, that is, an increase of £9.6 million over the estimate for national income in 1958.  We cannot yet be certain whether we will achieve that target.</P>
    <P>If we assume that agricultural income will remain static and particularly if we assume, as Deputy Dillon did, that agricultural income may, because of the special circumstances of this year, show a slight decline, then the increase in other sectors of the economy must be about three per cent. if that target of an overall two per cent. increase in national income is to be realised.  I believe we will do it.  I believe that a two per cent. increase in national income&mdash;the target aimed at in the <Col N="1549" /> White Paper&mdash;will be realised.  Indeed, it is not at all impossible that the final figures may show that the country has done something better than that.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the few minutes left, I want to say a few words concerning Deputy Dillon's comments upon the activities of our Minister for External Affairs during the recent meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations.  Deputy Dillon made critical remarks upon these activities and said the policies we had been following there were making enemies for this country throughout the world.  I think the reverse is the truth.  I think that because of the actions of our Minister for External Affairs during the course of the General Assembly meeting, the prestige of Ireland stands now throughout the world as high as ever and perhaps higher.  Indeed, I am certain, and I have ample evidence to know, that regard for Ireland among the people and in Government circles in the United States of America is now higher than it was for a long time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made facetious references to the Dalai Llama and got the expected titter from his back benches. I agree that the Dalai Llama is to our <Col N="1550" /> people a strange alien figure, and I do not doubt that Deputy Dillon will be able to amuse the crowds at crossroads meetings by making similar facetious references to him.  Probably in that part of the world, when we were fighting for our freedom here, there were the equivalents of Deputy Dillon who made similar disparaging references to de Valera and Michael Collins.  Fundamental human rights are universal and indivisible and wherever attacks upon them are made I hope that the voice of this country will always be raised in protest and that our Minister for External Affairs will try to organise world action to prevent them.  That is what our Minister did and may I say that, because of the line he took and because of his persistence and determination in pushing through the resolution with which his name was associated, the contribution to the national prestige to which I referred was greatly enhanced.  Indeed, all over the world nothing but praise and commendation of that action was recorded in newspapers and parliaments.  It is regrettable that the only disparaging statement was made in Dáil Éireann.</P>
