      <P>Last night, I intervened for the purpose of getting a little more clarity as to the intention and effect of this Bill.  I said, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning, that the attitude of the Taoiseach was &ldquo;to admit very definitely that that was a policy intended to assist the transfer of the population from the western districts to the greater centres of...&rdquo;  Then the Minister interrupted to say that the Taoiseach said no such thing and that he would quote him verbatim.  I was in the House here, listening to the Taoiseach's general line on this matter.  It was suggested by Deputy <Col N="882" /> Corish &mdash; again reported only in today's paper &mdash; that &ldquo;he could not understand why special treatment should be afforded to people in any particular part of the country.&rdquo;  He said that they should &ldquo;encourage people to come from underdeveloped areas to areas where there could be development.&rdquo;  The report in today's paper goes on:</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: One of the effects of this Bill will be to do that.</P>
      <P>When a Bill is brought in, one of the effects of which will be to bring people from the undeveloped areas into greater centres of population, the Government cannot divest themselves of the intention of doing that.</P>
      <P>I raised the matter in relation to the general principle, so that we may not go blindly into such a situation.  Even if it is inevitable, at any rate, we ought to know what we are doing.  We are asked, in very hurried circumstances, to discuss a series of Bills here.  We have the Undeveloped Areas Bill and the Minister admits that should not be the title of that Bill at all.  While that title may be misleading in certain cases, I think it is a matter of advantage to this House that the Bill has been misnamed, because it draws attention to a very important part of the spectrum of our society, where industrial development is desirable and necessary. That development is necessary if the people in some of the western areas are not to go like the scraw off the rocks, without any possibility of any development in the area at all once the population is weakened to a greater extent. We have seen specimens in western areas where the arduous work of the people there in winning a living from the land has been made almost impossible by the reason of the absence of that stimulus to action which the having of neighbours around brings. There are arduous occupations in the West of Ireland, in the sea and on the land, where without the presence of an audience, the work will not go ahead and where without the presence of helping hands in difficulties, there is no courage in the people and no intention in the people to face their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked that we should hear the <Col N="883" /> Minister for the Gaeltacht in the discussion of a measure which, it is admitted by the Taoiseach, will draw people from the undeveloped areas, in circumstances in which he expresses disappointment at the amount of development it has been possible to bring about in the western areas.  With this background of legislation regarding the undeveloped areas, State grants and An Foras Tionscal, the Taoiseach definitely says that there is little field now for the development of industry in the country intended to supply native or local needs.  All this concentration on the provision of additional capital, on increased millions of expenditure under this Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Bill &mdash; which is not intended for the undeveloped areas at all &mdash; and on increased money being provided under the proposed Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, is intended, according to the Taoiseach, for the development of industry other than the smaller industries which provide for our own people here, that is to say, it is intended for the development of large export industries.</P>
    <P>That is all right.  While we are committing ourselves to the possible expenditure of very substantial sums in development, we ought not to be asked &mdash; as we are apparently being asked &mdash; to turn our minds entirely away from the conditions that exist in the Western areas and, particularly, from my point of view, in the areas for the protection and development of which the Gaeltacht Department was set up.  That area has at its heart from 40,000 to 50,000 people, where the main concentrated residue of people who traditionally speak the Irish language is situated.  Outside that, in the contiguous areas, the Gaeltacht Department is responsible for about another 70,000 or 80,000 people.  But the returns given for the development that has taken place under the Undeveloped Areas Act and the meagre details included in the annual reports of An Foras Tionscal give no impression at all that any development has taken place in the areas that are the responsibility of the Gaeltacht Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> There has been a certain conflict of emphasis on some aspects of this Bill. It has been indicated that Section 1 gives an unfair advantage to the undeveloped areas, that is, to the areas for which the Undeveloped Areas Act was originally framed.  There is no evidence &mdash; none at all &mdash; in anything that has taken place that that is so. On the contrary, there is very substantial evidence in the statements made by the Taoiseach, if not by the Minister, that the present developments in the proposals in the Bill and the increased money provided for industrial credit expansion hold no inducement at all and give no hope of any development taking place in a way that would help the areas for which the Minister for the Gaeltacht is responsible.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the situation as presented in the Dáil and the type of discussion for which an opportunity is offered to the Dáil lead to confusion enough without any deliberate misrepresentation of any aspect of the case.  But I suggest to the Minister that when the Taoiseach comes along and says, as he said here in response to a suggestion that people should be encouraged to come from the West, that one of the effects of the Bill will be to do that, that statement, with the background of his general comment on the unsatisfactory development that has taken place up to the present under the Undeveloped Areas Act, at any rate should indicate to us what will happen in the carrying out of the work intended in the various Bills before us.</P>
    <P>The problem envisaged when the Undeveloped Areas Bill was first introduced in 1952, and the problem particularly envisaged when the Gaeltacht Department was set up, should not be ignored; and it seems to me that it is being entirely ignored. Before the discussion on this measure concludes, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for the Gaeltacht should address themselves very definitely to it and let us have a little more information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the speeches from the Opposition Benches <Col N="885" /> started on a high national note but I regret to say in many instances they lost pitch as they proceeded.  There is always a danger that depressing speeches here may interfere with our general economic outlook.  It is too often evident that Deputies do not realise that various schemes and projects may proceed on parallel lines without clash or obstruction.</P>
      <P>Due to the handicaps of a scattered population and distant lines of communication, the undeveloped areas of the western seaboard were treated advantageously in the matter of development, but that does not mean that now the Government do not realise there are pockets of undeveloped areas in many other parts of the country which require attention.  Everybody travelling through the country will observe that a town or village with an industry has a prosperous outlook.  Its people are more content and that makes for the future progress of our nation.</P>
      <P>As well as leaving the door open for further development in the West, the idea should be to develop the country generally as well.  The West still have the advantage in the grants being provided over those proposed for other parts of the country.  There is no intention whatever on the part of the Government to abandon the West to the fate that some members of the Opposition referred to here.  There is room for development all round.  The intention of this Bill is to make more general, but to a lesser degree, the grants available for the establishment and promotion of industries.  That is very necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though agriculture is our primary industry, it cannot, as has been seen, give employment to all our people in the rural areas.  In the towns and villages, it is necessary to have the employment potential provided by industry. Any encouragement in that direction is not only desirable but vitally necessary now, when there is so much competition in trade in the world and so many suggestions for the linking up of nations in groups such as the Free Trade Area and other developments of that kind.  At least, it is necessary for us to do what we can for our <Col N="886" /> own people nationally and then, if possible, to establish industries with an export potential.</P>
    <P>To my mind, it is not always necessary that buildings and such like should be provided in order to establish a local industry employing, perhaps, 20, 25, or more people.  With regard to our bogs, for example, we sometimes have enterprising businessmen who recognise that fuel must be provided for the towns and who set out to develop portion of a bog to provide turf for winter fuel.  These people should get every encouragement, too.  They do not have to put up buildings except, perhaps, some shelters, but they may require some machinery to develop the little project they have in mind.  Those projects are small, sometimes, but they are important locally and they come from our native resources, from the soil itself.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I had a visit from people from the Baltic area, from Holland and other countries in that area.  They passed the remark that there was gold in the fields of Ireland if they were properly developed, and they pointed out that, due to the advantages of the more favourable and the milder weather which the Gulf Stream gives us, if transport were available, we would be a month or two ahead of them in regard to vegetation. They said there is wide scope here for the production of flowers and vegetables for sale in the cities of Northern Europe along the Baltic.</P>
    <P>We have always looked on the people of Holland as being very progressive, and having all the technique and skill to develop horticulture and agriculture and things of that kind, but they had no hesitation in pointing out that from what they saw themselves here, activities of that kind could be developed to the advantage of families residing in certain parts of the country, if transport were available. That is one of the reasons I have been so anxious for the construction of an airport at Cork: within three or four hours, vegetables and flowers from certain parts of this country could be marketed in the cities of Holland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> These are matters which are apart from what we understand as ordinary industrial projects where buildings and machinery are required.  There are many other things which come to mind, which if properly organised, might develop into worthwhile projects which would serve our interests and add considerably to our national economy.  It is evident that even if there are difficulties and obstacles in some directions, we always have the skill and technique and enterprise to try to work on some smaller lines and keep our people employed at home.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to people coming from the Gaeltacht to take up employment in other industries which may be established outside the western seaboard.  Surely it is far more desirable that they should be given employment in industries of various kinds in their own land, rather than that they should be obliged to emigrate.  We have all seen the advantages of seasonal employment when people from the West came to work for farmers of the South during the beet season.  They worked with advantage to themselves in their own country on this seasonal employment.</P>
    <P>The emphasis all the time is on grants.  Immediately someone mentions a grant for some project there is a debate, and criticism is made regarding the objects which the Government have in mind.  There is something more fundamental than that in it.  There is the question of employment; there is the question of the technique available; and there is the question of the machinery which may be necessary.  No matter how we may talk, in many ways, we are an undeveloped country in that respect, due, in great measure, to our history, and a Government who try to change that should be encouraged in every way, instead of having to listen to the olagóns we sometimes hear from members of this House, who should be trying to put forward some constructive ideas to encourage our people rather than depress them, saying that there is no hope anywhere.</P>
    <P>That was not the spirit of the <Col N="888" /> generations who clung to the soil, and fought and made sacrifices for the freedom of this land.  Their spirit was that we should develop our resources to the fullest, and where local enterprise cannot do that, surely it is the obvious duty of the Government in power to devise ways and means in order that that development may take place.  That is what the Government are doing here, with the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal acting, one as an advisory authority so to speak, and the other helping to bring these projects to fruition.</P>
    <P>We have seen many of those projects. I have travelled through the west of Ireland in recent years and I saw none of the despair of which people in this House have spoken just because they want to criticise the Government. In doing so, they do not care about the effect they are creating locally by an attitude of that kind. Surely what we ought to do is to stimulate public opinion rather than depress it in this way.  Everything is not healthy no doubt; much remains to be done.  All of us regret that so many people have had to emigrate in order to get employment, but many who did emigrate did so because inducements were held out by their relatives who had already gone abroad.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I am glad to say from my experience at any rate many people are returning to some parts of the country where new industries are being founded and where hope of extensive employment is arising.  Bills such as this, if properly debated in the House, and improved, if there is room for improvement, and then implemented, should create, in other parts of the country, the same measure of hope and confidence as is arising in the constituency which I, with others, have the honour to represent.  These are the things we should keep in mind, and I believe this Bill will go some way towards implementing the efforts of local people.</P>
    <P>Meetings are sometimes held by local development organisations in an effort to get funds to promote a local industry.  Very often these funds are limited.  We have heard speeches <Col N="889" /> here which would discourage &mdash; some of them would at any rate &mdash; people who have money from investing it in Irish enterprises.  That has actually happened in the past and the consequence is that provisions of this kind have to be brought in in order to get the progress so essential in the competitive world in which we live.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the step he has taken.  I hope his efforts will be crowned with success.  I hope that they will result in the establishment of many new industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks made by the Deputy who has just spoken are not in any way conducive to the constructive criticism that he asked for on this side of the House.  He seemed to think that the views expressed on this side of the House are wholly destructive.</P>
      <P>On the face of it, this Bill is something we should welcome, certainly as far as my constituency is concerned, if the clauses in the Bill mean that an attempt will be made to encourage industries in the smaller towns throughout the country.  The constituency I represent has four medium-sized towns, each of which has no industry of any kind.  Kilmallock, Rathkeale, Abbeyfeale and Newcastle West have no industries.  They are centres of trading so far as the farming community is concerned, but in all of them there are pockets of unemployment. If grants are made available under this Bill to encourage small industries, even industries employing as few as ten men, it may be possible to hold the people on the land.  I hope the Minister will clarify that for us when he comes to reply. Will the emphasis be on exports from the point of view of financial assistance or will the establishment of the industries be regarded as work of national importance, vital to the economy of the country as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must bend all our efforts and all our energies towards retaining on the land and in the smaller towns throughout the country the population that we now have in them.  From that point of view we must establish <Col N="890" /> industries catering for the needs of the people in the first instance, industries to supplement, or even to supplant, the products we now import. It is important that those industries should be based on native materials.</P>
    <P>The fear has been expressed that this represents a departure from the principles governing grants hitherto to the undeveloped areas.  If the emphasis is on goods for export, prospective industrialists will be tempted to concentrate their efforts near the larger centres of population, close to railheads and ports.  From that point of view, this Bill may possibly interfere with the advantage enjoyed up to this by undeveloped areas along the western seaboard.  So far as the Gaeltacht and congested areas are concerned, our policy should be to keep people in these areas.  I do not agree with Deputy MacCarthy that they should be encouraged to migrate from these areas to do seasonal work elsewhere. What should be encouraged is keeping them permanently in the areas in which they are born and bred. That is the policy I advocated earlier with regard to land division, and so forth.  These people should not be migrated.  If we want to keep their culture and traditions alive we must keep them in their own surroundings, or as close to them as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether projects which have been established but which are labouring under difficulties will qualify for assistance by way of grants under this measure.  I welcome the Bill as something which gives hope to the smaller towns, towns which have been gravely hit.  I hope that many of them will benefit directly under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonorMaryCrowley" hpid="Mrs. Crowley Mrs. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because of the effects of the Principal Act in the past.  The Undeveloped Areas Act has helped areas more than most people think.  In the last two years in my constituency one big factory has gone into production; it is employing about 150 at the moment and, when in full production, it will employ between 400 and 500 people. Another smaller factory is also in <Col N="891" /> production.  Yet another has been sanctioned.  That has made all the difference to the people in these areas. They are now able to stay in their own locality, among their own friends and in their own surroundings.</P>
      <P>If this Bill extends the benefits to cover other areas, I do not think the people in the undeveloped areas will suffer because I understand the bias will always be towards the undeveloped areas.  The reason we give grants is to encourage development.  We give grants for the reconstruction of houses. We give grants to farmers to build haysheds.  These grants are an encouragement.  If people did not get these grants they would not reconstruct their houses at all.  It is the fact of getting something that encourages people to go on to do something better. Therefore, I welcome this Bill but I still hope that every inducement will be given to manufacturers to come into the undeveloped areas so that the good work started by the Principal Act of 1952 will be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the advantage of hearing the entire of the Minister's speech and, as the Official Report is not yet available, the only way in which I can deal with the part of his speech that I did not hear is to take the report as it appeared in this morning's <i>Irish Press.</i>  My difficulty is that I am not at all clear yet what the Minister and the Government intend or hope to achieve by this Bill.  Frankly, first of all, I had thought that the Bill was founded on the dogma, if I may use that term, laid down in paragraph 13, Chapter 16, of the grey book on Industrial Development but I heard the Minister last night take violent issue with Deputy Mulcahy in relation to what had been said by the Taoiseach.  It seemed to me that the interjection by the Taoiseach, which I heard when Deputy Corish was speaking, was exactly as phrased by Deputy Mulcahy and I see in this morning's <i>Irish Press</i> a report which bears out exactly my interpretation.  The report is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. B. Corish (Lab.) said they <Col N="892" /> should encourage people to come from undeveloped areas to areas where there could be development.</P>
    <P>Taoiseach: One of the effects of this Bill will be to do that.</P>
    <P>As I understood Deputy Mulcahy last night, that was exactly what he said that the Taoiseach had described as an effect of this Bill but the Minister seemed to be very upset and extremely annoyed that such a declaration had been attributed to the Taoiseach.  If that is not one of the effects and, indeed, not one of the purposes of the Bill, in the mind of the Minister, I should be glad if he would give us some clarification, when he comes to reply, of exactly what it is intended to do under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I feel that the main reason for this Bill is to kill the Industrial Grants Act, that because the Industrial Grants Act was passed by us when we were in Government, the Minister and the present Government want to ensure that it does not operate in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a re-enactment of it in a better form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is. I think one of the reasons the Industrial Grants Act has not been availed of at all as widely as people would like is that the period from the time it was passed until the time the present Government took over was very short indeed, that they deliberately set out to throw cold water on the provisions of that Act and that there was a general feeling abroad, immediately after they acceded to office, that anybody who considered moving under the Industrial Grants Act was not likely to find favour with them. That is an entirely wrong approach. It is an approach that is not likely to make for the continued industrial development that all of us &mdash; and I include the Government in that&mdash; would like to see.  Nothing can be more disturbing in relation to general private enterprise than the feeling that there is not a continuity of approach and that in relation to the general policy, as apart from specific projects, of assisting industry, there will be a <Col N="893" /> change, that merely because an Act, such as the Industrial Grants Act, was passed by the previous Government, this Government would frown on it.</P>
      <P>Whenever one is considering problems like this &mdash; and it is no criticism of the grey book or of its author to say so &mdash; one must consider, not merely the strict economic approach, but also the human problem inherent in our problem.  Obviously, from a strict economic point of view, it might be entirely desirable to concentrate every industry, every project, in Dublin but it would be highly undesirable from a social and from a general political point of view &mdash; using that term in the extreme, widest sense &mdash; and particularly from a human point of view. One has to measure the benefit of the two things and to weigh them one against the other.  I do not think that mere streamlining for economic purposes is necessarily always the best approach to any problem like this.</P>
      <P>One must not consider this Bill on its own.  One must put it against the general picture.  It is, for example, a measure that must be considered side by side with the discontinuance by the Government of the Connemara scheme under the Land Project.  That is another part of a scheme for the undeveloped areas.  One must consider the whole pattern and it does seem to me that, when one considers that pattern, the interjection of the Taoiseach in reply to Deputy Corish does point to the mind of the Government.</P>
      <P>Anybody who goes through the country at the present time cannot fail to be struck by the fact that the worst problem with which we are trying to grapple is what will happen to the village and the smaller town in rural Ireland.  Anybody who goes from one part of the country to another cannot but be depressed by the outlook in relation to the small town and the larger village.  No matter what may be suggested about this Bill, I do not see where there is much hope in it in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind whether the State assistance is in the form of an initial grant or interest-free loan, I would prefer to pay more State assistance to base <Col N="894" /> an industry which will thereafter have a permanent chance in an area where it would improve human and social conditions than to base it in an area where it would not improve them so much.  As I see the position, it is the permanent chance of the industry that should be the consideration there rather than the amount of the grant or State assistance that has to be paid out in future.  There is no use, under any Bill like this, putting up State moneys merely for the purpose of starting an industry unless it will have a definite chance of survival in future, no matter where it is placed.  Otherwise you will have a position, as unfortunately we have had before, of considerable State moneys being poured out in an area to start something and the industry merely eats into the State moneys.  When the initial grants of State assistance finish, the industry itself fails to operate and either has to go back for more or else fade out.  It would be a much better proposition to pay even more at the beginning to establish something worth while, provided that, in so doing, it would not merely be a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.</P>
    <P>I know of cases where industries have been started, kept going for a few years on State assistance and, at the end of that period, the industries have had to fold up.  However, during the interval in which they were operating, existing industries catering for exactly the same product were put out of production even though they had some chance of surviving, in the wider sense. I shall have a word to say about that on another Bill that is ordered for today.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic about this.  The first way to be realistic about any part of our approach to our economic problem is to tell the people the truth and the whole truth &mdash; and that is the business of Government.  I cannot see where the Minister or the Taoiseach have been frank with the people in relation to this Bill.  Certainly the interjections I heard from the Taoiseach and from the Minister for Industry and Commerce differ absolutely. We cannot hope to get anywhere <Col N="895" /> in relation to economic development when we have the head of the Government saying one thing and his Minister for Industry and Commerce saying another thing.  We must make it clear that the people as a whole are taken into the confidence of the Government and that this House is fully taken into its confidence.</P>
    <P>There is another way in which that should be done.  I have said this before regarding the Industrial Credit Company and I say it again in relation to An Foras Tionscal.  I agree that the method of having an allocation of grants by a body such as An Foras Tionscal or a body removed only one step, as may be, from the Department of Industry and Commerce is desirable. I feel however that once grants have been made and the position has clearly been defined by the body concerned, be it An Foras Tionscal or the I.D.A., as it was before this, there would be a very distinct advantage to the community as a whole if, after the completion of negotiations, the position were frankly stated.  I feel that in relation to the Industrial Credit Company which we shall discuss later.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion, the present Taoiseach made the objection that I was asking him to take political responsibility for something for which he was not politically responsible. The Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts were a cumbersome method in some respects of assisting industry but they had the advantage that there was a frank disclosure once the conclusions had been reached.  We are likely to get a better appreciation and understanding of our problem and of the means we are taking to ease and solve it if we have that full and frank disclosure after negotiations have been completed.  I cannot see how it can be suggested that such disclosure is asking the Government to accept political responsibility for something for which they have not been politically responsible unless you take the view that the Government on the other side &mdash; whatever Government is there &mdash; will claim the entire credit for allocations that may be made by An Foras Tionscal, the I.D.A. or the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> If the Government want to take the line that they are responsible for pressurising one of these State bodies into making advances or grants, then they must take the blame but in their quieter moments &mdash; apart, perhaps, from the heat of an election platform &mdash; I do not think the Government want to make the case that they pressurise An Foras Tionscal or any other bodies in that connection into providing the State assistance.  I think the approach they, in their quieter moments, want to make is that these bodies do it on the merits of the case put up to them.  That being so, I do not see what disadvantage there is in openness and frankness. I do not see what disadvantage there is in saying: &ldquo;Here is what will be done; here is what is hoped for; here is what is intended&rdquo;, once the negotiations have been completed.</P>
    <P>Certainly it would remove a great deal of the irritation felt by existing industrialists in relation to the provision of State assistance towards something in which they are interested.  If the full facts were known a great deal of that irritation would be removed. Therefore, I should have liked the Minister, when introducing this Bill, to give us a far more detailed resume of what has been done in relation to grants and State assistance for industry other than protection.  I should have liked to be able to see all that so that the House could judge whether the given State assistance had been successful, whether it had been a failure or whether it had resulted in competition. I would describe it as unfair competition if the State-assisted industry went into competition with existing industries so that existing industries had to curb their activities.</P>
    <P>If we had such a disclosure, we would be in a position to judge the efficacy of the measures involved.  I do not follow the reasoning by the Government that it is desirable that the entire question of State assistance should be dealt with by An Foras Tionscal rather than by the I.D.A.  I do not see why it is necessary to segregate those two functions in the way suggested in the Government White Paper that they must be segregated and in the way in which that <Col N="897" /> segregation is effected under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I think there was an advantage in having separate consideration, though consideration effected in consultation between areas where there is the type of problem that exists in the undeveloped areas and the type of problem that exists in the rest of rural Ireland. I am disappointed that the Government did not in the past two and a half years give greater support to the proposals that were offered under the Industrial Grants Act.  I am sorry that, during those two and a half years, they applied douches of cold water to those grants, mainly by pronouncements from time to time by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Taoiseach, and by implications in the Government White Paper for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that that type of approach, merely because it is general State assistance as apart from specific projects, is not right.  All of us have an absolute right to differ on specific projects but the suggestion that because a type of general State assistance was provided by one Government it will not be continued by the succeeding Government seems to me to be basically wrong.</P>

      <P>It was to be expected that this Bill would be welcome since stress has been laid on export markets. I shall be rather brief.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to the fact that it is not sufficient merely to give grants for projects designed to create or develop our export markets. While we think of our immediate neighbour as our greatest customer, in the United States, there has been a very ready and willing market of which we, as an agricultural country, could take advantage.  The very large Irish population there are desirous of taking advantage of that situation.  It is necessary that consideration be given, whether collectively or otherwise, by the people concerned, whether the Minister, his Department or some section set up in relation to industrial development, to the advisability of acquiring or erecting the necessary warehouses either on the New York or the Jersey front as a base for our products. Grave disappointment has been <Col N="898" /> expressed when, the first issue of a product having arrived and been welcomed, there is no continuity of supply.  It has been suggested that those concerned in this matter are one step removed from the Minister's Department; it might be better if that step were taken away completely because the situation is anything but satisfactory.  I know that is slightly irrelevant but it is no use spending money and finding that after a year or two no purpose is served by that expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or any of us, for that matter.  That has been due largely to a certain amount of confusion introduced at an early stage and, I should think, introduced needlessly.  Those who spoke early on should have spoken with greater knowledge than they professed to have of the background and the history of this type of legislation.  I suggest that in a few instances there was deliberate misrepresentation of the terms of the Bill and of the events over the past eight or nine years leading up to to-day.  Personally, I have never heard such a see-saw debate in this House &mdash; Deputies criticising the Bill for completely different reasons.  In a sense, the whole tenor of the debate savoured of unreality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies ought to appreciate, and I am sure they would if they thought enough about it, that the giving of grants is not a <i>sine qua non</i> to the establishment or development of industry in this or in any other country.  If a sound project is to be established to produce a commodity of reasonable quality to be sold at a fair price and as long as that commodity is satisfying a yet unsatisfied home demand or has a reasonable prospect of export, it is very unlikely that such a project will fail for want of capital. In the first instance, it is likely &mdash; certainly it is possible &mdash; that it will attract private investment.  If it fails to attract private investment to a sufficient <Col N="899" /> degree, there is always the opportunity of having recourse to the banks or to insurance companies who advance moneys for purposes such as this, and in the long run there is the State agency, the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <P>There are perhaps means other than the seeking of a grant for the establishment, expansion or other development of industrial projects, but let me take a practical example as to the effectiveness of a grant as against getting the capital in some other form, that is, in an industry in which the subscribed share capital and possibly the working capital would amount to, say, £120,000.  If for want of £20,000 of that money, the promoters found it impossible to go ahead, surely in that case the difference between 5 per cent. on £20,000 or £20,000 free would not be the difference between the starting or the non-starting of the industry or the success or failure of the industry, having started.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies will agree that this is so, but there are occasions when free grants are sought to assist in the establishment of industry or in the development of those already established.  Let us look for a moment at the reason for giving grants for such purposes.  We have the well-established principle underlying the Undeveloped Areas Act. It is not only well-established but generally accepted in this House and in the Parliaments of other countries. It is nothing new for a country to assist industrial development in what have been described as under- or less-developed areas.  Even in such an economically and industrially advanced country as Germany, they have such a system.  They have it also in Britain and in Italy, to my knowledge; there are perhaps others.  That principle was established and accepted generally in this country when the Undeveloped Areas Act of 1952 was passed through the House.</P>
    <P>Then there is the other form of assistance which is available under the Industrial Grants Act.  The Industrial Grants Act was intended to cover the parts of the country for which the Undeveloped Areas Act did not cater. <Col N="900" /> Before I leave that, I should like to refer to the comment that has been made on the term &ldquo;underdeveloped areas&rdquo; as applied to parts of this country or, as people suggested, as should be applied to the entire country. It is true that Ireland is described in the concept of the O.E.E.C. negotiations as an underdeveloped country, but during these negotiations, it was recognised that if the Free Trade Area proposals were to materialise, there were certain countries, of which we were one, that would need assistance and certainly a little more time in order to condition themselves to the requirements and, I might even say, the rigours, of the Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>It was sought to get a definition covering these countries and at one stage I believe it was suggested that the term &ldquo;countries in the course of development&rdquo; be applied to them, but other countries which were more economically advanced said that that term could be applied to almost any country, even Germany, Great Britain and France.  For that reason, &ldquo;underdeveloped&rdquo; was the adjective ultimately applied and I do not think we need feel any shame that we are included in that category in the O.E.E.C. negotiations.  It implies not destitution or depression but a country whose economic position requires some assistance or some marking of time, over and above that given to the more economically advanced countries.</P>
    <P>However, to pass from that, I should like at this stage to take a look briefly at the history of that form of legislation in this country. The Undeveloped Areas Act was introduced in 1952.  It was introduced shortly after the change of Government, it is true.  It was suggested that it was introduced primarily as a political stunt in order to assist Fianna Fáil to retrieve a situation they had lost in the western part of the country.</P>
    <P>I think the situation was reached shortly after the war when it became apparent that the measures taken up to then with regard to the rehabilitation of the western areas generally and the Gaeltacht areas in particular had <Col N="901" /> not been meeting with the success which everybody desired.  Therefore, it was realised that something more than had been done up to then ought to be done thenceforth.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to set up the Parliamentary Secretaryship &mdash; I happened to be appointed Parliamentary Secretary &mdash; with special responsibilities to the needs of these areas.  But as part of the general scheme, the Government decided to introduce the Undeveloped Areas Act whereby grants for the establishment of industries were given in this country for the first time but were given only for the establishment of industries in what were described as the scheduled areas which closely conformed to the old congested districts and were scheduled in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The line had to be drawn somewhere. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the definition conforming with the old congested districts, there was provision in the Act that in the event of a sound industrial project materialising in an area contiguous to the undeveloped areas, the Minister might, by Order, schedule that new area as an undeveloped area.</P>
    <P>There have been over a number of years applications from development committees in some of these contiguous areas to be scheduled for the purpose of the undeveloped areas, but it was frequently stated by the Taoiseach, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, and, I believe, by Deputy Norton, when Minister, that it would not be desirable to schedule in advance of a sound project any particular area, but that if an area or town contiguous to the scheduled undeveloped areas was successful in procuring an industrial project favourable consideration would be given to the scheduling of that area or town as an undeveloped area.  I believe it was a good practice to follow and that many areas and towns benefited as a result.</P>

      <P>I am afraid not.  The Undeveloped Areas Act continued in operation until 1957 when it was necessary to increase the limit of the <Col N="902" /> moneys available for grant purposes. At this stage, it may be convenient to answer a number of questions asked by Deputy Cosgrave &mdash; Deputy Sweetman also referred to this &mdash; in regard to the amount of money expended and the number of industries established.  I am afraid that I cannot give all the information that was asked for but I shall give all that is before me.  The total grants approved under both the Undeveloped Areas Acts and the Industrial Grants Act amount to £2,695,840.  The break up as between the two Acts is: Undeveloped Areas Acts, £2,293,490; Industrial Grants Act, £402,350. These are approved.  The amounts paid are: Undeveloped Areas Acts, £1,189,047; Industrial Grants Act, £152,915 &mdash; a total of £1,341,962.</P>

I think I said that 4,500 might have been the number employed as a result of the grants under Foras Tionscal.  That is a bit on the high side.  The numbers employed in projects approved by Foras Tionscal, 3,955; projects approved under the Industrial Grants Act, 1,700 &mdash; total 5,655.  These are all the figures I have.

      <P>It has been suggested during the course of the debate <Col N="904" /> that the Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Bill which is before the House is a departure from the principle underlying the Undeveloped Areas Act.  It has been referred to in most extravagant terms, first, by Deputy Dillon, who described it as a cynical and shameless betrayal of the people in the west of Ireland and then by Deputy Lindsay who followed by describing it as a shameless desertion of a position taken up for a shameless reason.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind Deputies opposite that if the Bill before the House can be so described, they are the guilty ones because it was they who first passed the Industrial Grants Act which weakened the influence and the effects of the Undeveloped Areas Act by extending the grant-giving facilities to the entire country.  So if there is anything shameless, or anything cynical, in the introduction of this Bill, the shame and the cynicism must at least be shared by Deputies opposite because it was they, and not the Fianna Fáil Government, who first introduced this principle of giving grants for the establishment of industries outside the undeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>It is no harm that Deputies should remember that, and it is one of the reasons why I said in my opening remarks that there was a certain amount of misunderstanding and a certain amount of misinterpretation introduced into the debate and in a few instances, I said, deliberately.  The attempt was to run from a situation that they had created themselves.  It is no harm to remind them and the country what the true position is. There is no new principle in the Bill before the House.  It is a principle established by the last inter-Party Government as late as December, 1956, when they brought this measure before the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the effect of this Bill on the Undeveloped Areas Act, the Taoiseach in his intervention did say, and I promised I would give the quotation:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is correct that the introduction of the grants for industrial enterprise in areas outside the undeveloped <Col N="905" /> areas had the effect of weakening the policy of industrial development in the western counties,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and that was the principle of an Act introduced and enacted when the inter-Party Government were in power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that good or bad?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come now to the point which Deputy Sweetman wants me to come to.  The Taoiseach also said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Anybody will realise who gives it a moment's thought that that must be so and clearly therefore any enlargement of the grants or extensions of the conditions under which grants can be given in the rest of the country must also have that effect.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So much for what the Taoiseach said during the course of his speech.  When Deputy Corish was speaking, it is true that he did make a suggestion to the effect that it would be better to attract people from the west and give them employment in the eastern part of the country.  As a result of an interjection by Deputy Dillon who asked for an interpretation of a nod which he had seen the Taoiseach make, the Taoiseach said &ldquo;Yes, it would have that effect.&rdquo;  During the course of the debate, it was suggested that the Taoiseach had stated that the intention of the Bill was purposely to draw people from the Gaeltacht areas.  That was a very wide and loose interpretation of what in fact he did say.</P>

      <P>During the course of yesterday's debate, I had not got the newspaper account of the previous day's debate and at the time of Deputy Dillon's interjection, there were some other interjections and I did not hear exactly what the Taoiseach said.  That was why I said last night to Deputy Mulcahy that the Taoiseach said no such thing.  I admit that he said something similar but he did not say that <Col N="906" /> the intention was to draw people away from the Gaeltacht areas.  If the Deputy consults the Official Report, he will see the statement.  That is the allegation I denied vehemently last night and I admit freely I did not get the import of the Taoiseach's remark when he made it as a result of some other remark made at the time.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, we all know there is a special problem in the Gaeltacht areas.  When the Undeveloped Areas Act was introduced originally, it was not represented as the panacea for all the ills of the Gaeltacht areas and it was so stated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, now Taoiseach.  Deputy O'Sullivan last night suggested that that was the claim made for it but it was never made in that fashion and certainly never intended that it could cure all the ills from which the Gaeltacht suffered economically.</P>
      <P>I might refer to the Taoiseach's speech, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he introduced the Bill in December 1951. The Taoiseach speaking on 12th December 1951, at column 892 of the Official Report said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>I think that private enterprise in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht would only have an anglicising effect.</P>

      <P>If there is to be development of industry or other activities there, it must of necessity be done by State organisations, organisations which will have instructions to subordinate commercial success to the preservation of the language and the Gaelic character of the area.</P>
      <P>I think he stated, and spelled out in very clear terms, that he did not anticipate that the Undeveloped Areas Bill was going to have the effect of keeping the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to repeat that I share the same concern as some of the Deputies who are interested in the survival of the language and who realise the importance of preserving the Gaeltacht for that purpose.  Even when I spoke on the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, I did say it was possible that the Undeveloped Areas Bill might attract industries to the Gaeltacht areas, but I realised that it was necessary that a little more should be done in order to achieve that purpose.</P>
      <P>I share what the Taoiseach said in 1952, that some State organisation, some State enterprise, specially set up with a particular purpose in view, is possibly the only and certainly the best type of organisation that we can look to for the purpose of establishing industries in the Gaeltacht areas.  The special Department for the Gaeltacht will naturally have regard to that aspect of the Gaeltacht economic life and I would suggest that the recent establishment of Gaeltarra Éireann as an independent body is a step in this direction.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill before the House and its relationship to the Industrial Grants Act, I want to repeat that the Industrial Grants Act is not being wiped out, but, having regard to the proposals laid down in the White Paper on Economic Expansion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being repealed, but, as I said in an interjection to Deputy Sweetman, it is being reenacted in a better form.  That really is the cause of the unfortunate title of this Bill.  In so far as it is an amending Bill, it amends the Undeveloped Areas Act by increasing its terms, by <Col N="908" /> increasing the amount of money available for grant-giving purposes, and making provision for capital for electricity supply in remote areas.  It contains the same differential in favour of the undeveloped areas &mdash; I should not say the same, but a substantial differential, in favour of the undeveloped areas as against the rest of the country. In the White Paper it was stated that the improved facilities which were being provided for the Industrial Credit Company would have the effect of placing that company in a better position to offer assistance in general to meet adequately the requirements of industrial promoters, and that it was the intention that grants under the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, would in future be made only in exceptional circumstances, and for projects of exceptional importance.</P>
      <P>That was stated in the White Paper and was generally accepted, and I would say to Deputy Russell that it was in this context that I stated, in my original statement, that the introduction of this Bill was in accordance with the contents of the White Paper and also in so far as it divided the functions of the Industrial Development Authority by leaving with it its promotional functions, and transferring to An Foras Tionscal the grant-giving functions they had held up to that.</P>
      <P>But, to revert to the giving of grants only in cases of exceptional national importance and in exceptional circumstances, that has been stated clearly in Section 2(1)(b) which states that where the Board</P>
      <P>&ldquo;are satisfied that financial assistance by way of grant is necessary to ensure the establishment or development of the undertaking and that the undertaking will be of a reasonably permanent nature and will be carried on efficiently,</P>
      <P>the Board may &mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) for the purpose of providing or facilitating the provision of sites or premises&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should have quoted, in fact, from Section 2(1)(a), which says that whenever the Board:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;are of opinion ... that the <Col N="909" /> undertaking is, having regard to its size, character or the probable extent to which its products are likely to be exported, of exceptionl national importance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is consistent with the terms of the White Paper.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  Suppose five Irishmen had £200,000 and proposed to establish a factory for the manufacture of something that was at present being imported, and say they wanted to establish the factory in some town in Kildare, what would they get?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Any industry that is established to produce something that we had imported, up to this, must surely be put in the category of being of exceptional national importance and could, therefore, qualify for a grant under Section 2 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would they not have to prove it could not be established in the undeveloped areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Norton gave an example, just on that point, when he was speaking the other night. He asked if a certain town within 50 miles of Dublin was able, by its own initiative or that of a development association in the town, to procure a certain amount of capital and made contact with a foreigner who <Col N="910" /> also had a certain amount of capital and technical know-how, and they intended to produce a commodity not already produced in this country but which had to be imported, and the project had an export potential what would happen.  I think that would be a case where it could be established that the industry might not go to the undeveloped areas.  First of all, these people would have the capital and, obviously, would have made provision for a local site.  They would have contact with foreign know-how and foreign capital as well.  I think these would be circumstances under which a grant might be given under this Act.</P>
      <P>However, I think it is undesirable that I should be giving off-the-cuff interpretation of legislation here because a Board is established for the purpose of implementing this legislation, and any interpretation in this fashion from me might tend to be a directive to, or, on the other hand, tie the hands of the Board.  I think it is undesirable that I should do that, but, as projects emerge and they are put before the Board, they will be treated on their merits within the framework of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that quite right?  In other words, you are leaving the interpretation of this Bill completely to the Board even though Deputies have evinced doubts as to possible interpretations. Take the case of my own city, Limerick, within eight or 10 miles of an undeveloped area.  It would be very hard to prove that an industrialist could not go those eight or 10 miles to establish a factory in the undeveloped area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It may or may not be hard to prove.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the more concentrated the legislation is, the better, and the less ambiguity in it, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for this legislation has been questioned, particularly from the opposite side of the House, but I think it will be appreciated that the scope for new industries in this country is getting <Col N="911" /> more and more limited, that is, industries designed to satisfy only home needs.  There certainly is plenty of scope for the establishment of industries with an export potential and I think, as the Taoiseach said, it is only reasonable to assume that industries designed to export products would require to be located at, or near, a port capable of exporting their products. Where that port might be is a matter for the promoters of the industries concerned and, in so far as they might qualify for a grant, the qualification would be a matter for the Board.</P>
      <P>I think we must be practical and if we are to pursue this principle of the giving of grants outside the undeveloped areas, introduced by the previous Government, in the future these should be limited to, as this Bill says, a project of exceptional national importance that has an export potential.  If a project has an export potential, we must be equally realistic with regard to its location, and its location must provide it with a good chance of making its products competitive in foreign markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The examination by An Foras Tionscal of proposals in regard to production for home consumption in the case of industries to be established in undeveloped areas will naturally be more liberal and not as close as in the case of industries to be established outside those areas.  Another reason for the introduction of this measure was that the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, showed certain weaknesses.  That Act provided for the giving of grants only in the case of industries that had certain potentialities, but it did not provide for the giving of grants to industries already established.  If there was a company in a certain line of business who felt that by their knowledge, experience and equipment and by their potential to get into a new line of business in the premises they already occupied or with an extension of the existing premises and that new line of business had export possibilities, they would not, under the original Industrial Grants Act, be entitled to a grant.  It was for this purpose that the Bill was amended, &ldquo;for the purpose of <Col N="912" /> providing or facilitating ... the establishment or development&rdquo; etc.  That will give the opportunity in future for such industries to receive assistance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave made a point about the multiplicity of organisations dealing with the giving of grants or loans or examination of industrial projects.  I think this is, to a great extent, a co-ordinating Bill producing a desirable co-ordination.  Some Deputies have objected to the taking away of the grant-giving functions of the Industrial Development Authority but the Taoiseach said &mdash; and I should like to repeat &mdash; that that is done at the instance of the I.D.A. itself.  They found that, having regard to their peculiar function of promoting industry, a function which often necessitated seeking out possible industrialists &mdash; I would say industrialists for whom we had a hope of establishing an industry here &mdash; it was rather invidious for them to examine the financial aspect of it with a view to deciding whether or not the industrialists should be given a grant.  The I.D.A. felt they would be able to pursue their promotional activities much more effectively if they were relieved of the grant-giving functions.  It was for that reason, not only because they asked but because the Government was satisfied that the reasons behind their request were sound, that the grant-giving functions in the case of the Industrial Grants Act have been transferred to An Foras Tionscal who already administer the giving of grants under the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also asked that there should be a greater disclosure of information by the Industrial Credit Company.  I think it would be a departure from the practice of most finance houses that a disclosure of the arrangements between private individuals in the matter of giving loan assistance should be made to anybody outside.  The Deputy and other Deputies will have an opportunity of raising this matter when the Bill dealing with the Industrial Credit Company comes before the House later in the day, I hope, or certainly next week.</P>
    <P>I now come to one piece of criticism <Col N="913" /> by Deputy Lindsay.  He criticised not only the terms of the Bill but the purpose of the Bill and the principle underlying it and in his usual Pharisaical manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay read out the terms of the Bill.  He quoted portion of Section 2:&mdash;&ldquo;Whenever the Board are of opinion that there are sound reasons why an industrial undertaking cannot be established or developed in the undeveloped areas and that the undertaking is, having regard to its size, character of the probable extent to which its products are likely to be exported.&rdquo;  He dwelt on some of these provisions and asked how any Government could introduce in a Bill something so incapable of assessment as &ldquo;carried on efficiently&rdquo;. He asked how could any Government impose on an organisation the task of deciding that any industry that was being examined could be &ldquo;of a reasonably permanent nature.&rdquo;  He described these provisions and others as fraudulent.</P>
      <P>Again, as in the case of the suggestion from the Opposition that this Bill is a completely new departure from the terms of the Undeveloped Areas Bill, I remind the Opposition that it was they themselves who made this departure in the first instance.  I should like to remind Deputy Lindsay that in December, 1956 when the Industrial Grants Bill was before the House he was a Minister and, therefore, I presume had some responsibility for the terminology of the Industrial Grants Act.  I am sorry he is not here because I should like to read for his benefit certain passages out of Section 2, subsection (1) of that Act.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;... the Authority, if satisfied that financial assistance is necessary to <Col N="914" /> ensure the establishment of an industrial undertaking to manufacture the commodity to a substantial extent&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>again consistent with the terms of the new Bill,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and that the undertaking will be of a reasonably permanent nature&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>a phrase to which Deputy Lindsay took great exception as being fraudulent,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and will be carried on efficiently,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>another phrase to which he took vociferous exception.  He described these provisions as fraudulent and intended to delude the unfortunate people coming before the I.D.A. for grants and he suggested in effect that the Government that introduced such terms in a Bill were not entitled to be in Government at all because they were frauds and incompetent and because they were imposing impossible burdens on an organisation.</P>
    <P>It would be no harm if Deputy Lindsay went back on his notes or jogged his recollection to see what protest he made to the then Government when they introduced these &ldquo;shameless&rdquo; and &ldquo;fraudulent&rdquo; provisions in the 1956 Industrial Grants Act.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal with every point made by all the Deputies.  The debate lasted much longer than I anticipated but there are a few matters to which I think I ought to refer. Deputy M.P. Murphy and Deputy Wycherley referred to the special conditions applying to West Cork and each of them said that I was not very far removed from West Cork.  That is so; there are certain paternal associations for me in West Cork but when I used to go there as a young fellow on holidays I got the impression that the people of West Cork were a resilient type of people.  I got the impression that they would thrive in adversity, that opposition would bring out the best in them.  I should like to believe that that is the position still.</P>
    <P>I want to say, particularly in reply to the charges made by Deputy Michael Pat Murphy, that there is no bias in An Foras Tionscal or amongst <Col N="915" /> its members, against West Cork.  On the contrary, there is the utmost goodwill. As a result of inquiries I have made, I find there is not only ordinary goodwill but active goodwill towards West Cork.  There was one industry of which I had special knowledge myself when, as a Parliamentary Secretary, it was being negotiated with An Foras Tionscal.  The project appeared to be a good one, the prospective employment appeared to be reasonably good and substantial, the goodwill of An Foras Tionscal was there in abundance and a grant was available.  It had all the ingredients for the establishment of an industry in the town of Bantry. Something went wrong.  It was not that something went wrong with the Government or their attitude to it, or with An Foras Tionscal, or with the amount of the grant they were to get, or with the foreign interests.  It is not fair for Deputies or people from West Cork to suggest that if anything goes wrong with industrial proposals somebody other than the local promoters is at fault.  I am sure that what I say will jog the memories of some people who were interested in these early industrial proposals.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that, far from having a bias or a prejudice against West Cork, An Foras Tionscal is extremely desirous and anxious that some project will come before them, of a reasonably substantial nature, which will justify the giving of a grant and which will qualify for such a grant.  The people of West Cork can be sure that, in such a case, there will be no delay and there will certainly be no absence of goodwill in coming forward with the necessary assistance.</P>
    <P>The Undeveloped Areas Act is still in existence.  The grants under it are more favourable than those which it is proposed to give under this Bill for the rest of the country.  The grants under the Undeveloped Areas Act amount to the full cost of the buildings and half the cost of the machinery, together with other ancillary requirements. Grants will be given for these, too.  Outside the undeveloped areas, grants will be given, up to a maximum of £250,000, of half the cost of the <Col N="916" /> buildings and machinery.  The £250,000 maximum covers both.  The grants in the undeveloped areas will have no limit.</P>
    <P>It is not right, and certainly it is not fair, for Deputies to say &mdash; and some of them have, although others had the contrary view &mdash; that the differential in favour of undeveloped areas is being wiped out.  It may be that, by reason of the passage of time, the effect of the Undeveloped Areas Act is being somewhat reduced.  Nevertheless, the same provisions are there under this Bill as were there before.  In fact, they are better provisions, in so far as the over-all amount of the grant is increased and certain assistance is being given for the introduction of electric power.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an attempt, within the terms of the White Paper on Economic Expansion, to improve the Industrial Grants Act.  It repeals that Act in its entirety, but re-enacts it, I insist, in a better form, having regard to the needs of the day.  If, as time passes, it proves not to meet the requirements which we expect it will be asked to meet, or if some new conditions emerge which we feel will have to be provided for, I certainly shall have no hesitation in asking the Government to amend this legislation to meet these new requirements or to keep up with new conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the payment of additional funds to Bord Fáilte Éireann to enable the Board to operate a programme of financial assistance for the development of major tourist resorts and the provision of additional bedroom accommodation in tourist hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the general plan to expand the tourist industry, considerable importance must obviously be attached to the proper development of our tourist resorts.  Many Irish tourist resorts are lacking in the facilities and amenities which holiday makers expect to find when they go on holidays.  We are all aware and proud of the fact that nature has endowed our country with a wealth of natural beauty and other attractions for visitors, but we must realise that if the tourist industry is <Col N="918" /> to be properly developed, these natural assets must be supplemented by the provision of practical facilities such as promenades, parks and outdoor recreational facilities of various kinds. I think we can take justifiable pride, too, in the fact that we have roads capable of attracting a certain type of tourist trade &mdash; that is, motorist traffic &mdash; which are better than the roads found in many other European countries. Furthermore, having regard to the uncertainty of the Irish climate, it is essential that adequate indoor recreational facilities should also be available.</P>
    <P>Under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, the Minister for Industry and Commerce may, on the recommendation  Bord Fáilte Éireann and with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance guarantee loans required for the purpose of providing amenities and services at tourist resorts.  In addition, he may authorise the Board to make grants to meet the interest charges arising on such loans for a number of years.  A scheme for the giving of these guarantees and grants has been in operation since October, 1953, but although resort development proposals have been formulated by local interests in some cases, little real progress has been made in carrying out major improvements. The failure of the guaranteed loan scheme to promote resort development may be attributed to the fact that it can of necessity be used only in the case of works which will earn the revenue needed to repay loan and interest.</P>
    <P>Examples of revenue earning works are ballrooms, entertainment halls, amusement parks, boating lakes, pitch and putt courses and tennis courts. There are, however, many improvement works which are essential for the proper and orderly development of tourist resorts, but which are not directly revenue earning, and consequently cannot, in the ordinary way, be financed by means of loans.  Works of this kind include basic site development, provision of promenades, parks, river-side walks and pathways.  The past experience of Bord Fáilte Éireann in relation to resort development works supports the view that substantial <Col N="919" /> capital investment of a non-remunerative type is essential in order that profit earning activities may later be established. It is the opinion of the Board that in many centres local interests are unlikely to be in a position to proceed with revenue earning projects unless basic amenities of a non-revenue earning character are first provided; and it is clear that non-revenue earning works of this kind will have to be financed other than by way of loan if the general development of our tourist resorts is to be achieved within a reasonable time</P>
    <P>It was precisely for this reason that, as announced in the White Paper on Economic Expansion, the Government have decided to set aside a sum of £1 million to assist, by way of grants, the financing of a 10-year programme for the development of major resorts. The new grants, which will supplement expenditure from local resources and the guaranteed loan facilities already available through Bord Fáilte Éireann, will be confined to non-revenue earning works of the kind I have mentioned. The grants will be subject to two conditions, namely, that the works to be carried out at a resort shall form part of a fully co-ordinated plan of development for that resort, and that a substantial local contribution will be forthcoming either from a local development group or from the local authority concerned.  The scheme will be administered by Bord Fáilte Éireann and its operation will be limited to 10 years so as to ensure that development of resorts will take place as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is visualised that the works to be undertaken with the help of these grants will constitute part of an overall development plan to be prepared by the local authority and the local development company or other local interests concerned, in consultation with Bord Fáilte Éireann.  In the normal way the responsibility for the execution of the grant works will rest upon the local authority, to whom the grant moneys will be issued; and the revenue-earning portion of the project will be undertaken by the local development company with whatever funds are raised locally, as well as by means of <Col N="920" /> loans guaranteed by the Minister under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>It must be realised that the task of developing our resorts is primarily one for local enterprise, even though some assistance from the State is obviously necessary if the job is to be done quickly and properly.  I must emphasise, however, that while the State and Bord Fáilte Éireann will continue to assist financially and otherwise in the carrying out of the necessary development works, the main initiative and effort must come from local interests. Local authorities in particular must play their part and adopt a more positive attitude towards the development of the tourist traffic.</P>
    <P>Deputies who are interested in tourist development can render the industry no greater service than to use their influence to persuade members and officials of local authorities of the importance of the industry and of the necessity for active local co-operation in order that the potentialities of the tourist traffic may be exploited to the full.  Under this Bill, local authorities and other local interests in major resorts will, in the course of the next 10 years, have a golden opportunity of developing and improving local amenities with generous assistance from the State.  By availing themselves of the opportunity they can lay the foundation for the establishment of a thriving tourist trade that can bring much needed employment and prosperity to their locality.  This Bill provides that over the next ten years Bord Fáilte Éireann will be able to draw a sum of up to £1 million from the Exchequer to be paid in the form of grants to local authorities and other agencies who are willing to prepare and execute suitable schemes for the improvement of local amenities.</P>
    <P>About eighteen months ago the then Minister introduced in this House another Tourist Traffic Bill, the purpose of which, <i>inter alia</i>, was to renew the power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to guarantee loans required for the construction, extension and improvement of hotels and other forms of holiday accommodation. The Minister said on that occasion that hotel accommodation <Col N="921" /> continued to be a major bottleneck in the tourist industry and that further substantial private investment would be necessary in order that the tourist industry might be enabled to meet the demand for more and better accommodation. Over the past two years there has been a small increase in the total number of registered bedrooms in hotels and guest houses, but the rate of progress is painfully slow and far from adequate to cope with the growth in international travel which experts say we may expect in the next few years.</P>
    <P>It would appear that one of the biggest deterrents to the expansion of accommodation is the heavy capital cost involved in relation to the comparatively short duration of the tourist season and the consequent low rate of occupancy in hotels and guest houses in tourist centres.  Accordingly, in order to provide further encouragement and assistance for the expansion of hotel accommodation, the Government last year decided to authorise Bord Fáilte Éireann to introduce a scheme of grants to cover portion of the cost of additional bedrooms and bedroom/ bathroom units in tourist hotels and motels.  The scheme was introduced in May of last year.  The grants cover 20% of the cost involved, subject to maximum limits which range from £275 for a double bedroom with bath to £175 for a single bedroom without bath.  Where central heating is installed in the new accommodation a further grant of one-third of the cost, subject to an upper limit of £25 per bedroom, is payable.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants can be altered to suit changing conditions and I understand that the Board are proposing certain changes in the scheme as it has operated up to the present.  I hope to be able to consider these proposals very soon, but my consideration of them will be influenced by the fact that the Government have already provided a very generous measure of assistance in a number of ways to the hotel industry.  In order to finance the scheme to which I already referred over the next 10 years this Bill provides for the payment to Bord Fáilte Éireann of a total sum of half a million pounds in that period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> The House will, I think, agree that the State is being generous in the financial assistance which it is providing for the expansion and improvement of hotel premises.  Hoteliers already have the advantages of a State guaranteed loan scheme which assures them that the capital required for the carrying out of improvement works will be readily available.  They also have the benefit of the grants made by Bord Fáilte Éireann to cover the interest charges arising on State guaranteed and other loans for the first 5 years during which the loans are in operation. If they carry out improvements to their premises they qualify for remission for seven years of two-thirds of the local rates attributable to the improvements and there is also the concession that 10% of the capital expenditure incurred is allowable as a deduction in computing profits for income tax and corporation profits tax. Furthermore, as announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech, it is the intention to provide in the Finance Bill for the granting of a 2% annual wear and tear allowance for capital expenditure on hotel buildings with effect from 6th April, 1960. Last, but not least, hoteliers benefit directly from the expenditure of almost half a million pounds which is incurred each year by Bord Fáilte Éireann on the general development of tourism and the publicising of Irish tourist attractions.</P>
    <P>The special funds which are being made available to Bord Fáilte Éireann under this Bill for the development of tourist resorts and the expansion of hotel accommodation are, of course, in addition to the existing annual maximum grant of £500,000 which is available to the Board under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1955, for the general development and publicising of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The foreign experts who surveyed our tourist industry some years ago stated that among the best assets which we have for expanding the tourist industry is the capacity of our people to treat visitors with cordiality and good humour, to make them feel at home and to send them away talking of Irish hospitality and kindness.  If to these <Col N="923" /> qualities we can add the advantages of well-equipped and well-managed hotels and properly developed holiday amenities, there can be no doubt that the tourist trade will grow and prosper.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this Bill will make a most important contribution to the development of our tourist traffic industry, and I recommend it confidently for the consideration of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It always seems to me that for some reason or another the development of the tourist trade here has not been exploited to the full and that, although statutory recognition of the importance of the tourist industry goes back as far as 1931 &mdash; when the Act of that year gave power to local authorities to raise money for the Tourist Association &mdash; and although since then there have been a great number of decisions dealing with development, the value of this industry to the country is not fully appreciated by many who themselves would benefit from its further development. The fact that that development has not been as satisfactory as one would have wished may be due to a number of factors.  I do not think it is necessary, or desirable, to go back over the problems which arose out of the Tourist Board as it was constituted some years ago, and the establishment of a second board, Fogra Fáilte, although the attitude of hoteliers and others to the old Tourist Board was undoubtedly, to a considerable extent, one of suspicion.  It seems to me that in recent years that attitude has changed and the Board, for a number of years, has been gaining the confidence of hoteliers, owners of guest-houses and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure which proposes to provide additional funds is designed to improve the facilities and amenities available in different localities, and it is complementary to certain facilities already available under the earlier Acts.  It seems to me, however, that there are certain aspects of the matter which have not been fully understood by either the Department or Bord Fáilte.  Reference is made in <i>Economic Development</i> to the fact that the grants and loans which were provided <Col N="924" /> under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, for the purpose of providing amenities and services, were not availed of to any great extent.</P>
    <P>I notice that in the Minister's introductory speech he referred to the importance of local committees initiating proposals and schemes for development. We have got to consider, first of all, what is involved in that suggestion. Local committees must exist, and assuming that there is a local voluntary association such as a residents' association, or some other resort development committee, they themselves have no funds available.  I think many Deputies have had this experience. I can point to a specific case in my own constituency where the local residents' association were anxious to get certain work carried out in order that a beach might be made acceptable for visitors.  The county council was approached in the matter; Bord Fáilte was approached.  Bord Fáilte was prepared to put up a grant and the council was sympathetic, but the problem then arose that, because of the actual nature of the proposed development and where it was contemplated, the risk of injury, or of accidents occurring with a possible risk of injury to users, might involve the county council in liabilities in the event of a claim for damages.</P>
    <P>Despite repeated representations by Deputies in the constituency and by the residents' association, the county council had ultimately to refuse to proceed with the development.  They were advised by their legal adviser that if a person were injured, or any damage sustained, they would be liable.  It was even pointed out to them that, under present conditions, persons frequenting the beach and the area might sustain damage, but their answer was that if that happened at the moment, they had not directly invited or encouraged them.  If they carried out development work and, by implication, invited people to avail of the facilities and to enter the beach, they would, as a result, leave themselves liable in respect of any damage which occurred.</P>
    <P>I know it may be argued that if the place is of such a nature, it is not a very suitable place for visitors or persons anxious to avail of the swimming <Col N="925" /> facilities.  Nevertheless, quite a representative section of the local people think it is in the interests of the residents, as well as the visitors, that this beach at Shankill &mdash; a comparatively small place &mdash; should be developed and facilities provided.  If that problem is to be overcome, some type of liaison arrangements will have to be worked out between Bord Fáilte and the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>In other cases, I have been aware of hoteliers and others who were anxious to have development work undertaken, but, because of the general nature of the proposed schemes, the heavy costs involved, and the fact that the local authorities were already committed in respect of a number of projects, it was not possible to engender sufficient initiative and enthusiasm.  I believe that the Minister and the Department, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, should consider whatever local problems are involved because it seems there are some cases which come to light in which one of the problems is that there are the actual legal difficulties of either assuming responsibility or, on the other hand, evading responsibility in the event of any claim or difficulty arising.</P>
    <P>The inducements which have been provided for the expansion and development of hotel accommodation have not, so far, succeeded in securing the additional accommodation required for the peak tourist trade.  Again, I believe, there is another deterrent operating which has been adverted to. There is the fact that, if hoteliers carry out improvements, they are liable to have their valuations increased.  I know that in respect of improvements and developments generally there is a seven year remission of rates.  It depends, of course, on what type of extension or expansion is carried out as to whether or not the actual work leaves the hotelier concerned liable for revaluation, but undoubtedly the deterrent of a possible revaluation has a very serious retarding effect on those who would otherwise be prepared to provide improved facilities and increased accommodation.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficiently recognised that the tourist season here is so short.  In <Col N="926" /> most areas it consists merely of the summer months, with possible short additions at particular periods of the year in particular areas.  These additions do not apply in every area. For that reason, the Minister should, in conjunction with An Bord Fáilte, consider the effect of revaluation. Undoubtedly, hoteliers will be deterred because of the possible revaluation which can take place if improvements are carried out.</P>
    <P>During the course of the Minister's remarks, reference was made to the investigation carried out some years ago by the American experts and to their statement that the people here were both cordial and friendly.  It is not sufficiently realised that the best advertisement an hotel, or indeed an area, can have is a satisfied customer. Time and time again the same people come back for holidays here, simply because they are impressed by the cordial reception extended to them and the services which are rendered. In developing the tourist industry and in satisfying our customers, we must consider carefully the importance of providing reasonable facilities at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>Too often critics of facilities here compare conditions and services with conditions and services in the more exotic resorts abroad.  It would be foolish to try to emulate such resorts or copy their standards.  One of the attractions we have to offer &mdash; it is an attraction which exists in many other places as well &mdash; is that people are drawn to a particular area because the area is, so to speak, itself and does not try to emulate some other place or achieve standards beyond its capacity or provide services in circumstances entirely different from those in which such services exist elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The pattern of life here, the scenery and the natural amenities available are an attraction to many visitors.  In addition, the inherent friendliness of the Irish people and the courtesy invariably extended to visitors are in themselves the best advertisement the areas as well as the hotels can get.  For that reason it is important that care should be taken to provide good and reasonable accommodation at prices <Col N="927" /> within the capacity of the average tourist or holiday maker.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to stress for urgent attention is the need for further development as rapidly as possible at Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  I understand it is proposed to carry out a big development scheme there.  Certain works have been undertaken by the Board of Works in conjunction with the authorities at the Pier over the past five or six years and considerable improvements have been effected.  Nevertheless, at peak seasons, the congestion is still considerable.  I understand a ferry service is contemplated.  The sooner that work is carried out the better.  It will be a major scheme costing about £400,000.</P>
    <P>It will naturally take some time to complete the work, but the importance of getting it under way is obvious.  It will have a two-fold effect: first, it will improve the facilities and the services there; secondly, it will provide employment for local skilled and unskilled personnel.  The Department, in collaboration with An Bord Fáilte, should press forward with that scheme as rapidly as possible.  Dún Laoghaire is one of our most important tourist areas.  It is also one of the ports of entry to the country.  From that point of view the facilities available should be up to the standard which tourists nowadays expect to find, standards which can create a lasting impression on those who visit here.</P>
    <P>This measure will, I hope, add to the facilities already available for developing the tourist industry.  This industry is valuable both as an earner of revenue and as a channel through which to provide employment in many parts of the country.  It is, in fact, a comparatively cheap way of providing employment dispersed over a wide area.  For that reason it deserves encouragement and support from all sections of the people as well as from all sections in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Happily the question of the development of the tourist industry is not a Party question.  It is a national question.  It is a matter on which all Parties can see eye to eye with one <Col N="928" /> another in regard to the best means of accomplishing the objectives we all realise are essential if we are to make the fullest possible use of our tourist potential.</P>
      <P>Situated as we are here on the main road between West and East we have a particular attraction for tourists. Our main problem is to try to induce many tourists from the West to stop here on their way eastwards in the hope that they will spend here some of the money they have earmarked for their holidays.  It must be our constant aim to attract to this country as many as possible from the United States of America and from Canada.  Not only are these people good tourists but they are good spenders.  Their whole economy enables them to spend on their holidays much more money than our own people, for example, could afford.  While it is true that we get our share of American visitors I do not think we are getting an adequate proportion of the increased travelling which Americans have been doing in recent years.</P>
      <P>A British tourist agency has indicated that they believed the American tourist traffic in Britain for the first five months of this year was up by 14 per cent. on the same period last year and that judging by the number of American tourists now to be seen in London, this percentage may be substantially exceeded by the time the tourist season is over.  One can easily realise, of course, that many American tourists, when arranging their holidays in Europe, take direct flights to London or into Europe proper and, therefore, overfly this country but, as many of these tourists are persons of Irish extraction or persons who could be interested in a holiday in Ireland, it must be our constant aim to endeavour to show them that a holiday in Ireland is not only relatively inexpensive, judged by American standards, but that here there are scenic beauties and many other unspoiled attractions which are not as easily or as inexpensively enjoyed in other places in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our aim, therefore, must be to endeavour to attract as many visitors as <Col N="929" /> possible from the West because, so far as they are concerned, they cannot get to Europe except by passing Ireland. They have to come this way and our aim ought to be to endeavour to induce them to spend some time here either at the start or at the end of their holidays.</P>
    <P>What is the best way of doing that? Nobody has found any substantial or satisfactory substitute in the tourist field for advertising.  Every country in the world has found it necessary to print literature and to distribute it lavishly through agencies and through their own tourist offices.  They have found it a compelling obligation to advertise the attractions of their country extensively.  I do not think there is any short cut for us in that respect.  We must continue to advertise the attractions of Ireland.  While it would involve colossal expenditure to undertake a large-scale advertising campaign over the entire United States of America, we must recognise that expenditure on advertising is not expenditure from which there is no tangible return.  Advertising of tourism must be regarded as a long-term investment which, in the long run, will pay dividends from the point of view of the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>I welcome, therefore, this Bill to provide the amenities and the attractions which it envisages.  I would welcome, also, still greater investment in advertising overseas as being, in the long run, the method best calculated to reach the potential tourist and to excite his interest in a holiday in Ireland.  It may be said that the State cannot afford to undertake expensive advertising in America because America is not a country; it is a continent.  However, ways and means might be found whereby the revenue from some forms of taxation or levies could be hypothecated to advertising our tourist potentialities.  In that way, the moneys available for advertising could be augmented so that it would be possible to reach a larger number of potential tourists.</P>
    <P>The main thing is to ensure that the attractions of this country will be kept before potential tourists.  The main, and probably the most profitable, type <Col N="930" /> of tourists that we can get are those from North America, that is, Canada and the United States, on the one hand, and from Great Britain, on the other hand.  If we could get a fair share of the holiday traffic from these countries, we need not try to bring people from the far ends of the earth.  The concentration of advertising in Great Britain, America and Canada would pay substantial dividends, some immediately and some at a later date.  If this country could be made a draw for American, Canadian and British tourists, that in itself would advertise the country over a wider field and induce people from other countries also to come here.</P>
    <P>What we have to recognise &mdash; and this is useful from the point of view of promoting agreement between all Parties &mdash;is that, next to our cattle trade, tourism is our best export.  We manage to balance on our external trade only because of the fact that we have a very substantial income from tourism.  The more we can develop the tourist traffic, the more we can earn foreign currency, the more we can provide employment diffused over the entire country and, at the same time, provide ourselves with a means to maintain existing living standards and possibly to improve them.  Therefore, from the school up, we should endeavour to inculcate in all our people the idea that it is a patriotic duty to do everything possible to promote the tourist traffic, that every possible effort must be made to make the tourist at home because the tourist is a customer capable of spending substantial sums of money which will improve the Irish economy as a whole and be of considerable value to local communities.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest some things that might be done which might not only improve the appearance of the country but would remove eyesores which are a reflection on our energy. Throughout the country, frequently on the main roads, one sees a tumbledown shack.  The roof is falling in. Nobody lives in the place.  The most marvellous collection of wild, exotic plants grow around it.  It stands there as a gaunt reminder of our earlier poverty and gives the tourist the impression <Col N="931" /> that he has arrived a little too late to see the Irish in all their pristine squalor and misery.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why local authorities could not be set to work next Monday to demolish all these ruins which are an eyesore and a disgrace on the Irish countryside? You get into your motor car at Inchicore and drive to Cork.  At almost every village and town on that run you will see these eyesores.  You will see festering rubbish heaps used for the dumping of sewage, tin cans, old prams, buckets, bicycle wheels, bedsteads and all kinds of repelling chattels which nobody apparently wants to own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do we want to parade these before the visitors?  Are we afraid we will impress them too much with the attractions of the countryside?  Do we think we will curb the visitor's exuberance and exaltation of what he sees by keeping these horrible eyesores along the main roads on which he must necessarily travel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You come to another structure, the old shed erected 100 years ago.  It has never been painted since.  It is covered with corrugated iron which is rusty and well holed at the top.  That is paraded there, too, so that the tourist may have another look at the seamy side of Irish life.  Surely it ought to be possible in 1959 to get rid of these kinds of structures, at least so far as the main road is concerned?  If we have an affection for these, well and good.  If some person has an affection for that kind of wreck and   <Col N="932" /> and good.  However, I do not see why he should be allowed to bring it on to the main road.  Let him take it on to the by-roads if he is fond of that kind of architecture and all these kinds of antiquities.  There is no reason why his insane mind should be permitted to parade these articles of property on the main road, to the denigration of the country and to the horror of the tourist who cannot understand why these things are left there.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister &mdash; this will not cost very much &mdash; to get the Minister for Local Government to endeavour to impel local authorities to use their powers to demolish these eyesores so that the beautiful little villages which are to be seen every five or ten miles along our main roads will not be spoiled by these dreadful structures which are paraded there in all their filth and squalor.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have now come, very largely, close to the end of their house-building activities.  There must be a substantial change for many of them in so far as house-building activities are concerned.  Their engineering staffs to-day are as heavy as they were when house-building was at its height.  There must be some time available to these engineering officials and that section of local authorities which could be set to the doing of other kinds of work.  Is it too much to ask that local authorities should be required to take town by town and village by village to see what the structural imperfections are in these places and to endeavour to remedy these defects by whatever steps appear to be open to them?</P>
    <P>In a number of instances, local authorities have demolished houses in their towns and villages and have built new houses but the old ruins still remain.  I do not see why the local authority should not be required to demolish the old ruins and build new and decent houses on the sites of the old ruins or make some other use of them instead of having them there to the annoyance of everybody who wants to try to make this country not merely progressive and enlightened, from the standpoint of its habits and its social amenities, but to look it as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> I agree with the Minister when he says that these grants will be available for providing amenities and attractions for tourists provided there is some local effort by private enterprise or by county councils or by local authorities generally.  I do not think it unreasonable to ask local authorities, whatever their status may be, to help in promoting the tourist trade and to help in providing amenities and attractions in order that that trade may be better catered for than it is at the moment. After all, if a local authority has within its area certain tourist attractions which could be embellished and made still more attractive it is a good investment of their money to endeavour to exploit the attractions they have so as to bring more tourists there.</P>
    <P>Not only is the tourist nationally advantageous to us from the standpoint that he is a money spender but he spends his money in local areas and is thus helping local ratepayers to pay their rates with a greater ease than if he were not there.  Therefore, local authorities stand to gain substantially in places where there are potential tourist resorts.  It is not unreasonable to require them to spend some money in developing the amenities and attractions of their particular areas.</P>
    <P>Something should be done about signposts.  I think there has been a considerable improvement in recent years in signposting the country.  I still find it hard to analyse the kind of Irish mind that takes a malicious delight in twisting signposts only for the purpose apparently of misleading the tourist or the stranger.  It is hard to believe that any national purpose is served by this curious method of diverting signposts.  I do not know who is responsible.  I suppose that, if we knew, the guilty parties would appear in the courts in due course.  It may be that our aged citizens indulge in this craze but I suspect the offenders are at the other end of the age group.</P>
    <P>Would it not be possible for the Minister to ask the Minister for Education to get teachers in schools to lecture children not only on the bad citizenship of twisting signposts but on the harm they do to the <Col N="934" /> country by misleading tourists and strangers and possibly causing doubts in people as to the direction in which they are going &mdash; very often on a dark night when there is nobody available for consultation as to which is the right direction a person may desire to take in the course of his journey? Something ought to be done there. We ought to get away from this mistaken concept of recreation in twisting signposts.  That, apparently, in some parts of the country, is a kind of a national pastime.  The sooner it is eradicated the better.</P>
    <P>Dublin is one of the loveliest cities in the world.  The more you travel the world the more you see that Dublin has few equals.  It is situated on the coast.  It is surrounded by hills.  You can fish, hunt fox and catch salmon, six miles from the General Post Office.  I do not think you can get these conditions in any other city in the world and I have seen a good part of the world.  The strange part of the thing is that, although you can get those attractions here, if you want a boat trip out in Dublin Bay, you cannot get it.  You may take a chance and take a small boat out and just see the wave in front of you and the wave behind you, but surely it ought to be possible, in a city like Dublin, the capital of the country, with a population of approximately 600,000 people, the main entry gate for tourists, to organise some boat trips from the city out to the bay and north and south of the coast so as to give our visitors an opportunity of seeing the coastline and enjoying the salubrious air which the bay provides in such reckless abundance for us.</P>
    <P>Certain boat trips were organised some years ago and many people who were of adult age then can remember some disedifying scenes associated with those nautical pilgrimages.  I am not advocating a repetition of these Captain Kidd adventures into the bay, nor am I suggesting that those who go there should behave like sailors with their rum jars in the days of old.  I am suggesting instead that some body ought to get together &mdash; Dublin Corporation is probably the best body <Col N="935" /> to do it &mdash; and promote a scheme for boat trips in this delightful bay and along a delightful coastline, and that these trips should be run under conditions in which temperate people, ladies and children and elderly people, may go without fear of being shipwrecked by more boisterous trippers on a venture of that kind.  Something should be done in that direction. Money can be earned and it would add to our attractions as a tourist country.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to mention is the possibility of developing what I think could be the finest boulevard not merely in this country but in the world. There is a stretch of coast from Sandymount to Dún Laoghaire which is ideal for utilisation as a boulevard. Unfortunately, the railway is there, with the result that you cannot get across the railway except over some hump bridge or through some lattice work and then you get down to the beach which is in an undeveloped state because the railways have prevented development.</P>
    <P>In 1959, it ought to be possible to lower the railways there.  Railways in every city in the world travel underground for much longer distances than from Sandymount to Dún Laoghaire. Lower the railway along that stretch and you can build along that seafront a boulevard which would be the envy of many countries in the world.  It could be a great attraction for tourists.  It could in particular be a great attraction for the citizens of this city and it could be a very good money spinner as well.</P>
    <P>I know that is a pretty big job. Some of the best things in the world are the most expensive to get but the very fact that it is expensive and would take some time ought not to prevent our considering it and prevent our starting to survey the possibilities of building there what I think could be the most magnificent boulevard in the world.  It could in fact pay for itself in half a dozen different ways, if we only had the courage and the determination to start, but if we allow ourselves to be frightened by the financial cost of it, then it will never be done until some Government comes along <Col N="936" /> determined to establish a precedent in a field like that and go ahead and build the boulevard.</P>
    <P>I do suggest to the Minister who is responsible for tourism that this is a matter well worth considering.  I tried to get it considered and I brought city officials to the scene and showed them what the advantages were, but at the time they were distraught with their own financial worries.  I suggest to the Minister that if he sets his hand to the task of having this possibility explored, before he is many years older, he could see the boulevard being christened after him.  I do not begrudge him that honour, if he will only set his hand to the task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure and congratulate the Minister on it. I do so coming from what I can claim to be the major tourist centre in this country, Galway and the West.  A great deal can still be done to add to the amenities we have by the proper expenditure of this money.  I should like to see greater advertising done over the radio and over television.  The co-operation of the Continental and American television companies can be obtained for that purpose quite easily.</P>
      <P>We are inclined not to appreciate the amount of good that youth can do in the country.  Young people who come in here, travelling as it were on a shoestring, can be our greatest advertisers in the years to come.  Many of them are students.  The Minister was a student once and realises the amount of money a student usually has.  However, they take away impressions with them which in the years to come are to our advantage.  They advertise the country in their different spheres, whether they are medical men or whatever their profession may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism is our second best industry and we are coming close to the day when it will be our best.  I agree with Deputy Norton in regard to the demolition of unsightly, derelict buildings. Unfortunately, the hands of our local authorities seem to be tied in that respect.  There is a great deal to be done and the Minister should use his good offices to see that it is done. We are blessed with grand scenery and the visitors say we are blessed in that <Col N="937" /> we are a grand people, but we could be still grander if our schools could instil into youth a proper appreciation of what tourism means to the country. A lot of leeway has to be made up there, because although it is not extensive, there is a certain amount of hooliganism which can be eradicated only by educating children in the schools in the importance of a civic spirit.</P>
    <P>I agree this money will be well spent if it is for the purpose of providing amenities and I would suggest that the Board should carry on as they have been doing up to the present in Salthill, Galway.  I would suggest that a further improvement could be made by the provision of a pier.  The importance of a pier there cannot be overstressed because Galway Bay is known the world over.</P>

      <P>I shall get you a drop. I mentioned the question of amenities in Salthill.  I should like to see further development of the amenities on Lough Corrib which is a vast expanse of water.  Before I conclude.  I should like to refer to the matter of the improvement of dwellings.  I said before &mdash; I could not say it often enough &mdash; that where people develop hotels and guest houses, they are faced with a heavy impact of rates.  They may get relief for a number of years.  Where guesthouses and hotels are used for only three months of the tourist season, they have to pay the full rate for the nine months.  I think that is unfortunate. I am just bringing the matter to the Minister's notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> I again congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill.  I hope to see an increase each year.  We have done a lot for agriculture and I would like to see as much done for tourism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to join with the other Deputies in welcoming the Bill.  I do not think the sum involved is unreasonable, provided the best use is made of it.  It should have an advantageous effect on our attempts to attract tourists to this country and make it worth their while to come here.</P>
      <P>Personally, I am more inclined to advertise the natural advantages we have in this country rather than spend money in creating artificial facilities such as piers, promenades and similar types of outlay.  I know that these are considered attractions, but, having regard to the amount of money which we can afford to spend on tourism, I feel that the best expenditure would be to make available to the tourists the natural beauties of the country which do not cost us anything at all.  By that I mean improving the approach roads to beauty spots throughout the country so that tourists can get to them without any difficulty.</P>
      <P>Even a simple thing like the cutting of hedges would open up a greater view of the countryside than they can get today in a great part of the country.  The Minister should encourage the local authorities concerned to take the initiative in this regard by offering a service to the farmers whose land abuts on a main road or on a good secondary road to assist them by some mechanical means to cut these hedges and keep them cut, particularly during the Summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one word in the Bill that I find some objection to.  Perhaps, the Minister would allay my fears when replying.  The suggestion here is that these grants are for the development of the major tourist resorts.  The word &ldquo;major&rdquo; is one that causes me some little concern because I think it would be a pity to concentrate only upon the major tourist resorts at the expense of the smaller but nonetheless beautiful tourist resorts elsewhere in <Col N="939" /> the country.  I hope, therefore, that at least some of this money will be available for the small resorts with the necessary facilities, which have small hotels and guest houses and which at the same time have the advantage of natural scenery.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton made reference to unsightly buildings.  I do not know whether he intends to include in that the large old country houses bought by certain well-known firms and individuals for the purpose of demolition. They are demolished only in so far as the timber, slates and windows can be sold quickly on the site, leaving the very unsightly shell of these large country houses to stand as a gaunt reminder of the days that are past &mdash; and a very unsightly reminder. I think it should be possible to get the local authorities concerned to make it obligatory on the person carrying out the demolition to demolish these large country houses down to the ground.  A number of them throughout all parts of the country certainly give a melancholy and very unsightly appearance to the countryside.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to Dublin as being the major tourist inlet to the country.  I would suggest that, with the present development of air traffic, Shannon Airport is becoming more and more important as a tourist inlet to the south and west of Ireland, if not the entire country.  In considering the expenditure of this money, special consideration should be given to the wide area to which Shannon Airport gives access.  In that regard, I have in mind Limerick city itself which on a much smaller scale is, I think, a very perfect example of a small historic Georgian city.  It is well worthy of a visit by many tourists.</P>
    <P>We have in Limerick city one of the most historic castles in the country &mdash; King John's Castle.  Some time ago, Limerick Corporation made application for a grant to put that castle in proper repair.  At the time, they were not successful.  I should like to appeal to the Minister that, when the application is re-submitted, having regard to that historic part of Ireland on the <Col N="940" /> banks of the Shannon, he should give favourable consideration to allocating some funds to restore this historic building.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is intended that the £500,000 in subsection (b) of Section 2, which covers grants for the development of holiday accommodation, should include small guesthouses or lodgings.  I should be sorry to think that it is confined solely to hotels or large guest houses because most of our seaside resorts have a large number of quite small lodgings which are let each year, the owners of which are quite unable to find the necessary capital to provide even such common or garden amenities as bathrooms and, in some cases, toilets, within the confines of the house.</P>
    <P>Most of us know that the tourist season in parts of the country is confined to a bare two months, or at the outside, three months.  The income which the owners derive from letting these lodgings is certainly not sufficient to allow them to carry out these comparatively minor modifications and reconstructions. I hope that this sum will be available to these people, provided they are prepared to do a decent job at a reasonable outlay.</P>
    <P>For the past two years, I raised on two or three occasions by way of question to the Minister for Local Government the matter of some control in regard to the erection of advertising hoardings.  I understand that some form of legislation is pending and will be introduced, I hope, in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that these hoardings are going up at an increasing rate on our main roads and are certainly detracting from the appearance of our unspoiled countryside.  I would urge the Minister, or his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to take the necessary steps, through An Bord Fáilte, to prohibit the erection of these monstrosities which are ruining the countryside.  I am glad to see this Bill being introduced and I am sure it will have a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There was quite an <Col N="941" /> amount of sound common sense in what both Deputy Norton and Deputy Russell said with regard to various matters which might be rectified under this Bill.  One matter on which I should like to comment is that the Tourist Board, in their wisdom, never seem to pay the slightest attention to a tremendous potential which we have in Ireland, and particularly in Dublin, as a tourist attraction.  I refer to the efforts of the people who visit this country, and Dublin in particular, to trace some of the characters and locations referred to by James Joyce in his various writings.</P>
      <P>Everyone must appreciate, particularly journalists and anyone connected with literary or cultural activities, that five out of six Americans, if you enter into a discussion with them, will ply you with questions about various aspects of Joyce's work and the various places mentioned by him in his books.  It is a serious reflection on the Tourist Board that up to now they have not thought it worth their while even to put up plaques or produce a proper handbook or guide to these places.  It is rather an extraordinary thing, seeing that many university students, or graduates of American universities, when they are doing a doctorate or a thesis on English literature take Joyce for their subject.  Myles na gCopaleen referred to that on several occasions and I suppose we have 14 or 15 different authorities writing on Joyce. It is a matter of tremendous national importance.  I hope I am not straying too far from the Bill but it does state that money can be devoted to major tourist resorts and I think some of this money might be spent in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no memento of Seán Ó Casey and there is not even a plaque on his house.  About a year ago the magazine <i>Life</i> in one issue had a most beautiful production in colour which dealt with O'Casey and his early days in Dublin.  It showed his house and different scenes referred to in some of his plays.  It would be a tremendous asset to have a handbook on those lines and it could also deal with George Bernard Shaw.  The Minister might say that this is a matter for the Arts Council.  There should be co-ordination, <Col N="942" /> I respectfully submit, between the Arts Council and the responsible body, whichever body thinks it is responsible. The Tourist Board, when they appreciate the fact that nothing is being done to publicise these tremendous attractions, should step in or the Minister should use his good offices in the matter.  Something will have to be done about it because it is very unfortunate that we are lacking in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell referred to old houses.  I would say that the Minister should ask the Tourist Board to spend some of this money, possibly in conjunction with the Minister for Lands, for the preservation of old houses.  I do not know whether it was a Fianna Fáil Government or a Coalition Government which allowed Lady Gregory's house to be demolished.  I personally, and very many other people also, took a very poor view of that.  It was criminal to let a residence such as that be razed to the ground.  It is gone and now we have people going down to Coole Park where all they can see is the remains of the historic past.</P>
    <P>It is essential that there should be some co-ordination between the responsible bodies.  At present we have too many bodies working, or thinking that they are working, on different cultural projects which should be co-ordinated under the aegis of the Tourist Board. The Minister for Lands is allowing the demolition of these old buildings.  I do not think we have anything in this country comparable with the National Trust in Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is that?  I am talking about the spending of money on major tourist resorts and suggesting to the Minister that he should ask the Board to use some of that money for the purpose I suggest and that the Board might co-ordinate its activities with the Minister for Lands who has charge of these old houses and who is allowing some of these masterpieces and historic buildings to be demolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> The Minister should clarify one point.  I do not think it is fair that he should give us the interpretation of &ldquo;a major tourist resort.&rdquo;  Governments change and Ministers change and it should be specifically written into the Bill what &ldquo;a major tourist resort&rdquo; is under this Bill.  Has it to be a city or a town with so many thousands of people in it?  Why put in the word &ldquo;major&rdquo;?  Who is the competent authority to interpret the meaning of the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; in this Bill?  Surely the word could be omitted and just &ldquo;tourist resort&rdquo; left in?  Are places such as Kilkee, Lahinch, Lisdoonvarna and Dingle, allowed to qualify under this Bill, or would Limerick City be considered &ldquo;a major tourist resort&rdquo;? The Minister himself may be satisfied that there is no necessity to change the Bill but, when an application comes before the Board, how is the Board to decide who qualifies and who does not?</P>
    <P>With regard to tourist bureaux which derive their source of income from voted moneys, I should like to say that I take a very poor view of the present position that obtains at Shannon Airport where the head man in the bureau is a non-national.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <P>The tourist bureau in Limerick City closes at 6. p.m. and I believe its opening hours should be extended.  I thoroughly agree with Deputy Norton that we should pay more attention to the middle-class British visitor, and I should like the <Col N="944" /> Minister to be specific when giving his views on the matter of the smaller hotels and boarding houses mentioned by Deputy Russell.  There are not sufficient officials in the Tourist Board at the present time to correct the injustices perpetrated by some of these establishments which go under the names of guest houses and lodging houses.</P>
      <P>I should also like the Minister to say if indoor swimming pools would qualify for assistance under the terms of this Bill?  We are very far behind in the provision of indoor swimming pools and swimming facilities of all types, except on the coast.  If a local authority, be it a county council or a Corporation, is willing to make contributions for the provision of swimming pools would the Minister tell us would they be deemed worthy of consideration for the payment of a grant?</P>
      <P>The only other matter to which I want to refer is the question of the grading of hotels.  Anyone who has even a slight knowledge of the grading of hotels knows it is not working out satisfactorily at the present time.  In some peculiar way an hotelier knows when the inspector who grades hotels is coming.  He is given a sumptuous repast for lunch or dinner and, if he stays the night, he will be treated royally, and so will all the other regular occupants of the establishment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that this Bill has received the acclamation it has received from all sides of the House.  It is a healthy sign that there is an appreciation of the value of the tourist industry to the economy of the country, and that it is now no longer a matter of political debate between different Parties in this House.  The main question is now one of approach. <Col N="945" /> While we have heard no strong exception to the Bill, the scope of the debate largely centred on what further and better things can be done apart from this Bill, and apart from the other facilities that have been provided for the development of the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>The points that have been made are, in many cases, outside the scope of this Bill but, nevertheless, they cannot be overlooked if we are to complete the overall picture in adding to our tourist amenities and making the country in general more attractive.  The lack of liaison between the local authorities on the one hand, and local development committees and Bord Fáilte on the other, is a matter in which I think individual Deputies can exercise their influence to bring about a better liaison, and a better spirit of co-operation than exists now.  I do not think there is any lack of spirit of co-operation but there is still the old feeling, when a job requires to be done, that everybody feels it is the business of somebody else to do it.  I believe that local authorities and local development committees should co-operate to the fullest extent with Bord Fáilte in providing any amenities that can be provided. The important thing for local authorities is to realise that the development of tourist business is something as much within their competence, and within the obligations they should take upon themselves, as it is of the Government.  Therefore, as Deputy Norton stated, it is reasonable that local contributions should be forthcoming in order to balance whatever grants may be given under the first part of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal difficulties to which Deputy Cosgrave referred are not very clear to me.  I do not really know what he has in mind but, if there are such difficulties I am sure, in so far as they hinder or affect the work of Bord Fáilte, they will get over them.  If we are to accept our system of valuation as affecting the level of rates to be paid in respect of property, I think we shall have to expect that, in so far as improvements are made in property, there will have to be some corresponding increase in valuation <Col N="946" /> and a consequent increase in the amount of rates to be paid.  Apart from the reliefs given to hoteliers to improve their accommodation in the manner it is suggested it should be done here &mdash; that is the seven years' remission &mdash; I understand that the valuation officers take into account the usage and occupancy of the additional accommodation. Therefore, in the case of purely tourist hotels, they can be full sure they will not be assessed by the valuation commissioners on the same lines as other property that will have a higher degree of occupancy during the year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton and Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the question of amenities in Dublin and around Dublin.  The pier at Dún Laoghaire has been improved to a considerable extent in recent years and I understand that whatever improvements are still outstanding will be undertaken, and undertaken vigorously. In so far as my Department is concerned in it, it is the intention to facilitate these improvements and have them done in the minimum time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton stressed the importance of advertising in countries abroad.  I do not think we can, as he said, afford to take any short cut in that respect.  Naturally, we cannot afford the extensive advertising campaigns undertaken by countries better off than we are.  Nevertheless, we must realise that this type of advertising must be done to the fullest possible extent that we can afford.  I believe it would be a very effective form of advertising if we could get displayed, on Sundays or ordinary days at resorts in or around London and especially on the road home from these resorts, some of our Irish scenes.  I believe it would be very effective if we could in some way display such resorts as Owenahincha, Rossnowlagh and Caherdaniel where there are miles and miles of golden sands with very few people sitting on them or bathing from them.  I believe that the English people as a result of increased motor traffic are getting rather tired of making the most hazardous journey to and from their own resorts, especially at week-ends and on bank holidays.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> If we could sell &mdash; I know some people do not like the word &ldquo;sell&rdquo; in that context &mdash; the attractions of these resorts where there is plenty of space and accommodation, I think we could induce many more English people to come here.</P>
    <P>The complaint Deputy Norton made about unsightly ruins is perhaps timely in certain respects.  In a debate such as this, is it a hardy annual.  On a recent change of Government, some of us were new to government and naturally wanted to clean up everything, but one of the things on which we found the greatest agreement was the cleaning up of unsightly ruins.  As a result of discussions by the Government, the Minister for Local Government was instructed to go ahead with legislation dealing with the removal of unsightly ruins in villages and towns throughout the country.  I understand he has gone ahead to the extent that at least the heads of the Bill have been drafted so that we hope before long the Minister or the local authorities will have power to ensure that these unsightly ruins will not be there much longer as a blot on our countryside.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley was on a plane rather higher than I expected, up with Lady Gregory and James Joyce, but I can assure him that while the singing of the praises of these writers and the perpetuation of their memories would not be germane to this Bill, I believe that An Bórd Fáilte do not overlook the tourist value of the association of these famous literary people with this country.</P>
    <P>The question was asked: what is a major resort?  That will have to be left to the Board to decide.  They must decide in what resorts they will expend the moneys or give the grants which are available under this Bill. There will be no hard and fast rule and I certainly should not like to take it on myself to define and spell out on a Bill such as this what a major resort will be, how many houses, how many miles of road or how many people should normally reside in it. There will be no hard and fast rule. If the Board see a resort developing and if they see the need for making <Col N="948" /> provision under this Bill for schemes of development, I am sure they will do so.  There will be no rigid application of a set of rules.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in regard to the point made both by Deputy Russell and Deputy O'Malley that some assistance should be given towards making extra accommodation available in boarding houses, the test in this respect is being provided in the Bill.  The test is that the premises should be registered with Bord Fáilte.  I am sure both Deputies will agree that this is essential in order to ensure the premises will reach a certain minimum standard and will enhance the development and attractions of a particular resort.  So long as the premises are registered, there will be a certainty they will conform to minimum standards and as the intention of the Board is not only to extend but also to increase the standard of tourist accommodation, I believe that the better the premises, naturally the greater the grant will be because in any case the cost will be higher.  That will be the policy of the Board &mdash; not only to improve resorts but also the accommodation available.</P>
    <P>I think these are the major points that have been raised and I conclude by thanking the House for the reception it has accorded this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main object of the Bill is to abolish the need for endorsement of cheques and similar instruments where they are paid into the bank account of the payee.  This has already been done in Britain and the Six Counties under a British Act called the Cheques Act, 1957, and the difference in practice has been causing inconvenience to the Banks here.  Six County and British Banks tend to present Irish cheques unendorsed and the Irish Banks have work and expense <Col N="949" /> in returning them for endorsement before payment.</P>
    <P>As the vast majority of cheques nowadays are paid into the accounts of the payee, the abolition of endorsements in these cases has resulted in a considerable saving of time in Britain and the Six Counties both for banks and their customers.  This Bill will bring similar savings to the Irish banks and business people generally. As it is obviously desirable that the uniformity of banking law here and in the Six Counties and Britain should be restored the present Bill follows strictly the lines of the British Cheques Act, 1957.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill extends to unendorsed cheques and similar instruments the protection which a paying banker at present enjoys in respect of endorsed cheques and other instruments.  Similar protection is afforded to the collecting banker by section 4 (3).  Section 2 preserves the existing rights of a collecting banker as a holder of a cheque in due course notwithstanding that the cheque has not been endorsed.  Section 3 provides that a paid unendorsed cheque is evidence of the receipt of the sum payable by the cheque and thus will have the effect of reducing the number of cases in which drawers of cheques will require the payees to give receipts on the back of cheques.</P>
    <P>Two further amendments of the law relating to cheques and similar instruments are made by the Bill.  Sections 4 (1) and 4 (2) extend to uncrossed cheques and similar uncrossed instruments the protection against claims for conversion afforded to collecting banks by section 82 of the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, as amended.  At the same time, Section 4 (1) (b) provides that this extended protection applies where any of the instruments in question is accepted for collection and the payee's account is immediately credited.</P>
    <P>Section 5 consolidates the present legislation regarding the application of the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, relating to crossed cheques to instruments not being bills of exchange.</P>
    <P>The consequential repeals of existing <Col N="950" /> legislation are dealt with in section 6 and mentioned in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>In order to give banks and the business community time in which to prepare for the introduction of the new arrangements, section 7 (2) provides that this Bill shall not come into operation until three months after it has been passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With the general proposition that some legislation is desirable to obviate a great deal of the unnecessary trouble that arises in relation to the endorsement of cheques, no one will quarrel.  Indeed, on frequent occasions since the system was introduced on the other side, I have asked the Minister myself when he hoped to introduce legislation.</P>
      <P>The legislation introduced now is exactly word for word &mdash; with the exception of the preamble &mdash; the legislation which is in force in Britain.  That legislation arose out of a Private Bill introduced in the British House of Commons.  Following that, a Committee on Cheque Endorsement was set up and reported in November 1956 &mdash; the Mocatta Committee.  The Bill in England did not follow the recommendations of the Mocatta Committee and I have failed to find anywhere an explanation as to why it did not follow the Report of that Committee. As the Minister here has taken the same line, of going in the teeth of the recommendations of the Mocatta Committee, I would like to hear from him the reasons he did not do so.</P>
      <P>When you have a cheque drawn, say, by me and payable to Deputy Dr. Ryan, and which is going to be lodged to the account of Deputy Dr. Ryan, it seems to me an utterly nonsensical waste of time for Deputy Dr. Ryan as the payee to have to endorse that cheque.  This Bill correctly does away with that necessity and correctly saves that time.  I am not going to go into the question of what would happen if the cheque came back again afterwards. We shall leave that for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Mocatta Committee reported in England, it made it quite clear that in relation to a cheque drawn <Col N="951" /> in favour of a payee and lodged to that payee's account, certainly the need for endorsement should go.  This Bill, however, does more than that.  It provides that not merely when you have a cheque payable to a payee and lodged to that payee's account it need not be endorsed but, apart from that, even when the cheque is to be paid over the counter in cash there is no legal obligation, as this Bill is drawn, following the English Bill, as far as I can find out, for that cheque to be endorsed either.  The Mocatta Committee made it very clear that they supported the principle where the cheque was going to the payee's account but they did not support the principle where the cheque was going to be cashed &mdash; as we understand the word &ldquo;cashed&rdquo;&mdash; by receiving cash over the counter.  I should like the Minister to explain to the House why he has not accepted that recommendation of that Committee, just as the British did not accept it.  Why they did not do so I cannot trace, though I have read the entire debate on the similar Bill in the British House of Commons.</P>
    <P>The second change this Bill makes &mdash; and, I want to be fair to the Minister, that the British Bill made&mdash;is in relation to Section 3.  There the Bill provides that an unendorsed cheque which appears to have been paid is evidence of the receipt by the payee of the sum payable by the cheque. The Mocatta Committee provided that in such a case the cheque when paid should be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the particular payment.  Deputy S. Flanagan, of course, can appreciate the difference straight away.  As far as I can understand the position now, it is that while the Committee's report in England made a saver in the case where a cheque had got into wrong hands &mdash; then, though the paid cheque was <i>prima facie</i> evidence it could be rebutted by other evidence &mdash; this Bill provides, on the other hand, that no evidence of rebuttal is permissible.  I do not quite understand what the position is to be in relation to the provisions of Section 3.  If a cheque is drawn now &mdash; an order cheque, of course; it <Col N="952" /> does not refer to bearer cheques &mdash; and is mislaid and is picked up in the street by someone else and is brought into the Bank and is paid, the effect of Section 3, as I understand it, is that that cheque, having been paid to a thief, operates as a complete estoppel against everybody else, the genuine person entitled and otherwise, to obtain the moneys due.</P>
    <P>It might be taken that the two points I have mentioned are more Committee points, but they strike at the fundamental root of the whole Bill.  The part which worries me is why they in England, and why we here, other than for the sake of uniformity, flew in the face of the recommendations made by people who had experience of this situation not merely from a legal point of view but from a practical point of view as well.</P>
    <P>There has been in America for some considerable time a system by which the collecting bank sometimes endorses a cheque and that the collecting bank &ldquo;will be accountable for want of endorsement&rdquo;. That has been used in America to obviate the necessity for endorsement.  I know of occasions on which it has been used here.  It was a possible solution of this problem which was not thought fit.  While I am in agreement with the Minister that it is probably better that we should keep complete uniformity in this respect, at the same time I think that, before we ultimately and finally decide that uniformity is desirable, we should have the pros and cons of the other difficulties put down clearly before us.</P>
    <P>I take it, from the reference the Minister made, he agrees that under this Bill there will still be room for the provision of special endorsement receipts?  Deputy Flanagan will agree with me that in relation to an ordinary cheque, there is no difference between the production of the cheque itself as evidence of payment and the production of the cheque with a blank receipt on the back of it.  But there is another method adopted, particularly by insurance companies which saves very considerable administration costs in relation to insurances, where the endorsement on the back of the cheque is that the amount has been received in <Col N="953" /> full discharge of the claim under policy so-and-so.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, it would not be necessary for the banks to continue that type of service, but it is a service that most certainly should be continued and a service which, I think, was continued by an undertaking from the Committee of London Clearing Banks at the time the British Bill was going through.  I hope the Minister has obtained the consent of, and in fact a complete understanding from, the Banks Standing Committee here that they will continue that service in the future.  If they do not continue that service, then the additional costs in administration involved by the necessity of providing in those cases for further administration receipts, as in the case of insurance companies and so on, and where special endorsement receipts are necessary, will obviate a great deal of the saving that otherwise would arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, I am sure, read the report of the Mocatta Committee, but I would particularly refer him to recommendation No. 6 in the Summary referring to paragraphs 61-66 of the main report.  There the Committee came down quite specifically on the lines I referred to at the commencement of my speech.  I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The endorsement of cheques paid over the counter is outside our terms of reference but we have given consideration to it and we think that there are grounds for retaining endorsement in these cases.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, this Bill does not retain endorsement in these cases.  If I have misunderstood the Bill, I should be glad to be told so; but if I have not, then I think it is clear that this House should be told why that has been departed from.</P>
    <P>I do not know either whether the Minister is in a position to give us an indication of the amount of stamp duty on the ordinary twopenny receipts, where there is a general receipt on the back of a cheque, and what will be the loss in those cases. He may not be able to give us that figure, but perhaps he can give us some indication of the amount of revenue being given up &mdash; and revenue <Col N="954" /> is being given up &mdash; to assist in this administrative improvement.</P>
    <P>I am sure all those who have had the opportunity of seeing commercial concerns deal with a great number of cheques &mdash; often made out in the wrong name and having to be endorsed first in the wrong name and then in the right name &mdash; will appreciate the necessity and desirability of something like this to obviate that difficulty.  I know it is dealt with in some cases by a rubber stamp giving every conceivable misspelling of a person's name; but that is an undesirable method and this is a much better method.</P>
    <P>The other summary provision in the Mocatta Report I was looking for and could not find is paragraph 9 on page 25 which deals with paragraphs 75-82 of the main report.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We have considered the possible objection that, under the foregoing proposals, the value of paid cheques as prima facie evidence of payment would be reduced.  We think it difficult to forecast with certainty the view which the Courts would take on this point, but we think that any possible risk of loss of evidental value should be counteracted by a provision that where it appears that a cheque has been paid by the bank on which it is drawn, it shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt of the money by the payee.</P>
    <P>The Committee went on in its Schedule to draft what it called &ldquo;a possible form of legislation.&rdquo;  The possible section, which would be the equivalent of our Section 3, included in their report is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If it appears that a cheque, or any other document, draft or order covered by Section 4 (i) of this Act, has been paid by the banker on whom it is drawn then it shall be prima facie exidence of the receipt by the payee named thereon of the sum for which such instrument is drawn.</P>
    <P>This section makes it, not <i>prima facie</i> evidence, but absolute evidence; and we are entitled to be told why that very proper saver put in by that Committee has been omitted from the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose <Col N="955" /> to say very much about this because Deputy Sweetman very ably put a certain point of view.  In passing, I might say it is very seldom a Private Member in a House of Parliament is able to say that, as a result of his introducing a Bill, he has within a short time succeeded in changing the law in two countries.  Like Deputy Sweetman, I was actively interested in the introduction of a measure similar to that introduced in England.  The object and purpose of the member who introduced the Private Bill originally was to cut out unnecessary waste of time, while at the same time retaining necessary protection.  Those who, like myself, have read the proceedings will have been amused by the description given by that member in his speeches throughout the debate.  He described very graphically the way time is wasted by furnishing receipts, bank officials turning over cheques and so on.</P>
      <P>I am very glad indeed we have got around to introducing legislation which will have the effect of cutting out unnecessary waste of time in industry, in legal circles and so on.  But I do agree with what Deputy Sweetman said, particularly on the section which makes the production of a cheque absolute evidence of the payment to the payee of the amount stated on the back of a cheque.  Possibly that can be discussed more fully on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>As regards the insurance practice, that again is a very good point.  He put it that we should keep in mind that the object of the Bill is to cut out unnecessary difficulties and waste of time, but we should be very careful that as a result of the Bill we do not do something which will involve fresh difficulties and waste of time which did not previously exist.</P>
      <P>For that reason, I wholeheartedly support the views put forward by Deputy Sweetman with regard to insurance practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel sure the Minister will be able to explain more fully in his reply to-day all the points which have been raised and that he will probably be able to meet the House on any points on which there is substantial resistance. Whether there would be substantial <Col N="956" /> resistance on something which is a legal point, I do not know, but it is one of great importance and one which we should like to be satisfied about before the Bill, in its present form, goes through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can make out, at the present time, the law does not compel a bank to see that a cheque is endorsed.  The banks could have proceeded on those lines, if they thought it wise to do so, but they felt they would be unprotected if they did, and that if a person took action against them afterwards, it would be evidence of neglect on their part, if they did not look for endorsement.  This Bill is brought in to give them that protection. Deputies will see that the Bill says that the fact that a cheque is not endorsed does not, in any way, lay them open to a charge of neglect and is the same protection which they would have, if they insisted on a cheque being endorsed. If we start from that point, the rest of the Bill is fairly easy to follow and explain.</P>
      <P>There is reference in the Bill to cheques handed over the counter.  The banks could, if they liked, accept a cheque over the counter for cash without asking for an endorsement, but it is not likely they will do so, because even in Great Britain, they have not gone that far.  In this case, it is very important that the law should be uniform in the two countries, because, in the first place, we have a good many branches of British-owned banks here, and there are a number of branches of Irish-owned banks operating in the Six Counties.  If there was not a uniform procedure, it would lead to a lot of confusion, at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned in introducing the Bill, if a person here pays to a person in the Six Counties a cheque in settlement of a fee and that person lodges the cheque to his account, the banks there are accustomed to accepting cheques of that sort without endorsement but when it comes back to Dublin to the paying bank, it cannot be accepted and it has to be sent back for endorsement.  That leads to a great deal of trouble and confusion and it is necessary for that reason to see that the law, so far as possible, is made <Col N="957" /> identical.  As there was no objection on our part to the law passed in England, there would be no objection to making it identical.</P>
    <P>With regard to specially endorsed cheques, the banks will, I understand, continue so long as their customers require them to do so, to insist on endorsement. Where special cheques are paid into a special account, they will insist on endorsement.  In the case of payment of rates, we are accustomed to being told that we should pay our rates into the account of Dublin Corporation, or Wexford County Council, as the case may be.  That cheque would, of course, have to be endorsed. If it were to be lodged to that account, I think it would have to be endorsed.</P>
    <P>There is another case which was mentioned by Deputy Sweetman &mdash; I also read the reference in the Royal Commission which he quoted &mdash; and that is where there is a special form of receipt on the back of the cheque which is not only a receipt of the money but a receipt of the money in full satisfaction.  It is the practice of the banks in England to insist on endorsement in that case, and the banks here say they will do the same, so long as their customers want it.  They are leaving that proviso; perhaps in five or six years' time, the customer will think he does not need it.</P>
    <P>The other point to which I want to refer is the point about evidence.  I do not know enough about the law to know exactly what Section 3 means. I have a fair idea of what <i>prima facie</i>, or conclusive, evidence means but I do not know what &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; means.  It is not conclusive, I take it; it can be produced in evidence, but, I take it, it can be rebutted, if there is a case for rebuttal.  Whether Deputy Sweetman thinks it is going too far to say that it is <i>prima facie</i> evidence, I do not know. As I say, I do not know enough about the law to answer that point.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Industrial Credit (Amendment)" RHead="Bill, 1959&mdash;Second Stage">
    <Title>Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, 1959&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies will, no doubt, recall that on the Second Stage of the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, 1958, I indicated the Government's determination to ensure that the resources of the Industrial Credit Company, Limited, would be ample to meet all reasonable requirements arising out of the financing of industry.  On that occasion, I assured industrialists that they could proceed with their plans in the knowledge that no industrial project with worthwhile prospects, particularly export prospects, need be frustrated by lack of capital.  The policy of allowing no soundly-based industrial project to fail, or to be prevented from starting, solely through lack of capital, is confirmed further in the Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
      <P>As shown in Appendix II to the White Paper, the Programme envisages the provision by the Industrial Credit Company of credit for industry amounting to £20 million in the years 1959-60 to 1963-64.  It is visualised that the company's capital expenditure will be at the rate of £3½ million in each of the years 1959-60 and 1960-61, £4 million per annum in 1961-62 and 1962-63, and as much as £5 million in 1963-64.  Thus, the company faces a much enlarged scale of activities over the next five years as compared with its previous level of operations.  In 1958-59 its capital expenditure amounted to £2.8 million and this included a funding of existing overdrafts to the extent of £1.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enhanced facilities now proposed, apart from assisting in the setting up of new industries, are intended to encourage the replacement of old machinery by up-to-date plant, the installation of additional machinery and, generally, the expansion and modernisation of industry.  The company's need for additional capital and borrowing is increased, too, by its decision to provide hire purchase facilities for industrial plant and <Col N="959" /> equipment on attractive terms.  It is now prepared to finance up to 75 per cent. of the cost of suitable new plant and machinery in this way.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the policy set out in paragraph 98 of the Programme for Economic Expansion now justifies, in the light of the Company's existing financial resources, the introduction of amending legislation to provide it with sufficient funds for the purposes of industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>The capital available to the Industrial Credit Company consists of an authorised share capital of £5 million and loan capital that may be raised under guarantee of the Minister for Finance within a statutory limit of £5 million.  The company could also raise further loan capital by means of debentures but in practice debentures would, in present circumstances, require to be backed by a State guarantee.  Up to the present, £3 million worth of share capital has been issued and paid up and is held almost entirely by the Minister for Finance. In addition, a loan of £1.8 million has been made by the banks under State guarantee.  This makes a total of £4.8 million which has already been invested in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>A further issue of share capital to the value of £250,000 is in the process of being arranged.  These shares will also be taken up by the Minister for Finance and the money issued in payment for them will be used to meet maturing commitments in respect of various projects.  The resources remaining available to the company will thus consist of £1.75 million of unissued share capital and the possibility of raising £3.2 million under State guarantee &mdash; a total of just under £5 million.  Against this, it already has commitments extending over the next five years amounting to more than £7 million.  Access to additional capital is, therefore, necessary to enable the Company to play its due part in economic expansion in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to allow of the enlargement of the company's resources by £15 million.  This, with the balance of about £5 million <Col N="960" /> which the company is already free to raise, would make up the total of £20 million forecast for the company in the Programme for Economic Expansion. It is proposed that the enlargement be effected by increasing the authorised share capital from £5 million to £10 million &mdash; an increase of £5 million&mdash; and by increasing the Company's effective borrowing powers from £5 million to £15 million &mdash; an increase of £10 million.  The increase in the company's borrowing powers involves enabling the Minister for Finance to guarantee, when necessary, such borrowings up to £15 million instead of up to £5 million as at present.</P>
    <P>Further, as loan capital may not always be readily available from banks and other institutions as and when required, it is proposed in the Bill to enable the Minister for Finance to make loans to the Company on such terms and conditions as to interest and repayment as he may stipulate.  It is intended, however, that such advances together with any sums borrowed by the company from other sources should not at any time exceed the proposed overall limit of the Company's borrowing powers, namely £15 million.</P>
    <P>The new legislation also affords an opportunity to effect some minor improvements in the existing law relating to the administration of the Industrial Credit Company.  These are effected in Section 6 (1) and (2) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is intended to place in the company's hands the means of accelerating future industrial progress.  The availability of necessary capital is, of course, only a beginning.  The capital must be wisely invested: this requires co-operation, initiative and enterprise from industrial promoters and workers alike.  It can then be expected to fructify and yield a continuing return of goods for sale at home and abroad, of jobs for the workers and profits for the promoters.</P>
    <P>The latest reports from the Industrial Credit Company indicate that the policy of providing adequate funds for industry is already bearing fruit.  This, indeed, may be gathered from the extent of the provision considered <Col N="961" /> necessary for 1959-60 &mdash; £3½ million. The company's activities have expanded appreciably and there has been an upsurge in demand for industrial credit. It is clear that the better services being provided are welcomed and appreciated by industrialists, and I feel that we can safely look forward to further expansion.  I should, perhaps, say that the facilities provided are available not only for public manufacturing and processing companies but also for private companies, partnerships and individuals engaged, or proposing to engage, in manufacturing activity. Enterprises large and small are, therefore, being catered for.</P>
    <P>The Board and staff of the Industrial Credit Company have a heavy task before them.  They are in one of the key positions in the drive forward on the industrial front.  The expansion of activities which has taken place, and the greater expansion to which we look forward, will necessarily give rise to many difficulties and problems.  I am sure Deputies will wish the company every success in its efforts on which so much depends.</P>
    <P>The legislation now proposed, if enacted, will take us a step further in the development of our country.  I hope the step will prove to be a significant one.  The Bill will, I trust, commend itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like a little more detail as to what was covered before in relation to the existing capital and the finances provided by the Industrial Credit Company.  What is envisaged in the future in terms of production projects, in terms of persons employed and in terms, <i>per capita</i>, of employed capital in the the business?  Let me say straight away that, in relation to the present Chairman of the Industrial Credit Company, I think the country is fortunate in having his ability, his efficiency and his boundless energy, I think, too, that the company has been considerably strengthened by the accretion to it of Dr. Mill, of Messrs. Guinness, and Mr. Thompson, of Cork. I say that because I want to make it clear that the criticisms I have to make are criticisms of a system rather than criticisms of a personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> I am not a bit happy about the manner in which the Minister proposes in future to deal with industrial credit. I do not know of any case in respect of which industrial credit was needed for any worthwhile project and that credit was not forthcoming.  With the resources of the Department behind him, can the Minister produce any single instance where a worthwhile project would have got ahead, had finances been made available to it, and in which finance was not made available to it?  I agree there may be some necessity for streamlining the method by which industrial financial facilities can be made available, but I am not aware of any project which has not started production because of lack of finance.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, there has been a tendency up to this to finance far too many industrial projects by bank loan rather than by equity share capital. That has been the case not merely in relation to initial projects but also in relation to the expansion of existing projects.  Whether it was as desirable a method as possible of financing the projects, it was certainly there as a method and I have yet to hear of a soundly based industrial project that did not go ahead because of the lack of finance.  I do not think the Minister will find in the records of his Department or in the records of the Industrial Credit Company any such project. While, therefore, it is right and proper that the Minister should make the case that he has made that there will be no such circumstance in future, it is equally right to make it clear that there has been no such case in the past.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a sequel to paragraphs 8 and 9 of Chapter 16, which deals generally with industry, of the booklet <i>Economic Development.</i>  We see in that that the £1.8 million to which the Minister referred, which was being provided by the commercial banks by way of guaranteed loan stock to the Industrial Credit Company was to be used by the company largely in redeeming existing overdrafts and directly financing liabilities under existing bank guarantees.  There is, therefore, nothing involved in that, in any shape, of new financing.  It is <Col N="963" /> merely transferring finance that has already been provided in one form to another form and that transference will not, of course, affect in any way existing industrial production, nor will the financing of liabilities under existing bank guarantees involve any new industrial production.  It is merely taking out of one pocket of the banks the moneys which they have provided under guarantee and providing it now, not under guarantee of the individual industry, but under the loan stock guarantee of the Industrial Credit Company.  If we are to be realistic, therefore, in considering the problem, we can completely disregard the transference of funds in that way.</P>
    <P>What really perturbs me, however, is the suggestion that the Industrial Credit Company was going to provide an unlimited, or a virtually unlimited, guarantee in one or two big cases. I do not think it right that the resources of the State should be pledged by the Industrial Credit Company to the extent that they have been pledged. Every effort that has been made to ascertain the extent to which the resources of the State have been pledged in connection with the Verholme Dockyard proposal in Cork has failed to get any light shed on the proposals.  We are all anxious to ensure that there would be proposals of that sort put into operation, provided we were satisfied that they were proposals that would fructify to the common good in the long run.</P>
    <P>The House and the country are entitled to know the extent to which the resources of the State are being pledged when it comes to an operation of that size.  I do not like a system under which the Industrial Credit Company, a State-sponsored company, can give guarantees, be they called guarantees or be they called umbrellas, of a size far and away in excess of the sum that is actually being provided by the Minister for Finance of the day without the Minister for Finance accepting the responsibility for that guarantee.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a guarantee given to anybody &mdash; and I use &ldquo;anybody&rdquo; in the corporate sense of the term &mdash; for a <Col N="964" /> matter of somewhere between £3,000,000 and £5,000,000, then I think that, once the negotiations have been concluded in relation to that guarantee, this House and the country are entitled to be told that the national resources have been pledged by a guarantee to that amount.  I do not think it right that a State-sponsored body of the sort which we are now discussing can, by a contingent guarantee, not merely pledge its own capital but, in effect, also pledge the Minister of the day to come to its assistance in relation to such a guarantee. Nobody would visualise for one second that if the Industrial Credit Company had given a guarantee which its own funds were unable to fulfil, the resources of the State would not be utilised to ensure that the word of the Industrial Credit Company would be fulfilled.  If, therefore, it is to operate by guarantee, it should only so operate by guarantee within specific limits and figures set by the person who will have ultimately to pay the piper if anything goes wrong and that will be whoever is Minister for Finance at the time.</P>
    <P>As the law stands at present, the present Taoiseach particularly, the Government and the Minister for Finance, take advantage of every opportunity to stress that the Industrial Credit Company is operating aside and apart from Government decision, that it is that company, and not the Government, that decides what financial support, and the extent of the financial support, will be given to different institutions and projects. There may be some argument for that approach in relation to actual cash advanced or to be advanced out of the existing resources of the company.  The Minister for Finance has made available to the company, or has undertaken to make available to the company, certain actual cash resources.  In the detailed application of those resources, I can see the case that it is for the company and the directors of the company to allot those resources but, when it comes to a big and wide guarantee over and above and in excess of the amount that has been made available by the Minister for Finance, it seems to me that we are travelling into an entirely different <Col N="965" /> sphere and that the State is being committed without those who are responsible from time to time for guiding the State being consulted and having acceptance of the contingent liability which may be thrown on the State in future.</P>
    <P>That principle appears to me to be utterly and entirely wrong, quite indefensible. The matter is one that should be dealt with by guarantee of that sort, being administratively more easy than the system of trade loan guarantee, but at the same time it should be clear that it is being done by the people who will ultimately have to pay the piper, that is to say the State, and not by a board or company which is being deliberately divorced by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance from the State administration.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

I endeavoured to do that before any licence was issued.  These licences would not have been issued at any time if we were satisfied that Irish oats suitable for milling purposes were available.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Taoiseach is leaving the House as he is the architect of this iniquitous system by which the Industrial Credit Company is allowed to be in the position of setting at nought the terms of this Bill. Let me draw the attention of the House to the limitation provided in Section 3 (1) (d) (i) of the Bill.  As the Minister indicated a few minutes ago, that provides that the limit of the share capital and the amounts raised by the Industrial Credit Company is to be £15,000,000.  However, it does not, in any way, according to the procedure <Col N="970" /> that has been adopted, limit the contingent liability which the Industrial Credit Company may take upon themselves, that whatever money may be advanced from time to time, or whatever money may be raised from time to time by the Industrial Credit Company by share capital or by loan stock, will be utilised by them and properly utilised by them for the purpose of the direct financing of industrial undertakings. But in addition to that the company has adopted the practice of making guarantees which, if the guarantees came home to roost, would far exceed the limitation that is included in this Bill and in the existing statutes. That is entirely wrong and in fact it is almost a breach of faith with the House.</P>
      <P>Every one of us agrees that the appropriate finance should be made available for any worthwhile project but it should be made available in the right way.  I am clear myself that there has been no project that was worthwhile that has failed to materialise because of lack of finance.  Finance may have been provided in different ways that were not so desirable as this way, I agree, but finance has always been provided.  However, where a State-sponsored body is committing itself to more than the limit of its commitments as provided by the Oireachtas, even though that commitment is only contingent, it is, in my view, a breach of the spirit and of the letter of the Act which sets it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a much more frank approach to this situation.  I appreciate there must be the confidential inquiries and negotiations that go on from time to time until a project becomes a reality and until the provision of finance or the provision of a guarantee becomes a reality.  Once the provision of finance has become an actual fact then there must be the acknowledgement of the provision that it is the State and the taxpayer who are providing that finance, be it actual or be it contingent under guarantee.  Once public money has been committed to an expenditure &mdash; and public rumour has it it has been committed in the Cork case &mdash; there is an obligation on the Minister and on the Industrial Credit Company to tell the House and <Col N="971" /> the country of the commitments that have been entered into.</P>
    <P>It is not right that commitments of the sort and size that have been made in that respect should be made without this House being told that they have been entered into.  It is not right that commitments of that size, totalled up with the other umbrella or contingent guarantee commitments that have been made, should exceed, with the capital already advanced, the limitations provided in an Act.  It would be far better for the future sound basing of Irish industrial finance that there would be frankness in this respect and that there would not be the effort that is being made up to this to hide the facts in relation to it. It would be far better for the industry concerned and for future industries as well.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, said that, in his view, that could not be done because it would mean the Government would be taking political responsibility for something in regard to which they had not the political choice in the determination of the grant or of the provision of finance. I do not agree.  I do not agree that there is any question of political responsibility if the Board of the Industrial Credit Company are going on their own initiative.  If they are not going on their own responsibility, they can only be going on the responsibility of the Government in which circumstances it is only right that the situation should be publicised.</P>
    <P>When the trade loan arrangements were being abolished we were specifically told here that the reason for the abolition of the trade loan procedure was not the publicity when the loan had been given but the cumbersome method of arriving at a decision as to whether a trade loan was warranted or not.  I agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the procedure coming up to the point of decision in relation to a loan under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts was cumbersome but there were the further tabling provisions in these Acts and it was not <Col N="972" /> suggested at that time that one of the things that the new practice was going to do was to avoid that publicity.  I think it would be bad that it should be avoided.</P>
    <P>I also wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the provisions in paragraph 9 of the Chapter on industry in <i>Economic Development.</i>  Up to this a great deal of our industrial finance has been provided by bank loan overdrafts rather than by the provision of finance through public issues.  The chapter to which I have referred draws attention to the possibility of operating unit trusts in Ireland to be sponsored by the Industrial Credit Company.  It also draws attention to the fact that in other countries unit trusts of that sort, and savings movements within the factories concerned, give those employed an opportunity of taking an interest in their own concern and therefore in their own job.</P>
    <P>There has been far too much holding of Irish industrial shares as a permanency rather than the free byplay of purchase and sale that would have the effect of procuring here an industrial share market.  If one wants to buy the Irish industrial shares of the great majority of Irish concerns, for a considerable time there may not be any shares on offer for sale. Similarly if one wants to sell them, for a considerable time there may not be anyone on hand to purchase.  It is that lack of fluidity that has contributed in no little degree to there being a lack of <i>entrepreneur</i> capital for industrial concerns which was met therefore by bank overdraft accommodation.</P>
    <P>It was also contributed to by the desire of many people who bought such shares to continue to hold them and to the fact that they did not ever change out of them; therefore shares did not come on the market.  But it was somewhat of a circle.  The reason they did hold them was because there were not buyers and the reason there were not buyers was that the shares did not come into the market.  The formation of a unit trust here for Irish industrial shares would materially improve that position.  It would probably do more than anything else to create an industrial share market of <Col N="973" /> real dimensions.  If such is to be formed in this country, then it seems to me that it can only be done through a lead being given by the Industrial Credit Company such as is suggested in the paragraph of <i>Economic Development</i> to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, when introducing this Bill, not only to do so in terms of monetary limits but also in terms of the class of production involved, what employment was hoped for and what amount of capital per employee was likely to be necessary, in modern parlance.  In relation to the discussion we had this morning on the Undeveloped Areas Bill for Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Development Authority, it appeared that somewhere between £1,150 and £1,200 has to be sunk in any undertaking for the employment of one man or, to be more strictly accurate, one person, because the figures we got did not indicate whether it was male, female or juvenile employment.</P>
    <P>Whether it is male, female or juvenile, it does make it clear that the amount that has to be found from industrial enterprise in order to provide employment is a very substantial amount indeed.  It also makes it certain that when we are getting into a project of any substantial size, the amount by way of guarantee may be very substantial indeed.  When it is as substantial as that, this House and the country as a whole have a right to be told the amount of the taxpayers' money that is being pledged in excess of the amounts permitted by statute for direct financing operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer first to the extent to which the capital of the Industrial Credit Company is being increased under this Bill.  The Bill also provides that the company shall have power to raise and borrow moneys at any particular time to an amount not exceeding £15 million.  I should like to ask the Minister how soon he anticipates that the new capital resources, which have been put at the disposal of the company by this Bill, will be invested by the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible, of course, to put down <Col N="974" /> any particular figure in a Bill of this kind and not to relate the amount so put down to the anticipated demands on the company for such finance for new enterprises.  Is this figure for new powers of borrowing based upon an examination of the anticipated demands on the company within the next two, three or five years?  Is it likely that the company will, in fact, be able to invest this money in one enterprise or another within a particular period and, if so, perhaps the Minister could tell us how long he thinks the new capital will be available to enable the company to carry on its financing activities?</P>
    <P>The second point I want to raise is somewhat similar to that raised by Deputy Sweetman, that is, the position of the Industrial Credit Company in respect of guarantees.  I submitted a question for answer next week to ascertain the extent of the State loan or State guarantee given in respect of a certain enterprise which has indicated its intention of going into production here.  It seems to be difficult to ascertain to what extent the Industrial Credit Company has, in fact, committed itself by guarantee given in its name.  I should like to know from the Minister what is behind that policy. Is there any reason why the Industrial Credit Company, having given a guarantee on behalf of the taxpayers, should not indicate, once the guarantee has been given, that, in fact, it has been so given?</P>
    <P>I can understand the necessity for reticence and even secrecy when the negotiations to secure a guarantee for the company are taking place, but once the Industrial Credit Company has, in fact, given a guarantee, has pledged the credit of itself, the Government and the community and having laid the taxpayers open to the possibility that, by a raid on their pockets, the guarantee will have to be fulfilled, is there any reason why the Industrial Credit Company should not disclose publicly the fact that it has committed itself to a guarantee?</P>
    <P>After all, State moneys are involved in this matter and I think that the minimum the public are entitled to ask is that they should know the extent of <Col N="975" /> their commitment.  I do not know how far the policy adopted by the I.C.C. has Governmental approval or whether it is a policy which the I.C.C. has adopted of its own volition.  I should like the Minister to tell us what is behind this policy and what is the reason why the Dáil and the community generally cannot be appraised of the fact that the nation's credit has been committed in respect of guarantees given to private enterprise by the Industrial Credit Company.  Perhaps the Minister could answer these two questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow the point already made about the particular guarantee in question. I raise it on this occasion because it is almost impossible to get an informative answer on this matter through a Parliamentary Question.  I referred to this matter during the course of the debate on the Undeveloped Areas Bill during the past couple of days.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said it was not usual in financial transactions for finance houses or institutions to disclose details of transactions of that sort.</P>
      <P>Surely, that is missing the point entirely?  This is not a normal finance transaction and the Industrial Credit Company is not an ordinary finance institution.  The moneys, as Deputy Norton said, are provided here by means of a statutory guarantee and are moneys raised from the public as a result of the statutory provisions governing the Industrial Credit Company and which will be further increased by this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, reasonable that the matter should be treated delicately while negotiations are being conducted, but it surely is unreasonable to withhold information from the public as to the extent of a guarantee in respect of a project, more especially when the promoters are foreigners.  Nobody questions the ability or capacity of the person concerned with this Cork Dockyard proposal but we want something more than the capacity, the ability or skill of an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it only right that the House <Col N="976" /> should be given full information concerning the extent to which moneys have been provided by the Industrial Credit Company on foot of a statutory authority for a transaction of this sort.  It is generally recognised that in a normal transaction between any finance institution, banking establishment or other finance corporation, if the matter were arranged as a normal business transaction, there would be no obligation on the parties concerned to disclose anything to the public, but this is entirely different. This money is being provided by the State.  Because it is raised in a particular way does not alter that fact and it is important, from the point of view of gaining public confidence, that full information should be made available.  In fact, people would much more readily assent to an arrangement of this sort, if they knew all the facts.  The rumours about this matter are varied, and of course no one is expected to believe all of them, but there would be far fewer rumours if more information were available.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know when it is expected that this proposed extension of financial facilities will be absorbed in particular cases, what major immediate commitments are involved and if the Minister can give us an indication of the type of industry which it is expected will be financed as a result of the extended provisions here.  I should also like to know to what extent extensions will be made of existing business, and what new businesses are concerned or contemplated under it, and if the Minister can give any indication of the expected employment content under both of these headings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word on a point mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Norton and Deputy Sweetman.  Personally, I would object strongly to interfering with the principle that the activities of a statutory body, such as the Industrial Credit Company, should not be open to investigation by way of Parliamentary Question.  I agree that there is, or appears to be, a case here for securing information with regard to the financing of projects.  I think the main <Col N="977" /> reason for endeavouring to secure that information is that the public have reason to believe that the finance concerned is of a very substantial nature and I take it that our curiosity as Deputies would not be aroused to the same extent if we had reason to believe that the money so advanced to outside companies or interests was of a comparatively minor nature.</P>
      <P>The trouble, as I see it, is if this body gave way to the request to give information of this type, where do we draw the line because in the case of a £2,000,000, £3,000,000, or £4,000,000 loan, certainly I think it is in the public interest that information should be given, but not in the way suggested. Even if it were a question of a half a million pound loan, or a loan of £100,000, we would still want information. I think you would cut largely across the effective operations of the Industrial Credit Company if its activities were to be scrutinised and made available by way of question in this House.</P>
      <P>Personally, I think the Industrial Credit Company should not deal with transactions of this type at all, that if it is a question of a major industrial undertaking, involving several million pounds of the taxpayers' money, the matter should be dealt with by the Minister under some form of State guarantee, or something akin to the old trade loan section in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  If we feel the Industrial Credit Company is being used or is using its powers to cloak up very substantial advances to any interests, either inside or outside the country, it would be far better to attack the question by changing the procedure for advancing these substantial sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question which I should like to ask is: is there any association of any kind between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Industrial Credit Company?  Is the company a completely independent statutory body, free from any suggestion of encouragement, direction or influence by the Minister?  I am not saying that in reference to the present Minister but to any Minister whoever he happens to be, because one of its advantages was <Col N="978" /> that it was to be free to operate as any ordinary lending business and to conduct its business in private and uninfluenced by political or any other considerations.  Perhaps he would satisfy me on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear what the Minister has to say as to the limitations which he thinks are right to put on the ability of the legislature to get information about the borrowing of public money.  There is undoubtedly a dilemma here and it is not easy to see how best it can be overcome.  The Minister himself, I think, will admit that it would be an astonishing proposition that it should be in the power of any agent of Oireachtas Éireann to lend, on the people's behalf, several million pounds of public money and yet to disclaim all liability to provide Oireachtas Éireann with any information about such a transaction.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to concede that while a matter of that kind is under negotiation, a certain discretion is necessary, but it does appear clear that at some stage Oireachtas Éireann should be informed.  Otherwise, the traditional power of Parliament to control finance, which is the ultimate sanction that Parliament holds over the heads of the Executive, appears to be virtually cancelled and we drift further and further into the position of the Executive coming to Parliament and saying: &ldquo;We want a general authority to lend £20,000,000 or £25,000,000 or £50,000,000 without giving Parliament any information, good, bad or indifferent&rdquo;. I do not think that principle should be or could be conceded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago, I mentioned to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce that it would be a prudent thing to communicate fully to the House the facts concerning the Verolme Dockyard construction agreement.  On that occasion, the Taoiseach said that the position was that there was a sum of somewhere between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000 involved.  The principals desired to supply it from Dutch sources but informed our Government that it was not impossible the Dutch Government would impose exchange restrictions which would make it impossible to <Col N="979" /> transfer capital to this country and that our Government, through the Industrial Credit Company, informed the Verolme interests that we would hold an umbrella over their heads in the shape of an undertaking to provide from our resources any capital the Verolme interests required and which they are prevented from taking out of Holland by the action of their own Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said on that occasion that he was not in a position to give any further information as to the actual facilities for the transfer of capital and we did not know what the outcome was going to be.  I want to suggest that either we know now, or the Minister should tell us when we will know, and inform the House what the ultimate outcome of that transaction was, and whether he has in contemplation any other transactions of that dimension under the general powers conferred on the Industrial Credit Company by the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to make another submission to the Minister for Finance.  Whenever we come to discuss the provision of employment in this country, we seem to concentrate almost entirely on newcomers to the ranks of employers. Now, I do not think I am wrong in saying that 80 per cent. of my neighbours in this country are employed and have been employed by people who have been in business of one kind or another for the past half century, and I am sure that considerable army of employers, who employ 50 men here or 100 men there, has abundant scope for expansion; but certainly in respect of a great number of them, particularly of private firms, the problem is that if they borrow money wherewith to expand, they never can pay it back because by the time they have paid interest on their borrowings, and income tax on their ascertained profits, there is nothing left to reduce the capital sum.</P>
    <P>Ask any employer of labour in this country who has sought to expand by raising a bank overdraft or raising a loan and I think he will tell you that he curses the day he ever went into debt <Col N="980" /> for that purpose, because, from that day forward, from whatever profits he realises from the expansion of his business, after allowances have been made for the payment of extra labour hired, for the payment of interest on the money borrowed, and of income tax and corporation profits tax on the profit earned, there has been nothing left wherewith to redeem the capital sum borrowed.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister for Finance that without any permanent injury to the Exchequer a vast ocean of capital could be provided for the development of employment &mdash; and mind you, there is a great deal of employment given in this country which is not commonly described as industrial employment, in transport, and in distribution.  Many people forget that the distribution industry in this country probably employs as many people as any other industry, or more people, but nobody has any respect for it.  Yet, without distribution machinery, without marketing machinery, no other form of industrial activity is of any value because there is no use in producing stuff if you cannot sell, and you cannot sell on the home market, if you have not a distributing system to bridge the gap between the potential consumers and the goods produced.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister that there is a vast ocean of capital available for expansion of existing industries, and existing businesses which provide employment, if it were possible to say to a person, to companies particularly, private and public: &ldquo;Your profits will not be taxed until they are distributed.  If you retain in your business, for the purpose of expansion, half of your annual profits, they will not be liable to taxation, but, if you distribute half of your annual profits, you will have to pay tax on that.&rdquo;  If the investment is productive, and it is a reasonable assumption that no firm, public or private, will invest its own money in a losing transaction, you may postpone the Exchequer's harvest for two, three, four or five years, but, sooner or later, the increased investment which a firm undertakes in its own business will yield increased profit, and a time will ultimately come when <Col N="981" /> that profit will yield revenues to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Mind you, instead of encouraging dozens or twenties of <i>entrepreneurs</i> who may be encouraged by the provisions of this Bill, if you do that, you will encourage hundreds, and even thousands, of small employers in this country to undertake investment of that character, because, if they borrow in order to finance expansion, they have immediately within prospect the means of redeeming their borrowings and delivering themselves from the burden of standing charges which remains upon them, unless or until they can liquidate the capital commitments they have entered into.</P>
    <P>I should be interested to hear from the Minister for Finance if we could not supplement the provisions of this analogous Bill by a step of the kind I suggest to him, because I believe you take off the responsibility of the Industrial Credit Company 50 per cent. of the burden that the company ought to be bearing, but is not bearing, because so many firms in this country are reluctant to go to a body of this character and argue the toss with them about getting an accommodation under the terms proposed by the Industrial Credit Company.  Every merchant or every small <i>entrepreneur</i> in this country is on terms of relative familiarity with his bankers.  They know as much about him as anybody is ever likely to know and, therefore, if they go to their bankers and get accommodation, they are dealing on a basis of mutual confidence.  It may be old-fashioned.  It may be reprehensible in these days of jet propulsion that a family business is not willing to sit down with some august body of this kind to chew the rag about what they regard as their personal affairs, and to argue the toss as to whether they might be operating their business on more efficient methods and up-to-date procedure.</P>
    <P>Old-established firms are inclined to say: &ldquo;That is our business.  We know the way to run our business in the special circumstances in which we find it.&rdquo;  Modern and up-to-date accountants and officials in a body of this character may take a different view. Bankers who have been dealing with <Col N="982" /> old established businesses for generations are very often better equipped to understand that these businesses are best run by the people who know how to run them.  I think it is these businesses that can provide a great deal of employment in this country at the present time, and in which there is a much bigger potential reservoir of employment than you will get out of new enterprises set up under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I often wonder what is this House interested in.  I am not interested in bringing tycoons to this country for their own sake.  The only interest I have is to see industrial enterprise operated in this country, and to see good employment provided for my neighbours at decent rates of wages in their own country, so that nobody will be constrained to leave this country involuntarily because he cannot find work at home.  I have always the feeling that the Taoiseach and some of his colleagues are in some kind of way bewitched by the dream of seeing chimneys belching smoke all over the place, large buildings, and brouhaha of one kind or another.  They are not interested if work is quietly provided at fair wages for working people, without any dramatic externals associated with the employment provided.  I am solely interested in the employment because I am convinced that permanent employment must be indissolubly associated with profitable occupation and I am certain there is an immense reservoir of potential employment at decent rates of wages of a permanent character for people here if existing firms in the country were given the only effective encouragement to expand to which they will promptly and energetically respond and that is the exemption of company profits from taxation except at the point of distribution.</P>
    <P>I think it true to say that the Industrial Credit Company and those associated with it within the limit of the discretion conferred upon them are an admirable body and within the functions they undertook to discharge they have done a very good job.  Certainly, any failures that have attended their efforts were not due to any want of effort on their part and it is gratifying to find that a body of that character <Col N="983" /> deservedly receives the approbation of all sides of the House for the work put into the job assigned to them.  I think it would be a terrible pity if, in a situation where everybody is prepared to applaud their exertions, they are now manipulated into the ambiguous position of becoming a conduit pipe for large credit transactions of which this House knew nothing and in respect of which certain elements in the House had the gravest doubts as to the expediency and propriety of their grant.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to consider the proposal I make for the expansion of the kind of credit which is capable of providing employment here and now, but I was never surer of anything than that the proposal I now make will produce a more rapid expansion of employment than any project which can be effectively promoted by the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman at the beginning of his speech wanted to make it perfectly clear that any criticism he had to offer was not directed against the Board and he complimented the Chairman and welcomed the two new members of the Board. These are sentiments I heartily endorse. I think these gentlemen have given great service to the country and they are to be congratulated for their hard work on this Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred in my opening speech to a statement I made before that I should like to make certain that no worth-while project would fail to mature for want of finance.  I think Deputy Sweetman took that as meaning that I had in mind that such projects had failed to mature in the past. I was rather thinking of the future and saying that, although the programme appears to be very big, I should still like to give that guarantee that no project would fail for want of finance. In that connection I might answer the question put by Deputy Norton&mdash; when was it likely that this money would be used by the company?  I said in my opening statement that the estimate for this year and the next year was £3½ million each year and for <Col N="984" /> the following two years £4 million each year and for the fifth year £5 million.  That is how the £20 million is made up.  I referred also to the fact that the Banks had advanced £1.8 million by way of loan to the Credit Company last year.  He said that largely went to pay bank overdrafts and therefore made no material difference. To a large extent, that is true. £1.4 million went to pay bank overdrafts so that, if you like, there was £1.4 million of new money.  But on the other hand it is now a loan which may extend for 32 years or may be paid off somewhat within that term.  I think anybody in business would like to feel that if he had money he would not be pressed for it in six months' or twelve months' time but that he could make his plans to liquidate that amount over a certain number of years.  Otherwise, it is preferable to have this rather than what was there before.  It is a significant change.</P>
    <P>I am not able to answer the questions as to what is the production expected from the projects before the Industrial Credit Company at present, where loans have been promised or commitments entered into or where they are under consideration.  I do not know if they will be able to give me that information in a manner in which it could be intelligibly presented in regard to what employment might be given.  However, I shall try to get some idea of that and see if the information can be supplied.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the difficulties of providing capital, Deputy Dillon also pointed out the difficulties of an ordinary business in repaying capital if it had to pay interest on a loan and corporation profits tax.  When a business man complains too much about corration profits tax I always think that he must at least have something left to meet a loan of that kind. The suggestion made by Deputy Dillon with regard to taxing only the distributed profits and leaving the undistributed profits behind is one, of course, that has received very much consideration.  The question has even been put to me as Minister for Finance on more than one occasion and I had to go very fully into it&mdash;I am not sure if it was for last year's Budget <Col N="985" /> or that of the year before&mdash;and look at all the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons.</i>  It was a question that received great consideration and it created a great deal of difference of opinion between those who were arguing the point.  Being a non-technician, I thought the only thing I could safely do was to leave things as they are.  That only applied to that particular time.  I am quite sure the question will be raised again. I may be wrong, but I should like to say to Deputy Dillon that the British tried out this idea and found it was not a very good arrangement.  That may be too general a statement but I think the Deputy will find the experience in Britain, at any rate, was against it.  At the moment I would not be able to say why.  It is a question that has been fully considered and will be considered again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked a question about guarantees.  I am not sure whether he was talking there of guarantees between the State and the Company or guarantees between the Company and the State through somebody else.  Any guarantee made by the State will be published and has to be published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is a question of the Company giving guarantees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Guarantees by the Company need not be published and, in fact, are not published, I think, under the present system.  Deputy Russell asked whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce had any control over the Industrial Credit Company. He has not.  He may have his own views about a new industry, which may be discussed with him by the Industrial Development Authority or by officials of his Department; but when the case goes to the Industrial Credit Company it is for their consideration alone.  He does not even appoint the Board.  It is the Minister for Finance who appoints the Board. At least, the Minister for Finance appoints the majority of the Board&mdash;I think it is four&mdash;and the minority three are appointed by the shareholders; but as the Minister for Finance is the principal shareholder, he <Col N="986" /> appoints them, too.  The answer, therefore, is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no particular control over that Company.</P>
      <P>The big question referred to by many Deputies here is whether it is right that the Industrial Credit Company should maintain secrecy in issuing a big loan for a particular proposition&mdash;it does not matter what the proposition is.  There are, of course, two points of view on that and we should assume, I suppose, while we are discussing this question, that we have an honest point of view on both sides.  In regard to this particular dockyard, rumour has it that they got or were promised a very big loan by the Credit Company.  Deputies speak of allaying public fears, that to satisfy the public confidence the facts should be disclosed.  It is bad from the point of view of public confidence to make too much of this, because the public will probably come to the conclusion that there is something there which should be hidden for some reason other than the ordinary rules which apply to credit transactions.  I do not think there is any reason for anyone thinking that.  I do not know the full facts myself, but I have a fair idea of what they are.  I do not think there is any reason for anyone to be troubled about this from the national point of view.</P>
      <P>I read what the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the time said, when this question was put to him.  I think his argument was that we set this Company up, and we put State money into it, because we wanted a body of that kind to deal with the financing of industry and with new projects of that kind.  We gave them absolute freedom&mdash;well, I suppose there are certain limits under which they must work, but we gave them as much freedom as any bank has to deal with projects of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We set them up as an independent body.  There is no such thing as any reference to any Minister for approval of that kind.  They have absolute discretion to deal with any project, to make loans as they think fit, to give guarantees or purchase shares and do all the various other things, entirely <Col N="987" /> on their own discretion.  That being so, I think what we attempted to do in this House was to set up, as it were, another bank to deal with a certain type of business only.  We put State money at the disposal of that credit organisation and then let them do the best they can.  From that point of view, we must come to the conclusion that they should be treated in the same way as any other credit institution.  I think we all agree that a credit institution is bound by many considerations, one of which certainly is to keep its transactions confidential.  I do not think there is any doubt about that.  We would be doing a great deal of injury to this organisation, and in turn to the idea of building up new industrial projects here, if we were to make public the method by which any particular industry here was financed.</P>
    <P>One may say, of course, that this is reported to be a particularly big loan and that there is a big amount of money involved.  However, if we publish all the facts of this case, all anybody has to do in future is to send out a rumour.  I am not saying a rumour was sent out by anyone in this case.  I said at the beginning that I am assuming that everyone is perfectly honest in this case.  If we adopt the suggestion made, all any person or group would have to do would be to start a rumour that there was a shady transaction taking place and then we would be forced to give all the particulars. We would be driven from case to case, until everything would have to be published about everything, as time went on.  I put it to Deputies that, from that point of view, it is not only undesirable to do this but it is a dangerous thing to do.  I believe it is dangerous.</P>
    <P>There may be a stage at which these things could be published.  I do not know, I have not thought over that at all.  I know that Deputies here have made it very plain that they would not require publication during negotiations, or even during the time when an industry would be set up, but that publication should be made at some stage.  On that point, I must say that I have not given it any <Col N="988" /> thought.  It was only, as it were, when this case was raised, that I looked at the file and I found that this thing was raised.  As I said, I looked at how it was dealt with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time. I thought he had dealt with it well and certainly I would agree with what he said.</P>
    <P>As for the other point, whether the facts could be revealed at some future time, that was not referred to and, therefore, I think no thought was given to it and I could not really say anything on that particular point. Deputies will understand that if I were to think about something of that kind, the first body I would have to consult would be the Credit Company themselves.  They might have very strong views or they might not. I do not know, and I cannot say any more on that point at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, may I ask one question on this point?  He has made reference to the way financial institutions conduct their business.  As far as I know, these are private companies, operating on private capital.  In this particular case, the Industrial Credit Company is operating on the people's capital. Surely the people are entitled to know on what horse their money is?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's point that the people are the shareholders in this concern, the Deputy may be a shareholder in the Bank of Ireland&mdash;I hope he is&mdash;but has he any right to ask the Bank of Ireland how much they gave such and such a person?  The Bank would tell him to mind his own business.  Why has the State to give information of this kind, any more than a bank to an ordinary shareholder?  I am speaking from the point of view that the people own the money.  I do not think that is making a good case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that analogy not wrong from this point of view?  Any shareholder of the Bank of Ireland, if the bank's Irish assets are not sufficient to meet a guarantee cannot be called on for anything further.  He has a limited liability.  If the assets of <Col N="989" /> the Industrial Credit Company are not sufficient to meet a guarantee, then clearly it is a State institution and the taxpayer has to meet the difference.</P>

I promise to give the matter consideration in the future to see if anything can be done in that way.</P>

Various sums of money were mentioned to me.  One was mentioned to me on that occasion; others have been mentioned since.  Everybody wishes the project well.  There is no question of any disputation about the matter.  The Minister ought to make the position clear in this case because it has become such a focal point of discussion.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish Córas Tráchtála as a statutory board to carry on the functions of promoting, assisting and developing exports at present carried on by Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, which is to be wound up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> Since its establishment as a limited company in 1951 C.T.T., with the assistance of annual Grants-in-Aid, has filled a very important role in our economic life by stimulating interest in exports and by giving to exporting firms assistance without which they would have in many cases found it extremely difficult, if not impossible to export.  Amongst the ways in which the company helps exporters are the investigation in detail of export market prospects, sending trade advisers to overseas countries to carry out market investigations on the spot, watching for openings for Irish products in foreign markets, organising collective marketing plans, supplying importers in overseas countries with information on Irish goods, advising on channels of distribution, methods of salesmanship and on the selection of agents.  The company also arranges participation in trade fairs and in addition it provides publicity for Irish goods overseas through Press, television and radio.</P>
    <P>The results achieved by the company were reviewed by the Government in connection with the preparation of the programme of economic expansion.  The Government were satisfied that it was in the national interest to maintain as a permanent feature of our industrial policy an organisation specifically charged by the Oireachtas with the task of advising exporters and potential exporters and, where necessary, the appropriate Ministers, on all aspects of export development.  Accordingly the introduction of legislation to establish Córas Tráchtála as a permanent State agency for the promotion of exports was announced in the White Paper on economic expansion.</P>
    <P>The establishment of Córas Tráchtála as a statutory body will add considerably to its standing and authority in implementing a long term policy of export development.  It will also influence and increase that confidence which is necessary for the developing of new types of goods as well as increased quanities of existing goods for export.  Córas Tráchtála's ability to contribute towards the realisation of the programme for economic expansion <Col N="992" /> in the export field will undoubtedly be strengthened by this measure.</P>
    <P>I confidently commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>One matter that the Minister did not refer to in the course of his speech was how it is proposed to finance the new company to be set up when this Bill is passed.  I understand from the Schedule that it is proposed to transfer the property and liability of the existing company to C.T.T. and to that extent it may have a certain initial foundation.  I should be glad, however, to hear from the Minister what arrangements will be made for permanent financial backing.</P>
      <P>This company has done very useful work since it was established and has helped many individual traders and companies in getting markets and in facilitating them in developing trade. While that has been the case, I wonder to what extent the work of this company has been impeded by Government policy in other directions.  I referred to this matter on a previous occasion, but I want to do so again now, because if there was ever a case of one hand not knowing what the other was doing, it is evident in some of the figures published in the booklet, <i>Economic Development.</i>  It concerns one of the most valuable export trades which we had and which I hope, as a result of efforts being made, is again growing.</P>
      <P>On page 170 of <i>Economic Development,</i> figures are given for the export of spirits, mainly whiskey, in the three pre-war years, 1937, 1938 and 1939. These figures show that in those years a total of 230,000 gallons a year with an average annual value of £179,000 was exported.  Details are then given of the countries, the quantities and the value in each case.  Then we come to the post-war period and we find that the export of whiskey grew steadily from 1948 to 1951, reaching a peak in that year of 438,000 gallons, valued at £558,000.  It goes on to say that they declined steeply in the next three years but have since begun to recover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you examine the exports for 1951 and contrast them with the figure for 1954, you find they were less than half <Col N="993" /> in 1954 what they were in 1951.  There was a subsequent recovery in 1956 and 1957 and I gather from some recent information that that trend is continuing.  Here is the real kernel of the matter.  Córas Tráchtála were provided last year with a special sum of £25,000, in addition to the money which was provided by the distillers who were concerned to develop the market for whiskey abroad.  At the same time the effect of taxation in the 1952 Budget, and for the next couple of years, was such that it depressed the whole export trade in whiskey.</P>
    <P>I know it may be argued that exports of spirits are not liable to taxation, but the fact that exports dropped substantially is clear evidence of the deterring and retarding effect which heavy taxation on spirits has had on this old-established industry.  It is an industry which gives male employment, uses raw materials which are home-grown and home-produced, and provides a manufactured article second to none in quality.</P>
    <P>I notice that one of the specific responsibilities assigned to the new Board is that &ldquo;it shall be the duty of the Board to advise the Minister on matters affecting or in any way connected with the development of exports&rdquo;.  I hope that when this new Board is set up, it will quite freely tender advice to the Minister, and through him, to the Government.  It is bad national policy, on the one hand, to have a special board or company charged with the responsibility of developing exports and, on the other hand, the effect of Government policy operating to depress that industry and reduce rather than expand the exports concerned.  I mention that because I believe it is a good example.  I do not say that there are not a number of other comparable examples but that certainly is one.  Another example which was referred to on a previous occasion was our valuable export trade in biscuits.  Happily, recent information on that matter shows an improvement again.  Surely it is to the advantage of a company of this sort that it should advise and investigate, and supply information on the various factors which affect the trade and which <Col N="994" /> limit or facilitate, as the case may be, the development of the trade.</P>
    <P>One of the problems confronting firms in this country is that a great number of them are small firms.  Some of them are family businesses run by individuals and their resources are limited.  We have had experience of traders making efforts to get into the export market and finding administrative or other obstacles put in their way and then, for one reason or another, they had not sufficient resources available to pursue the matter sufficiently vigorously, or they had not available to them the technical advice or assistance necessary if they are to develop a technique of getting into the foreign market.</P>
    <P>While this country has a number of trade agreements with foreign markets&mdash;I have in mind our agreements with Continental countries&mdash;in all those agreements, the balance of trade is heavily adverse, so far as we are concerned.  While on paper an agreement may entitle us to facilities or to the right to send goods into these markets, nevertheless, in practice, on occasions we have found administrative difficulties put in the way of individual traders, or some other restrictive practice applied, which prevented exporters from getting a foothold in the market concerned.</P>
    <P>In matters of this sort, a body such as C.T.T. can be of invaluable assistance and it has, I believe, helped many people very considerably since it was established in 1951.  It was originally established as a result of the findings of a committee which was set up by the first inter-Party Government. After very careful consideration, that committee recommended its establishment.  Steps were being taken to have it established when there was a change of Government and the succeeding Government proceeded with its establishment.  Since then, I believe that decision has been more than justified, and the work which Córas Tráchtála has carried out has reflected credit on the Director and staff of that organisation.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that when it is established on a more permanent basis, when its functions are set out <Col N="995" /> as they are being set out in this measure and when the company has statutory recognition, the full potentia-utilised of this organisation will be utilised to the maximum extent by all concerned with developing their export trade and that in whatever sphere they are this board will be in a position to assist them; but, on the other hand, I hope the board itself will freely express its views to the Government, or anyone else, on all the steps or measures that should be taken to develop our export trade, and that they will say what factors they consider are militating against the proper development of the export trade of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is possible for the Minister to give any indication of the volume and value of exports developed as a result of the initiative or efforts of Córas Tráchtála.  That information may be difficult to give because some of their activities are additional or ancillary to the individual efforts of traders and companies.  If, however, some indication could be given of the extent of the exports which have been developed as a result of the activities of Córas Tráchtála, it might be of interest.  Some matters may arise on the Committee Stage and further consideration of the measure can be deferred until that Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Cosgrave said, the C.T.T. organisation came into existence as a result of a committee set up during the period 1948 to 1951 to ascertain the possibilities of exports to the dollar market so that we might earn urgently required dollars to pay for portion of our imports from the dollar area.  As a result of the recommendations made by that committee, C.T.T. was crystallised into its present form.  For some years past the question of giving it a statutory basis and allowing it to function as a statutory body has been under consideration.  Pressure of other business of a more important character resulted in delay in giving effect to that proposal.  Beyond its conversion from a non-statutory to a statutory basis, this Bill does not, in fact affect its over-all activities to any extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> My main purpose in intervening in this discussion is to pay tribute to C.T.T. for the very valuable work it has done, not merely in the general national interest but also on behalf of a number of enterprising firms which have been encouraged to go into the export market.  Before C.T.T. was established, there was no single organisation which could tell one that it had carried out market surveys or that it had made any gains in promotional activities in foreign markets, so far as Irish goods were concerned.  There was no single organisation to which a business firm could go in order to ascertain what were the procedures associated with exports to foreign countries.  As a result of the establishment of C.T.T., all that work was taken in hands.</P>
    <P>C.T.T. studied the problem of what a foreign customer wants, in quality, in style, and in packaging.  It studied the customs and import regulations in a vast variety of countries in which we either had no trade at all or trade of a microscopic character.  By dint of sustained effort, it was able to build itself into an expert organisation which knew the complexities of trading with foreign countries, the difficulties of currency regulations, the difficulties embodied in the simple phrase &ldquo;c.i.f.&rdquo; and the interpretation it had in the different countries. It learned, too, of the necessity for guaranteeing traders against risks in politically volcanic countries. All that information was assembled and utilised for the benefit of Irish industrialists.</P>
    <P>As a result of the activities of C.T.T. we are now exporting goods which, if it had not been brought into existence would probably never have been exported.  Today, industrialists are exporting to many countries, industrialists who have been encouraged and inspired by the example given them by C.T.T.  That is creditworthy; that is praiseworthy.  Having had a good deal to do in the years 1948 to 1951 and 1954 to 1957 with C.T.T. activities, particularly in the latter period, I want to put on record now my appreciation of the excellent work done by the Chairman, the Directors and the staff.</P>
    <P>In a matter of this kind in which one <Col N="997" /> has to marry two organisations in order to achieve results, it is not always easy to guarantee that the success of one of the partners will necessarily be the measure of speed of both when harnessed together.  C.T.T. had a difficult job in persuading industrialists that there was money to be made in the export market.  They had to teach them the way in which they should price for the export market and the quality, style and packaging required for the export market.  That was not an easy job.  Very frequently, people who are protected by a high tariff wall are inclined to take the attitude that they are doing all right and do not want any headaches with export markets.  They know the people they are dealing with at home.  They know they will get their cheque and everything will be all right.</P>
    <P>People had to be torn out of that slumber and inertia in order to induce them to go into the export market.  In that field, C.T.T. did an excellent job. Its activities, and the success of its activities, are in direct ratio, of course, to the energy and enterprise of the firms engaged in the export trade. C.T.T. cannot after all compel people to export.  They can only show them the advantages of exporting.  In that direction, C.T.T. has done very valuable work in soil which was pretty difficult to plough and still more difficult to harrow and to sow.  We can be satisfied now that they have done a pretty good job in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>The field staff of C.T.T. is microscopic as compared with the field staffs employed by other countries engaged in the export trade.  In every State in America, you will find continental travellers with bags of literature.  In one bag alone, there is more than C.T.T. has under its entire control. Travellers fan out all over the States, selling the advantages of buying from their particular countries.  In other countries, the C.T.T. staff does not exist at all.  If occasion arises, someone has to be sent out.  Even in the United States, with its enormous market potential from the export point of view, the staff scarcely numbers half a dozen.  If you subtract the office staff <Col N="998" /> proper, then there is only one man.  I know of one.  There may possibly be two.  Remembering that, and remembering the problem of trying to make contacts in America, one has some appreciation of the Herculean task we set C.T.T. in asking them to invade the foreign markets without giving them an army to carry out the invasion, but, despite all those disadvantages, C.T.T. has done remarkably well.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have any problem with that organisation in the future, it will be a problem of finding more money to finance its activities on a wider scale.  Exports are essential to our existence as a viable economy. Whatever the cost, we shall have to face up to the necessity of doing what other countries have done, namely, sent their commercial travellers, or their field officers, in adequate numbers into potential markets.  If it pays other countries to export, it will pay us to export.  Now that there are such substantial tax concessions in respect of the export of manufactured goods, I hope that an augmented and statutorily endowed body will utilise every opportunity to its fullest, aided by additional Government finance, in order to push on with the drive to sell more Irish goods abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I am not quite clear from the Minister's remarks as to the necessity for changing Córas Tráchtála from its present form of a company into a statutory body.  However, if it will increase its efficiency and make for expanded efforts and more success on the part of Córas Tráchtála, I have no objection.  I have some misgiving every time we are presented with another board.  I have no great objection to boards as such but I do think that in this country in recent years we have tended to place our faith rather too much in boards of one kind or another.  It should not be forgotten that, long before Córas Tráchtála Teoranta or any other promotional body was set up, there were old-established Irish industries exporting all over the world.  Some of these industries continue to export and some, unfortunately, have declined, not through any fault of the directors or <Col N="999" /> owners, but because national policy tended to inhibit their efforts.  By the tariff policy that was followed here, particularly over the last 25 years, costs were raised all round, to such an extent that certain industries could not export at an economic figure.</P>
      <P>While giving every credit, and while I should like to be associated with the remarks passed with regard to the efforts of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, particularly in the case of small businesses that cannot afford an export department, in my view the best way of securing exports is for the individual owner or director or associate of a company to go out and explore the markets himself.  It would be foolish for us or for business in general to assume that, because we set up an Export Promotion Board, all that the individual factory owner or industrialist has to do is to sit back and wait for Córas Tráchtála Teoranta to produce the markets.  As Deputy Norton rightly says, in the final analysis, it does depend on the energy, enterprise and hard work of the industries concerned to sell their goods.</P>
      <P>Possibly for good national reasons at the time, we have tended to look more to the home market than to the export market for a great number of our factories.  That has produced an attitude of mind that, certainly, is not conducive to going out and getting export markets in the teeth of competition from other countries.  What we really need here, more than any Promotion Board or anything else, is a change of attitude of mind from buying Irish to selling Irish and, in the final analysis, that does depend on the individual industrialist or businessman himself.  If encouragement is to be given, the best place to give it, as the Government have, indeed, recognised, is to the manufacturer or the industrialist concerned, to encourage him to go out and look for exports and to make good profits on them and to show that his enterprise will be rewarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one small point in the Bill to which I should like to refer.  I notice that if a member of the board is nominated as a candidate for election <Col N="1000" /> to either House of the Oireachtas, he shall thereupon cease to be a member of the board.  Would it not be desirable that he should wait and see if he is elected to either House of the Oireachtas?  He might find himself neither elected to a House of the Oireachtas nor continuing as a member of the board.  I do not know if that follows the usual procedure but, if it does not, I would suggest that at least the member concerned might be allowed to wait and see if he is successful at the hustings before he loses his seat on the board, as he may be a very useful member indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask myself, what is the purpose of this Bill?  I have studied the Minister's speech most carefully.  I have been asking myself that question since the Bill was first circulated. What is the purpose of changing the company into a board?  I read the Bill. I did not find anything there.  Now I have discovered the secret.</P>
      <P>A good deal of brouhaha has been going on about the White Paper on <i>Economic Development</i>, Mr. Whitaker's book, and what the Government were going to do, and the devil in the bag, and this shower of Bills that has descended on us is all a flexing of muscles in public.  In fact, it is the mountain heaving and the extremely moth-eaten stuff coming out, because I am informed by the Minister:</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the introduction of legislation to establish Córas Tráchtála as a permanent State agency for the promotion of exports was announced in the White Paper on <i>Economic Expansion</i>,</P>
      <P>and the reason for the introduction of this Bill is to show that they are all as busy as bees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, while this Bill is being drafted to promote exports, I am informed in this morning's paper that one of the most important concessions under the Trade Agreement made in 1948 to promote exports of agricultural produce from this country has been lost. While our trade competitors were taking from us the advantage that we had acquired in our principal market for agricultural exports with blood, <Col N="1001" /> sweat and tears, in the 1948 Trade Agreement, we were careering around the country chewing the rag with the present President and the present Taoiseach and his colleagues as to whether we should elect Deputies by proportional representation or not and we are all expected now to get up and cheer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are expected to get up and cheer because a Bill has been brought in here to make Córas Tráchtála Teoranta a board instead of a company.  We are all meant to say, &ldquo;Is that not wonderful?  Look at the way the Government are breaking their necks to get exports for the country. Are they not marvellous?&rdquo; Is there to be no end to this fraud and codology?</P>
      <P>I do not think people realise the gravity of today's developments for this country.  The agricultural export potential from this country has suffered more in the last 48 hours than Córas Tráchtála will ever remedy.  If this were a Bill to implement a new Trade Agreement with Great Britain, then I would feel that we were doing something significant for the expansion of profitable exports from this country but this is a Bill to turn Córas Tráchtála Teoranta into a board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compare the volume of exports which this body, either as a board or as a company, can conceivably be interested in with the volume of exports on which the survival of this country depends.  Remember, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta takes no part, and should not take a part, in the marketing of 90 per cent. of our agricultural exports but we are told that the Government provided two and a half years ago £250,000 to examine that question. Has any Deputy read either of the two reports we have got so far?  One of them informs us that there is no market for eggs; the market is gone&mdash; we knew that, without spending £250,000 for anyone to tell us&mdash; and there is no other place to sell eggs.  We knew that also.  We knew that 27 years ago, when Fianna Fáil started the economic war and started looking for alternative markets.  I still remember going to the Department of <Col N="1002" /> Agriculture then and meeting a decent civil servant, who is now in Heaven, wandering around a corridor with a sheaf of papers in his hand.  I said: &ldquo;Where are you going with that sheaf of papers?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Well, to tell you the truth, I am carrying out my Minister's instructions to look for an alternative market for eggs that I know does not exist.  I am paid to go and look for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unlikely that a civil servant would say that to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He did, 27 golden years ago.  We have been looking for these alternative markets, ever since, most industriously.  We have at last reconciled ourselves to the conclusion that there is no alternative market for eggs.  Where will we get an alternative market for bacon?  Who is worrying now about our markets for 80 per cent. of things we have to export?</P>
      <P>This Bill is cod.  I do not think it makes any difference to anybody. I think it has been introduced for no purpose other than to create the impression that the Taoiseach, since he got into power, is like a human dynamo, and that is all.  It makes me almost frantic that we should be engaged in Dáil Éireann with that kind of claptrap&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the <Col N="1004" /> Bill and about Deputy Loughman's unique intervention because nobody else has said a word.  I am protesting against the appearance of the Government doing the devil with a bang when in fact they are doing nothing in the sphere that matters most.  It shocked me that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should move a Bill of this character, while his colleague the Minister for Agriculture is told he is not to say a word, as he was the day before yesterday, about the events transpiring throughout the principal export market we have.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister if he has adverted to one of the greatest dangers into which a body of this kind can fall, that is, to undertake the sale of commodities that we have not got?  There is only one thing more dangerous to our export programme than lethargy and that is misguided zeal.  Incalculable harm can be done by rushing out to promote markets for a particular product and then discovering, when the orders come in, that you are not in a position to supply them.  I want to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is authorised on the part of the Government to give us any indication of the Government's intention to set up any body corresponding to Córas Tráchtála to assist in the marketing of agricultural products.  We shall need it.</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputies have awakened to the fact that the only agricultural produce left to us now with a secure market are live cattle.  Standing, as we do today, outside the Common Market, the Swedish seven-nation agreement, in association, I understand, with Iceland, Turkey and Greece, we shall find ourselves in a very awkward situation.  It ought not be any consolation to Deputies here to learn that we propose to convert Córas Tráchtála, Teo., into a board.  They will have no function to discharge if our agricultural markets wither away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think something possibly could be done if some energetic measures were taken to promote sales organisations in Great Britain for Irish bacon and Irish butter&mdash;at least by way of a holding operation until such time as we are in a position to re-negotiate a trade agreement with Great Britain.  I am getting <Col N="1005" /> extremely apprehensive of the situation which threatens to develop in default of something along those lines being done.</P>
    <P>It shocks me that this House should congratulate itself on the kind of legislation we are now considering in the context in which we find ourselves at present.  As usual, we are in the awkward situation that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will say it is outside his responsibility, that the marketing of agricultural produce is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister has a dual function now.  He is not only Minister for Industry and Commerce at the moment.  He also speaks on behalf of the Government in this House at the moment.</P>

Following on the commencement of those talks, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for External Affairs visited London and had certain negotiations there.
