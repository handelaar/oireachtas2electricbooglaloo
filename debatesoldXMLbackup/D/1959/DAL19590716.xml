      <P>It is proposed to take business as set out in the Order Paper in the following order: Nos. 1, 2, 3, 18 (Votes 55 and 56, 1 to 25 inclusive and 14), 9, 19, 20, 10 and 21. Questions will be taken at 3 o'clock. It is proposed to interrupt business after Questions to take No. 18 (Vote 14) and when that is completed to resume the order.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  I consulted with the Minister for Local Government and we certainly intended to take it in the Winter session.  I am not sure that it is possible to say it will be ready in time for circulation before the resumption.  It seems to me that would not be any advantage in view of the amount of legislation that has already to be dealt with, but if there is any point about it I can arrange to have a First Reading.</P>

    <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&mdash;(Deputy Sweetman.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is anything that is generic or typical of speeches by Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs over the years&mdash;and I use the word in the plural deliberately&mdash;it is that their speeches in introducing their Estimates have always been smug and complacent. I should not have thought it was possible for the present Minister to fall into that pattern so very quickly, but I am afraid he has, because the <Col N="1334" /> speech he made yesterday was about as smug and as complacent as could have been made.  I do not think we have anything to be smug or complacent about in relation to certain aspects of our postal services.  In many cases, the postal services we have to-day are worse than the postal services 25 years ago.</P>
      <P>I can remember 25 years ago that, as a matter of regular habit, living in the country, if a letter were posted the previous day in England, it was delivered to me that morning.  Now it always takes two days.  Here, at present, if a letter is posted at a pillar box in or around this vicinity at five minutes past four today, it will not be delivered in Naas or in the Naas area, until Saturday morning.  It is utterly absurd for anyone to be smug or complacent about postal services when it takes more than 36 hours for a letter to be delivered some 20 miles.</P>
      <P>If you go to Merrion Row post office, for example, and post a letter after five o'clock in the afternoon, it will not be delivered in my constituency in Kildare the following day.  If you go to Lower Baggot Street post office and post your letter after 4 o'clock, it will not be delivered in my constituency in Kildare the following day and not merely that but we have a position now in relation to parts of Kildare in which the people are regularly receiving their letters the day after they should be received, even if they are posted before 4 o'clock.</P>
      <P>We have a position in South Kildare in which people get their post an hour earlier than they used to get it, but it is yesterday's post they get, not to-day's post.  If I post a letter at 3 o'clock this afternoon to Ballitore, Castledermot, or the rural area around Athy, it will not be delivered in that area until Saturday morning.  I cannot see that that is anything other than a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Monday last, I had a personal example of the same sort of postal delay.  A telegram came to me from France.  It was, apparently, as far as I can understand this telegram at all, received at the post office here at 6.15 p.m.  It was in French.  It was delivered by telephone by the girl.  In fact, there was a mistake in the typing <Col N="1335" /> of the words in French.  Neither the girl, not through her fault in any way, nor my house, being the recipient, could understand exactly what the message meant.  We asked that it be confirmed in the ordinary way&mdash;the ordinary confirmation of a telegram. That happened at 6.15 p.m. on Monday.  The confirmation of that telegram arrived at 9.25 yesterday morning, Wednesday morning&mdash;over 36 hours afterwards.  If the Minister wants the telegram, he is welcome to it.</P>
    <P>If the resources of the Post Office cannot ensure that a letter which goes from this vicinity after 4 o'clock down to the sorting office and then is sent out to Kildare is delivered the following morning surely its resources are not so meagre that they cannot deliver the confirmation of a telegram that arrives in the General Post Office in O'Connell Street at 6.15 p.m. so as to ensure it is delivered on the following morning's post?  That is not merely the experience in Kildare.  I am mentioning Kildare because it is Kildare of which I have the most experience, naturally enough.  However, I am told by other Deputies and by people from other parts of the country that they experience the same thing as I have mentioned. It seems peculiar, to say the least of it, that, in this modern age of 1959, we cannot arrive at a system and a method by which communications entrusted to the Post Office arrive somewhat more speedily, particularly in areas adjacent to the place of posting.</P>
    <P>One of the things I have against Deputy Hilliard's being Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is that he is too pleasant an individual.  I had the pleasure of serving on the Restaurant Committee with the Minister, of which he was Chairman, and he was too courteous.  For this type of position, we want somebody who&mdash;as I was told yesterday by the Minister for Lands&mdash; has some of my rudeness or some rudeness somewhere to do a bit of shaking-up. I hope, therefore, the Minister will forget his traditional courtesy and see that there is a thorough shake-up from what is a tradition of &ldquo;stick-in-the-mudness&rdquo; in the Post Office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> Along their own specific lines, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is one of the most efficient of our Departments.  However, to think in terms of getting outside these lines is something that does not enter, apparently, into their make-up.  If we are to get the service the business community require for the proper and efficient despatch of business, there must be a new approach and a change in relation to the outlook in that respect.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I was unable to reconcile some of the figures the Minister gave yesterday with figures he gave me, and which I admit were only approximations, on 21st April.  Perhaps I am looking at a different set and a different type of figures.  The Minister yesterday indicated that the Post Office would show a profit for the year 1958-59.  According to the information given to me on 21st April &mdash;I agree it was provisional and I was prepared to accept it as provisional&mdash; there was to be a loss then of £40,000. Does the change from that estimate to the figure he mentioned last night of £200,000 profit mean that the actuality is better than the estimate because, if so, it is very satisfactory, or is there some other accounting reason for the difference?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to let us know also what is the average period during which capital repayments are made.  In his speech he said they were to be repaid by annuities extending over periods not exceeding 25 years.  Is it always a 25-year period or is it a period that varies and, if so, what is the average period for that repayment?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned on page 8 that the International Convention made it obligatory for him to raise the minimum letter rate to 6d.  I take it that that is in respect of foreign mails.  Let me take Switzerland for example.  Does the ordinary letter posted with a 6d. stamp on it automatically go air mail now to Switzerland or is there a special charge in order to go air mail?  I want to tell the Minister the reason why I ask that question.  I have been recently in three separate post offices, small post offices, I agree, and in each of the three, I was told that in order to <Col N="1337" /> send a letter, the lightest form of communication there is, to Switzerland, it would cost me, in one post office I was told, 10d., in another 1/- and in the third 1/2d., whereas the Minister implied that 6d. is the correct charge. I think that 6d. is possibly the correct charge, but let us make sure that there is some form of circular sent to sub-postmasters which cannot be misunderstood. In the case in which I queried it, the sub-postmaster went off to look up the circular and came back with the result I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on in his speech to make a reference to the commemoration stamps but I shall come back to that at a later stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to the telephone service, it would appear that the pressure on the exchange in the Oireachtas is building up in a way that was not visualised when the new facilities were made available.  No one could get more efficient service than we get in this House from the telephonists but it frequently arises that the pressure on the exchange is such that Deputies cannot get their calls as quickly as they would wish, particularly, I might add, at a time when the House is not sitting but when there are a great number of Deputies in the building doing appropriate work for their constituents. The time I refer to particularly is the morning after the House has been sitting when there are a great many Deputies here.  There should be some possibility of improving that position.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation the Minister has introduced&mdash;when I say &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;, I am using the generic term; I cannot remember whether it was he or his predecessor&mdash;into telephone charges is satisfactory, but just as I find that he seems to have a desire not to give the best service to my constituency, so also he seems to pick out Naas as being the place where more money will be paid in telephone calls in the future than before.  At least 50 per cent. of the calls from Naas&mdash;and I am told more than 50 per cent.&mdash;are to Dublin, and with the incoming calls, it would be the same thing, but the cost of telephoning from Naas to <Col N="1338" /> Dublin has been increased, though it has been reduced in many other parts of the country.  I cannot understand why Naas should have been selected for that.  Even though Dublin to Balbriggan is farther than Dublin to Naas, you will be able to telephone from Dublin to Balbriggan for 2d. but if you want to ring up Naas, it will cost you 1/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but we do not like our importance being measured quite like that.  The position up to this has been that there was a concentration on the provision of the trunk line in relation to telephones and on the provision of circuit facilities, rather than on the servicing of connections, and so forth.  It would seem from what has been said in the introductory speech that we are now, in certain cases, getting to the position at which there cannot be connections to certain exchanges because the switchboards, even though reasonably newly erected, are now booked out. While that may be unsatisfactory for the people concerned it is, however, evidence of an increased user of the telephone service, and that must in the long run mean that there will be a better service and perhaps a cheaper service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know exactly what will be the plan of the development of rural telephones in the future.  Some years ago, I think it was the hope that in many of the rural areas there would be a semi-automatic exchange, that there would be a small satellite exchange operating round a rather bigger one. The Minister has not specifically said whether he proposes to depart from that plan or not.  However, I gather from his reference to the automatic, nation-wide coverage provided from Athlone and from Cork that he does intend to depart from that and to provide that instead of the semi-automatic exchanges in small areas, the subscribers in small areas will be grouped into central exchanges and that these central exchanges will be fully automatic. I should like some elucidation <Col N="1339" /> and clarification on that point when the Minister is replying.</P>
    <P>I notice, too, in relation to the stores for use under the Telephone Capital Acts, that there was a pretty heavy draw-down from stores in 1958-59, a draw of some £40,000 in excess of the 1957-58 figure.  It may be that the stores have been built up to a point beyond which it was unnecessary that they should be kept, but I should like to know whether that draw-down in respect of expenditure under the Telephone Capital Acts means that we must have larger expenditure on stores this year than was otherwise anticipated.</P>
    <P>In connection with the moneys we spent last year under the Telephone Capital Acts, it is very noticeable that there was a cut of one-third in the amount spent on the co-axial trunk circuits and a cut of about 40 per cent. on the amount spent on other new trunk services.  Is that one of the reasons why we have gone behind and now find that subscribers in certain areas cannot get the connections they wish because of pressure on trunk services and because of pressure otherwise?</P>
    <P>The telegraph service, I think, has been a distinct headache to every Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in recent years.  I thought some consideration was to be given to the possibility of having a special type of telegram for the purpose of popularising the service in a way that would not mean increased costs in administration.  So far as the ordinary telegraph service is concerned I think I am right in saying that the more ordinary telegrams that are sent, the greater the loss that the Minister has to report at the end of the year.  The service has been cut down, the loss running in or about £160,000 in the last few years, but it has been reduced to that figure because the number of telegrams has been coming down.  We are, and we have been, in the unfortunate position that the more telegrams sent the greater the loss.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances I thought consideration was to be given to some <Col N="1340" /> special type of telegram deliverable, not individually but in bulk, at stated intervals, perhaps by post.  This would include, perhaps, greetings telegrams and sympathy telegrams which would be sent at a lower cost than the normal but would yet fill in what might be a gap, having regard to the early hours of posting.  Perhaps there is such a service&mdash;I do not know.  If there is and I am not aware of it, it shows it cannot have been publicised as well as it might be because then I would be aware of it; I am reasonably observant.</P>
    <P>The story the Minister has to report in regard to savings services is not very good.  Fairly enough, perhaps, the Minister tries to gloss over the sorry story by suggesting that there were withdrawals to meet Exchequer Stock Issues, Savings Certificates and Prize Bonds.  There were similar issues of National Loans and Savings Certificates and Prize Bonds in earlier years. In the Minister's own words there were attractions of alternative forms of investment in other years and it is not satisfactory that sales of Saving Certificates should be down by over half a million pounds on the previous year&mdash; £556,000 to be exact.  It is not at all satisfactory that the deposits in the Savings Bank should be moving so slowly.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who is responsible for the working of the Savings Committee.  I know it was set up by the Minister for Finance but the detailed working of it is seen, to some extent, in the work that is done by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as an agent for the economy as a whole. It seems to me that the work of that Savings Committee has not been pushed ahead by the Government as it was in its earlier years.  It does not seem that quite the same encouragement and support have been given to it as were given before.  I do not know that it is quite fair to lay the complaint at the door of the present Minister because he is acting merely as an agent, to some extent, but I think something should be done.  I shall be trying to impress this on his colleague, the <Col N="1341" /> Minister for Finance, at a later stage to-day.  Something must be done to try to step up interest in small savings again if the economy as a whole is to benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and his Department will have a very important part to play in the drive for more savings which is so necessary.  Therefore I hope that he will endeavour to think out new plans, devices, even new gimmicks&mdash;if I may use the word&mdash;to improve the urge to save throughout the community.  It is much more difficult for the community to save when one remembers the effect of the policy of the Government in relation to the cost of living.  This is a Government that came in complaining that the cost of living under the previous Government was much too high and they gave the impression throughout the country that if they were put into office they would reduce it. Instead of that, the cost of living has gone up by 12 points during their time.  That is bound to affect savings and it is part of the reason for the reduction in savings that we see here.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to the philatelic policy of the Department.  I am glad to see that the Minister's predecessor succeeded at last in getting something done that I failed to get done.  I think it was actually announced by the present Minister on his first day in office, but I hardly think he galvanised the Department into action in one day.  Up to the announcement made on the 26th June in regard to the change of policy in philatelic sales, the policy of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had remained as it was laid down in 1927.</P>
    <P>I remember towards the end of the time I was in Government seeing that it was in 1927 the philatelic policy had been laid down.  A slight change has been made but it is not nearly big enough.  First of all, let us get it out of our heads that there is anything dis-honourable to the country in making a profit out of philatelic sales.  I am not talking of the type of method that could be discreditable&mdash;deliberately making mistakes in the printing of issues and so forth.  No one, of course, <Col N="1342" /> would suggest that we should drop to that level.  But, even keeping the highest level in relation to this philatelic business, many countries in Europe are making a great deal of money out of their philatelic sales.  The idea that it would lower our prestige to try and make money out of philately is one that must be dispelled, and I hope we can rely on the Minister to dispel it.</P>
    <P>There has been a start in that direction by the announcement made on the 26th June.  I am not a stamp collector myself.  At some stage in our careers some of us have collected a few stamps but as we got older we got interested in other things.  I am told that there are various new types of stamp collectors abroad at present.  When you are issuing a commemorative stamp it should be issued throughout your whole range and not merely confined to a couple of stamps, as was done in relation to Guinness.  Everybody will agree that Guinness is the most important single industry in the country and one of which all of us on every side are extremely proud.  But I am informed by those who know that no collector would be bothered to collect a commemorative issue when there are only two stamps in that issue. The position in relation to the Guinness issue is that it is confined to the 3d. and 1/3d. range alone.  I cannot see where the great additional cost would be in making the issue through a reasonable range so that collectors could collect not just a couple of stamps but a reasonable set.</P>
    <P>The change the Department have made in making it known that they will not continue to reissue after the stamp has been withdrawn will improve philatelic sales, but something more than that is needed.  The countries deriving a profit from this make it clear that they will issue their sets for a particular time.  They make it clear also very frequently that there will be a limit to the number of stamps issued of the set and publish what that limit is.  A move in that respect would undoubtedly mean that there would be more philatelic interest in Irish stamps.</P>
    <P>I wonder has the Minister ever looked at what some of the Continental <Col N="1343" /> countries have achieved in relation to their profits on stamps? Might I refer him to a very informative little article published in the <i>Three Banks Review</i> for June, 1959, by Kenneth Chapman?  He will find in that a considerable analysis of the type of market there is likely to be. I see no reason whatever why this country could not make quite a substantial sum, both in profit for the postal services and, through philatelic sales, in foreign exchange&mdash;because the purchasers would be collectors outside the country&mdash;when other countries in Europe are able to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister will find, if he studies the problem, that quite apart from the junior collector&mdash;I think by his smile that he was, as I was, one of them&mdash;who does keep a certain amount of basic interest alive, there are collections now being made not merely on the national basis of a country but also on the theme that is involved.  Substantial collections are being assembled based on a theme&mdash; for example, architecture.  Some collectors try to amass a collection of postage stamps of different countries, without regard to the country, showing worthy features of architecture in buildings, churches, perhaps, and similar things.  Other collectors try to base their collections, not geographically on national issues, but on the history of the post throughout the world.</P>
    <P>At one time the difficulty in relation to special issues by the Post Office was a printing one, in that they had to be printed elsewhere.  It was because of that we gave consideration to the erection of a special printing department for the Revenue Commissioners, a department with which it was unnecessary to proceed once the method of recess printing became otherwise available in Dublin.  Now that satisfactory printing, from the philatelic or any point of view, can be done here, there is not the same difficulty as there was previously in making a commemorative issue.  I can appreciate that before this it was necessary for an officer from the Minister's Department and the Revenue Commissioner's Department to go abroad for a <Col N="1344" /> considerable period to the place where the issue was being printed, be it London, Scotland or wherever it was.  That expense is gone now and it can be supervised here at home.  When it can be so supervised let us not be so supercilious as to say and think that any country which makes money out of selling stamps for collecting purposes is a country to be despised.  Unfortunately, from 1927 that was the outlook in relation to philately in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I made a speech some years ago on the subject of philately and people assumed that I knew a great deal about it.  I do not, but a great number of people wrote to me on the subject.  I spoke then on advice tendered to me by a person of approximately my own age and with a real love of stamp collecting. He saw the profit being made in other countries.  I urge the Minister not to despise that profit.  I appeal to him to make certain in the coming year that every avenue in that direction is explored.  If he thinks it would help him, let him get the advice of reputable people in this trade.  There are a great many reputable people in it.  Of course, just as in any other trade, there are one or two who are not quite so reputable.  The Minister's predecessor was sent a compendium on this subject.  I am sending it back to the Minister now so that he may study it. Some of the suggestions in it are worthy of consideration.  Some would not apply in our conditions.</P>
    <P>What we need more than anything else is a new outlook, an outlook based on the belief that it is worth while availing of the possibilities there are in this.  The first thing that must be done in that regard is to ensure that any issue we make is an issue worth while collecting, and that it is properly and adequately publicised.  It is not adequate publication of the Guinness issue to announce on 26th June that it will be issued on 20th July.  By the time that information has seeped through to the American market, there will not be anything like sufficient time for people in America to get first day covers.  That is the sort of thing that should be publicised in the Journal of the Department of External Affairs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> Of course, it would take anything up to a fortnight or three weeks for that Journal to reach likely markets.  By that time, there would only be a week left to order first day covers.  Notice has been entirely insufficient.  That is particularly lamentable in the case of Guinness, a firm of which we are all so justly proud.  It is even more lamentable that it should be confined to just two denominations instead of having a proper set.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent, I am in agreement with the views expressed by Deputy Sweetman.  The Minister's statement was certainly an encouraging one.  It recorded many satisfactory features of the Posts and Telegraphs organisation during the past year. Certainly the organisation is run on very efficient lines.  On the whole the staff make an honest effort to serve the public courteously and efficiently.  I regard the staff of this Department as a very hard-working and competent staff.  For some reason, which I have never been able to comprehend, the staff of the Post Office have not been accorded in all respects the privileges and advantages that civil servants in other Departments are fortunate enough to enjoy.  On a number of occasions, I have tried to find out why that position obtains, but I have never been able to get any satisfactory information.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some information on the matter when he comes to reply.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to the slow rate of delivery of mails, particularly mails posted at central points, such as Dublin, I am surprised to hear that, but I am sure Deputy Sweetman is correct Certainly I take his word for it.  If that position exists, it is about time some steps were taken to remedy it.  We have experience here in this House of the excellent postal facilities provided for us. Mail posted here up to 6 o'clock in the evening catches the morning delivery in all parts of the country.  I regard that as an excellent service.  If there are post offices in Dublin where posting up to 5 o'clock does not ensure delivery the following morning, I suggest something should be done to remedy that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> The Minister referred briefly to mail services.  He said the position was generally more satisfactory during the year.  Further progress was made with the reorganisation of rural postal services with the object of giving a standard six-day frequency of delivery and a better quality of service.  During the past few years, much reorganisation has taken place in rural areas.  I have some experience of the results secured as a result of that reorganisation.  By and large, I am prepared to say that it has been successful.  There were isolated areas, particularly on the borders, in which there was cause for complaint.  Prior to reorganisation, certain areas were unwieldy and generally unworkable.  It was a common experience to find a rural postal area coming within a mile or two of a town and yet posting and delivery of mails was carried out by an office many miles away.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that reorganisation was not as simple as one might imagine from a purely theoretical point of view. Many aspects had to be considered. It was exactly a question as to whether the area was workable or unworkable that influenced the final decision.  There was also the question of staff displacement, and many other matters, which made the task generally a pretty difficul one in many instances.  There were complaints, mostly from postmen, when the new arrangements were announced, but as far as the public are concerned, the reorganisation resulted in a general improvement of the services, which the public appreciate, as I should like the Minister to know.</P>
    <P>There may be isolated cases where hardship has resulted to postmen, many of whom have long service.  I am quite sure there are a number of complaints before the Department in that connection and I would suggest that they be dealt with very sympathetically. There is no doubt that some postmen, particularly rural postmen and unestablished postmen who have no pension rights, have been adversely affected by the reorganisation and their difficulties should be minimised as much as possible.  I do not propose at this stage to discuss the reorganisation scheme further except to repeat that it has definitely provided a better service <Col N="1347" /> for the public.  It is unfortunate if postmen and other officials directly associated with the delivery of mails have to be inconvenienced and, in some cases, gravely inconvenienced.</P>
    <P>A general improvement in connection with outgoing mails is very noticeable in rural areas in recent years.  Not long ago, it was a pretty common experience in most rural offices that outgoing letters had to be posted before the incoming mail arrived if the outgoing mail was to leave the office on that day.  Happily, that is no longer the case and now there is a fairly long period, probably two or three hours, between the time mail arrives and the time mail is despatched.  This time lag gives an opportunity to people in the postal district, particularly those who reside close to the sub-post office, to reply to correspondence on the day of receipt.  That is a very great achievement, which most of us did not think could be secured in our time.</P>
    <P>There is, however, still some room for improvement in regard to the posting of letters and small parcels.  It has often occurred to me that better use could be made of our transport system in this connection.  Trains and buses, particularly on long distances, could carry post boxes for the use of travellers.  People who have to travel long distances often find it convenient to attend to correspondence on the journey and modern trains provide special facilities for that purpose.  In fact a number of people are influenced to travel by train because of those facilities.  It should be a practicable proposition to work out some arrangement whereby postage stamps and letter boxes would be available on trains and buses.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I read a Continental magazine which described a service of that kind which is provided in Italy. The service has been provided there with much success for a number of years.  I would suggest to our new Minister that he might consider the idea and, as an experiment, have such a service introduced on long distance trains and buses.  The cost of the experiment should be very small and, if it is found that the service is not utilised <Col N="1348" /> to any great extent, or is not fully availed of there is very little harm done.  I am quite sure that it would be a very popular move and I would respectfully ask the Minister to consider the matter at his earliest convenience.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the report with regard to the telephone service has been satisfactory for a number of years.  I must congratulate the Minister on the adjustment of telephone charges announced recently. According to the statement which the Minister made in the House, this adjustment will cost the Department a fairly large sum of money.  I am rather surprised to learn that the new arrangement is regarded by the Department, at the outset, as a liability.  I think greater use than the Department anticipate will be made of the telephone service under the new arrangement. I am rather inclined to predict that when the annual return is presented in 1961-62, the loss estimated will not exist.</P>
    <P>The shortage of labour, particularly in rural areas, and in urban areas also, renders it necessary for householders to use the telephone in connection with many domestic problems.  The use of the phone for other than local calls was somewhat discouraged in the past by the fact that the charges were regarded as being rather high.  The Department was conscious of that fact and I am sure that it was because of that that the rates have recently been changed.  The Department have faced the problem in a very realistic way and I sincerely hope that the loss which, according to the Minister's statement, is anticipated will not ensue.  It is more than probable that the increase in the number of local calls that will result will mean that there will be no change in the revenue.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the telephone services are very satisfactory, even in rural areas where they were not satisfactory some time ago.  We have every reason to be proud of the service in Dublin.  The service is greatly loaded during peak periods but, nevertheless, the service the ordinary caller gets could not be better.  The general standard of efficiency down the country, even in sub-post offices, where, in <Col N="1349" /> many instances, operators have had very little opportunity of being trained over a number of years, is very good. They feel, however, that it is about time the Department reviewed the terms of remuneration of sub-postmasters and postmistresses who operate telephone exchanges.  I understand that the extra remuneration for such responsibility is very meagre.  I am told, on very good authority, that, taking an ordinary sub-office having a telephone exchange with five or six subscribers, it is hardly worth mentioning the extra remuneration paid for such additional work.</P>
    <P>I notice that in recent times, rather than connect up telephones within short distances of central points, the tendency seems to be to start new telephone exchanges in the rural post offices.  It appears to me that the reason for this arrangement is that the Department anticipate in the course of a short time many applications for telephone connections in these rural districts.  Of course, it would be quite impracticable to consider connecting up such subscribers with the existing central exchanges in the bigger provincial towns.  It would mean laying a special line from the exchange to each rural subscriber.  Rather than have that done, the Department took timely action.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Department for the foresight they exercised in this connection by setting up exchanges in the rural post offices where no exchanges heretofore existed.  That, in so far as it goes, is a satisfactory development. It is something that will prove very helpful in years to come when most houses in the rural areas are likely to be connected up.</P>
    <P>The Department is certainly moving fast in one direction, that is, in the matter of installation, but they are not moving fast enough in the direction of awarding adequate remuneration to the operators of those rural telephone exchanges.  I understand that most of these offices or exchanges have to operate 12 hours a day.  It is a rather long period.  If one were to compare the conditions with those that obtain among the Civil Service section of the staff, there is a very big <Col N="1350" /> leeway to be made up.  The operators of rural telephone exchanges have to some extent been agitating for some years for improvement in their terms of appointment.  In that regard, I hope that the time is now ripe when the Minister will find it possible to do something about this matter.  The telephone organisation is in very good shape.  The financial side of it is satisfactory and is likely to be more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that the cooperation of the local exchange operators is required to give that service which all of us are anxious to have. If we are to get the service we require, it is only natural to expect that the operators should be rewarded for it. We are all human in that direction. They are very poorly paid for the general service they provide and sooner or later their position will have to be reviewed.  The sooner it is done, the better.  I think that, in the long run, the Minister will find it will lead to greater efficiency and harmony between the various sections of his Department.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the telegraph service still shows a very substantial loss.  I wonder if the policy of the Department a couple of years ago to increase the cost of telegrams was a step in the right direction or whether it did, in fact, make the loss more pronounced than it had been.  I felt there was some hope at that time of bringing down the loss&mdash;at least some hope of getting the people to utilise telegrams to a greater extent than they were doing.</P>
    <P>The cost of telegrams was increased almost 50 per cent. at that time.  The minimum cost was 2/6d. which puts it beyond the reach of the ordinary person to send a telegram, except for very special reasons in connection with certain matters.  The telegram was rather a popular way in years gone by of communicating ideas but, with the advent of the telephone and the greater use of the telephone, it was natural that telegrams, as such, should disappear.</P>
    <P>Evidently the equipment and organisation that appear to be still necessary to take this telegram traffic is rather costly.  It would appear that the <Col N="1351" /> increase in the cost of telegrams has not offset that deficiency.  I would suggest to the Minister even at this stage that it could not do very much harm, if it would do any harm at all, if the cost of telegrams was reduced, say, 6d., from 2/6d. to a minimum of 2/- for a trial period, with a view to seeing whether this deficiency could be made good.  Naturally, the Minister will say to me that if he reduces the charges for telegrams, the deficiency is likely to get larger.  I do not agree.  I think you can always put a service out of the reach of a customer if the price is high enough, but if you put it within his reach by having only a reasonable figure, it will lead to a greater use of the service.  I would ask the Minister to consider that course of action.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of people complained to me that the cost of telegrams nowadays does not make it practicable for them to utilise the telegraph service.  When people express their views in that direction&mdash;I am quite sure that other Deputies have had the same views expressed to them, too&mdash;it would be some justification for the Minister considering the proposal I have made.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the question of staff rather fully.  I have always had a definite view with regard to those sections of the post office staff that work the hardest.  The postmen in rural areas, and quite a number of them in the urban areas, too, have to work very hard.  I think we would all agree that the outdoor staff, such people as auxiliary, unestablished and established postmen in rural areas, are obliged to perform very arduous duties.  On most occasions they are working in the open and they are required to work under all sorts of weather.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the terms and conditions of appointment of these people vary very much.  The established postman has security which his colleague who is unestablished has not. The established men have also certain rights with regard to sickness pay and other conditions of employment which are considerably better than those <Col N="1352" /> which the unestablished personnel have.  I understand that some years ago an effort was made by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to establish a number of temporary hands.  An examination was set at the time and I am informed that quite a number of temporary personnel succeeded in getting on to the established staff.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Department did not go far enough in that connection.  We have a similar experience of unestablished staff being employed in other Departments of State.  It was only in recent months that the Department of Agriculture had an examination set by the Civil Service Commissioners with a view to establishing a number of temporary officers who had service with the Department for the past nine or 10 years and who were recruited, in the first instance, on a temporary, week-to-week basis.  Eventually it was found that because of certain developments in the Department their fulltime service was required.  If we could get down to the same position in the Post Office and endeavour to regrade the temporary and auxiliary postmen particularly, to some sort of established positions carrying pension rights we would be doing a very good day's work, not alone for the men concerned but for the public with whom they are dealing, and for the Department.</P>
    <P>The idea of expecting unfortunate men to work for 40 or 45 years and then to retire at 60 or 65 due to ill-health without a pension or gratuity is something which is out of date.  It is rather unfortunate that we should still have a Government Department employing people under those conditions. Ministers and various public representatives exhort employers all over the country to introduce superannuation schemes, pension schemes and other types of schemes for the general betterment of their workers. The State should set a very high example and I think that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has some leeway to make up in that regard.</P>
    <P>I fail to see, when other Departments have been able to establish temporary officers, whom, no doubt, they were <Col N="1353" /> obliged to take into their service in years past, why the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should not be able to follow suit.  If you are to have a contented staff you will have to give them the same security as their counterparts in other Departments.  It is marvellous that we have got such loyalty and co-operation from those outdoor post office officials particularly and, moreover, from the postmen who discharge their duties under difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine this very vexed question and to endeavour to do something about it at his earliest convenience.  I should not like him to feel that I am making this appeal to play to the gallery in any sense or form.  I feel that the time is long since past when something should be done about this question and I sincerely hope the Minister will be able to introduce the ameliorative conditions so necessary in the case of postmen and certain clerical grades as well, who I think are still being taken on in a temporary capacity.</P>
    <P>No matter how efficient any organisation is operated or controlled you will always get people to come along and make complaints about it.  I think it was Deputy Sweetman who said that the Post Office was a very efficient organisation on its own lines but that they were not inclined to adjust themselves to modern requirements in commercial directions.  I think too that there might be a little more flexibility than there has been.  The only complaint I have to make against the organisation is that it is slightly too strait-laced.  Modern conditions require flexibility.  Generally speaking the Post Office is a commercial institution. In fact it deplores losses under any heading and endeavours to make profits in all its various sections.  This proves it is no different from any commercial organisation except that it is controlled by the Minister and operated as a Department of State.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of regulations still applying in the Post Office which are not practicable nowadays.  A similar position obtained in many other Departments from time to time in the past and has now been rectified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> That state of affairs was very noticeable in the Department of Local Government at one time.  I would say that at that period progress in that Department was retarded considerably by what was known as red tape.  Progress in this Department is retarded by ancient regulations and rules which are found to be impracticable under modern conditions.  For that reason I ask the Minister to take his courage in his hands and endeavour to have a review of the whole code for the purpose of bringing it into line with modern requirements.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should again like to thank the Minister, the higher officials, and indeed all officials of the Post Office for the co-operation which I have received from them when I have had recourse to them on Parliamentary or other business.  I must say that we should feel very proud to have such a very splendid organisation under a native Government, an organisation operated by a staff that at all times works hard and for longer periods than appear to be generally operated in other Civil Service quarters.  I hope that state of affairs will continue and that the little losses about which the Minister is worrying will turn into surpluses in a short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it true to say that the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is one which usually has a quiet passage through the House, mainly because Deputies appreciate that, over the years, they have been getting a useful, silent service from the officials of that Department. Any criticisms we have to offer are, as the Minister will appreciate, constructive criticisms, with a desire to help the Department to give a better service to our constituents.</P>
      <P>The ramifications of the Department have grown considerably over the years and it carries out many of the services which properly could be allocated to the Department of Finance or, in some cases, the Department of Social Welfare. The fact that it carries out those services in addition to its own is an indication that, generally speaking, it is an efficiently run concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> I should like to support the remarks of Deputy Sweetman about the savings movement.  I do not know to what degree the Minister has jurisdiction over the savings movement, but I personally get the impression that, within the last year or two, the momentum seems to have been lost in regard to the whole question of savings.  Now that we have a new Minister taking up office, I would urge him to bend his energies to a bright, forceful and attractive campaign to encourage our people to save more. The fact that over the years our accumulated savings amount to little over £90 millions, of which the Post Office accounts for just under £80 millions, is not a great tribute to us as a people who wish to save and invest. With an average of less than £30 per head of the population for accumulated savings over the years, we compare very unfavourably with people in other countries, even small countries like our own.</P>
    <P>So much depends, for the progress and future prosperity of the country, on adequate savings that I should like to repeat myself by asking the Minister again to strike a new and attractive line in encouraging our people to save more.  Whether that means an increase in the present inducement offered to depositors or not, I do not know.  I know that there are very serious considerations to which the Minister must have regard before there is any question of raising the interest rate.  I should like the Minister to give very careful consideration to this and to do something, even if it means breaking new ground, towards encouraging our people to save more, particularly in regard to small savings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman also referred to the opportunities of earning more income from stamp collectors.  That offers an opportunity to get some much-needed income into the Minister's Department. In answer to a recent Question of mine in the Dáil, the Minister's predecessor indicated that the Department issued stamps only to commemorate a centenary or longer established event. I think the Minister might consider departing from that precedent and <Col N="1356" /> issuing stamps to commemorate, say, a golden jubilee of some national or even international event.  Recently I referred to the founding of the Fianna organisation and I was told that the reason why stamps could not be issued was that the Minister was hidebound by the precedent of this centenary regulation.  Recently also there has been a minor celebration in the West of Ireland to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the landing of Alcock and Brown after the first West to East Atlantic crossing.  While that is not directly associated with any individual Irishman, it is an event in which Ireland participated.  In looking for new stamp issues, I do not think we should be too restricted in outlook. Personally, I should not mind going outside this country, if I could find some reason, however tenuous, which might associate this country with the event in question.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he could give some reason for the continuing delay in the installation of telephones in Limerick City.  This has been an old complaint of all Limerick Deputies.  Up to two years ago, the answer given was that no progress could be made in speeding up the installation of new telephones until the new telephone exchange was opened in Limerick.  That exchange was opened by the then Minister some two years ago, but there is still three months' delay in getting a telephone into a business premises there.  I think I am correct in saying that this compares unfavourably with the experience in other large urban centres.  I should like the Minister to do something quickly to remedy this state of affairs.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Moloney has pointed out, there has been a general and sustained improvement in telephone services all over the country.  This does not apply, however, to all rural telephone exchanges. It may be that the reasons are, as he suggested, that the staffs in those exchanges are not paid an adequate salary to encourage the better, more intelligent and more educated operator to apply for the positions; or it may be that, in the country areas, we like to carry on the friendly, homely tradition of the <Col N="1357" /> country post office.  In this regard, I should like to refer particularly to some of the seaside or holiday resort exchanges, which still carry on what I referred to a moment ago, the friendly old tradition, but which do not go hand in hand with the modern service which the tourist now desires. I should like the Minister to pay special attention to these seaside resorts, as if we want to encourage tourists we must give them a more modern service at these particular centres.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has any power or jurisdiction with regard to the twopenny stamp levy, if I might use the expression, on receipts. As the Minister knows, every cash payment of two pounds and over must carry a stamped receipt.  I think that legislation is now out of date and should be revised or abolished altogether.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest to the Minister that some of the post offices, even in big urban centres, are very dowdy and very old-fashioned looking.  The Minister should take a lead from the new General Manager of C.I.É. and brighten up some of these post offices. It would have the effect of improving business and it would also be to the benefit of the staffs concerned.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I should like to suggest that, in the interests of decentralisation, some more autonomy and responsibility might be given to the local superintendents, in the quite minor decisions which at present they have to refer to the Minister's Department here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I conclude as I began, by paying a tribute to the staffs of this Department, both technical and ordinary, who give, on the whole&mdash;and I am afraid many of us do not realise it&mdash;very efficient, silent, public service to the citizens throughout the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs is one which does not obtrude itself on the public, in the sense that the relationship between the officers of the Department and the public is not as pronounced as it is in the case of several other <Col N="1358" /> Departments.  We members of the public are inclined to take for granted, to a very great extent, the results of the inner planning and inner workings of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I want to say that I do not think that in any other Department of State, or in any other aspect of our business life, has there been such a rapid advance in both the mechanics and the efficiency of their application as there has been in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, since the war.  It is quite a pleasure, not alone to enjoy the benefits of improved mechanism, by way of using the telephone or faster postal services, but it is an even greater pleasure still, when making such contacts, to find the human element in the officers of the Department so pronounced, and to find them so ready and willing to help.</P>
      <P>I refer particularly to the telephone exchanges, not alone in Dublin, but throughout the country, and, in mentioning them, I should like to pay a special tribute to those operators who control cross-channel operations.  In fact, I have heard tributes paid to them by operators in Continental capitals. Whenever there is a breakdown due to sudden storm, lightning, or any of the other things which tend to cause breakdowns, one cannot help being struck by the rapidity with which the situation is attacked and the speed with which repairs are effected.</P>
      <P>It is a rather remarkable feature of the Minister's annual report that there is an increase, both in local and trunk calls, and, at the same time, an increase in the number of letters sent through the post.  Before I looked at these statistics, I should have thought that the increased use of the telephone might well have caused a decrease in the use of ordinary postal services. Such, however, does not seem to be the case and it is rather pleasant to know that one particular side of the activities of the Post Office does not operate to the detriment of the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree that any reluctance to use the telephone, particularly by way of trunk calls, is due to the charges.  I think our charges are reasonable and the only complaint I <Col N="1359" /> would make with regard to charges for trunk calls is the lack of&mdash;not uniformity of charge&mdash;but the lack of uniformity of the coins in use.  I have made three or four calls recently in country areas, from one country town to another, where the charge in different cases was 1/5d. and 1/1d.  It is extremely difficult to have 1/5d. ready, whereas 1/6d. would do just as well, and nobody would have any complaint about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very often done. The system of express letters is also a very good one, the use of which gives a considerable advantage. I do not agree with the suggestion of Deputy Moloney that the Post Office should be asked to undertake what I am sure would be a considerable extra cost in installing some kind of letter boxes in long distance buses and long distance trains.  Having regard to the modes of conveyance, I think that would have the effect of delaying deliveries, whereas, under the present system, as somebody mentioned, one can post letters in Dublin up to 6 o'clock in the evening&mdash;particularly in this House&mdash;and they will be delivered in any part of Ireland the following morning.  I do not think that can be improved upon.</P>

      <P>The fact that Deputy Sweetman and I occupy the front bench of the Opposition does not necessarily mean we have to agree on all matters of detail.  Matters of principle, of course, are another subject.  I think that Deputy Sweetman is probably affected very much by the exclusion of Naas from the proposed reduced charges, but that does not affect me in any way because my charges will be much the same.</P>

      <P>Possibly.  I want to say that I am quite satisfied with the telephone facilities and telephone <Col N="1360" /> charges in so far as they relate to long distance, as between Dublin and Mayo, and as in operation in Mayo also.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Moloney, I want to pay a tribute, but perhaps from a different motive, to the sub-postmasters and the postmen who operate the service in rural areas.  I do not think that in the human attribute of being obliging, of being tactful and being helpful, these people can be surpassed and, indeed, the remuneration which they receive is altogether out of joint in relation to the service which they provide.  I know it will be argued in the case of sub-postmasters that there is always some other business on their premises and the post office being on their premises is a help towards the promotion and advancement of their businesses.  Such an argument, however, does not take away from the fact that a sub-post office in the country is a miniature Department in itself and is, by and large, handled with tremendous care and great honesty.</P>
      <P>We are inclined to take this service for granted from the honesty point of view.  It often strikes me, as I am sure it strikes other people, that when one puts an envelope into a post box, whether the envelope contains an ordinary communication, or some valuable security, is of no consequence.  The mere act of putting that letter into a box to be collected by an employee of the Post Office and transmitted in the usual way to the addressee is a great act of faith, and that act of faith is justified almost 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is a great tribute to the method of recruitment, to the staffs of sub-post offices and the people responsible for the delivery of the letters, and even the people dealing with money inside, that the incidence of defalcation is so low and the amounts involved in defalcations so small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the sub-post office, I think that that very high tradition of honesty, integrity and efficiency, is due to the pride a family takes in having charge of a post office over a long number of years, running from generation to generation, and it is a very commendable practice in the Post Office that where a sub-post office <Col N="1361" /> is in a family for a certain length of time, without advertising on the occasion of a change, the Department turns it over to another member of the family on a death or resignation. Looking around the country, one finds that the highest degree of efficiency and the highest standard of honesty obtains where there is that family tradition.  Recruitment by any other means, except, of course, where it is absolutely necessary, should be conducted with the greatest possible care and I speak for all sides of the House, I hope, when I say that efficiency should never take second place to political influence in the method of recruitment.  In my own experience, I have seen a few cases where political influence prevailed and the Post Office suffered as a result.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of rural deliveries now involves a six-day service for everybody, and it must afford a great measure of convenience to the people. Indeed, it affords a great measure of relief to some of us who have to write letters from time to time on behalf of the man across the road who used to object that he got his letters on only three days of the week, whereas his neighbour on the other side had a six-day delivery.  The allegation was always made that he got this six-day service because he was supporting the Government in power. Of course, such allegation was groundless but it was very difficult to deal with.  In any event, it is a welcome change and a welcome reorganisation and the only thing to be deplored is that some hardship was inflicted, but I think it was kept to a minimum. The post office people responsible for the reorganisation kept as their principal consideration that whatever hardship was caused by redundancy or extra mileage should be held down to the very minimum level.</P>
    <P>The question of the issue of commemorative or anniversary stamps has already been adequately debated. I agree with Deputy Sweetman with regard to the time between the announcement and the issue being too short in order to get the best possible benefit.</P>
    <P>With regard to telegrams I had an <Col N="1362" /> idea, and I think it was correct, that the charges which were increased some time ago were designed to kill the service, as such, because it was not paying.  I do not know whether or not it would be a good thing to kill it altogether, having regard to the continuing habit of sending telegrams of sympathy or congratulation as the occasion warrants. The telegram has been adopted as the handy way out in such instances. Perhaps it might be possible to reduce the charges on those occasions by having a section of the Post Office&mdash;I merely put this out as a suggestion; I do not know if it would work at all&mdash; devoted to those kinds of messages. They could be transmitted by telephone to the office or the sub-office in the area where the addressee resides and the messages could be recorded and sent to the person concerned in bulk rather than going through the laborious process of sending on separate sheets the messages which people choose to send on such occasions.</P>
    <P>The savings service of the Post Office is an excellent service, and the decline which is shown here, while not a welcome one, can hardly be blamed upon those who operate the service. After all, the question of savings is determined by two factors: the desire or the capacity of the people to save. Some people may have the capacity and not the desire, while others may have the desire without the capacity. A drop such as is recorded here is certainly a reflection of one of the two, or both, and it is something which might be countered by an attractive programme of savings advertisements. I do not think it is really a matter for the Post Office itself.  It is a matter largely for the Government as a whole, and not only for the Government as a whole, but all public people, lay and clerical, should devote some of their time to exhortations in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased number of meetings and the better relationships between the sub-postmasters' organisation and the Post Office generally. The rate of remuneration for sub-postmasters should certainly be increased. In many cases, they have to <Col N="1363" /> employ an operative who must be qualified in every aspect of post office work.  Mind you, it is extraordinarily interesting that while the present rate of pay obtains, if a sub-post office has to get an operative, say, from the staff of the principal office in the area, the amount charged is tremendous.</P>
    <P>I had an experience recently in which I must say I was very fairly met by the Post Office.  I had to make representation in a case where a person from the principal office in the area was lent or seconded to a sub-office during an emergency which lasted for about five weeks.  One could almost employ a top-notch film star to come to the Cork Festival for the rate which was levied against the sub-office in that case.  It was reduced considerably after representations but it still remained rather high.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister the very best and I am quite sure that he will act in his new capacity as reasonably as he acted when a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to add my good wishes to the many expressions of goodwill to the new Minister for the future.  I, too, should like to suggest to him that the special telegrams of greeting or condolence, which have increased in numbers, as has been said, should have a specially low rate.  I do not think that would cause any loss but rather would show increased revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly interested in asking the Minister to introduce the reverse charge system.  Business people would appreciate such a system, as has been said by Deputy Sweetman. If one is travelling through the country late at night or, at any time, one has to try to find Irish sixpences and pennies for trunk calls costing 2/3d. or 2/9d. or, as has been suggested, 2/1d.  The introduction of a system of reversing the charges would be very beneficial and indeed, again, I think would lead to increased revenue.  A person travelling merely gets in touch with the supervisor or the operator and the person at the other end is asked if he will receive a reversed <Col N="1364" /> charge call.  This would be a very beneficial change.  It is very difficult late at night or when travelling or even in the daytime always to have the necessary coins.  I hope the Minister will investigate this matter as the inauguration of such a system would be of great benefit to the country generally.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the position of Post Office pensioners retired about 15 or 20 years ago.  Their pension was based on the salary or wages they were receiving at the time of their retirement.  In view of the great change that has taken place in the value of money it must be recognised that in justice these pensions should be reviewed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I wish to congratulate the Minister on his elevation to his present post.  I think I can justifiably say to the officers and officials under him that they have a decent man in charge of the Department.  The fact that he is so efficient himself will make his task all the easier.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I asked why a half-day is not granted to all grades of postal staffs.  I cannot understand how it is that the Government can order the ordinary citizen to grant a half-day to his employees while they are not prepared to extend the same privilege to their own employees.  I was told that this matter was under active consideration.  From what I can gather, this matter has been under active consideration for the past three or four years.  I wonder what is meant by &ldquo;active&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that the postal services are beginning to pay their way.  I wonder if we are getting such good and efficient services as are alleged.  Galway Corporation asked the Department to consider a late-night collection at Salthill to meet the cross-Channel boat. Salthill is one of the most important tourist centres in the country and, during the summer, the number of people there is very large indeed.  It cannot be held that the type of collection that may be adequate there in the winter is adequate in the height of the tourist season.  We have a late collection in <Col N="1365" /> the city in order to catch the cross-Channel mail and surely it is not too much to ask for a late collection for the same purpose at Salthill.</P>
    <P>The postal authorities were asked to provide a telephone kiosk at Mervue. Various reasons were given as to why they would not do so.  This estate is about 1½ or two miles from the city and the people there should not be isolated.  There is such a thing as an emergency.  There is also the possibility of loss of life.  I understand that there is a box in a private house but one cannot knock up people at two or three o'clock in the morning.  Furthermore, the estate is situated on the fringe of an agricultural area.  A person might need a veterinary surgeon urgently.  Then, again, people frequently require a doctor or a priest urgently.  I put it to the Minister and to the Department that they should look into this matter again.</P>
    <P>On the question of efficiency, I understand there has been a changeover in the city from horse vans to motor vans.  Has there been a resultant saving?  Perhaps it is too early to give an answer to that question as one may have to consider the position over a period of years.  I have my doubts as to whether there has been greater efficiency or economy as a result of the change-over.</P>
    <P>Cable-laying at a fairly heavy rate has taken place in Galway.  I want to know if, when these cables are laid, there will be expedition in the installation of the telephones which are required.  There is a back-log of such applications.  Deputies are under pressure to have the installation of telephones expedited.  Possibly the delay and the back-log have been due to the fact that hitherto there was a lack of cables.</P>
    <P>I notice that in areas where people take over offices which had a phone it takes a long time to have the phone put back again.  I have heard of several cases in Galway where there has been a change of business and where there has been difficulty in having the phone reconnected.  Surely that is most uncalled for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> Once again, I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to his new post.  We have a decent man as Minister. I would say he will be just as efficient as he is decent.  I regret we have lost the former Minister from the Department but we hope we shall not lose him from the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, I have a number of complaints.  It is difficult to complain to a Minister who has just been appointed so he can take my criticisms in the form of suggestions.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the cost of renting a telephone.  The Minister ought to help small people to install a telephone or assist them to make up their minds to install a telephone.  Here is the average cost of rental.  A person gets a bill for two months for £1. 0. 2. worth of calls at the rate of 2d a call but the rental is £1. 17. 6.  That means that the average small person must pay 5½d. for every phone call.  If the cost of the calls is only £1. 0. 2. and the cost of the rental is £1. 17. 6. obviously it works out that the cost of each call is approximately 5½d.  It is all right for business people.  They are making money out of it.  Sometimes they can make quite a profit on telephone calls. The small man is making nothing out of them and that should be taken into consideration.  The rental should be reduced so as to encourage the small man.</P>
      <P>Consider the position of city or town councillors.  They are not paid.  They do not get even the price of a stamp. However, they are public representatives. They do much more work than a member of the Dáil.  I am a member of the Dáil and a City Councillor but 90 per cent. of my work is as a Councillor.  I have to do a lot of telephoning. I am not talking about myself because there is some allowance here.  However, consider the case of a Councillor who has only a small job. How can he pay for a telephone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am on the subject of rentals, I suggest the Minister should allow free calls to public representatives.  It is not fair to ask a man like a councillor or a T.D. to spend his few shillings doing a public service.  He does not benefit personally and it would help <Col N="1367" /> him to help the public if he were allowed a certain number of free calls.</P>
    <P>I have a Question down for to-day in connection with queueing for children's allowances in Finglas village. About a month ago, I was asked to go to Finglas and there I counted 70 people lined up outside the post office to get their children's allowances.  It takes about two minutes to deal with each person so that the average length of time a person must queue is two hours.  What is the cause of that? Are there complaints in respect of other post offices?  Is it that the post office in Finglas is too small or that there is not enough service there?  Is it that the people are not capable of dealing with the business or is it that they have a shop and that they are dealing with their own private business as well as with State customers? Anyway I invite the Minister to investigate the queueing which takes place every month at Finglas where the accommodation is so inadequate that people have to queue on the street.</P>
    <P>I criticised Radio Éireann last year and said they were producing &ldquo;ham&rdquo; shows.  I must correct that.  Some of the shows bore me and bore others, but the morning broadcasts are good. There is the news and good music in the morning and at night there is the Sweepstakes programme which is also good.</P>

      <P>Very good.  During the year, Questions were tabled asking if the Minister would consider the issue of a certain stamp.  As an old Fianna man, I thought the Minister would have taken into consideration that the Fianna is the oldest organisation outside the Republican Brotherhood.  It was organised in 1909 and should have been paid that tribute of having a stamp issued in its honour.  This is the 50th anniversary of its founding.  If it were not for the Fianna, there might not have been so many participants in 1916 or 1921.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to refer, that is election addresses. I understand the system is that the Government and the Opposition divide a certain amount of time on Radio Eireann for election purposes. We all know who the Government are but who are the Opposition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go over what many other Deputies have spoken about but I should like to dwell on a matter which is a source of grievance not only in my constituency but all over the country, that is, in relation to sub-postmasters.  They are a wonderful group of people.  They are the oracles in the various villages and do a great deal of work.  Goodness knows what qualifications they had when they went into the service&mdash; I am not questioning that&mdash;but I do not think any examination could test the <Col N="1369" /> qualifications they have, how obliging they are and how they can meet the various problems that arise.  I have known cases where the sub-postmistress in the depth of winter having had a telegram delivered to her and having nobody to deliver it to the people to whom it was addressed, would trudge away in the rain and would say to me or somebody else whom she met:&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose it is against regulations but will you deliver that to so and so? He must have it to-night.&rdquo;  These are the fine things about the service these people give.  I know no Minister or his officers would ever bring any of the sub-postmasters or sub-postmistresses to book for doing a thing like that. These are little elasticities under the system.  These people, not having been brought into the service in a regular fashion, not having been bound down by red tape, seem to be able to put it over.</P>
      <P>In relation to the unestablished servants in the new Minister's Department, I wish to bring to his notice cases involving great hardship.  People with up to 40 years' service who were not established were discarded like old shoes.  It is all right to say they were kept on a few years extra or that there was a new system by which they could do examinations.  These people could not pass examinations.  They do the job they have to do and they do it well and for doing that job well all these years, as many of them have done it, they should be given consideration. When a man has served so long in the Post Office, goodness knows he has not so many years left, and there should be some means of establishing him.  His years of service should establish him and entitle him not just to a gratuity but to some kind of small pension.  I put that to the Minister because I know he is a generous man. I know his officials in the Department might have been tied up by some old regulations but I think it is time we got away from these now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as telephones are concerned, it is a welcome present for people throughout the country that the areas around the various centres have been extended so that the people can go further afield for their 2d.  The Minister <Col N="1370" /> and his Department are to be congratulated on that as an excellent policy.</P>
    <P>I also want to pay tribute to the personnel of the telephone section all over the country.  I have never had any discourtesy on the telephone and the only time I have known of discourtesy over the telephone it has come from subscribers.  I mentioned this in other places.  Even some of the best-mannered and nicest people forget their manners when they pick up a telephone to speak to an operator. That is to be deplored and it is no harm to mention it and to say to such people that they should be more appreciative of the very good service they get.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Ormonde, my colleague from Waterford, had to resign the office of Minister for health reasons.  When I say that I know the present Minister will not consider it in any way a reflection on him because I have already congratulated him on his appointment and I wish him well in this office.  I feel sure that he and his Department will be able to surmount the difficulties and cope with the complaints mentioned by Deputy Sweetman this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the expressions of regret that Deputy Ormonde, for health reasons, found it necessary to resign from his post as Minister.  I think the House will share the hope that the Deputy may soon be restored to good health and enabled to play a continuing and active part in the deliberations of this House.  I should like also to congratulate the new Minister.  He comes to a Department which has a great tradition of public service.  He will be well served by competent and extremely able advisers.  He will have the comforting knowledge that the staff of his Department have a long tradition of public service and a sense of dedication to that service and to the people. He will be the successor of many interesting people, the successor of Rowland Hill, the author of the penny post.  If he does not feel that is sufficiently regal, he is the successor to the house of Durham&mdash;I think Lord Stanley was at one time Postmaster-General <Col N="1371" /> and ruled the destinies of this country.  He has the unenviable reputation that when the Post Office staff, whose wages were less than £1 per week, sought an increase he described the staff as &ldquo;bloodsuckers and blackmailers.&rdquo; I do not think the present Minister will take any pride in that administrative predecessor.</P>
      <P>It would be unfair to a new Minister to raise, in a contentious way, matters appropriate to his Department and therefore the matters I raise are in the main suggestions which I should like him to examine in the hope that he can find a remedy for existing difficulties.</P>
      <P>The first point&mdash;possibly the Minister can answer this when replying&mdash; is the position of the new sorting office in Dublin.  It would take weeks to recount the long struggle going back to 1922 to have a new sorting office erected in Dublin.  I do not want to embarrass the Minister by recalling the many promises that were made by his illustrious predecessors as to when they hoped this new sorting office would be erected.  However, we are now, I think, on the threshold of some developments in that field.  I understood the cost of this building was originally about £1,000,000.  The estimate was revised, I think, to £800,000 and the latest estimate, I believe, is about £600,000.</P>
      <P>I should like to find out from the Minister, if he can conveniently give the information, what is the explanation for this chopping and changing with the estimate.  I hope the Minister and the Department generally are not the victims of the parsimony so characteristic of the Department of Finance in matters of this kind.  I am sorry for Deputy Sweetman but not even a great reformer such as he is was able to effect in a short period the transformation which the Department of Finance has so long defied. I want to warn the Minister that one of the characteristics of the Post Office is to provide buildings and then live sufficiently long to lament their failure to provide adequate accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present G.P.O. and the public counter there, although it has been <Col N="1372" /> erected relatively recently&mdash;certainly within living memory&mdash;are now altogether too small for the requirements. That is characteristic of Post Office building generally.  All the earlier buildings simply do not fit the needs of today because the Post Office has taken on new responsibilities.  Its activities extend into wider fields than then with the result that in many cases the Post Office is at its wits' end to find additional accommodation, having built itself into a confined area where it now finds it utterly impossible to get the accommodation, which is so necessary for the transaction of public business.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will fight against any attempt by the Department of Finance to cut down the size of the building or limit the adequacy of it. As I understand it, the building is to be erected in an area that will need not only good ventilation but good heating. I hope the amenities of the place, in respect of air conditioning and heating, will not be sacrificed merely to gain in 1959, 1960 or 1961 some temporary advantage which will be lost completely with the effluxion of time.  I trust the Minister will be able to give us some information on this matter as to what the Department's intentions are in regard to the new office and when he expects work on the building will commence.  I trust he will be able to assure us that it is not intended, by the reduction in the estimate, to curtail facilities which he must know are essential in respect of a staff which works round the clock in the Central Sorting and Delivery Office in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The next question I want to raise for the Minister's edification and in the hope of securing a sympathetic reaction from him is the position of auxiliary postmen.  The Minister represents a rural constituency and I am sure he knows that auxiliary postmen are part-time employees who serve the Post Office for 40, 45 or 50 years and that during that period of service their wages are low and it is impossible for them to make provision for the rainy day which comes in the winter of life to everybody.  The Post Office provides them with no pension whatever on retirement.  It is true they may get <Col N="1373" /> a gratuity on retirement provided they can establish they are in necessitous circumstances.  If they fail to do that, because they have a good son or daughter to help the parents in the winter of life, the Post Office says to them &ldquo;That is a very good son or daughter you have.  We certainly do not need to give you anything&rdquo;, although the person may have had 40 or 50 years' service.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he ought to endeavour to get the means test in respect of that gratuity abolished.  I am sure the Minister, if he had an employee for 40 or 50 years, would hardly let him go out of office without recognising the service he gave by means of a gratuity or pension. The Post Office somehow or other, notwithstanding the human character of many of its ideals, has always been able to steel itself to a situation in which a person who has given 40 or 50 years' service is retired from the Post Office without a penny, without any pension whatever.  I know in this case that the nigger in the woodpile is the Department of Finance and not the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Still, the sympathy of the Minister is important in this matter. I would ask the Minister to examine, as soon as he finds time, the possibility of abolishing the means test for the small gratuity which is at present payable in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I understand, too, that the question of paying a pension to auxiliary postmen on their retirement has been under consideration for a few years past and that it has been the subject of examination by the Civil Service Staff Side, on the one hand, and representatives of the Department of Finance on the other.  Here again I know the Minister himself personally cannot give any decision on the matters in dispute.  But I would suggest to him that he should endeavour to arrange with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to bring this matter to a speedy conclusion, so as to ensure that persons who served the Post Office for 40 or 50 years as auxiliary postmen, and whose incomes do not enable them to <Col N="1374" /> make provision for their old age, would be enabled on retirement from the Post Office to receive a pension in recognition of their long and faithful service.</P>
    <P>The question of Post Office buildings is a matter to which I should like to call the Minister's attention.  It is only too obvious from visits to offices throughout the country that many of these are in need of reconstruction with a view to providing adequate accommodation not only for the staff to deal with the work but for the transaction of public business as well.  The Post Office has made an effort, especially in recent years, to provide new offices where these were needed.  I should like to congratulate the Post Office on the design of some of the new offices and on the consideration given to the provision of amenities for the staff.  Some of these new offices are a great credit to the Post Office and to all associated with their erection, but there are too few of them throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Many offices, as the Minister's predecessor indicated recently in reply to a Parliamentary Question by me, are still in need of reconstruction and renovation. I hope the Minister will be able to find time to get down to the question of pushing forward with a comprehensive scheme for the erection of new offices where they are necessary and for the expansion of existing offices where that is a possibility, and generally to take the post office out of the category of a dull, drab, uninteresting building.  After all, the Post Office is in the market to get customers, and the office ought to be a bright, cheerful and attractive building. In that way you can encourage customers to come to it.  Apart from new customers, the Post Office is under an obligation to the public to provide accommodation for the transaction of public business under conditions vastly better than are available to-day in many of these out-dated offices throughout the country.</P>
    <P>While on this point, I should like to call the Minister's attention to one aspect of post office buildings.  As the Minister knows, the Board of Works are responsible for the provision of new office buildings and for the carrying out of works of reconstruction and <Col N="1375" /> renovation on them.  But it frequently occurs that, even when a small job has to be done on an office, the whole machinery of the Board of Works has to be invoked to get that job done.  I appreciate the need, where some substantial job has to be done, to ensure that the work is carried out under Board of Works supervision and that the requisite technical experience is brought to bear on whatever job has to be done.  But it frequently happens that small jobs, which could be done by a local contractor through the instrumentality of the local postmaster, become involved in the procedure of Board of Works machinery and it takes quite a while to get even the smallest job done unless it is of the most urgent character.</P>
    <P>I know that if somebody breaks the glass in the front window of an office, the postmaster is authorised to have it repaired; and if somebody runs away with the front door of the office, the postmaster is entitled to get another door as quickly as he can.  But there are a whole lot of minor jobs within the office which do not arise because somebody runs away with the door or breaks the window, and a postmaster ought to be allowed to arrange to have them carried out, without cluttering up the whole Board of Works machinery and without having to endure the long delays inevitable once a relatively small job gets into a machine like the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>I want to call the Minister's attention to the question of uniform clothing for postmen.  The present quality of the uniform supplied to them is not good.  It is the kind of material that easily attracts dust and dirt and, because of the character of their work, it tends to make the uniform untidy after a very short period.  The Minister ought to examine the possibility of supplying postmen with a better quality uniform. It is essential for the public service that postmen should be neat and tidy when on duty.  They cannot be tidy if the quality of the uniform supplied to them is such that it loses its shape because of its softness and the way it is fashioned and because it easily <Col N="1376" /> attracts dust.  The Minister might give consideration to the question of providing a better type of uniform, one that would hold its shape and appearance and not be such a dust collector as the present uniform is.  If the Minister could do that, I think it would occasion very little additional cost.  It would make a great difference to the appearance of the postmen.  The Minister will hardly deny that it is his aim and ambition to ensure that the quality of the uniform supplied is of a type calculated to make the postman a public servant for whom the general public will have nothing but admiration.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to raise is the reorganisation of the telegraph section of the Department.  I do not expect the Minister to know all the ins-and-outs of this, because it is a complex technical problem, but his advisers know all about it.  I do not intend to deal with the issues involved; the Minister will have access to his officials and can make himself informed on the matter. I merely want to leave a few thoughts with the Minister.</P>
    <P>New methods of signalling and new methods of telegraphic transmission have produced what can only be described as a revolution so far as the telegraph section of the Department is concerned.  This section was founded and built upon the operation of the Morse code.  Morse has now virtually disappeared.  A large number of people are employed in this section of the Department.  So far as they are concerned, that is their life.  Their economic outlook and their hopes of promotion have all centred round the survival of the section in which they work, if not in its expansion, at least in its maintenance.  Because of the new methods the personnel in this section has fallen considerably.  That cannot be avoided because telegraphic traffic has fallen considerably, not alone here but in every country in the world.</P>
    <P>Human beings are involved in this matter.  The Post Office has endeavoured to meet the problem the best way it can, but there are still quite a number of people whose whole working life has been associated with telegraphy. I think the Post Office hopes to get rid of redundancy in this section by transferring the officers concerned <Col N="1377" /> to other activities in the Post Office. That will mean a great wrench for these people.  They have been associated with this work for 20, 30, or more, years and they will not find it easy at this stage of their lives to assimilate new work.</P>
    <P>By the reorganisation methods adopted in the telegraph section the Post Office has saved a very substantial sum.  It knows it will save more as time goes on.  I would appeal to the Minister to look at this matter not just from the point of view of a satisfactory balance sheet but from the point of view of the human beings involved and the hardship imposed on them if they are transferred to new types of work and new surroundings.  Instead of transferring these people to other sections I would urge on the Minister that he should allow the problem of redundancy to be solved by permitting the normal retirements, marriages, deaths and other wastage to rectify the position.  That would solve the problem in two or, at the most, in three years.</P>
    <P>The Post Office ought to share some of the money saved on the reorganisation of the telegraph section with the staff to avoid imposing hardships of the kind I have mentioned.  There is a human element involved.  It is not a case of moving pieces on a draught board or a chess board.  I urge the Minister to take counsel with his advisers in the hope that they will put on their humanistic spectacles when they are examining this matter and find a solution for the problem on the lines I have suggested rather than uproot people from a branch in which they have given long service for the purpose of transferring them to new work with which they will be entirely unfamiliar.  If the Minister acts on the lines I suggest he will have the comforting knowledge that the problem was not solved by the adoption of methods which imposed hardship on staff.  I do not expect the Minister to deal with the matter to-day.  He has not yet found his sea legs.  I mention the matter to give the Minister an opportunity of examining the situation as sympathetically as possible at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>There are just a few brief remarks I want to make on this Estimate.  The scheduled time for drivers is not enough.  The speed at which they have to drive now constitutes a danger both to themselves and to the public at large.  Some twelve months ago there was a change made in my constituency and the driver in a particular case is not allowed enough time to complete his journey.  Country roads, as everybody knows, are rough and twisting.  In country districts it should not matter very much if a driver is allowed an extra half hour in which to do his journey.  I think country drivers should be allowed at least half an hour more.</P>
      <P>Postmen in general should be both permanent and pensionable.  It is an intolerable situation that a postman who has given service for upwards of 55 years should find himself, at the end of that time, without a pension.  All postmen should be permanent and, like other permanent officials, they should be pensionable.</P>
      <P>I had a particular experience in my constituency last Christmas.  Generally postmen are given relief to help them with the Christmas rush.  In my constituency application was made for relief, but it was turned down.  I raised this matter with the Minister's predecessor. Again, it is not on the 22nd or 23rd December that these relief men should be appointed.  It should be given at least eight to ten days before Christmas Eve so that letters and parcels will not accumulate to such an extent that the postmen cannot carry them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The telephone service in my constituency is appalling.  Sometimes it takes an hour to get a call over a 50 mile radius.  It would take a shorter time to travel the distance by car.  The Minister may tell me that they are working on the service and that in a week's time there will be eight lines instead of five.  That may be the case but I complained about this matter on the Estimate last year and the year before.  It is not when the summer rush is on, when the tourist season is at its height, that these things should be attended to.  The service should be installed before that.  When work is being carried out on a 50-mile line, <Col N="1379" /> say, from Galway to Clifden, or to any other part of the West, two or three gangs should be employed, one at each end and one in the centre.  That would speed up the work.  Another complaint that I have heard throughout my constituency is that the lines are not very clear and that at times it is impossible to hear the conversation.</P>
    <P>This morning Deputy Sweetman complained that a letter posted in Dublin was not delivered to his constituency within the normal time. I had the same experience within the last 12 months.  There is a great deal of truth in what he says.  When I complained I was told that the delay probably occurred in the G.P.O. in Galway but I discovered that it had not, that whatever mistake was made was made in the sorting office in Dublin.  I hope there will not be a recurrence of such delays.</P>
    <P>In all cities throughout the State, in the tourist season, the Minister should arrange for later postal collections to facilitate tourists.  It would also facilitate businessmen who are busy during the day.  Their letters would be despatched more quickly to their destinations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on behalf of sub-postmasters. In my opinion, sub-postmasters give very loyal and devoted service to the State.  Those who are on the smaller exchanges which have a round-the-clock telephone service now, are, for the remuneration they receive, considerably overworked.  I would ask the Minister to direct his attention to that problem.  I know several post offices in small areas in my constituency which have a round-the-clock service where the man and wife have never been able to go out together.  They employ an assistant during the day but, naturally, the assistant goes off duty when the working day is over and then one or the other is tied to the telephone. There may not be many calls but it is their duty to be there.  They should be suitably remunerated for that service.  Taking into consideration the amount of work they do as State servants, in comparison with other <Col N="1380" /> classes of our official life, they are grossly underpaid.  That is a matter to which the Minister might give attention.</P>
      <P>Temporary postmen labour under considerable injustice.  Scattered throughout the country there are innumerable men who are employed in a temporary capacity as postmen and who can never become permanent due to some regulation, whatever it may be. I have known cases where men have served for as much as 35 and 40 years as temporary postmen and when their health fails they have to leave without any remuneration whatsoever.  Under the new system, there is a standard examination and probably the Minister's reply in this case will be that temporary postmen are not in a position to pass the examination.  It seems to me that that difficulty could be surmounted in some way.  If a man is able to read the addresses on letters and to deliver them and if he has given service of the highest integrity to the State over a certain period, it seems to me that that entitles him to become a permanent official.  Would it not be possible for the Minister and his officials to conceive a scheme whereby these people who have given loyal service could be transferred to the permanent staff and placed in a good position <i>vis-a-vis</i> those who come in many years after them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the telephone service, for some reason or other, in the area where I live, there is more or less continuous noise on the line.  The officials have done their best to counteract it and I would be the first to admit that there has been considerable improvement in the service generally along the East coast and in the reception.  Some years ago the reception was very bad and considerable attention was given to the matter by experts.  They decided that it was in some way due to noise from E.S.B. terminals or wires in the area.  That was corrected but I have noticed in the last few months a tendency for these things to go wrong again and there is very often a whistling noise which interferes with calls, not necessarily long distance calls. Perhaps the Minister would consider looking into the matter.  The East <Col N="1381" /> coast is always forgotten but I would direct the Minister's attention to the fact that there is a considerable tourist season there which contributes a considerable amount to the central Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Another point with regard to the telephone service is that country people find the three minute period for a trunk call very, very short.  If the postal authorities were to extend the period for a trunk call, it might benefit not only those using the telephone but the revenue as a whole.  People in Dublin do not realise the difficulties that country people undergo in connection with trunk calls.  We have to wait a long time to get on.  If you ring a large institution, a hospital or such institution, you have absolutely no hope of getting the person you want inside three minutes.</P>
    <P>In fact, I happened to be in a Garda barracks recently when one of the Guards was trying to find out how his wife was in hospital.  He spent 12 minutes on the phone before he could get the person he was looking for.  It must have cost him something like 14/- or 15/- before he was finished.  He heard his wife was not dead and then the 12 minutes were up and he was cut off.  One is limited on a public telephone to 12 minutes, which is four periods of three minutes each.  I would suggest that it would be worth while for the Minister to introduce a system of four minutes and extend it to the full period, if necessary.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of people come here from across the Channel. They take houses and they have to be in telephonic communication with their businesses on the other side.  By facilitating such people, you will get more calls and more people will come over here.  I have nothing further to say except that I have always personally received every consideration from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I wish the Minister, as the new appointee, every success in his high office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to say that I am grateful to Deputies, practically every one of them, for the personal good wishes they extended to <Col N="1382" /> me.  I felt, when I heard Deputy Sweetman, that I would be in for an extended amount of criticism directed towards the activities of the Post Office generally.  In tendering advice to me, Deputy Sweetman described me as a courteous man.  He seemed to imply that a courteous person would not be a very good administrator. I feel that in respect of a person in a Ministerial position or any other position in which he is called upon to handle staff, there is no necessity to reintroduce the old Sergeant Major methods of dealing with the day to day questions of an administrative kind, especially in a large Government office such as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I hope that, as long as I am in this office, with natural courtesy and a fair approach to the problems which face me as Minister, I shall be able to obtain from the staff immediately around me and from the staffs all over the country the co-operation that courtesy and a natural approach can get from persons who give their service to the State for remuneration.</P>
      <P>I have not heard in this debate many complaints about the administration of the Post Office.  In so far as the letter service is concerned and the point made by Deputy Sweetman that it appears that Naas and Co. Kildare were not as well served as they should be in the delivery of letters which are posted in Dublin and elsewhere, I wish to say that, taking into consideration that the Post Office deals with such a large amount of letters, the complaints generally coming in are very few.  In regard to this complaint, I understand there are two despatches daily from Dublin to Naas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the night mail at 8 p.m. and the day mail at 6 a.m.  Sub-post offices served from Naas and the town of Naas are afforded delivery which includes letters arriving by these two despatches.  Letters posted late in the evening in Dublin&mdash;as late as 10 p.m. in some cases&mdash;are due on the same delivery in Naas town next day and also in the rural areas for which Naas serves as a distribution centre.  If delays are occurring, the Department will be only too pleased to investigate any complaints. For this purpose, it requires <Col N="1383" /> the covers of the items concerned.  If there are persistent complaints in the Naas area, the persons concerned should pass on the covers.  I certainly shall see that the matters are fully investigated and if any action is needed, I shall see that such action is taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman asked about the 6d. rate and whether it qualifies for air transmission without surcharge.  The special air letter charges apply only to countries outside continental Europe.  There is a large poster on display at all post offices setting out the charges for the various categories of letters.  This notice makes it clear that a special air fee is not levied on letters to continental Europe. The Post Office counter staff should not be in any doubt on that score.  I do not think there is any necessity for me to ask the authorities to issue a special circular to the post offices concerned.</P>
      <P>We are not contemplating a cheaper greeting or sympathy telegram but we are considering how we could stimulate a greater use of this side of the telegram service.  In so far as Deputies made reference to the charges for telegrams and advocated their reduction the position is that even at the present price of 2/6d. per twelve words the telegram is still losing for the Post Office.  I would not consider it advantageous for us to reduce the charge from 2/6d. to 2/- for twelve words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that now so that it will be generally known that the telegram charge, as it stands, is not a paying <Col N="1384" /> proposition.  There is an over-night telegram service at a cheap rate and very little use is made of it.</P>
    <P>In so far as night telephone services are concerned, it is intended to convert all exchanges, large and small, to the automatic system.  The new system of charging recently announced is designed to assist this programme.  It may be unfortunate that the charge from Naas to Dublin, under the new system, is such as to give rise to complaint. Nevertheless, Deputy Sweetman will agree that, in setting out a programme of charges on such a system, there are bound to be places where such a situation will arise.  It is a fact, of course, that even in Naas the charges to other exchanges within the specified area in the Order which was made, will be reduced from the higher charge to the twopenny charge.  I cannot say at this stage that there will be any change in the situation in Naas in that regard.</P>

      <Col N="1385" /> Deputy Sweetman also asked for an explanation of my statement in regard to the repayments of annuities in respect of debt created under the Telephone Capital Acts.  Apparently he wished to know if these advances were being paid in less than the 25 year period.  &ldquo;Not greater than 25 years,&rdquo; was the phrase used by me in my statement. The advances for the purpose of development of the telephone service are paid in the form of annuities which commence in the financial year next after the calendar year in which the capital has been advanced.  They are repayable in equal half-yearly instalments of principal and interest combined. The period of repayment of loans raised under the Telephone Capital Acts, 1924-1946 is 20 years, and 25 years in the case of loans subsequent to the 1946 Act.  The rate of interest varies from 2½ per cent. on amounts advanced in 1946 to six per cent. on amounts advanced in 1957 and 1958.  I presume the Deputy has sufficient information now on the matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised another point in regard to a reply given earlier in the year about an estimated loss of £40,000.  The figure of £200,000 which I included in my statement refers to the overall gain on all telegraphic, telephone and postal services and the estimated loss of £40,000 referred to in May referred only to postal services.  That is the explanation as to why we anticipated a profit of £200,000 at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>As far as the sale of stamps for philatelic purposes is concerned, I listened to the Deputy's advice and suggestions and tried to assimilate them.  I shall look into the matter, study the suggestions which he made and see what conclusions I can come to then.  I would not attempt now to give him a direct answer to the questions he raised.  In regard to his complaint that we did not give due or sufficient notice to philatelic agents and those interested in the purchase of stamps about our last issue, the announcement made on the 25th of June was the final announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> Three months earlier the Post Office had notified all agents, newspapers and periodicals both at home and abroad that the stamp would be issued in July. All those interested had ample notice.</P>
    <P>Philatelists are divided on the subject of the denominations.  A majority of them say that the denominations should be limited because, where more than two are issued, collectors consider they are being exploited.  That is a matter of opinion and we naturally follow the opinion of persons who claim to have expert knowledge on those questions.  I think I have covered all the points made by Deputy Sweetman in his speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <P>Several Deputies raised the question of the status of sub-postmasters throughout the country. This is a question which comes up for consideration by the consultative council and there are regular meetings between the Department and the sub-postmasters' union on the matter. Many of the questions raised deal with matters under consideration at the moment and, being such, I cannot offer any opinion as to what the outcome will be.  I presume that all such questions are of a continuing nature and that difficulties that arise between sub-postmasters, or any other employees of an office such as this, will be resolved in time.  We hope that as we progress, and are in a better position, we can meet the claims made by those who are seeking to have their conditions made better than they have been in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moloney raised the question of postal services generally and wanted to know what efforts were being made to improve efficiency.  I want to tell him that our quest for greater efficiency in rural areas goes on and no opportunity is neglected to obtain it.  In some cases desirable changes have to be postponed pending the occurrence of staff vacancies.  The Department generally adopts a sympathetic attitude towards its staff and does as much as it reasonably can to avoid imposing <Col N="1387" /> hardship on them.  In the reorganisation of services, it is not possible, however, to ensure that every member of the staff benefits.  Deputy Moloney can take it for granted that, in whatever reorganisation is taking place, the Post Office will give due consideration to the staff being replaced and will deal with the matter in a humane way.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the question raised with me here by Deputy Norton in regard to the telegraph service.  The Post Office take the view that they should do everything they possibly can to meet the situation in a humane way, but where redundancy is accelerated by the advancement of new techniques, above the normal rate that obtains generally, it may happen that some individuals may have to be provided with alternative employment somewhere else: but as regards the people engaged in this particular service which Deputy Norton has in mind, he can take it for granted, I think, that no person will be unfairly treated in so far as the Post Office officials can meet their case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have that assurance from the Minister.  May I suggest to him that if he does not recruit a new grade to do the new class of work, the existing redundancy will be cleared off in a matter of two or three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall look into that matter.  Deputy Moloney compared the intake of staff into the Post Office, that is, from temporary staff to permanent staff, with other Departments.  He seems to think that the Post Office did not permit of intake from its temporary staff into its permanent staff through limited competitions or limited interviews or examinations, as the case may be.  That is not so.  There is provision for the recruitment of staff into the Post Office from its temporary employees into its permanent staff. That intake, of course, is limited, as is understandable, and the competitions are not very frequently held.  Nevertheless, I would say that the intake compares as favourably as the intake from any other Department in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> Both Deputy Russell and Deputy Sweetman made reference to the savings movement.  It is a fact that there has been a reduction in the amount of money invested in savings in the Post Office by the general public.  There are various reasons advanced for that. Deputy Sweetman seemed to think that the increase in the cost of living was one reason.  It may very well be, but Deputy Sweetman knows as well as I do that Governments cannot deal adequately or fully or as they would wish with the cost of living figures or with the cost of living itself.</P>

      <P>Be that as it may, the Post Office savings have fluctuated up and down, if you take them over a long period.  The responsibility is primarily on the Minister for Finance. We act only as agents.  In so far as I am concerned, I shall do everything I can to promote the savings campaign. We provide the staff in the Post Office for the Bank and for the savings counters and we co-operate very closely with the Department of Finance.  We exploit every opportunity to push the savings idea.  I stand for that as a policy and I hope to continue to pursue that idea.  Whatever suggestions have been made here, I shall <Col N="1389" /> have a look at them and see if any of them can be adopted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Russell also raised the question of delay in installing telephones in Limerick.  There has been a substantial improvement over the past twelve months in regard to the installation of telephones in Limerick.  In fact, there are very few people waiting for service in Limerick and they have all applied within the past couple of months.  The position in Limerick compares favourably with that in other cities and large towns.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton raised other questions with me and was kind enough to say that he wished me to regard them only as suggestions and not as criticism &mdash;realising, as he did quite rightly, that I am new to the office of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and that he could not expect me to be <i>au fait</i> with all the questions raised.  He mentioned the Central Sorting Office in Dublin. The sketch plans for the new building have been approved, as I said yesterday evening in my opening statement, and the Office of Public Works is considering the type of structural design best suited to public requirements. This is a big building project and the preparation of the contract drawings will necessarily take a long time.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that a reduction in the estimated cost has taken place.  That reduction refers only to building expenditure, exclusive of heating, lighting, and ventilation services.  The reduction was secured by the elimination of certain basement accommodation, coupled with a modification of structural design and some saving of over-all floor area.  These changes do not involve any interference with or curtailment of planned staff facilities or amenities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton raised the question of auxiliary postmen&mdash;pensions and the abolition of the means test when considering gratuities for auxiliary postmen.  Some of those matters are under consideration, but I have not got full information on them yet.  I shall look into them, but I do not think I can hold out a great deal of hope about some of the matters he mentioned.  However, as I said, I shall have a look at these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> Deputy Norton also raised the question of minor jobs, minor reconstruction work and minor work throughout the country in local offices.  I can tell the Deputy that this matter is under review again.  Apparently there has been some improvement recently in that regard but it is another of the matters to which I shall have to give my personal consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there were any other matters of note raised during the debate that I must comment upon, but I should like to add that no development works in regard to Post Office services have been held up for want of capital, and any deficiencies that may exist are not due to that reason. A question on that score was raised by some Deputies and all I have to say is that that was not the reason. I shall have to look into these matters and discover what other reasons there were.</P>
    <P>Let my stay be long or short in my present office, I shall receive all Deputies who approach me with the courtesy to which they are entitled, in my view, and I shall endeavour to answer their complaints and meet their suggestions as far as I possibly can, at the same time, making it clear that whatever suggestions or complaints they make must be related to general policy administration by the Department in regard to Post Office services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £291,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926), including Public Concerts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount provided in the Wireless <Col N="1391" /> Broadcasting Estimate for 1959/60 is the same as was provided in 1958/59.</P>
    <P>While the Broadcasting Estimate is comparatively small in relation to the Estimates for the larger Departments and does not contain provision for any important schemes of national development like the Estimates for, say, Agriculture and Industry and Commerce, the service which broadcasting provides is of more intimate interest to the citizens generally than those of any Government Department; its output penetrates into practically every home in the country.</P>
    <P>As the House will appreciate, broadcasting services must be more concerned in their year by year working with a gradual improvement in standards of production rather than with spectacular innovations.  I may, however, refer to a few of the more important Radio Éireann productions. The most outstanding&mdash;although it could not be termed in the usual sense a production or a programme&mdash;was the coverage given to the illness and death of the late Holy Father, Pope Pius XII.  During that period, the broadcasting and television organisations of every country in the world&mdash; Catholic and non-Catholic&mdash;had converged on Rome and it was a task of some magnitude to obtain facilities for daily reporting on the illness of the Holy Father and on the obsequies, with on-the-spot recordings.  The arrangements in Rome had to be correlated at home with literally hour by hour cancellation of programmes already fixed.  Tributes were paid to Radio Éireann by ecclesiastical authorities and by the laity for the dignified manner in which the occasion was dealt with.  The ceremonies connected with the election and coronation of the new Holy Father were also satisfactorily dealt with.  I should pay public tribute to the authorities of the Vatican Radio for the notable help given to the Irish broadcasting service on both occasions.</P>
    <P>Other important events abroad covered by Radio Éireann included the European Games in Sweden and the opening of the transatlantic service by Aerlinte.  The most recent <Col N="1392" /> coverage of that sort was the President's visit to the United States. Radio Éireann was able to bring to its listeners first-hand on-the-spot reports and the voice of the President of Ireland on the historic occasion of his address to the United States Congress.</P>
    <P>Among the programmes produced at home, I might refer to the Thomas Davis lectures which have been broadcast on Sunday nights for the past few years.  These lectures have been a valuable experiment in adult education. To give them permanent form several of the series have been published in book form and have sold exceedingly well.  Some of them were published in co-operation with the Cultural Relations Committee of the Department of External Affairs, others by Radio Éireann itself, and the lectures on &ldquo;Irish Sagas&rdquo; are in course of publication in co-operation with the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.  The book on St. Patrick was sold out and a reprint had to be obtained.  Some of these books are on University courses and there is a constant demand for them.</P>
    <P>On the dramatic side, Radio Éireann continues to provide plays by dramatists of high world reputation as well as by native writers.  A variety of features have also been produced.  I might mention &ldquo;Meet the Showmen&rdquo; in which Éamonn Andrews had interviews with some of the more celebrated personalities in the entertainment world, including boxing promoters, television stars, and circus owners. &ldquo;Question Time&rdquo; is still in favour and has just celebrated its 21st year by a special contest confined to the winners and runners-up in the competitions held over the years.</P>
    <P>The newsroom has now built up a very detailed network for getting news from home sources, including the northern counties, and has also an elaborate source of supply for world news which is broadcast from an Irish standpoint.  I am glad to say that practically all the news, both home and foreign, in English has its counterpart in broadcasts in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra continues to give performances in the studios and public <Col N="1393" /> concerts both in Dublin and in the provinces.  It also takes part in opera in Dublin.  I should also mention the Light Orchestra.  Favourable comments were made on this orchestra last year and it was suggested that greater use should be made of it.  The Light Orchestra is now doing three programmes per week and they consist of such diversified music as light classical, Irish music and modern dance music. That is a heavy weekly schedule to rehearse and perform but I am glad to say that, in addition, the Light Orchestra gave public performances in Athlone, Waterford and Maynooth and of course they have regularly gone to Wexford to take part in opera.</P>
    <P>I should refer to the new radio studio centre at Cork which has now been in operation for more than a year.  The output of programme material from the Cork station has been maintained up to the highest expectations and it has enabled talent to be obtained from a large area of Munster which would not have been so readily available while there were studios only in Dublin.  Might I also mention that a string quartet, a combination that Radio Éireann has never had before, has been established in Cork and it will now take its place in the musical resources of the service alongside the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra, the Radio Éireann Light Orchestra, the Radio Éireann Singers, and the Radio Éireann Choral Society?</P>
    <P>The Radio Éireann transmissions are still suffering from interference both from local electrical apparatus and from foreign stations.  Everything possible is being done to assist in the removal of the local interference but nothing much can be done about the interference from foreign stations until a further wavelength plan is considered and has been adopted.</P>
    <P>Although nothing has been provided in this Estimate in respect of television, Deputies will expect me to say a few words about the subject.  Early last year, a Commission was set up to examine the question of the establishment of a television service.  The Commission has now reported, and the reports have been released for publication, apart from supplements <Col N="1394" /> referring specifically to proposals made confidentially.  The Government are considering the reports and what action should be taken on them.</P>
    <P>In advance of decisions on the whole problem, the Government have acted on an interim recommendation from the Commission and have acquired a site for a transmitter to serve Dublin and a large area of country around it. The acquisition of the site and the provision of the necessary road, water and electricity services to it may save some time later on in starting a service.  The cost of this preliminary step is, of course, trifling in relation to the total capital and operating cost of a television service.  The whole television question will, of course, come before the House soon&mdash;how soon I cannot say; meanwhile I should like to thank the members of the Television Commission for the large amount of time and study they devoted to the problem. I might add that when television is eventually in operation it will not lessen the need for maintaining a sound broadcasting service of a high standard.  That is what is being done in every country in Europe in which television has been established.</P>
    <P>I wish finally to thank Comhairle Radio Éireann, the Director, and the Broadcasting staff generally for their efficient conduct of Radio Éireann during the past year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do so for the purpose of widening the discussion which would otherwise possibly not be as wide.  The Minister has facilitated us on this Estimate, as on the previous Estimate, by circulating copies of his speech which enable us to keep a note of matters to which we wish to refer. However, I do not propose to make any comment in relation to Radio Éireann, partly because I am not a radio fan; partly because I lack, unfortunately, any musical ear and am, therefore, unable to make any comment on the performance of the Radio Orchestra; and partly because I do not want to get involved in a discussion on the work of Radio Eireann as I <Col N="1395" /> hear so many violently differing criticisms of its programmes and its performances.</P>
    <P>I want, however, to make a few remarks in reference to television, not in reference at all to any particular proposal or even to any method of providing a television service.  I think some of us do not realise the immense influence of television in the countries in which it is completely available or the immense influence it is likely to have in other countries.  Already in some areas it has moulded, and in others it will do more to mould the thoughts and habits of the people than even the national Press.  I do not think there is any doubt whatever that, as a medium of propaganda, it is far more powerful than even the newspapers or sound radio.</P>
    <P>We see when we read and we hear when we listen to the sound radio, but we get a combination of both with television, and we can be conditioned into a frame of mind, by a medium such as television programmes, in a way that is not at all possible other wise.  For that reason and because of the immense impact and effect it has had and will have it is of the greatest possible importance to Ireland that whatever is done in relation to a television service here should be done carefully, and after the most exhaustive inquiry.</P>
    <P>I must say that I entirely agree with the terms of reference which were set out for the Television Commission by the Minister's predecessor, but I am not sure that I entirely agree that those terms of reference were correctly interpreted by the members of the Commission. It may be, indeed, that there is always room for difference of opinion about the manner in which terms of reference should be interpreted.  There is, however, considerable difficulty in discussing television on the Estimate today because the report which has been made public is not the full report at all.  I am not attributing any blame whatever to the Minister or to the Commission in that respect.  I fully understand and appreciate that it was necessary for certain aspects of the matters which were discussed by the <Col N="1396" /> Commission to be confidential not only to the Government on the one hand, but to the proposers of the various schemes, on the other.</P>
    <P>I appreciate, therefore, that it was not possible to make public every piece of evidence that was given and every proposal that was put forward.  The main reports were made public but they are incapable of complete critical analysis without the information that the reports themselves say has been given in supplementals, privately and confidentially to the Government.  That is inevitable perhaps, but it makes it more clear that some other type of approach is necessary at this stage.</P>
    <P>Everyone will agree on the importance of ensuring that the impact of television on the Irish viewing public is such as to be in complete accord with national and economic policy. The reports suggest that we have, at the present time, some 30,000 sets here.  There were 20,000 sets in the country in the year previous to that in which the Commission started and, when they had concluded their report, there were some 30,000 sets.  It is visualised that that figure may rise to 100,000 sets after three years of operation. It may even rise to very near that figure when the British I.T.V. station opens its services in the Six Counties.  Even at the limited figure of 100,000 sets, it means a capital of £8,000,000 sunk in television receivers which, to put it midly, is a very very substantial figure in our circumstances. Where we may go afterwards in density of viewing sets can be seen from the position which obtains in other countries.</P>
    <P>In America, there is virtually 100 per cent. cover per family; virtually every family in America has a television set.  In Canada, the figure is about nine families out of ten.  Of course, in Europe the position is not anything like as fully developed as yet, but in Great Britain, which is the most fully developed European country, it is approximately one in every two families.  After Great Britain, there is a very big drop in the figure in the other countries in Europe and none of them reaches more than 15 per cent. of the families in each country. Sweden is probably next to Britain, <Col N="1397" /> having one in every seventh household, which is the same in Sweden as five television sets for every 100 inhabitants.</P>
    <P>When we see the development there has been on the one hand, and on the other hand, that it is not possible to make generally available to the public the evidence from the supplemental reports which is essential if we are to judge the merits of the main Television Report, we realise that we are faced with a very big problem.  As well as the supplements, I think the interim report to which the Minister referred was not published either.  I am not quite certain of that but I do not think it was published.</P>
    <P>One of the most disastrous things there could be in a service such as this, which will have such an immense impact on our national and economic life, is that it would become the plaything of Party politics.  It would be very much in the national interest that there should be the greatest degree of unanimity on what it is desirable to do about a television service.</P>
    <P>It would not be right or in the national interest that the Government of the day would set up a television service on one basis&mdash;when I say &ldquo;set up&rdquo; I mean <i>bona fide</i> in every way&mdash; in what they thought was the best way, and that another Government would come along in a few years and, because they had different ideas, attempt to change the service and its method of operation.  For that reason, I want to make this suggestion to the Minister. The commission have made it clear&mdash; and the Government also have made it clear that they are standing over that part of the commission's report&mdash;that much of the information on which a decision must ultimately be based is so confidential that it cannot be released to the public.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to suggest to his colleagues in the Government that the best way of ensuring that we would get a television service that would be above Party political lines and that would be dealt with as a real national service would be for him to call together an all-Party committee of this House to whom the confidential information could be made available <Col N="1398" /> and who would be in a position, therefore, to judge and assist objectively on that confidential information. In that way we could ensure that whatever service was set up would be one on which there would be the greatest degree of unanimity amongst our people on having the best possible service in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>Unless something like that is done, I cannot see how any decision, no matter how <i>bona fide</i> it may be made, could be judged objectively without the full information necessary for its judgment.  I do not expect the Minister to offer any comment on that suggestion now.  It is clearly a suggestion, coming as it does from us, that he would have to convey to his colleagues.  I do not expect he would be in a position to make a comment on it at this stage.</P>
    <P>I said earlier I personally accepted and agreed with the terms of reference of the commission.  As a country, I do not think we can afford to have the cost of a television service borne by public funds.  I do not think we can afford in our existing circumstances, when taxation is already too high, to do anything in relation to a television service that might mean that any part of its cost had to be borne out of the public purse.  Therefore, I personally entirely agree with the limitation included in the warrant of appointment to the television service that no charge should fall on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I differ with some members of the commission in their interpretation of what that means.  Licence fees will presumably be charged when a television service is in operation.  The report on page 27, paragraph 79, recommends that the licence fees should be paid to the television authority.  Reservation No. 3 to the main report differs in that respect.  I agree with reservation No. 3.  I do not think that when licence fees are being collected by the State the payment of those fees to the television authority complies with the terms set out in the warrant of appointment.  It will be inevitable that these licence fees will have to be paid to the general Exchequer and retained there to make up for the loss of revenue in entertainments <Col N="1399" /> duty from cinemas when an Irish television service becomes an established fact.  In addition, there is likely to be a loss of other revenue to the Exchequer.  The Reservation also mentions the existence of the tax on newsprint and indicates that perhaps there might be such competition by television with newspapers that they would be affected.  I do not agree with that but I agree that there will be a loss in general entertainments duties.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the establishment of a commercial television service can fail to hit the existing revenue of Radio Éireann fairly substantially. Whatever decrease there may be in the revenue commercial receipts of Radio Éireann, it will have to be made up somewhere.  It seems to me that if the Exchequer will have to make that up, as perhaps it may, the television licence fees should be available to make that up and it should be treated, therefore, as being contrary to the terms of the warrant of appointment.</P>
    <P>The majority report in paragraph 91 makes it clear that it accepts the view that the establishment of a television service will affect injuriously the commercial receipts of Radio Éireann.  I agree entirely with the Minister that, notwithstanding the establishment of a television service, sound broadcasting must continue and Radio Éireann must continue.  It is no good our hoping, therefore, that the gap that might be thereby created in respect of Radio Éireann would be made up out of the sky.  It would have to be made up somewhere and I cannot see where else it would be made up otherwise than out of licence fees.</P>
    <P>I disagree also with the suggestion being made in certain places, that the stipulation that there is to be no charge on the Exchequer permits an indirect method of the Exchequer providing the capital for this service.  It is entirely illusory to suggest that when a State-sponsored body, which gets its money out of the resources of the country because it is a State-sponsored body, puts up the money, that that is not being put up by the Exchequer.  I <Col N="1400" /> cannot see the slightest difference between moneys being advanced direct in this context by the Minister for Finance on a loan to the television authority which is going to be set up and the money being made available by the Industrial Credit Company, Ltd.  That is only a question of the channel by which the moneys are available.</P>
    <P>We must never forget that the whole problem of capital for all the various needs we have is one that must be considered as a whole.  Considering it piecemeal will not improve our economic position.  If we take more in one respect than is available, it must come out of some other pocket.  Whether it comes out of the pocket of the Industrial Credit Company or directly out of the pocket of the Exchequer, so long as the Exchequer has to stand over the Industrial Credit Company&mdash; and it will have to stand over it&mdash;it amounts to exactly the same thing.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have already given I do not intend to discuss in very great detail the various recommendations in this report.  There are many interesting problems posed some of which are not answered at all partly because the information has not been released in the report.  They may, for all I know, have been answered in the confidential document the Minister has received. I am interested today in making a contribution purely from the point of view of trying to ensure continuity, to make certain that the service will be above Party politics and to ensure that the baby in relation to television does not come back on the desk of whoever may be Minister for Finance for the time being.  I accept that there should be no charge on the Exchequer and I want to ensure that the &ldquo;no charge&rdquo; is a fact not merely in relation to the establishment of a television service but also in relation to its working and to its continuity.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear that we must have some type of Irish television service because of our contiguous position to Great Britain and to their station operating in the Six Counties.  The question is not whether there would be television programmes viewed in Ireland or not.  The question is whether we shall have some control over <Col N="1401" /> the television programmes that are viewed or whether we shall have none.</P>
    <P>Over a large part of the country at present, even though it is in the area of fringe reception, programmes are received, and the area will grow even larger when the new station comes into operation in the Six Counties.  If we are to have any control then we must ensure that the service we provide is one that is so worthwhile that our people will be more anxious to look at an Irish television service than to some of the fringe reception they are getting at present from the B.B.C. or from I.T.V.</P>
    <P>If we are not able to produce a service here&mdash;and I am talking of the time after its teething troubles are over&mdash; that compares favourably with the B.B.C. and with I.T.V., then the people here will turn on to the B.B.C. or to the British commercial service.  If they do not turn on to the Irish service, the possibilities of the Irish service obtaining receipts from commercial advertising will diminish considerably.  It is unfortunately a circle.  If you have not got a large number of viewers you do not get the commercial receipts and if you do not get the commercial receipts you do not get the money to provide the programmes which will command a large number of viewers.</P>
    <P>Speaking entirely, therefore, from the point of view of someone who at one time had the responsibility of looking after national finances and speaking from the point of view of whoever may be looking after national finances in the future, I think the two most telling paragraphs in the whole of this booklet that has been published are paragraphs 22 and 23 on page 64. Unless we have programmes here that are of a standard that will entice Irish viewers to look at them in preference to the B.B.C. and in preference to other British programmes, I cannot see how we can maintain the finance of this service.  Unless that happens, sooner or later the Minister for Finance of the day will be called upon to come to the rescue because once the service has been established it must be continued no matter what it may cost. It says in these paragraphs that the programme costs put up by the proposers <Col N="1402" /> are between £140 per hour a programme to £190 per hour maximum.</P>
    <P>I cannot reconcile the figures there with the figure that is given of £350,000 for the cost of the service in paragraph 43 on page 19.  I understand that the programme cost there is based on 30 hours per week and that would work out at £230 an hour.  I cannot see how we can hope, as a general principle, to command the viewers when our costings are made on a basis&mdash;to get the widest possible maximum&mdash;of £140 to £250 per hour, when the programmes that are at present being received on fringe reception reasonably satisfactorily, were costing £1,538 on an average in 1956-57 and £1,730 in 1957-58.</P>
    <P>Of course there would be individual programmes which will cost very little and which will be so appealing to an Irish audience that they will be anxious to switch them on but it is not an individual programme which is going to maintain that regular number of viewers on which firms will give their advertising and which will therefore produce the receipts for the service.</P>
    <P>As far as I can understand&mdash;and everything I say is subject to the limitation that all the facts have not been disclosed to us for perfectly proper reasons&mdash;everything seems to suggest that we will be setting up a service under the scheme that is proposed that will be like using a pea shooter against a gun, in army parlance.  Undoubtedly there will be programmes so appealing to Irish viewers that they can be produced at very small cost but we could not possibly hope to compete with live programmes, at the figures that I mentioned. We must remember that what is at present merely fringe area reception will, with the advances that are being made in television science and engineering in the future, become actual areas of reception.  I am afraid that the proposals that are made accordingly are based far too much on what is called here in one of the paragraphs in the main report, &ldquo;filmed and tape-recorded material&rdquo;.  I think in a parlance that we know better in this country what that means is &ldquo;old canners.&rdquo; If you are going to have an <Col N="1403" /> Irish television service in which a large proportion of the programme is merely &ldquo;old canners&rdquo; or out-of-date stuff dished up by one or other of the television people, be they Canadian, British or anything else, people will not turn on that programme but will inevitably switch over to one of the other programmes coming from across the water. If they do that, the commercial receipts will fall and if they fall, whoever is Minister for Finance at the time must come to the rescue.</P>
    <P>One of the first things we must do, therefore, is to ensure on all sides of the House, that when this service is being set up it will be done in such a way that there will be that continuity of thought and of object and of method of financing that only discussion in an all-Party committee such as I have already suggested could provide.</P>
    <P>I want to take great exception to the suggestion summarised in paragraph 17 on page 12, in which, of course, they are only repeating what was put up to them.  I am not attaching any blame in that respect except that I think that they should have asked for a different approach.  One of the reasons why we want an Irish television service I think is not for the Dublin area but for the remote rural areas, to make life more attractive in those areas.  We could try to utilise such a service as something that will tend to keep the people in those areas. But the approach that is indicated in paragraph 17 is that it should be started in Dublin and perhaps extended to the rest of the country over a period of years.</P>
    <P>I think it should be started outside Dublin and extended upwards to the city centres rather than the reverse. Apart from the desire and the necessity to keep people in rural areas it is quite clear that the establishment of any television service here will bring with it substantial teething troubles at the beginning.  That is obvious and inevitable.  Is it not better that these teething troubles would be overcome where the people have not quite the same criterion of television as in the areas where they can already get good reception.  If something happens during <Col N="1404" /> the early teething troubles in the Dublin area and people can get perfect reception by switching to the B.B.C. or to British commercial television, they will do so.  Not merely that then, but a habit will be set up that will to a great extent injure the Irish service at a later stage.  That cannot be the position in the remote areas, so that, apart from the question of keeping the people in rural Ireland, it would therefore be better that the service would be introduced in the reverse of the way contemplated.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to colour television.  The report suggests that it is a long way off but says it is a reality.  In Sweden they visualise that colour television will be introduced in a widespread way throughout the country in 1960.  It may not be introduced in the same way as ordinary television but it is likely to become a reality next year in Sweden.  That will add even further, as far as I can understand, to the cost.  Everything we have by way of information points to the same view, that what we are doing now will have a vast effect on the lives of our people in the future.  It will have a very great effect on our habits, on our modes of thought and on our economic future.  Indeed, I believe that television could considerably assist agricultural education quite apart from any other type of education or any other type of aid to industry.</P>
    <P>More than anywhere else we could bring help home to agriculture by bringing, so to speak, the pilot farm and the results achieved in pilot farms throughout the country, right into the farmers' own homes.  And it is where they have seen pilot farms in operation that the greatest advances in agricultural methods have been made.</P>
    <P>Television will be, perhaps, the most dynamic thing that has happened in shaping our mode of life.  In the words of the report: &ldquo;The service is hungry for money.&rdquo; Let us make quite sure that we do not set up something that cannot do its job efficiently and that, when it is set up, it will be carried on under proper Irish Governmental control. It must be under Government control, directly or indirectly.  Let us ensure as it will be such a strong weapon of propaganda, that it will be <Col N="1405" /> utilised for the benefit of the community as a whole and not merely something that will be a financial weight around our necks in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to confine my remarks to the radio, now rapidly becoming obsolete.  It is noted in the Minister's opening sentence that £291,000 has been provided for Wireless Broadcasting for 1959/60.  That is the same amount as was provided in 1958/59.  Radio Éreann has many adverse critics but few of them appreciate the relatively small amount of money on which Radio Éireann is expected to operate.  If those critics reflected on the fact that a sum of £291,000 is provided for its operations in a full year, then, perhaps, we might not have so much adverse criticism.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, true that everyone in the country will be critical to some degree of Radio Éireann, but there are many people who do not see any use at all for it.  I wonder why there has not been an increase this year. How do Radio Éireann, the Advisory Council, the Minister or the Government expect they will get the same service as last year if fees, salaries and wages have not improved?  Broadcasting is a highly competitive business. Unfortunately, we have lost very many good artists from this country.  If we are not prepared to pay them the fees they can get in the B.B.C. or elsewhere, then the quality of Radio Éireann programmes must of necessity deteriorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems from the report of the T.V. Commission, from the remarks of the previous speaker and from the general consensus of opinion that very soon television will completely outdo wireless broadcasting.  Whether it will be next month, next year or in the next five years, we do not know.  The Government have not been very helpful in guiding the country in that respect. The Minister made a very brief reference to television in the concluding part of his speech, more by way of courtesy than anything else.  Do the Minister and the Government appreciate that the vast majority of the people are wondering what the Government will do?  While we may have a <Col N="1406" /> certain amount of sympathy with possible viewers, my sympathy is with the traders.  They expected that by now the Government would have indicated what would happen to the report, whether or not it would be accepted or what parts of it would be accepted and implemented.  The Minister should realise it is a matter of serious concern for the manufacturers, the assemblers and the ordinary shop traders what the future of television will be.</P>
    <P>This reminds me of the Vote for the Land Commission.  The Minister says he has no responsibility.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister in this debate.  His invariable reply when asked questions is that this is a matter for the Director. There is also an Advisory Council, but what function they perform I do not know.  I shall make my criticism of some of the programmes in Radio Eireann.  Whether the Minister passes them on to the Director or not or whether the Director reads the Dáil debates or not, I do not know.  In any case, here are my criticisms for what they are worth, and not necessarily in order of importance.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the G.A.A. and so are thousands of others who await with great interest the end of the news on Sunday nights for the G.A.A. results.  But, as far as the news is concerned, I am afraid G.A.A. fans do not get great satisfaction.  One hears a result like this, given at a very high speed: &ldquo;Tipperary, 7-9; Galway, 6-11.&rdquo; Who won the match? In a matter of a split second you have to listen to the next result.  Outside this House I have often suggested to the G.A.A. that they should ask Radio Éireann to give the score in points, but the stupid answer I got from the people in the Association was that the result would smack too much of a Rugby result.  The Minister should take this matter up for the benefit of G.A.A. fans and ask Radio Éireann to consider giving the results in points. If they do not want to fall out with the G.A.A., at least they should say: &ldquo;Clare beat Galway such-and-such a score.&rdquo;  At present the results are given out so rapidly that nobody in fact knows what the result was.  Do you <Col N="1407" /> want me, A Cheann Comhairle, to move to report progress?</P>

      <P>The only reason I asked is that the Minister has disappeared.  I want to raise also the question of the Irish language on Radio Éireann.  I appreciate that Radio Éireann are doing something for the Irish language &mdash;I shall put it at that&mdash;but I think it is a bit much when we get three Irish language programmes in direct succession, one at 6.45 p.m., another at 7 p.m. and another at 7.15 p.m.  That does not do justice to Radio Éireann.  The people will think the station is trying to force the language down their necks and I do not believe that is the intention.</P>

A fall of one per cent. in the consumption of <Col N="1415" /> tobacco in the financial year 1958/59 would have resulted in a reduction of the order of £250,000 in the yield of tobacco duty.</P>
      <P>A variation of one per cent. in the tobacco content of cigarettes generally would result in an increase or decrease of revenue of something over £200,000 per annum.  I am not in a position to apportion that figure as between the various sizes of cigarettes.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied with that answer.  Slings are sold.  They are on sale in shops and the kids buy them for no other purpose than to have a cock-shot at something.  There were fifteen windows broken in Seán McDermott Street only last week.  That is why I put down the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the announcement of the proposed Agreement between the British and Danish Governments which contemplates the halving of the British duty on imports of Danish bacon as from 1st July, 1960, and the abolition of the duty on 1st July, 1961.  These arrangements would mean a cash advantage of considerable size to Danish exporters, but, as I cannot foretell the manner in which this might be utilised by them, it would not at this stage be possible to say what effect the arrangements, if implemented, might have on Irish bacon exports to Britain.</P>
      <P>It is, however, desirable to point out that, as our producers are assured of reasonably stable returns for all pigs produced, they need have no apprehensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister must exercise some reserve in referring to future supplies but are we to interpret the last sentence of his reply in the sense in which I would wish to interpret it, as an indication to producers that they need have no apprehension in maintaining pig production in future as the high probability is that it is well within our capacity to deal with whatever situation arises from the Danish agreement, and it should not be allowed to operate as a deterrent to future production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that when the Deputy reads the sentence he will see that there can be no room for ambiguity as to its meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Irish exporter of pigs has lost his ten per cent. preference <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Danish exporter, in the British market?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Danes now have the same privilege in the British market as we had before.  Was the Minister not discussing such affairs with the British Government and should he not, therefore, be in a position to make a more definite statement in this House on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have clearly stated in my reply that the agreement, if implemented, would, on 1st July, 1961, have the effect of putting the Danish producer on the same plane as ourselves in regard to that matter.  There can be no doubt as to the meaning of the reply I gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture who is responsible for the allocation of contracts for the purchase of reactor cows under the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme; who is at present authorised to purchase such cows, and at what price; and where the responsibility of the seller finishes with regard to delivery when reactor cows are accepted by a representative or agent of his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Contracts for the purchase of reactor cows under the Scheme are allocated by my Department. Reactors are purchased by officers of the Department.  The price paid is the market value.  The seller is responsible for the safe delivery of the animal to the contractor, in accordance with directions issued by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the last portion of the Minister's reply, I wonder where exactly the seller's responsibility ceases in this regard.  I know of a case recently where an agent came to collect reactor cows and asked farmers to help him.  One of the farmers, as a result of a kick he got from a cow, was badly injured.  I should like to know and the farmers would like to know where their responsibility ceases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of an animal in regard to which a purchase arrangement is made by the Department's representatives a document is signed. As far as I know, the document clearly sets out where the responsibility begins <Col N="1422" /> and ends.  I am not aware of the individual case which Deputy Barry has in mind but I have read this document many times and I think that even a layman would have little difficulty in determining the question the Deputy asked.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £13,500 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for a Grant to An Chomhairle Ealaíon (No. 9 of 1951).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that it was agreed last year, on the suggestion of Deputies opposite, that the Estimate for An Chomhairle Ealaíon should be taken separately from the main Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach.  The House is aware that the functions of An Chomhairle Ealaíon are to stimulate <Col N="1444" /> interest in the arts and the promotion of knowledge and appreciation of the arts, to assist in improving the standard of the work and assist exhibitions of art and artistic craftsmanship, and also to advise the Government and others concerned directly or indirectly with matters relating to the arts.</P>
    <P>The total provision for the Comhairle is £20,000.  It is the same this year as in each of the past six years.  The Council's Statutory Annual Report for the year 1958/9, which gives a summary of their activities during that year, was presented to the Dáil on the 24th June last.  The accounts for the past financial year are at present being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In previous years there was a delay in presenting the report of the Comhairle by reason of the practice of incorporating the audited account with it and to overcome that difficulty it was arranged that in future the report and the abstract of accounts would be submitted separately to the Government and that the report itself would be submitted not later than the 15th June, following the end of the financial year to which it relates.</P>
    <P>In accordance with that arrangement the report for the 1958/9 year was received by the Government on the 15th June and was presented to the Dáil on the 24th June.  As the report is a very full one, giving an account of all the activities sponsored and carried out under the auspices of the Comhairle during the year, I do not propose to refer further to these matters.  As mentioned in a reply to a Parliamentary Question today, the need for appointing a new director arose during the year.  The previous director, Mr. Seán Ó Faoláin, resigned with effect from the 1st July, because he found that the duties of directorship of the Council&mdash;which as Deputies know is part-time&mdash;made too great demands on his time and the Right Rev. Monsignor Browne, President of University College, Galway, and chairman of the Council of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, was appointed director on the 4th July, with effect from 1st November next, to fill the vacancy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> There is just one matter which I think I should mention arising out of the report.  Deputies who read the report will see it recorded that in October last year Mr. William J.B. Macauley of New York, a former Irish representative to the Holy See, presented a sum of £20,000 to the Council for the establishment of a foundation to be known as the William J.B. Macauley Foundation, in honour of the ex-President of Ireland, Seán T. O Ceallaigh.  This munificent gift is for the purpose of assisting, by means of Fellowships, young Irish painters, writers, sculptors, dramatists and composers under the age of 30, or in exceptional cases, under the age of 35, to further their liberal education and to continue their creative work.  I am sure that Deputies will agree that appreciation of the generosity of Mr. Macauley should be recorded here and that we should supplement, on our own behalf, the thanks which have already been expressed to him by the Comhairle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express appreciation of the fact that the undertaking given by the previous Taoiseach has been honoured by the Taoiseach to keep this discussion&mdash;I hope there will be a discussion&mdash;on the report of An Chomhairle Ealaíon separate from and before the general debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach.  This is the 7th Annual Report of the Comhairle and during the course of those seven years there has hardly been any debate whatever on the report of the Arts Council because of the fact that it always came immediately after the general discussion on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate was usually conducted in an atmosphere that was-not conducive to a calm discussion on the arts and crafts, coming as it did immediately after the termination of the discussion on general Government policy.  In fact, there was no discussion at all so that the position is that for seven years now the Comhairle has been in operation and the interest taken by Deputies has been remarkable for its complete absence.  I <Col N="1446" /> was responsible for setting up this Comhairle and I am very glad that I did set it up.  I am very glad to be able today to say that looking down through the seven reports that the Comhairle have issued in the last seven years they have, quietly and unobtrusively and with very little outside help, done a very good work indeed, within the limits of their resources and their capacity, and in particular having regard to the fact that with the exception of the director all the members of the Comhairle are giving voluntary service.</P>
    <P>I took some trouble to be here this afternoon for the purpose of expressing my appreciation of the work that has been done during those years to try to fulfil what I felt was a very serious want in the public affairs of this country.  In the course of those years they have done much work that has passed unnoticed but which, I think I can say, has not been without very considerable effect.  It was gratifying last year to visit the Evie Hone Exhibition in the premises of University College, Dublin, and to see thousands of people flocking to that remarkable exhibition of one of the greatest artists this country has produced. Not merely were they flocking in to see the various examples of Evie Hone's wonderful artistic capacity and industry, but they were taking the most extraordinary interest in the lectures given&mdash;public lectures by people who interpreted the particular quality of her arts.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council and particularly Fr. O'Sullivan, the member of the Council directly responsible for pushing&mdash;not without opposition of a very considerable character&mdash;this exhibition of Evie Hone's work, deserve very considerable thanks for their work.  The exhibition was also produced in London in a public exhibition and to a limited extent in the Tate Gallery. That is only one of the remarkable achievements of the Arts Council in helping to stimulate interest in art and to bring home the fact that Irish people have a capacity for artistic industry and for artistic development and expression.</P>
    <P>Before I make any other observations on this Report, I should like to <Col N="1447" /> join with the Taoiseach in expressing appreciation of Mr. Macauley for the munificent gift he gave, £20,000, and particularly appreciation of the purpose for which he gave that gift.  I should like to hope that the example he gave would be followed by other people, perhaps not as wealthy as he is but who may have other resources from which to give patronage, very much wanted patronage, to the purposes of the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>One of the most remarkable things since this State was established is the fact that numbers of people have made vast quantities of money in the operations and as a result of the setting up of this State.  It is a reflection upon our people, and particularly upon the commercial community, that they have been singularly lacking in the public duty that I am saying is cast upon them, to give some token of their appreciation of the efforts of the Arts Council and particularly in the application of art to industry.  It is understandable, of course, that the people have not got that gift of patronising the arts, certainly to the extent of giving practical expression to that by giving sums of money out of their savings; but it is very deplorable that the commercial community, by and large, have been singularly lacking in cooperation with the efforts of the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>One of the outstanding objects in my mind when I persuaded my colleagues to set up this Comhairle Ealaíon was the necessity for bringing to practical effect in this country the application of art to industry and particularly to stimulate the interest of industrialists and commercial people generally in an appreciation of the absolute necessity for proper up-to-date design in our crafts and arts and in our industrial development generally. There was an exhibition of design gathered together, inaugurated and organised by An Chomhairle Ealaíon some years ago.  Little, if any, interest was taken in that by our industrial community.  When I was last in office, I tried again to stimulate them into an interest in connection with design in industry and the application of art to industry&mdash;and I failed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> I find here in this last report of An Comhairle Ealaíon which has just been laid on the Table of the House a reference to a package design scheme. That package design scheme was conceived in the interests, not merely of the commercial community and those engaged in it, but in the interests of the country generally.  I shall come back to that, perhaps, in a moment.  The package design scheme was launched under terms which are stated in this Report.  Under the terms of the scheme, grants were</P>
    <P>&ldquo;given to Irish commercial firms towards the cost of employing the services of professional designers to design retail sales packages for their goods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then they go on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The response from Irish manufacturers was not as great as the Council would wish.  The scheme was launched in August, 1958, and though very fully publicised in the Press before the close of the financial year only eleven designs had been submitted to the Council. Grants were made in five cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what I am objecting to; that is what I am endeavouring to draw public attention to.  I am not doing that solely for the purpose of making the case that individual Irish firms or manufacturing concerns or industrialists can make profit for themselves out of a scheme of that kind&mdash;as they could&mdash;but I am emphasising the utter necessity for dealing with matters of that kind in the general interests of the community.</P>
    <P>We cannot hope to have an export trade of any dimensions in ordinary industrial goods&mdash;leaving out of consideration in this context the export of agricultural commodities&mdash;unless we have them top of the top class.  I was certainly of the view that when we exported goods, particularly to America, we were engaged in something which was highly competitive&mdash;and that is an understatement.  The only way we can meet that highly competitive drive, where practically every nation in the world is engaged in increasing exports, is to produce something essentially different from what is being flooded upon <Col N="1449" /> the markets of the world, something that will demonstrate the fact that we have here in Ireland something distinctively Irish, of a design and artistic quality that will beat the best in the world.  I believe that could be done if our people had given the necessary attention, paid the necessary expense and had undertaken the necessary risks.  There is no use in our producing glassware unless we have it top of the top of designs.  I take that merely as an example.  I think I said much the same before when I was speaking on this subject.</P>
    <P>Let us export what we like to the United States of America, where we have 25,000,000 of our kith and kin&mdash; yet we are not going to sell on the American market on the margin of our sentimental connection; we are not going to sell on the basis of sentimentality. That may be taken as an axiom with which I am sure the Taoiseach will agree.  We have a great fund of goodwill in America, amongst those citizens who are our kith and kin, either directly or through descent; and we have a tremendous fund of goodwill amongst ordinary American citizens who have not any connection of that kind with us.  But neither the sentimental Irishman or Irishwoman, nor those others who may have a sentimental feeling for Ireland, will buy sixpence worth of Irish goods unless the value is good.</P>
    <P>We must start with that proposition. It is true that Americans may come here and buy leprechauns and blackthorn sticks and objects with harps on them&mdash;which ought to be injuncted by an order of our High Court and by any Act of Parliament by which we could possibly stop that. We may produce what we want to sell in America but unless it is good value and a commercial proposition and high-class in design, in packaging, in format and in price, we shall get no one there to look at it or, if they look at it, they certainly will not buy it.</P>
    <P>The last time I was in New York I visited a well-known stores and saw displayed there a magnificent set of materials from this country.  They were all top class.  I spoke to the head man and he told me exactly what <Col N="1450" /> was needed.  He said there was no use in bringing the goods into a store in New York and putting on them merely &ldquo;Déanta in Éirinn&rdquo; or &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; or anything else unless they were top of the top class and were good value at that.  I have been urging the necessity for that ever since I had anything to do with the affairs of this country. I started in conjunction with Dr. Thomas Bodkin, who, I had hoped, would be the first Director of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, years ago, in the knowledge that this was what we required, above all things, in this country. We started in the knowledge that we had an opportunity, if we understood the application of art to industry and the necessity for top class design of exclusive Irish character, of doing something that would not be done otherwise for the export trade of this country.  That is why I feel so disappointed that our industrialists have taken practically no interest whatever in the work of the Arts Council and have not bent themselves to creating that exclusive Irish design which is necessary.</P>
    <P>Look at any of the stuff produced in this country.  It is not bad.  I hesitate to say that the attitude is that it is good enough for the Irish home market, but one would almost come to that conclusion.  I do not want to mention any particular commodity in case I might be accused of criticising this or that industry.  I am taking it in general, that the design of the stuff we produce here is very mediocre.  I did hear of one firm which, when efforts were made to get a better design, said: &ldquo;Is it not good enough to sell on the home market?&rdquo; That may be good enough for us but we have this opportunity, I believe, and we can only avail of it if we get design, and top class design at that.</P>
    <P>As I said before many times, I would be in favour of paying the biggest salary ever paid to anyone in this country to someone from any country abroad, whatever his nationality, who would come in here and help our industrialists to evolve a very exclusive Irish design, and I do not mean a design having shamrocks, harps and leprechauns.  The less shamrocks, harps and leprechauns we have, the better <Col N="1451" /> it will be in this case.  We have already had a practical demonstration of that in Sweden where they started, I believe, from scratch to make improvements in design.  That is my impression.  I may be wrong, but they got the top designers in the world for their glass-wear and they now have a tremendous export market.  We will do far better by approaching our export industries on those lines than we will do in any other way.</P>
    <P>We have one example of that.  Again, I do not want to give something in the nature of a free advertisement to a particular firm.  The Taoiseach will probably know to what I am referring. They got in good artistic designers and, in reference to their commodities, have a first class export trade, and they got that export trade before any Government in this country gave a stimulus or tax relief to firms who were exporting. I am sure the Taoiseach will have no hesitation in knowing the firm, which is not 30 miles from this city, to which I am referring.  There is a concrete example.  They worked up their very good export trade through design. They went to Canada and many other places, produced these particular types of commodities and they were able to beat any of their competitors on design, on quality, and on price.</P>
    <P>Unless we can stimulate our own industrialists and manufacturers into following that example, then you may throw your hat at most of your efforts to create any export trade of worthwhile character in the commodities we are manufacturing in this country. But, I think we still have the chance. I believe we still have in the country people of artistic instinct who only require that inherent spirit to be brought out from them, but the whole outlook of the vast majority of our people and particularly, I insist again, of business people, is shrugging their shoulders at art and asking: &ldquo;What have we got to do with art?&rdquo; I want to make the position clear that if design and application of art to industry were properly appreciated, and properly and effectively put into operation here, we have got a chance in this country for our export trade, but, without that, we will not have it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> Waterford glass is one example of the way that design can be achieved and an export trade got as a result, not because of the design particularly but because, coupled with the design, is the Irish element of Waterford in it.  You have the Irish attraction of Waterford glass, plus good design, though I am far from saying that the design of Waterford glass has reached its peak.  I think there is great room for improvement in that but, at least, they have done something in that respect for our export trade abroad.</P>
    <P>I do not want unduly to labour this matter.  I may be accused of having an <i>idée fixe</i> about this.  I am prepared to confess that I have, but the only chance we have of getting any of our goods sold abroad is to have the Irish content, plus first class design, the top of the top.  We can achieve that and, if we do, then we will get behind us the goodwill of Irish people in America and of people, not of Irish extraction, who have tremendous goodwill towards us.  When you have that, and a good article, you will beat the world, but you have the Irish industrialists who sit down and produce ashtrays with shamrocks on them, and produce other commodities with harps, and produce souvenirs that would turn your soul inside out if you have any artistic instinct at all.  That is just a waste of time and money.</P>
    <P>Again, we find a rather disturbing thing in this matter.  In the report that was laid upon the Table of the House, there is a paragraph or section dealing with the purchase of paintings by local authorities.  One of the only ways in which you can stimulate the artistic instinct which will produce eventually, in its proper time, its expression through painting, sculpture and the visual arts in general, is by getting somebody to support young Irish painters and artists when they produce paintings and other works.  It would have been throught the local authorities could have produced a few pounds to that effect, with the help given by the Arts Council, but it is on record&mdash; again I quote from the recent report of the Council which states:</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret to the Council that so few local authorities <Col N="1453" /> have, during the five years of the scheme's operation, availed themselves of this opportunity of purchasing the work of Irish artists at half-price.</P>
    <P>If we cannot get our industrialists and local authorities to help Irish artists, where are we going?</P>
    <P>That leads me to another consideration in connection with this matter. We have had, I think, three directors of the Arts Council.  Most Reverend Dr. Browne is the third director.  We had Mr. Little, Seán Ó Faoláin and now Dr. Browne.  I think the time has come when there should be a whole-time director of this Comhairle.  I had hoped, when I had appointed Mr. Seán Ó Faoláin, that it would develop in that way.  In effect, he gave pretty well his whole time to the job and that is the reason why he had to resign eventually. It was felt, with a man of his artistic attainments and his practical achievements in literature, that it would be a loss to Ireland and to artistic circles in general, if he should so have to devote his attention to the Arts Council that his individual creative work would be minimised, if not destroyed.  He saw that eventually and that is the reason he had to go, but I think we shall not get the full value of the Arts Council until we have a full-time director with adequate finances.  I do not think we have in Dr. Browne.  I have no intention of saying anything whatever about him, but I do not think we shall have from him the amount of time, energy and even the particular type of artistic knowledge which is required.  I think we should have a whole-time director, and the time has come when I do most urgently press upon the Taoiseach the necessity for increasing the allocations to the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in the opening part of his remarks, referred to the objectives which are imposed upon the Council by law.  They are very wide. They cover a vast area of artistic and creative work, from the visual artists down to the pipe band in Ballymac-slattery. The Arts Council, since it was formed, have been endeavouring, at all times, to do all the work.  They have been trying to stimulate interest in <Col N="1454" /> design, in the application of art to industry, and to encourage young people who have talent and touches of genius to go on with their work, and to enable them to go on with their training.</P>
    <P>They have done a vast amount of work in connection with the functions of the Council up to the point where we see in this report and, as I know in other reports, grants are being given to brass bands, pipe bands&mdash; and, I think, in one case to mouth organs but I am not sure of that&mdash;all sorts of ceilidhe functions, all kinds of dramatic functions throughout the country which are all very useful, necessary and desirable, as was the assistance which was given to the Gate Theatre, the Wexford Festival and local drama leagues which are also terribly necessary.</P>
    <P>Everything cannot be done at once and the result is that it can only be hit in spots, and the problem only touched in bits.  When the Arts Council are giving grants to all sorts of local rural activities, they pay a small sum of money which helps a little and is perhaps made up with the help of the local authority, but it only helps a little.  The Arts Council have not the remotest notion of what is done with the money because they cannot afford to supervise the application of the money, or even to see whether any results are got from it.</P>
    <P>They have not got the money and they have not got the staff.  The original Arts Council started with an unpaid director, a secretary and a typist, and I know that when certain exhibitions were being organised and the actual physical exhibits were being collected in a very small space in the St. Stephen's Green premises, the secretary of Comhairle Ealaíon at that time had to wait until late at night nailing down packages, parcelling up exhibits and carting them out himself to the place where they were to be exhibited. That even goes for the present secretary, Mr. Mervyn Wall, an extremely competent and conscientious person. I understand also that the young lady who occupies the high position of typist has done the work of secretary and director from time to time.  A <Col N="1455" /> considerable amount of valuable work has been done by the secretary and the typist for the past seven years under the direction of the part-time directors, Mr. Little and Mr. Seán Ó Faoláin.  A considerable amount of work has been done in those difficult and trying circumstances.</P>
    <P>I want the public to know that good work has been done with an inadequate staff and not enough money.  The Arts Council is a voluntary body and they give excellent services at their own expense and with a great deal of trouble and they have performed very useful work over the past seven years. It is not fair that they should have to continue to carry on in those conditions and, therefore, I appeal to the Taoiseach to increase the grant, though I know that every person, every body, and every activity in the country is clamouring for more and more money.</P>
    <P>At least I gave expression to my outlook on this matter, when, in the year 1956, when the financial affairs of the country were in a bad way, I helped them by giving an extra £3,000 in one year.  I did not do it the next year, but I absolutely refused, in spite of great pressure&mdash;which the Taoiseach can find out for himself if he takes the trouble to look it up&mdash;to reduce the grant, and I said if it were not for the state of affairs at that time I would have very substantially increased it.</P>
    <P>With a sum of £20,000 the Council are trying to do a vast amount of work in spreading that small sum to benefit a wide area, too wide an area. Unless the grant is increased, the net result will be that the work of An Chomhairle Ealaíon in future will have to be selective, that it will be selective and not comprehensive. Accordingly, in view of the fact that they have, for so many years, carried out such useful and valuable public services, I think they should be given an increased grant.  I do not base my case upon the grant alone, because it is more than that.  There is something inestimable, something that cannot be measured in value to the nation, in the stimulation of artistic instinct, talents <Col N="1456" /> and interest in the visual arts, and drama and literature generally.</P>
    <P>Every country in the world is spending vast amounts of money upon the very type of thing that the Arts Council was set up to do.  They are not doing that merely because they like pictures and music.  They are doing it for severely practical purposes. Leaving aside all question of artistic values and the building up of a nation so that it is not a nation of clodhoppers, leaving aside the inestimable value to a country of achieving that objective, it has, as I endeavoured to emphasise at the outset, a very severely practical purpose.</P>
    <P>If we had artists here, we would stimulate interest in art and its application to industry and Irish design&mdash; and we can only achieve that with the stimulation of the Arts Council&mdash;and if we had artists who were capable of producing distinctive Irish designs it might be possible to produce some sort of commodities or some types of artistic products&mdash;glassware, teaware chinaware, souvenirs, or anything else &mdash;of a character that could be sold on that market of immense goodwill towards us which exists in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>I believe that is the only way in which we can really increase our exports of industrial goods.  It is unfortunate that An Chomhairle Ealaíon was so frustrated by lack of interest on the part of the industrialists.  It is unfortunate that the package design scheme was also frustrated.  I hope, accordingly, to urge upon the Taoiseach that he should act in the way I have suggested.  He is a practical man &mdash;I do not accuse the Taoiseach of being an artist but I appreciate the fact that he knows something about the workings of industry here.  I think he will appreciate what I have been saying about the inestimable good that can come to the country if he will only shake up some people into the realisation that practical good will come to themselves, even if they look at it from an egotistical point of view, along the lines of the application of art to industry with high-class design for exclusive Irish goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what has been said by the previous speaker.  I feel there is a good deal of ignorance and misconception about the work of the Arts Council.  Many people think that it is just another semi-State body to be milked at times, if possible, to provide funds for some &ldquo;arty&rdquo; society that wants to put on a performance but cannot pay its way or prove to be an economic proposition on its own and that the Arts Council is there for no other purpose than to subsidise such a performance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello has spoken of the apparent disinterest of the commercial interests in this country in the Arts Council.  I can tell him that there is a gleam of hope in the constituency from which I come.  We believe that if the proper approach were made, and these people made aware&mdash;as Deputy Costello has done today&mdash;of their own interests in the promotion of the work of the Arts Council, there would be a readier response.</P>
      <P>In Cork city, we are proud of the achievements of our orchestral society and our ballet group, but I am sure their success could not have been brought about, were it not that the performances of both these bodies have been sponsored by commercial firms in the city.  That is not altogether due to the fact that Cork industrialists are different from those of the rest of the country, much as I should like to be able to say that, but the proper approach was made to them.  We certainly appreciate the work of the Arts Council and if their work was known more widely, there would be a greater response by other industrial interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join in appealing for more funds to be made available for the work of the Arts Council.  As regards the staffing position, they could seek more help outside their own staff.  If the position is as Deputy Costello said, that there was too much work thrown on a few people who were employed there, and if they had come to bodies such as those in Cork like the Tostal Council, they would have got any amount of voluntary help.  I think they should seek that help because not alone would they get it but they would arouse interest among a greater number <Col N="1458" /> of people.  I pay tribute to the work the Arts Council are doing and appeal for more help from industrial interests because their work is of the highest national importance.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Costello in regard to the line that our new industrialists take, men who have done well and made large sums of money.  I had the honour to be a member of the Governing Body of the National University and I discovered that new industry in Ireland took very little interest in education.  I did not find any of our big firms granting scholarships as the old firms did.  Afterwards, I happened to get in touch with the Arts Council.  I am very glad the Arts Council was created by Deputy Costello because it has done great service with very little money.  I should like to refer to a great cultural promotion put over in an area without the help of a good many of the new industrialists.</P>
      <P>In my constituency in Waterford city, much to the horror of the citizens, we were told two years ago that our fine old theatre would close and that it would not open again.  The Mayor of that time summoned a meeting to see if something could be done about it.  The usual result came from that meeting: let the Corporation do it; let the Government do it; let somebody do it.  However, it was a case of &ldquo;the Lord helps those who help themselves.&rdquo; The only way out was to get a local group together to form a company.  A local group was got together, and they met with great opposition.  They looked for support and got it from the Bishops of both denominations.  They got it from the fine old firm of Arthur Guinness Son and Company Limited and they got it from the Waterford Glass Company, whose Chairman is Mr. Joseph McGrath, but they did not get it from many people who had made money in recent years in industry and who should have helped them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time, Mr. Little was the Director of the Arts Council, and we approached him.  I want to put it on record that it is not for the help he gave us that I want to thank him but for the manner in which he gave it.  It <Col N="1459" /> was not a great sum of money but it was of great assistance to us.  During the term of office of Mr. O Faoláin, that assistance was made available to us and I can tell the Taoiseach that it was a wonderful achievement that this theatre, with the traditions of Keane and Jordan, Power and Wallace, was not allowed to be closed.  It is open now and is thriving.  Since it opened, with only occasional assistance, we have promoted magnificent theatrical shows in Waterford.  We had the premiere of the Casement play with Cyril Cusack; we had three great operas; we had musical comedy, Jimmy O'Dea and so on.  We also had local talent.  I am glad to say we were able to finish up the year with only a very small deficit.  I do not think that will occur again because we had a great deal of expenditure during the year that will not recur.  I am sorry to delay the House on this but I wanted to tell of the great value of the Arts Council and of the great assistance they gave us in reopening that theatre which was a wonderful occasion for the citizens of Waterford.</P>
    <P>As regards local authorities and the purchase of pictures by Irish artists it is to be deplored that the local authorities are in the same category as the industrialists who have taken no notice of Irish artists at all.  I am glad to say that the local authority of which I am a member has been a consistent buyer of pictures by young Irish artists.  We have a gallery in Waterford which has accumulated a reasonably good collection of pictures over the years since this scheme started.</P>
    <P>I would exhort the Taoiseach to increase the Vote for the Arts Council, not for the sake of what they have done for Waterford&mdash;I held that up only as an instance of what could be done&mdash;but because of the great work they have done and are capable of doing.  They could extend their scope and maybe bring in our industrialists. They could promote an art competition throughout the country among young Irish artists competing in designs for various things in industry, and so on.  Exhibitions of the competitions could be held by the Arts Council if they had a bigger Vote and <Col N="1460" /> were supported by the industrialists. If the industrialists do that, they will be working for themselves.  Deputy Costello was able to convince me, and I am sure the House, of the great idea that is behind all this in the propagation of Irish artistic ideas, whether it is in packaging, or in the design of glass, clothes, furniture or whatever we may be exporting.  Judging by the enormous amount of good done on the small amount of money that is in the Vote at present, I am sure that if there were an increase even of some few thousands of pounds, it would reflect itself in more good than practically any Vote that has come before this House.</P>

      <P>I welcome very much the circumstances in which the last hour of this part of the time of the Dáil has brought the ex-Taoiseach and the new Taoiseach in front of one another to discuss a matter that has been raised so clearly and concentratedly by Deputy Costello.  I think it points the finger to a line of thought leading to a line of action for which so many people in the country have been thirsting for some kind of realisation.</P>
      <P>I rise to get back a little to the significance of what is happening and to the clear line of thought which I think Deputy Costello would particularly emphasise.  I appreciate very fully in respect of the potential of Cork and the potential of Waterford the work that has been done for music, dancing, drama, and all that kind of thing.  We want our song.  In that atmosphere, the work done in movements such as Cór Fhéile na Scoil in Cork and Cór Fhéile na Scoil in Dublin and the rather stimulating movement of Ceoltóirí na hÉireann, culminating now in the yearly Fleadh Ceoil, is a very important development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot have our song, our dance, our drama and our music unless we have the result of the work of men and women carrying on the development and the actual productive work of the country and, in their productive work, shaping their work on lines that express the delicacy and grandeur of the mind.  I should like <Col N="1461" /> to emphasise the very great importance of the work contemplated by the Arts Council, not only as a polleniser of the efforts of various bodies' work throughout the country for the development of the country in a way that expresses a graciousness of mind and some of the beauty associated definitely with the development of nature, but also as a catalyst.</P>
    <P>The very fact that you have an Arts Council proceeding in respect of activities that become known and clearly expounded to the country has an effect on all kinds of people, even though no positive assistance or direction is given from the Council.  I see the Council and its influence as a polleniser and a catalyst.  I see its influence exerted on all kinds of organisations and people.</P>
    <P>The National School of Art is alongside this House.  Work is going on there that can vitally affect the economic wellbeing of the country.  On a Sunday afternoon recently.  I was in Cappawhite.  It was at the time of the Presidential election and the referendum. I met a friend.  It was coming on to five o'clock.  He said he was in a great hurry.  He was going over to the vocational school where an exhibition of the craft work of the students was on.  It had been on for some time and it would close at five o'clock.  I was very glad to hurry over with him to see the work being done there.</P>
    <P>Consider the work being done in technical schools in woodwork and metalwork and bear in mind also the work done in industries such as the old embroidery industry in Donegal and elsewhere.  Tremendous efforts are being made to get our young people to understand the relationship between their fingers and their minds&mdash;to express through their fingers on the materials they have around them their delicacy and graciousness of mind.</P>
    <P>We may sing, dance, play music, act plays, and so on, but until we learn and get the technique of inspiring the fingers of people to face the work of life, in the case of men and women, we shall not have the music, character or social life any more than we shall have <Col N="1462" /> the sound economic life that must be based upon the intensity of appreciation of what it is possible to do in a physical kind of way in actual work with the materials with which the ordinary day's life is carried on&mdash;and they ramify from the fields to the factory and to the studio.</P>
    <P>One has not to go back many years to see how people wished to approach these matters.  I remember that in 1922 it was being urged, and people were very anxious that it should be urged, that we should substantially go in for afforestation under particular circumstances.  At that time, it was felt that if we had forests, we would have wood in the hands of the people. It was urged that until we had wood in plenty in the hands of the people and the opportunity to take the raw material&mdash;wood&mdash;and to develop the skill and the enjoyment of working with fingers on wood, we would not develop in the kind of way we wanted to a particular kind of craftwork that was the essential basis of art development.</P>
    <P>I should particularly like to get back to what I understand is the kernel of what Deputy Costello has in mind&mdash; that you want to get your Arts Council to patronise, develop and induce the use of the fingers to develop from the material side of life an artistic expression of people's minds and capacities in a way that will enhance in every possible and growing way the things that are to be done, whether in the field, in the factory or in the home, the things that are produced by the operation of men's and women's hands, whether directly or through the application of machinery or through the development of machinery for turning out these things.</P>
    <P>If you are to capitalise the power of beauty that lies in the mind we can do it only through training.  If we can infuse into all our people, particularly the young, a knowledge of what a jo it is to do things artistically and wel then we will develop an energy and stimulus for work in the people that will repay itself very much both in economic productive work and in the productive work that is there just for pure enjoyment.</P>

      <P>The idea has gone from this House that if one asks an embarrassing question of the Government, it is looked upon as improper and, if I may say so, as not being in accordance with public decency.  I asked a question today that has a bearing on the Estimate now before the House.  I asked a question in regard to the appointment of the director of the Arts Council.  When dealing with this, may I say that I want to take the opportunity of paying a very high tribute in public to Mr. Seán Ó Faoláin?  Mr. Ó Faoláin devoted all his energies and spent many long hours, days, and weeks, working strenuously in furthering the aims and objects laid down in the Arts Act, 1951.  Despite pressure of work he devoted all his available time energetically to the Arts Council.  May I pay a tribute to Mr. Ó Faoláin and say it is a great pity that there are not more men of his type in the country today?</P>
      <P>The Arts Council was set up to do a very necessary job for the people of Ireland.  Nobody disagrees with the desirability of having such a Council or denies the fact that since its establishment excellent work has been done. I disagree however with the type of men selected to be part-time directors of the Arts Council.  In the past we had Mr. P.J. Little appointed as part-time director.  He was a good man, but nevertheless he was a former Fianna Fáil Minister and a Fianna Fáil Deputy.</P>

There is nothing in the Arts Act, 1951, to prevent an active politician from being thrown on the Arts Council, but whether that is a good thing or not is another question.  I think it is not.  I think a person of the type of Seán Ó Faoláin should be director of the Arts Council, a man who has devoted his whole life to art and one who has natural gifts to enable him to be associated with the arts.  Mr. Little may have been artistic in his own way; he may have had artistic qualifications that those of us not closely connected with him politically were unaware of&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to deal with the appointment of Mr. Ó Faoláin's successor.  The Taoiseach told us today that the Right Rev. Monsignor Patrick Browne has been appointed director of the Arts Council. He also added that no special qualifications for the office of director were laid down in the Arts Act, 1951.  While Mr. Little in his time was a politician and while Mr. Ó Faoláin was entirely devoted to his work and has no political associations, we now find we have Monsignor Browne.  I feel if this House is to vote one-twentieth of this Estimate for Monsignor Browne that those of us in this House who have the courage to speak on this subject without fear or hindrance should be permitted to do so.  I think Monsignor Browne is the wrong man for this job. I think there is a political motive behind his appointment.  Monsignor Browne might be a very good political designer but we all know quite well that he has been actively associated with the leaders of Fianna Fáil down through the years.  Not alone that, but he is a brother-in-law of the Tánaiste.</P>

      <P>I must confess I am not as familiar with the full range of the activities of the Arts Council as I intend to become.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce I had some contact with them and utilised my right to seek their advice on particular matters, the most recent being the design for a mural which we have committed ourselves to present for the International Labour Office building in Geneva.  I have acquired general knowledge of the activities of the Council and the help they have given to Government and semi-Government bodies on occasion has certainly been brought to my attention.</P>
      <P>I hope the Council will not be too disappointed by the response they munity in their efforts to develop an interest in industrial design and packaging. By and large, it is true to say that appreciation of the importance of design and packaging in industry is growing rapidly but business men may be hesitant to act upon an approach from a body which bears the name &ldquo;Arts Council&rdquo; and to accept the suggestion that there is anything artistic in the particular commercial task of designing and packaging their products so as to secure more extensive sales. The work of the Arts Council in that respect will, however, bear fruit.  In due course the suspicion of business men towards a body which is presumably more concerned with art than commerce will tend to fade away.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Council will continue to interest themselves in that branch of their activity.  There is particular need for encouraging young people to acquire training in industrial design. Indeed, while I would not urge our industrialists to confine themselves to this country in seeking advice on that matter, there is need for a more extensive appreciation of the need for training in that field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my visit to Italy for a few days earlier this year it was brought in on me again the extent to which the very rapid growth of Italian industry in many sectors since the end of the <Col N="1468" /> war was attributable to their flair for design.  It is true to say that the expansion of the Italian motor car industry as well as their textile and garment industries can be attributed almost entirely to that cause.  Indeed it was the success of the firms which gave due attention to design and packaging that has aroused the interest of others.  There is nothing else that would have had the same reaction upon their decisions.  The work of the Council in that regard has not been without value.  If they are not too discouraged by the response from the commercial community, I hope they will persist in it in the realisation that in due course they will gain increasing co-operation in commercial quarters.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Costello's feelings in regard to the limited extent to which local authorities have availed of the 50 per cent. grant for paintings by Irish artists to be displayed in their buildings. Some of them have shown quite commendable enterprise in that regard. I am aware from some letters that appeared in the papers that a controversy has arisen regarding the judgment of the Arts Council upon the quality of the pictures available for selection in that way, on the merits of which I am not competent to make any observation.  I am hoping to have an opportunity of meeting the Council at an early date for the purpose of generally making myself familiar with the work they have in progress and their intentions for the future.</P>
    <P>I would naturally be sympathetic to the plea made by Deputy Costello and others that the resources available to the Council should be enlarged.  I cannot give any undertaking, however, that they will be enlarged.  I am sure Deputy Costello will understand that at this time of the year the Minister for Finance might not be unsympathetic, but next March or so when the Estimates for next year are totalled up and the Government are meeting to consider how they can be cut down, because that is the function of the Government at that time, if cuts have to be made and there is an increased Estimate for the Arts Council, we shall probably find&mdash;</P>

      <P>Harpies in the <Col N="1469" /> Department of Finance try to capture every penny back from the Arts Council. But the Department of Finance has nothing to do with the amount of money given to the Arts Council.  It is entirely a matter for the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We all attack the Department of Finance when out of office and urge increased expenditure of this kind.  However, I would be sympathetic to it, but I should like, before coming to any definite conclusion in this matter, to have an opportunity of hearing from the Council themselves the directions in which they could effectively utilise any increased resources made available to them.  A great deal of good work has been done, even by the very limited grants which they are able to distribute at present.  It would perhaps be undesirable to create the idea that cash subventions for artistic purposes should be sought solely from Government sources.  Indeed the great aim should be to promote generally throughout the country the same local interest in various artistic activities which has been so noticeably developed in a few of our towns.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that I agree with Deputy Costello's suggestion that the director should be a whole-time official. As Mr. Paddy Little's name has been mentioned, in fairness to him it should be said that he acted as director of the Council for the whole period of his term without remuneration of any kind.  I do not know that in our circumstances that is either necessary or desirable.  First of all, if we commit ourselves to somebody completely dependent for his livelihood on that particular position and who is precluded by the terms of his appointment from having any other interests, then, in the event of his not proving to be fully suitable or losing interest or, in the course of time, running out of ideas, we would have always the problem of his future to worry about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis, however, of a part-time appointment, selecting people with the necessary qualifications, people who have other activities as well to  them, we could make changes from time to time with greater ease. <Col N="1470" /> Indeed, in my view, it is not desirable that we should contemplate a situation in which changes should not be fairly frequent.  In matters of this kind an inflow of new ideas is always highly important.</P>

      <P>All I can say is to repeat what I have said already.  There is available now, by an accidental combination of circumstances, for appointment as director of the Arts Council a man who represents an altogether unusual combination of qualifications&mdash;a very high reputation for scholarship and a long experience in the administration of an important institution. The Director of the Arts Council is, of course, essentially an administrator and it is administrative abilities which should be foremost in the minds of those selecting a person for appointment.  No doubt, if he is to be useful in that capacity, he must also have a very lively interest in artistic matters and be known to have a reputation which will command respect.</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress, I was complaining of the fact that Radio Éireann have the unhappy knack of having three programmes in the Irish language put on in succession.  The Minister ought to get the director to look into that.  If it is the intention to encourage the Irish language that sort of behaviour will only turn people against it.  Radio Éireann has a function in the revival of the language.  Another complaint is that the type of Irish programme is of too high a standard to be of any help to those who know some Irish and want to learn more.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to convey to the director the suggestion that the No. 1 Army Band ought to be used more.  I do not know whether or not the Minister for Defence would get a fee.  The band is a very popular one. It is not availed of at all to the extent it should be either by the Department or by Radio Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greater use of the Light Orchestra is very much welcomed.  I should like to pay tribute, as I have done in other years, to the conductor and members of that orchestra.  Perhaps the Minister might tell us what progress has been <Col N="1472" /> made in nationalising the Symphony Orchestra.  Years and years ago we were told that foreigners&mdash;Czechs, Hungarians, Germans and so forth&mdash; were brought in to augment the orchestra with a view to encouraging those from the Irish schools of music to make themselves proficient in that kind of music and eventually become members of the orchestra.  The alleged displacement of Irish musicians has been a bone of contention both here in the House and in the country generally.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what progress has been made in encouraging more Irish musicians to become members of the Symphony Orchestra.</P>
    <P>It would, in my view, save time if audiences did not applaud quite so much.  Why are the audiences at Question Time allowed to applaud so much?  To give an example: the question master asks &ldquo;A rolling stone gathers no ...&rdquo; and the bright boy answers &ldquo;moss&rdquo;.  The audience applaud for at least ten seconds.  That is ten seconds lost.  Applause is all right in its proper place, and for a good answer, but minutes could be saved in the three-quarters of an hour if applause were cut out.</P>
    <P>Sponsored programmes are of a very low class.  If the Minister can take it upon himself to ban the songs from the musical show &ldquo;Gigi&rdquo; he should also take a hand in censoring the low type of sponsored programme to which we are treated and he should encourage the excellent type of programme we get from the Irish Hospitals' Trust from 11 to 11.30.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Radio Eireann on its presentation of &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;.  We are a lazy people unfortunately, and most people do not bother to read the reports of the Dáil. They get a condensed, colourful and attractive report of what happens here from Radio Eireann for a quarter of an hour.  In my opinion, that report is unbiassed.  It gives a very good résumé of the proceedings here.  The Comhairle should consider extending that quarter of an hour to half an hour in order to include more of the comments made here and the speeches of the various Deputies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> There is a grave lack of Irish news. We are taken from London to New York and Rome, and even as far as Russia&mdash;everywhere except Ireland. Surely things happen here.  The Irish news we get is from correspondents: &ldquo;The Widow Murphy's cow fell into a ditch in Ballyjamesduff and broke her leg.&rdquo;  We are not concerned about the Widow Murphy and her cow down in Wexford.  Equally, the people in Ballyjamesduff are not concerned if a chimney catches fire in Wexford.  Irish news of general interest should be included.</P>
    <P>For 14 years I have been complaining about bad reception in Wexford. Reception is also bad in Waterford and in part of West Cork.  There has been no improvement over 14 years. We are now going to move into television. <Col N="1474" /> If reception is anything like what we get at the moment at night, television will be no good to us.  The Minister said we would have to get a new wave band, or something of that type.  When shall we get it?  It is pure fraud to take licence fees from us in present circumstances.  We have the Light Programme and Luxembourg, but we should like to get Radio Eireann now and again.  Will the Minister tell us when something will be done to improve reception in these areas?</P>

      <P>(1) Bord na Móna:</P>
      <P>Mr. Dermot Colman Lawlor was appointed to be a member and the Managing Director of the Board for a period of five years beginning on the 5th September, 1958, in succession to Dr. Christopher Stephen Andrews. His remuneration was fixed at £3,500 a year, as compared with £3,000 a year applicable to Dr. Andrews.  There have been no other changes since the 20th March, 1957, in the remuneration of the directors or in the membership of the Board.</P>
      <P>(2) Córas Iompair Éireann:</P>
      <P>There has been no change in the remuneration of the directors of the Board since the 20th March, 1957.</P>
      <P>When the Board was reconstituted with effect from the 1st September, 1958, Dr. Christopher Stephen Andrews was appointed to be the Chairman for a period of five years beginning on the 1st September, 1958.  Part-time members of the Board appointed at that time who were not directors immediately prior to the 20th March, 1957, were Mr. Thomas Patrick Hogan, who had been appointed originally as a director on the 13th August, 1957, and Messrs.  Martin F. Molony and William McMullen, former members of the Great Northern Railway Board.</P>
      <P>(3) Electricity Supply Board:</P>
      <P>The remuneration of the Chairman of the Board was increased from £3,500 a year to £4,200 a year with effect from the 19th December, 1958. A motor-car allowance of £300 a year, previously payable to him, terminated at the same time.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tomás Ó Muireadhaigh was appointed to be a full-time member of the Board for the period beginning on the 1st June, 1959, and ending on the 30th April, 1960, at remuneration of £3,700 a year.  Mr. Brendan O'Carroll was appointed to be a part-time member of the Board for a period of five years beginning on the 1st June, 1959.</P>
      <P>(4) An Bord Uchtála:</P>
      <P>The members of An Bord Uchtála are not in receipt of any remuneration.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> Mrs. Philip T. Brooks, Mrs. William I. Hamill, Mr. John James McConnell and Dr. John C. Saunders were appointed to be members of the Board for a period of five years with effect from the 6th January, 1958, in place of four outgoing members who had indicated that they did not wish to be reappointed.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give quantitative expression to the effect of changes in the terms of trade on the volume of imports and exports. What can be done is to estimate the value, at price levels prevailing in one period of the quantum of imports and exports recorded in a different period. The following statement sets out the estimated value at February, 1957 prices of the imports, total exports and import excess for each of the months Jan.-May, 1957, and Jan.-May, 1959. In preparing these estimates the official import and domestic export price (unit value) index numbers were used to revalue the current totals at February, 1957 prices.</P>
