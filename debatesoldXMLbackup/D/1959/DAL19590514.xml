    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House, I should be glad to have these amendments from the Seanad accepted.  Three <Col N="2" /> of them are purely drafting amendments. One is the deletion of a sub-section and the others are to meet the requirements of drafting and procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, we shall get a more detailed explanation in the usual way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the only explanation I can.  The Bill was discussed here and in the Seanad and all the explanations sought were given to the best of my ability.  I have not any more explanations to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I could not possibly agree.  If they were to be dealt with in the ordinary way and explanations given, we would deal with it certainly.  I want to deal with it amendment by amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And there is no use in the Minister being peeved about it either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing like keeping up the obstruction.  I move <Col N="3" /> that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 14.</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), line 15, &ldquo;for which the personal representative is accountable&rdquo; inserted before &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I object violently to that remark by the Minister complaining of obstruction.  I was asked last night as a matter of courtesy by the Government would I accept at short notice&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary can correct me if a word is wrong&mdash;that the amendments should be taken this morning.  I agreed to that provided they were dealt with in the ordinary way.  It is outrageous of the Minister now to suggest that that is obstruction.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether that is right or wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>After having agreed to give these this morning, the Deputy now demands explanations of the amendments, explanations which have been given already.  However, I shall give the Deputy the explanations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for the ordinary procedure to be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is a drafting amendment designed to ensure that the administration bond will cover only those death duties for which the personal representative is accountable.  The difference between real estate and personal estate for the purposes of death duties is explained in some detail in page 2 of the Explanatory Memorandum.  Estate duty on real estate (including compulsorily registered land) is a charge on the estate itself, and is payable by the person entitled to the estate under the will or an intestacy.  The personal representative is accountable for the estate duty on the personal estate, and he pays this duty out of the residuary personal estate.  It has recently been advanced against subsection (3) that the subsection as drafted might be relied on to make the personal representative accountable for estate duty for which he is not at present accountable. If this were so, we would in fact <Col N="4" /> be running contrary to the proposal in Section 8 to leave the law as to death duties as it is.  The present amendment will clarify the position.  Our intention was to make no change in the law as to the incidence of death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanation the Minister has just given in relation to this amendment&mdash;he having one minute ago suggested he could give no explanation&mdash;shows the contempt into which a Government, which says it is a strong Government with a strong majority, could put the institutions of this House.  It also shows the way in which the Minister considers that the merits or demerits of matters brought before the House by him and his colleagues should or should not be explained.</P>
      <P>So far as the amendment itself is concerned, the position appears to me to be that the change proposed here, having heard the Minister as to exact effect of this working, is one that now could be accepted on this side of the House, but we do not propose to allow legislation to pass without seeing that the wording is such that we can accept it.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (a), lines 1 and 2, &ldquo;registered land&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;property the ownership of which is registered under the Act of 1891&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  The expression &ldquo;registered land&rdquo; is not sufficient to cover burdens, such as money charges, the ownership of which may be registered in the Land Registry. As is explained in the explanatory memorandum, where a person gets his title registered, the register is conclusive and no question of notice can arise.  Such a person acquires the legal ownership, and he is not affected by anything that does not appear in the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this amendment operate only for the purpose of this Bill or does it also have the effect <Col N="5" /> of bringing the definition &ldquo;registered land&rdquo; to include other matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that it covers what is included in the section. That is my legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say what is included in the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy was interested, he would have read the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to help the Minister by looking it up.  He has his expert advisers who can answer the questions for him.  If he does not want to have the question answered in the House, we shall deal with the matter in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the Deputy to the fact that in the discussion here on 5th November on Committee Stage, Deputy Sweetman challenged a statement made by me on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated then that it was new to the statutory law and the following discussion took place on that occasion:</P>
      <P>Mr. Traynor: It is new to the statutory law.</P>
      <P>Mr. Sweetman: On the Report Stage, I shall have great pleasure in showing the Minister where it is.  It is not new.  I should not like to quote the statute it is in, but it is not new.</P>
      <P>Mr. Traynor: In that event, I must be wrongly advised.</P>
      <P>Mr. Sweetman: I think the Minister is, unless the section means something more&mdash;unless something new is put into the section.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...when a person sells, as personal representative, a leasehold interest, the purchaser is not concerned with anything further in relation to such a sale.  One does that every day.  One assigns, as personal representative, and, when you <Col N="6" /> assign as personal representative of a leasehold estate, the purchaser is not concerned with the course of the administration.</P>
    <P>Mr. Traynor: I am assured it is new to statutory law.  The Deputy should produce the reference to the existing statute.</P>
    <P>Mr. Sweetman: The Vendor and Purchaser Act, 1874.  There is no difficulty at all about it.  I think this is a re-enactment and that it is the note at the side that is wrong.  I do not think it is new except as regards real estate.  The section itself is all right but the note at the side is misleading.</P>
    <P>Mr. Traynor: Is the Deputy arguing that it is not new to the statute law?</P>
    <P>Mr. Sweetman: Yes.</P>
    <P>Mr. Traynor: Will the Deputy look into that and, on the Report Stage, he can tell me whether he was successful or not in finding the exact statutory provision?</P>
    <P>Mr. Sweetman: I shall give the Minister the opportunity of checking my information by sending him a letter beforehand.</P>
    <P>Mr. Traynor: Very good.</P>
    <P>The Deputy ran away from that.  He did not send a letter and he did not come into the House to report the matter on the Report Stage.  He knew he was wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had the manners to ask the Parliamentary Secretary who is sitting behind him, he would find that I was ill and that I was not in the House when the Report Stage was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as good an excuse as any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We now have an example of what ignorance we can get from a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will find, and his Parliamentary Secretary will find, that it will not be so easy to get the co-operation of the House when he is behaving like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The co-operation is all on our side.  It was on our side yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly was not and the Minister for Defence knows it.  If he does not, he ought to ask his own colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What took place yesterday has nothing to do with what is before the House.  Deputy Sweetman is entitled to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is entitled to speak when we have strong Government. On the Committee Stage, I suggested to the Minister that this was not new to the statute law.  Subsequently, having gone into it at some length, I ascertained that it was the practice of the Court of Chancery which was being enacted here and that the reference to the Vendor and Purchaser Act, 1874, which comes into that case law decided by the Court of Chancery was not in the statute as such.  The Minister was perfectly correct when he said that on that occasion and I told other people that I proposed to take advantage of the Report Stage to say so.</P>
      <P>The section put into the statute was, in fact, case law up to that time.  When one transfers case law into a statute, one must be sure that, if one is introducing consolidated law, and I understood the Minister to say on that occasion that he was merely anxious to draft in statutory form what was in fact the existing case law, one must be sure that the definition one introduces into a section of the statute is introduced in such a way that it affects merely the section concerned and that it cannot be given a throw-back reference that might have been there if a previous statute were being re-enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, the amendment for which the Minister is asking is an amendment that provides certificates of charge and so forth in relation to Section 19.  I did not think there was <Col N="8" /> case law on that subject and therefore all I am asking is to be quite clear that the definition of &ldquo;registered land&rdquo; in this connection is one that affects this section alone and that the definition will not be inscribed into statute law where it is not <i>ipso facto</i> being included as a definition that would otherwise affect other aspects of registered land.  I do not think it does.  I think it is a matter on which the House should be assured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;&mdash;that it affects this section alone.  The Deputy said he was ill.  The Whip now assures me that that is correct.  I accept that and I regret anything I said in that connection.  What I want to impress on the House is that it was new to the statute law.  I want the Deputy now to admit that he was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I just said so a minute ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite all right, then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I found out afterwards that I was wrong and that I had intended to say so on the Report Stage.  This is the first chance I have had of saying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am accepting that Deputy Sweetman was ill and that he was not in a position to attend but why did he not send the letter he suggested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I knew I was wrong.  There was no necessity to write the letter unless I thought the Minister was wrong and wanted to give him an opportunity of checking it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In subsection (5), lines 19 and 20, &ldquo;either solely or jointly with the personal representatives&rdquo; deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> We are satisfied on reconsideration that the last part of subsection (2) of section 87 of the Registration of Title Act, 1891, which allows the personal representative to be registered jointly with the person entitled, should not be re-enacted.  Joint registration serves no useful purpose.  If there is any reason why the Court should not make an order for the registration of the person entitled, there is nothing to prevent the Court allowing such person to renew his application.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in Amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Subsection (6) deleted and the following new subsection substituted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) (a) Nothing in this Act or in the <i>Administration of Estates Act,</i> 1959, shall operate to require the registering authority to register as the owner of land a person in his capacity as personal representative.</P>
      <P>(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (1) of section 17 of the Registration of Title Act, 1942, the registering authority may enter on the register a note setting out the fact of the death of a registered owner of land and the names of his personal representatives.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is twofold.  Firstly, it proposes to rewrite subsection (6) in the light of the amendment to subsection (5).  Secondly, it proposes to provide for the entry in the register of a note of the death of the registered owner.  Up to the making of the 1937 Land Registration Rules, the entry of such a note was provided for in the rules, though there was no express statutory authority for so doing.  The entry of a note renders unnecessary the registration of the personal representative.  The present practice of registering the personal representative will be discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the way, subsection (1) of section 17 of the Registration of Title Act, 1942, mentioned in paragraph (b) of <Col N="10" /> the proposed new subsection, prevents notice of a trust in respect of registered land being entered in the register.  It is considered desirable to make it clear that the 1942 Act provision does not prevent the entry of a note of the death of the registered owner and the names of his personal representatives.  The policy of the law as to the registration of title is to keep trusts off the register, but the entry of a note of death will not conflict with this policy.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (7) deleted.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete sub-section (7).  There is strictly no need for this sub-section as the Registration of Title Act, 1891, provides in sections 53 and 54 for the application of the provisions of the Act in regard to the registration of the ownership of freehold, to the registration of the ownership of leaseholds and to the registration of the ownership of rights such as money charges, rentcharges, etc., mentioned in section 54 (1) of the 1891 Act.  I should like to mention here that all the rules made from 1937 to 1956 are now being consolidated and amended in the light of the proposals in the present Bill.  We hope to have the new rules available in print by the 1st June.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation.  I am sorry there was a misunderstanding between Deputy Sweetman and the Minister. Deputy Sweetman agreed at short notice last night to take this Bill this <Col N="11" /> morning.  The Minister did not fully understand that the amendments should be taken <i>seriatim.</i>  It is also a fact that Deputy Sweetman's office was in touch with me at the time of the Report Stage to say that he was ill and could not be here for the amendments in which he was interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the Chair to a statement by Deputy Sweetman.  Perhaps he said it in the heat of the moment.  He said he would take some halting action against the business which would come before the House after this.  Is that statement correct?  If it is allowed to pass, surely what happened here on this Bill should not be allowed to affect any business that follows?  The Deputy&mdash;I believe in the heat of the moment and in a childish kind of anger&mdash;threatened to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will make statements like that, he should be accurate.  I am interested not in what the Minister may think about me but in how this Dáil should function. The Minister may think anything he likes about me.  In fact, the worse he thinks of me the greater compliment I shall consider it.  Any Parliament can function only if, when there is agreement on both sides of the House to take matters at short notice, the agreement is carried out on our side and on the Minister's side.  I tried to ensure yesterday that that would happen when, in relation to this business, as the Parliamentary Secretary has just said, we agreed to take it at short notice.  I said we would have to take it in the normal way.  I said earlier that, if we were to have examples of this and not have it taken in the normal way, then we could not take it at short notice.  That is necessary not for me but so that Parliament can function.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few points about some aspects of this Vote and the armed forces in general.  As has been often stated in this House, the armed services of this country have had very little to do as far as warfare is concerned and, thank God, they have been inactive in that respect since the National Army was established in 1922. For that reason, the armed forces, especially the Naval sections, can perform a very useful service, namely, the protection of one of our largest industries, the fishing industry, and could be usefully employed, by direction of the Minister for Defence, in the protection of fishery rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of fishery protection has been raised in this House from time to time and the usual replies have been received from various Ministers as to the steps being taken in that respect.  I do not think the Minister for Defence appreciates what is required although I believe he appreciates the value of the fishing industry <Col N="14" /> because he comes from a constituency in which many people are engaged in fishing.</P>
    <P>My direct concern is for the fishermen on the South-East coast and the coast of Waterford and, in particular, for those who are in the habit of fishing for herring during the autumn season on the south coast of Wexford and round the harbour of Dunmore.  The question of fishery protection was raised by me and supported by Deputies from County Wexford and County Waterford some time ago and one would gather from the approach of the Minister that things were not one-tenth as bad as we represented them to be. I should like to impress upon the Minister that the fishermen in that area were very alarmed at the damage that was being done to the fish and to their livelihood.</P>
    <P>I, like most Deputies, was furnished with a statement from the National Fishermen's Organisation describing the damage that had been done to the fishing industry on the south coast of Wexford and the south coast of Waterford. At page 2 of the document they state:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is estimated that the foreign fleets working at Dunmore East last year landed in various European ports 200,000 tons of herring.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I humbly suggest that that 200,000 tons of herring could have been landed by Irish fishermen and used for the benefit of the people of this country and would have been a great source of income to the fishermen in that particular part of the country.</P>
    <P>Judging by the activities of foreign fishermen in that area last year, it seems to me that their activities will be intensified this year and it is quite certain, as the document suggests, that the foreign fleets will concentrate in even greater numbers on Dunmore next season in an attempt to make good the shortages arising from the failure of the fishing in the North Sea and Norwegian fishing.  Apart from the loss of income involved to Irish fishermen, as I said when I raised the matter on the adjournment one night, there has been serious damage done. Spawning is upset.  Spawn has been <Col N="15" /> damaged to a very large extent.  Therefore, the Minister should ensure that there will be greater protection afforded when the herring fishing season starts this year.</P>
    <P>When a Deputy raises the question of fishery protection it is sometimes alleged against him, by inference, that he is suggesting that the corvettes are not doing their work properly.  I do not say this for myself, I say if for the fishermen involved, that they have the greatest praise for the commanders of the corvettes and the crews.  There is no doubt about that.  Their objection is that there are not enough boats and not enough protection generally.  When fishermen allege that numbers of foreign fishermen come within the three-mile limit, the Minister often says that that is not the case, that the corvettes did not see them.  That is the point.  The corvettes are so few in number that they are not in a position to see them.  They are not on the spot when the crime is perpetrated, so to speak.  For that reason the Minister and the Government ought seriously to consider employing helicopters for fishery protection, as has been suggested by many Deputies representing coastal areas.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be smart or to score a cheap political point but it was announced recently that £10,000,000 is to be raised for the purchase of jet aircraft.  I do not want to enter into the merits or demerits of that proposal.  I take it it is a proposition which the Government believe will be an economic one and something which will bring benefit to the country.  That can be argued another day, but if it is good economics to raise £10,000,000 to purchase jet airliners, I seriously suggest that it would be in the interests of the country if the Government were to decide that the Minister for Defence should be allowed to expend some substantial sum of money on the purchase of helicopters in order to ensure that foreign boats will not encroach for the purpose of fishing in what are regarded as our territorial waters.</P>
    <P>Helicopters are one suggestion.  It has also been suggested, and I repeat <Col N="16" /> the suggestion now, that boats of the same type as corvettes should be purchased. They would be a good investment. They could be purchased from the United States, or elsewhere, and used to ensure that our fishermen will not be robbed of the harvest of fish which is the rightful property of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>The position, as I am sure the Minister must appreciate, is a serious one, as far as the herring fishermen are concerned. The herring ground around Dunmore and South Wexford has been discovered only within the past three or four years.  Herring are in abundance in the area but the danger is that the fishing ground will be fished out and Irish fishermen will have no place in which to fish at that season&mdash;that is, from October onwards for some months.  Their boats do not permit of their travelling very far afield.</P>
    <P>There is no need to go into details in relation to the size of the boats supplied to Irish fishermen, but the fact is that Irish fishermen, by reason of the size of their boats, cannot travel as far afield as the Norwegian, Spanish, Scots, British, German or Russian fishermen.  They are confined to what is described as inshore fishing. From that point of view, Irish fishermen should be given the utmost protection the Government can afford. That is why I suggest it would be a really good investment for the Government to allow the Minister for Defence to purchase more corvettes and to purchase helicopters in order to ensure that Irish fishing waters will not be trespassed upon by foreign trawlers.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the question of the protection of the fishing industry, an industry which provides a livelihood for hundreds of fishermen and their families, the fact remains that if these men cannot get an adequate return for their labours during the fishing season, they will be forced to emigrate. I am sure that the Minister and the Government do not want, by any negligence on their part, to be the cause of more Irishmen and Irish families emigrating.  I appeal to the Minister to treat this question as fully as he can when he comes to reply and to allay the real fears that fishermen <Col N="17" /> have in respect of the encroachment of foreign trawlers.</P>
    <P>Our fishermen have also asked&mdash;in vain, I would say&mdash;for an extension of the three mile limit.  In the past 12 months, the Icelandic fishermen have had their fishing waters extended up to 12 miles.  How successful they have been, I do not know.  We can go only by the reports we get in the papers. It seems to me that the idea of an extension beyond three miles has been generally accepted by most countries. If Irish fishermen are not to have a 12 mile limit, the Minister should try to ensure before next Autumn that there will be at least a six mile limit inside which foreign trawlers will not be permitted to fish.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I appreciate that the matter is not really a question upon which the Minister for Defence can give an adequate reply.  He is, however, partially responsible for the protection of our fishermen and I humbly suggest, therefore, that he bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for External Affairs, so that he, in turn, when he goes to a conference which is, I believe, to be held in Geneva very soon, will advocate that the fishing limits for this country be extended, if not to 12 miles, to at least six miles.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister some questions with regard to the F.C.A.  It is right to say that there is dissatisfaction amongst the members of the F.C.A. with the type of uniform they are required to wear.  In view of the fact that we cannot afford a large army, we must all agree that the F.C.A. are doing particularly good work, and have done good work since 1940 when an acute emergency was declared, in being available.  Apart from the type of uniform, another matter for concern with them is the long delay in the supply of uniforms.  It is difficult enough to get recruits in the F.C.A. One of the attractions in joining is the fact that the young man or the boy will get a uniform.  If he does not get a uniform within a reasonable time, he will not continue to be a member.</P>
    <P>On the question of the type of uniform I remember a former Minister for Defence, Deputy MacEoin, stating in <Col N="18" /> this House that a new type of uniform was desirable.  It seemed to me then that he appreciated the necessity for a smarter uniform.  I hope I am not interpreting him incorrectly, but I think his intention was to supply a better type of uniform.  I am not stating that as gospel truth.  I see the Minister smile.  I know that Deputy MacEoin as Minister for Defence had plans for the supply of a new uniform to members of the F.C.A.  Irrespective of any promises made or not made, there is necessity for a better type of uniform if the intention is to keep the F.C.A. up to the strength at which the Minister obviously desires to keep it.</P>
    <P>There is also dissatisfaction with regard to recognition of service in the F.C.A.  In the Army service is recognised to the extent that the men get the long service ribbon and medal. The F.C.A. feel there ought to be some recognition of the service they give. We all appreciate that the service they give is voluntary service.  Some of them have been in the force since 1940, nearly 20 years.  These men have to carry on their ordinary activities during the day in their trade, profession or business.  They give their spare time to activities in the F.C.A.  I respectfully ask the Minister, therefore, to introduce some system of recognition for those who have given long service to the F.C.A. by awarding them a long service ribbon, or a ribbon and medal similar to that granted to members of the Regular Army.  So far as I am aware, the long service medal is given in the Regular Army to those who have served for a period of 15 years.  In the F.C.A. some people have served for 20 years and that should be recognised.</P>
    <P>In the beginning of my speech, I thanked God that the Army did not, in our lifetime, have to engage in warlike activities.  For that reason, it is important that they should be encouraged to engage in other forms of activity to popularise and publicise the Army.  In many towns, the Army has already been popularised and publicised by reason of the fact that there is a garrison in the town, and periodically there are mass parades, and from day to day the people see the Army personnel walking around the town <Col N="19" /> and engaging in different activities.  In the majority of the towns and villages, we have no Army personnel, and, in my town, it is so rare a thing to see a soldier that when a soldier happens to come home on leave, dressed in uniform, all the kids in the street follow him.  I only say that to demonstrate that there are children and young people who do not know we have an Army, never having seen a soldier.</P>
    <P>The point is that since there are no Army posts in many parts of the country, they should popularise and publicise themselves by engaging in sport.  I do not wish to be critical of the Army as sportsmen.  Maybe it is because I took a very active interest in sport when I was younger, but I remember the famous Army football teams who played Gaelic or Rugby or Soccer, particularly Gaelic games because I was very interested in hurling, and I should like to know where is the greatness that was, so far as sport is concerned in the Army.  A drive should be made and the Minister and the officials of his Department should take an interest in trying to ensure that every facility that can be offered will be offered to the men who engage in boxing, football, hurling, Soccer, Rugby or any other sport within the ranks of the Army.</P>
    <P>An effort was made recently to popularise and publicise the Army through the Army bands.  That is one of the most successful methods of achieving that objective.  I should like to thank publicly the Minister for Defence and his officials for the arrangements they made in recent months to allow, I think, the No.2 Army Band&mdash;it may have been the No.3 Army Band&mdash;to visit various towns in the South of Ireland.  I must say, apart from their ability as musicians, they received the applause and the plaudits of the people in the towns which they visited.  My complaint has been for many years that the Army bands have been confined to Dublin, Cork and the Curragh&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And Athlone, where there is a big garrison.  I do not know <Col N="20" /> whether the Irish Army call it a garrison but I call it a garrison.  Much can be done to publicise and popularise the Army and to gain respect for it as an Irish institution, by actively promoting sport and by allowing the Army bands to go to as many parts of the country as they can.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress again the point of fishery protection.  There is one thing I forgot to say on that.  I do not know how far the Minister can be of help, but as I said we have fishermen in Dunmore from Britain, Scotland, Germany, Spain, France probably Russia, and nearly every maritime country in Europe.  I wonder would it do any good if the Minister for External Affairs were to protest to these various countries and try to ensure, through their Governments, that their fishermen will not, in future, encroach on Irish fishing waters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Estimate we are asked to vote a sum of nearly £7,000,000 for defence.  I note there is a slight increase on last year's Estimate and, of course, the Minister must take collective and individual responsibility for the increase. He himself has drawn the attention of the House to the fact that this increase is due to the necessary increase in pay and the extra cost for materials.  This, in turn, is due to the general rise in the cost of living in the country as a whole.  Of course, the Minister himself is a junior Minister and is not primarily responsible for it, but, at the same time, he must take his share of the collective responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are spending, in a small country like this, the sizable sum of £6¾ million and it is no harm for the House to consider whether or not we are getting value for that amount.  In his statement, introducing the Estimate, a Minister more or less intimates his policy to the House and to the country.  Deputy MacEoin, the ex-Minister for Defence, very rightly challenged the fact that the Minister did not state any particular defence policy for the country.  I know, of course, and every Deputy knows, that it is impossible for us in the political circumstances at present existing here <Col N="21" /> and in international relations, to have any military commitments whatsoever, but, at the same time, in view of the uncertain state of world conditions at the moment, one does not know&mdash;one hopes not, but it is possible&mdash;when a third world conflagration may take place.  Therefore, one would have expected that the Minister, speaking on behalf of the Government, would have had some definite idea in mind as to the defence policy for the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know very much about the armed forces, the land forces in general.  It is not my bent, nor have I had any opportunity of learning very much about them, but at the same time, the Army point of view is apparently one of manning the barrack squares.  I cannot see anything in the Minister's statement, or from what I can glean about defence, that any attempt is being made to modernise the Army.  If we are to play our part in world affairs&mdash;and whether we like it or not, we shall have to, if, unfortunately, there is a world conflagration&mdash;we must be prepared and I see nothing in the Minister's statement to suggest there is any awareness or preparedness except in relation to his remarks as to defence, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>It seems that the policy of the Army is to have a certain number of troops trained perhaps in drill and military discipline and, as I said, manning the barrack square, but I can see nothing in the Estimate, or in the Minister's statement, to suggest that the Army is being brought up to modern defence standards.  Anyone who knows anything at all about defence, or anything whatsoever about military strategy, knows it is the force which is essential and that, in any military engagement of any sort, in any part of the world, it is a mobile, high-tension force which is necessary.  There does not seem to be anything in the Estimate or in the Minister's statement to indicate that we have a nucleus of what constitutes a modern Army.  Are we able, with our military defences, to play the small part that would be necessary for us to play if we have to defend our shores?  With the sort of set-up and the sort of military equipment we have today, are we mobile <Col N="22" /> enough to transfer our forces in war from one part of the country to another?</P>
    <P>Have we any paratroop training? I would have thought, in aerial warfare if we were trying to defend this country, paratroop defence would be highly necessary to disrupt the enemy's organisation.  It may be we have these defences but the Minister did not tell us anything about them.  Have we got a mechanised unit of any kind? I do not expect we could have a mechanised Division, because of the cost, but I do not know whether we have even got a mechanised Platoon. I would like to hear these things from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Naval Force, I am one of the Deputies who maintain we should have a Naval Force of some sort or another.  We are a maritime country.  We played our part, at all times when it was necessary, in other countries' navies.  We have produced very distinguished sailors in Ireland and, on this subject, I would say our naval defence would appear to have a three-fold purpose.  One would be for the training of naval personnel so that it may be extended in time of emergency. The other would be for the purpose of fishery protection&mdash;those would be the two main purposes&mdash;and I suppose the third purpose would be for the defence of our harbours.</P>
    <P>The Irish Navy consists of three corvettes.  Corvettes are obsolete fighting ships.  They are no use for harbour defence.  They are no use for any purpose afloat in warfare except for slow convoy work.  The Minister, if he is advised, as I am sure he is by his advisers, must know the tendency of merchant shipping today is towards a faster type of ship, not only for the purpose of economy but for the purpose of evading enemy action, so that our three corvettes are absolutely valueless as a fighting force.  They are absolutely valueless to defend our harbours.  They have not the speed and the manoeuvring capacity to do so.  They are no use to convoy modern merchant shipping because they are not fast enough.  They are useful for one purpose only, and I think that is why they have been kept on in this country, because the question of disposing of them would be a <Col N="23" /> difficult one as no navy is going to buy them.</P>
    <P>No other navy afloat to-day uses this particular type of ship.  They are useful only for the training of naval personnel.  They have all the up-to-date equipment such as asdic and radar and are capable of seafaring in deep waters.  As such, our men can be trained in all the necessaries of maritime life, but they are not much use for any other purpose.  In passing, I should like to mention my own experience of the discipline and the skilled capacity of the Irish Navy.  It is exceptional and I was very proud, some years ago, when we had a big parade in Wexford for the Barry Memorial ceremonial.  Several Services took part, men of the Irish Services and of the American Services as well, and my own view was that the Irish Naval Guard there was absolutely outstanding. I do not think I have ever seen anything better anywhere else, so far as the training of the personnel goes in the naval service, but I would remind the House that the purpose of a navy is, as I say, to have some function in defence.</P>
    <P>The third purpose of the Navy is for the defence of our fishery fleets.  I have always maintained here that corvettes are about the most useless type of craft you could have for fishery protection.  The element of surprise is necessary if you are going to come upon marauding trawlers.  The Minister himself agreed that the element of surprise is necessary.  When I asked him a Parliamentary Question as to what methods he had to protect our herring fishery off the south-eastern coast he replied that he did not like to disclose what it was because the other people would then know.  There is no possibility of his keeping the method of fishery protection secret because on a clear day these corvettes can be seen, hull up, miles away at sea.</P>
    <P>No other country uses them and surely the time has come when we might do a little serious thinking if we are going to spend the amount of money which we are spending each year on Naval Services.  I think it <Col N="24" /> would be better to dispose of these ships and get something that would be of some service.  I would suggest that one modern ship&mdash;it need not be a big ship&mdash;should be got for the purpose of training naval personnel and the other ships we would have would be a smaller, faster type, low down in the water, that cannot be seen miles away, and that would be of some use in harbour defence and would give adequate protection to our fishery fleets.</P>
    <P>If we are to develop the economic arm of fishing here ships must have protection and the protection offered to them at the moment, even with the best will in the world&mdash;I am not saying a word against our Naval Service, as a matter of fact I have a high regard for it&mdash;is not adequate.  I think our Naval Service has magnificent personnel in every way but you cannot expect men to do work properly unless you give them the tools.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to sea fishery is not what it was a couple of years ago.  A few years ago there were more and better fishing grounds elsewhere. Whether it was a change of tides, or something else, there are more fish off our coasts now than there have been for a long time.  Fishing is failing in other parts, in other grounds, and now there is a concentration of fishing vessels around our coasts which is absolutely unprecedented.  It is essential that our fishing vessels should be given protection and, to have a good element of protection, you must have surprise. Therefore, I submit to the Minister that he should make representations to the Government to which he belongs to have a proper policy with regard to whatever services we may have afloat, so that we may have proper fishery protection, and that we may have craft which will be of some use in the defence of our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach to this Estimate has, I think, changed somewhat over the 10 years or more that I have been in this House.  We have seen the post-war developments in regard to Defence here, but there are some basic factors which remain and I should like to say a few words about them.  Roughly, they come <Col N="25" /> under two heads.  One is the question of the Defence Forces themselves.  Do we need them at all?  Are they warranted, and what is the best way to have them?  The second, of course, is the question of civil defence.  I would prefer to take the latter question first, for the simple reason that two things have shown up since the last war.</P>
      <P>One is that now more than ever if there comes a war, a war on a big scale, its consequences and even its immediate repercussions are likely to reach very rapidly practically every member of any community in the sphere of action.  Under those circumstances you have the further consideration that the damage, the devastation that can be easily done to the civilian and productive populations that maintain the fighting Forces, is likely to be much greater than in the last two wars. In other words, the potential of any power against the civilian and productive element of an enemy is very much greater nowadays than it was, say, at the commencement of the First World War or even the Second World War. For that reason, therefore, as has been remarked in similar terms frequently, the ordinary citizen is in the front line.</P>
      <P>There are pointers that show that we in this country cannot afford to neglect the problem of civil defence. The problem of civil defence is basically a problem of organisation.  It is not a problem of big, expensive counter-weapons, at least so far as we are concerned.  It is largely a problem of organisation in the first case, and thereafter there will be, and must be undoubtedly, expenditure of, shall I say, largely an engineering nature, to provide the facilities necessary to make the civil defence scheme work. That I think is one of the most critical things contained in this Estimate and we are now afforded the opportunity of discussing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has adverted to the matter for other Deputies and I are perturbed that there is so little thought given by the people generally to the necessity for civil defence.  It would be wrong to be alarmist about the matter, or to panic off with measures in any particular direction.  In fact, that type <Col N="26" /> of panic would be a complete negation of the organisation that is involved if you are to have an effective civil defence.  It is a question of cool thinking and calculation and the provision of properly organised machinery. Although that must be so, we must not blind ourselves to the fact that 14 or 15 years have now passed since the last war; that there were only 20 years between the last two wars, from the end of 1918 to 1939; that there have been a number of scares in the <i>interim,</i> and a considerable amount of tension at times, and that at the present moment the world is not without its tension, to state the position very mildly indeed.</P>
    <P>We are going through a time when, in spite of all the talk and efforts to maintain peace&mdash;which rather reminds one of the type of talk that we heard during the 1930's&mdash;the belligerent countries are intensely active with the development of weapons and the development of offensive armament, on the one hand, and with counter defensive measures on the other.  Can we in this country afford completely to ignore these trends?  I agree that it would be dangerous and undesirable for us to panic unnecessarily about the matter but on the other hand can we sit back and be completely complacent?</P>
    <P>We know, for instance, that nuclear tests have been carried out in various parts of the world.  I understand that nuclear tests were even carried out over the Atlantic and we are on the edge of the Atlantic.  There were some scares recently&mdash;how well-founded they were I am not in a position to say&mdash;which indicated that there was a radio-active fall-out in certain western European areas.  If that is so we have a defensive problem immediately&mdash;the possibility of such radio-active fall-out contaminating some area in Ireland.  We shall probably have to consider such a possibility if this goes on and if reports of contamination from areas in this part of the world are confirmed.  That in itself will necessitate some kind of monitoring and it seems to me that if we are to monitor our own area, to keep a watch for such things, it is actually a matter more for the Minister <Col N="27" /> for Health than the Minister for Defence.  From another point of view it is defensive in the broadest terms. If we are to do that we must co-ordinate with civil defence.</P>
    <P>I make the point only to show that the time has come when we should pay some attention to this question of civil defence and emphasise again that in the first instance it is primarily a question of planning and organisation, in order to implement the plan so far as it is necessary to keep it effective, and potentially effective if you have a fall-out, and lastly to have provision for expansion to meet a major crisis.</P>
    <P>What can be done in regard to that? Again, when we consider the nature of the problem, it is not altogether a question for a small group of technicians in the Department of Defence. It is quite clearly a question, in the first place, of staff and technical people in the Department of Defence to plan and to work out a scheme in the light of the best information available to them at the moment.  They will probably have to revise that scheme in the light of changing information but when they have done that they must have the facilities for putting such a scheme into effect.</P>
    <P>These facilities will require two things.  They will require a certain amount of co-ordination and integration with other spheres of activity, technical and administrative, so as to ensure that a plan for civil defence, either generally or in a particular area, can be put into practice.  It will require a certain amount of personnel and a certain expenditure to do that.  Above all, because we cannot afford to maintain a large organisation on a whole-time basis for that purpose, it must of necessity mean a voluntary organisation tied in with the whole-time nucleus that is directing the activity.  Then you come again on the problems of voluntary organisation which are to be met whether in the case of the F.C.A., the Red Cross, or an emergency fire-fighting and ambulance brigade, or anything else.</P>
    <P>These are the problems that have to be faced here and I suggest to the House that a good deal of encouragement is needed.  We have not adverted <Col N="28" /> very much to this question of our civil defence organisation.  The Minister stated in his opening speech that enrolment figures were most disappointing but, although that is so, I am gratified to find that enrolment is as high as it is.  On that basis, it should be possible to build the organisation.  One of the great difficulties is that there is not the same glamour about a civil defence organisation as there is about the traditional Defence Forces where the clank of weapons, the pomp of parade, compensate to some extent for anything else that is lacking.  In the case of civil defence, it is hard slogging, done quietly, and frequently without any of the attractions that go with the other type of service.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister has a problem as to how to recruit for this organisation and how to foster it.  I am not prepared at the moment to make any concrete suggestions on that point.  It is an area of activity of which I have no direct experience, but I think we can agree the right approach is being made to the question of civil defence, that it is taking its place in a proper way in the activities and the programme of the Department of Defence.  Let us hope it will receive adequate attention, that there will be proper planning and that the problem of getting personnel to work out that organisation will be overcome.</P>
    <P>Apart from organisation, there is another aspect which ties up with the Defence Forces, that is, the question of technical advice and technical assistance. One of the great difficulties of a small country in relation to modern warfare or activity during modern war is the fact that the different activities in the community are interlinked.  At the beginning of this century, at the time of the Boer War, the army of even a big Empire like Britain was equipped mainly with the rifle, which by that time had practically reached its modern perfection, that is, the ordinary rifle supported by artillery which by the standards of the first World War would have been extremely light.  There were also a few experimental machine-guns.</P>
    <P>In that situation, there were merely the problems of transporting and feeding <Col N="29" /> troops and equipping them with these weapons.  I admit there were big medical problems which were unsolved at that time but on the technical side, the main problems were those of transporting, feeding and clothing the troops and supplying arms and ammunition on that relatively simple scale.  Of course, for a small country comparable with ours, the Boers were able to put up a very effective resistance because it was possible for them to have comparable armaments.</P>
    <P>That situation changed markedly during the Great War of 1914-18. During that war, the pressures were such that the technical organisations behind the line came much more into the picture.  There was, first of all, an increase in the number and types of weapons.  There was the development of automatic weapons, the development of certain types of mortars and of the combatant aeroplane.  Then there was the appearance of the submarine. All these things complicated the traditional soldiers' problems and introduced into war a technical aspect that had not been there to anything like the same degree before.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, there was an immediate tie-up with factory production. You could not separate armies from the civilian community or from the production factories.  Even in the armies themselves, much to the disgust and against the resistance of the &ldquo;old buffer&rdquo; type of soldier, you had technical officers in the gas warfare service, in artillery and signals. Those technical officers, who were really engineers or scientists, were coming in and taking their place as a necessary element in the armed forces.</P>
    <P>I have gone over that simply to illustrate a trend which was evident even in the first World War.  You could not say: &ldquo;There are your army units. Let them go off and fight and let us cheer them when they come home.&rdquo;  By the end of that war, those units were tied up inseparably with the community that supported them, with the production facilities of that community and with the technical people behind them and even in their midst by that stage.  By 1919, war had become <Col N="30" /> very much the affair of the whole community and it was impossible to sort out the defence forces as one isolated element which could be treated as such.</P>
    <P>Even in that war, too, you had the first signs of the civilian population, even in isolated countries like Britain, being involved at a distance from the actual zones of the conflict.  You had, for instance, the first air raids on London.  Although they were sporadic and very weak efforts compared with what the second World War brought, they were nevertheless an indication of things to come.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the first World War ended with the problem facing the world that no longer could you regard defence as being catered for by providing an army, either big or small, and supplying arms.  It had to be thought of in terms of factories, in terms of agricultural production and also in terms of the protection of the civil population against gas, against air raids, and so on.  The last war proved that that point of view was the only one because all over the involved areas, whether in Europe or in Asia, the civilian populations were as closely associated with the military effort as were the soldiers in immediate contact with enemy troops.</P>
    <P>It is a sobering thought to reflect that in Britain, between 1940 and 1944, the civilian and productive population was as much open to attack and was as much part of the offensive and defensive efforts of the British as were their troops in any other part of the country.  The event is too recent for me to delay the House with details which I think most Deputies will remember, but the lesson is there that if it comes to a conflict, we cannot ignore the fact that it means involvement for everyone, and under the stress of conflict, a certain co-ordination of all the available resources of the country in relation to defence is inevitable, if we are to survive.</P>
    <P>I hope the Ceann Comhairle and the House will pardon me going into these things at some length, but this is the one opportunity we have in the year and I think it is no harm that what I say should be said.  I come now to our own experience in the last war. <Col N="31" /> We entered the last war thinking we had made a certain amount of preparation.  In fact, we had; but we all know that that preparation would have been totally inadequate had we been immediately and directly involved.  We all know, too, that if we had been involved at a later stage, what we had achieved in 1940 would not have been adequate. From 1936 onwards, it became more or less accepted all over the world that all the talk and all the efforts in the interest of peace would not succeed and that there seemed to be an inevitable trend towards the holocaust that eventually came.  From 1936 onwards, certain efforts were made here to provide for defence.  These efforts briefly were to rehabilitate the Defence Forces at the time.  There was also an effort at civil defence and the provision of anti-aircraft guns in the city of Dublin.  There was preliminary work &mdash;good, quiet, unobtrusive work&mdash; done in a number of Departments in regard to the provision of materials and the sustenance of the civil population before that war.  In any event, the thing came upon us in 1939 in a situation of relative unpreparedness.</P>
    <P>I shall deal with the question of mobilisation later.  As I pointed out here ten years ago, it was a great fortune that we were spared any immediate pressure in September of 1939. But in regard to civil preparations, it was possible, because of the time available then, to mobilise our food resources and industrial resources so as to get by in a neutral position.  But nevertheless there were problems, problems which brought about, for instance, the hurried setting-up of the Emergency Research Bureau in 1940 or early 1941 and the hurried organisation of certain medical services or potential medical services in case of need and so forth.  These things were all done in a time of crisis.  They were done inadequately; but they were done at all merely because the time was available, and we got through. I think it is to a certain extent tempting Providence just to leave things in the same hope again.</P>
    <P>To get back&mdash;I know I have wandered&mdash;to the essential point I was <Col N="32" /> making about planning, we cannot regard this problem of defence in watertight compartments.  We cannot think in terms of, say, the Army, F.C.A., the Reserve&mdash;what we would call the Defence Forces&mdash;in one compartment, Civil Defence in another and normal life in another, even breaking it up into such large categories. It seems to me that the Department of Defence at this stage&mdash; and later we shall have to support them with the facilities for carrying out the programme&mdash;must consider all the activities of the community with a view to civil defence primarily, because naturally we will all agree that an aggressive form of defence is something out of the realms of practicability for us.  Therefore, it is civil defence in the first instance, with our military defensive arrangements alongside as part of the general scheme of national defence.</P>
    <P>Taking that approach to it, there are a couple of specific things I want to suggest to the Minister.  In my opinion, there is no use in having a competent group planning <i>in vacuo.</i> I know they are competent and before the last war they were competent. I have tried to pay my tribute to that elsewhere from my own experience of what the permanent staff did before the war.  There is no use, either, in their merely focussing their attention on civil defence in the sense of providing shelters, training personnel to deal with casualties or to evacuate casualties from an immediate zone&mdash;all very essential things.  There is no use thinking merely on that alone and in other Departments thinking of the armed forces and how they are to be deployed, whether for local protection or to resist enemy action on a big scale initially.  What has to be thought out is that it will be tied in with our other normal activities.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I see the problem this way.  It is an essential part of defence first of all to see broadly what kind of plans you can provide for your population and how you are to cope with the threat you forsee.  Of course, that means some definite estimate of the situation: what do you foresee? Some estimate will have to be made <Col N="33" /> as to the likely situation or the alternative likely situations.  Having made that estimate, you have to ask; what do we do as a people to meet that? Will it be a question of wholesale radio-active fall-out, because there is much of that in the vicinity; will it be a question of a bomb in a particular place, a question of a parachute invasion, a question of being involved generally because there is action in the vicinity; or merely a case of trying to get by with the storm around you, as we did on the last occasion? Whatever it is, it is a problem for the whole community and an estimate has to be made.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves what we will do.  It seems to me, without being dogmatic in the absence of information that would help me to form a firm opinion, that you have, first of all, the question of how you will feed your population, how you will maintain the supply of food to your population in the scheme you envisage.  For instance, if you envisage that you will have evacuation arrangements in certain areas, then you have to work out how you will provide for the feeding problem that goes with that.  I mention food simply because it seems to me that we all agree that it is a first essential.</P>
    <P>Equally essential is the question of transport.  Any movement to give effect to organisational arrangements involves transport.  I remember in the last war, when we were considering the question of civil defence for Dublin city, there was the problem of evacuation.  That meant a problem of transport.  It meant a dovetailing and co-ordination with the requirements for the moving of troops and the scheme of defence in existence.  I mention all these things to show how these problems are interwoven.  The real point I want to make is this: There has to be provision for feeding the population and co-ordination with food production in the country.</P>
    <P>Next there has to be provision for transport.  Therefore there has to be co-ordination of our transport system. There will be the necessity for certain goods and equipment that you may have to produce here, essential goods and equipment to make up for what you cannot get in.  That means a complete <Col N="34" /> survey of our industrial resources, and there will be technical problems as well.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the question of the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau.  As an example, I shall quote one instance of what actually happened. During the last war, a certain industry went short of certain essential chemicals and they requested the bureau to produce these chemicals. The bureau at first felt that it would not be capable of doing that.  It so happened that the Army required these same chemicals and by combining the resources of the Army with the technical research and skill of the bureau, these chemicals were actually produced and were available to the Army and the industry that needed them.  That is clearly indicative of the sort of thing I am thinking of, although the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau was limited in its potentialities by reason of its late start and because it had to rely on whatever facilities were available in the middle of 1941, which was then too late.</P>
    <P>It is the function of the Defence staffs here to co-ordinate all these aspects I have mentioned into one scheme and then to be ready to face the second stage, which is the preliminary implementation stage.  It is quite out of the question, of course, that the Department of Defence will be able to maintain such institutions, that they will be able to maintain a large number of technicians and scientists, experts on transport and food production and all these things, just waiting for whatever is to happen.  That is not in the realm of practical politics.  It therefore seems to me that some linkup is necessary with these agencies whose normal business it is to engage in these activities I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It should be possible for the Minister for Defence and the Government, perhaps with some other Departments, to secure the necessary liaison to enable the food problem to be placed in the stage of having something definite ready.  It should be possible for the Department of Industry and Commerce and certain individual firms to provide against certain problems that can be foreseen.  We have a very <Col N="35" /> elaborate transport organisation in this country, one which has been a problem. However, the fact that you have here an organised transport system in Córas Iompair Eireann seems to indicate that it should be possible for the Department of Defence to co-ordinate a scheme for the purpose I have mentioned.  All that will require staff, both civil and military, in the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>You then have the more difficult problem of technical advisers.  It is not quite easy to see how you can deal with that problem.  During the last war, you had in the Defence Forces a number of officers who came in temporarily and who had the necessary technical qualifications and experience. We had a number of engineers&mdash;the Minister himself was one&mdash;and you had others who came into the Army and whose technical knowledge was available to the Army.</P>
    <P>Naturally, such people cannot be kept in peace time, but I suggest to the Minister that a technical reserve of some sort should be seriously considered. I know that it might be considered wasteful but unless something like that is done, there will be a deficiency of technical personnel when the time comes.  Worse than that, the postponement of the mobilisation of that type of personnel to the last moment means that they will not have experience of the problems they are to face.  If you had such a reserve organisation of scientists, engineers and doctors, they could be brought sufficiently into the picture so that when the occasion arose, they would be able to fit into the scheme right from the start. That is very desirable.  If you wait until the last moment, you have to make allowance for the time factor involved in educating such personnel in the military side of affairs.</P>
    <P>I think that during the last war, at a certain stage, there were a number of surgeons and doctors who were actually taken in and provision was made for the maintenance of hospitals in case of necessity.  I doubt if any of them ever wore uniform, even though they were given their commissions and I would suggest the adoption of some such scheme covering the type of <Col N="36" /> people I have mentioned, chemists, physicists and biologists.  Bacteriological warfare is not beyond the realms of possibility and the fact that it is so little talked about makes me somewhat nervous.  We would need bacteriologists, chemists, physicists and practically every type of scientist.  Doctors, engineers and such people will all be needed to play an essential rôle in civil and general defence, if we should have to call on them.</P>
    <P>It will be too late to leave their mobilisation to the last minute and some thought should be given to the provision of some such kind of organisation. I do not know how it can be done but a solution of the problem is most essential.  I also think that the Defence Forces would never be able to supply that organisation completely from within themselves.  As far as the Army is concerned, they are technicians of another sort.  They are as much technicians and technical people in their own particular sphere as, say, a physicist or a chemist or an engineer is in his.  They are wanted for that. On the civil side, the administration and organisation of these things in their own way can be regarded as essential technical skills, too.  Therefore, there is still a gap.</P>
    <P>When I get that far, I come to the question of the Reserve generally.  I want to repeat something which I tried to emphasise to previous Ministers as far back as ten years ago, from the experience we had during the war, and that is the necessity, in the first place, for a particular cadre or regular force.  You cannot do anything unless you have the nucleus and, more or less, that nucleus has been maintained or provided.  After that, you must have a Reserve to tie in with that nucleus.  For that reason, I welcome what the Minister said about integrating the F.C.A., the First Line Reserve, and the permanent forces into one scheme.  I never could see very much reason why there should be any clear-cut distinctions.  It was in its nature to be one scheme although there were historical things that tended to separate things.  That is welcome.  The only thing I fear about it is that it is an indication of <Col N="37" /> our failure to maintain a First Line Reserve.</P>
    <P>I welcome and I think it is completely right that the F.C.A. should be integrated with the Defence Forces and treated as full soldiers, as they undoubtedly are and can be made, and that they should be placed in their proper place in the scheme as full soldiers.  I completely agree with that.  As a member of the organisation that was their predecessor before the War, the Volunteer Force, we fought for the same thing and, in the event of the mobilisations afterwards, it proved we were justified.</P>
    <P>I completely agree with the Minister there but I fear it is now an indication that we have completely failed in ten years to maintain an adequate First Line Reserve&mdash;in other words, that the First Line Reserve that was there at the end of the war dwindled away.  That is what I fear.  To that extent I am sorry.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, one has to face the fact that 15 years is 15 years, that that Reserve would have gone and that we never faced up to a provision for a First Line Reserve in the regard in which we discussed it previously. As far as men and N.C.O.s are concerned, there was a really serious problem there.  It was difficult to get men for the intake.  I can understand that.  But I still feel we were negligent on the question of providing continuity for a Reserve Officer of a certain type, as well as the F.C.A. However, that is by the way.</P>
    <P>The lesson I want to recall is simply that it will be on the F.C.A. that we shall have to depend if it comes to mobilisation for our organisation to work at all.  If it comes to a question of mobilising our resources for general defence, civil defence or military defence, the F.C.A. will have to play an essential role and a pivoting role.  What will happen will be what happened before.  Those in the F.C.A. will be needed immediately to be absorbed in the regular forces and to provide the framework on which the voluntary or compulsory influx, as the case may be, will come at that time to be built, just as in 1939 and 1940.  I think the Minster, therefore, <Col N="38" /> is right in his attitude there and that the F.C.A. must be fostered.  I am sorry, however, that some of the experienced officers, particularly, and the men who were there in 1940&mdash;some of whom would still be young enough&mdash; are not kept.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I would mention the question of lieutenants of the Reserve who went out at the age of 47, I think. In my view, it would have been well worth while to keep on these older officers.  Admittedly, officers over 40 years of age may be past the ditch-jumping stage.  They may not be as slick going around a corner with a rifle or a platoon of men as a youngster but they are not wanted for that now; they are wanted for their invaluable experience.  They can play a very fine and important rôle at a time of mobilisation or integration of the forces, and after, on the administrative side.  They are old and experienced enough to work in the team and make it work. They are old and experienced enough not to want, like young fellows, to be off with weapons all the time but to sit in an orderly room and do the administrative work, quartermaster work, and so on.  That is not glamorous work, which is what young people like, but it is more essential perhaps than the more glamorous work of the ordinary military exercises whether in reality or in preparation.  I think every effort should be made to keep these older officers.  For that purpose, I would again recall our experience of 1939-40. It is indeed very instructive.</P>
    <P>The pre-war Army was based on the Army which was demobilised after the Civil War, in 1925.  It had an excellent quota, within itself, of officers with actual experience of actions in some form or another.  I think that even we on this side of the House, who would have taken very different views in those days, must pay a tribute to the discipline and organisation of that Army in the period from 1925 to 1939.</P>
    <P>When I first made the acquaintance of the Army on the same side of the ditch in 1932 or 1933, the thing one was impressed by was that, whatever one said about it, discipline and administation were excellent.  You had a corps of Irish N.C.O.s second to <Col N="39" /> none.  I doubt if any Army will ever again see the corps of N.C.O.s that the Irish Army had prior to 1939.</P>
    <P>It was my own great privilege in Portobello Barracks in the period 1939 to Easter, 1940, to have in a company a picked bunch of these N.C.O.s.  I am prepared to say anywhere that a finer body of men was not to be found for efficiency, discipline, administrative ability and, I should say, combatant ability too.  They were the backbone of the Army.  The standard of the regular officers also was high.</P>
    <P>In the 1930's, we had an Army here whose officers and N.C.O.s and men were of a very high standard, extremely well-disciplined and ordered and, therefore, reliable.  The result is that we had a very strong nucleus upon which to expand even though their numbers were absolutely and totally inadequate.  I have gone over that before.  It is enough to point it out.</P>
    <P>The next thing I want to point out is that, grafted on to that Army, you had an &ldquo;A&rdquo; reserve of officers and men who were not very far behind them in quality.  The mere fact that they turned up and remained in association with them for one full month every year and that that discipline and administration were there indicates that you had a group of officers and men, at least as far as discipline and administration are concerned, of a very high quality&mdash;the men, particularly. Again, the N.C.O.s and men were good soldier material.  That was the &ldquo;A&rdquo; reserve.</P>
    <P>That &ldquo;A&rdquo; Reserve, because of the length of time they were in training every year, the smallness of the Army and the fact that their training every year simply involved routine work and administrative duties, meant that you had some thousands&mdash;I forget the figures but I gave them here on another occasion and they are on the records of this House&mdash;of a Reserve ready. You had that Reserve immediately ready to join the regular Army&mdash;all of them with plenty of experience and even competent experience.  Therefore, you could count on a bigger cadre than you had.  That was the position.</P>
    <P>You had the B reserve, which was <Col N="40" /> something similar.  On top of that, there was what started as the equivalent of the F.C.A., the Volunteer Force.  There you had a magnificent body of boys and officers which supplied its quota of officers and N.C.O.s and by 1940 there were about 20,000. I forget the exact figure as I have not seen the records for a long time, but it is safe to say that it was a considerable body of officers and N.C.O.s, with a good degree of training but with no real administrative or integrated experience.  They had potential ability.  They were from a very wide sphere.  They had a good deal of training, a good deal of enthusiasm and efficiency, but they were lacking in the knowledge of routine military life, as was natural, since we only did a couple of weeks whole time training every year.  The rest was part time, like the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>That leads me to this point: We had mobilisation in 1939.  What happened? It was a very chaotic business.  The A Reserve and the regular Army integrated. If it had not been for the A Reserve, we could not have carried on with the guards and all that kind of thing that had to be catered for.  The volunteer force took time to integrate. On mobilisation the Volunteer Force units, that is, what would be the F.C.A., were not immediately ready for full military duties.  It did require some time to integrate them.  Therefore, it was back on the old A Reserve largely supplemented by Volunteer personnel, and the regular Army to fill that gap which was only inadequately and barely filled, and that at a time when we were fortunately spared any further great pressures.</P>
    <P>When it came to the mobilisation of 1940, which was on a much bigger scale, we had to face the problem of taking in wholesale the volunteers all over the country who came to the Colours in the emergency.  In a few cases, they were men with experience. They were immediately absorbed. Mostly they were young men, willing to do anything for their country, but inexperienced and untrained, who had to be taken into the military organisation. It was at that phase that the Volunteer Force proved absolutely essential.  In the first mobilisation, if <Col N="41" /> it had not been for the availability of the officers, N.C.O.s and men of the old Reserve, we would have not got by.  If it had not been for the volunteer officers who were ready and of the proper age group, taking their place in combatant units, volunteer N.C.O.s and volunteer men already trained and in service for some nine months, already brought to the stage where they could form the basis of that mobilisation, that mobilisation could not have got by, either.  That is a fair statement and a fair judgment of all of us who have tried to examine the record in retrospect.</P>
    <P>That brings me to this point: Granting that we shall have a pattern giving one time to mobilise defence forces, I am worried about the administrative posts and the administrative problems of mobilisation and expansion of the Defence Forces that may be needed.  The older Reserve officers, particularly, and reserve N.C.O.s can be an invaluable resource there.  I should like to say to the Minister that every effort should be made to get that kind of man and to hold him.  He will not be the type you will want for immediate combatant duty, but he will be the man who will function in the stores, in the orderly room, in administration generally and he will also supply&mdash;and this is most important&mdash;a steady type of officer or N.C.O. for certain essential types of guard duty.</P>
    <P>There is a type of guard duty that is essential in times of crisis and a type of guard duty that calls for a great deal of steadiness.  These men, with their experience of past mobilisation, their maturity, can fill a very useful rôle there.  I am pleading with the Minister now for a reconsideration of these men who are, say, under 55. Anyone under 55 is useful in this category. I say that deliberately.  A man, physically fit, under 55, can be, useful in this category.  I would suggest to the Minister that an effort should be made to hold any of the old personnel who already had service during the emergency or even after it, who are of the necessary quality, and that effort will be well worth while.  They will not last forever and, therefore, there <Col N="42" /> should be a constant watch kept as to how the rôle they would be called upon to play can be filled, whether it is from Regular officers who retire as time goes on or not.</P>
    <P>In regard to the F.C.A., the only thing is to do what the Minister is doing and treat them as soldiers, rely on them as soldiers and try to give them the facilities to be as well trained as they can be to fit in with a scheme of mobilisation.</P>
    <P>I have delayed the House quite long enough.  In summary, I repeat that civil defence is an essential thing and should be carefully considered but it means coordination, not only with the Defence Forces but with fire brigades and such units.  It is a national problem and should be approached on that basis and we should all co-operate with the Minister in that regard.  In regard to the Defence Forces, I have made that plea for the old Reserve.  Do not let them go and, by all means, let us build up the new Reserve as rapidly as we can.</P>

      <P>We have heard the opinions of a number of Deputies on defence.  The opinion of Deputy Major de Valera is largely based on conventional techniques, of which he has some knowledge, being an Army officer.  I think a little differently.  It may be as well that the House should hear a little of the unconventional view point because war is full of surprises and does not turn out in the way one expects it to turn out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, the Minister is responsible for ensuring that the defence organisation is healthy and prepared for any possible emergency.  It is not his job to decide policy but to the best of his ability to see that the Army is prepared.  The question has been posed by Deputy de Valera and others: what do we forsee and what are we doing about what we forsee? That is a fair question.  We are asked to vote £7,000,000 for defence.  Defence against whom?  We had a Civil War at one time but I do not expect that we will ever have a Civil War here again.  The little disturbances Deputies know about in connection with the Border were mere incidents and I do <Col N="43" /> not see any threat there, either now or in future.</P>
    <P>In fact, those men claim that they have no grounds for challenging the Government of this country.  Their complaint is against Northern Ireland only.  We are not maintaining an army to combat them because we do not need an army for that purpose. If the ordinary Garda is not sufficient, we have a detective force; we can enlarge that force, if necessary, to deal with incidents.  But we certainly do not need an army for the purpose. The army is not there to guard against a possible challenge from these people because there is no challenge that I know of, or anyone else knows of for that matter, from these people.</P>
    <P>So far as internal conditions are concerned, then, I do not see any need for defence.  The Garda are quite capable of dealing with any minor emergencies that may occur.  The question of defence, therefore, is a question in relation to something external and not in relation to something internal.  It comes down to the possibility of invasion and, from that point of view, we really ought to think a little bit.  First of all, we should know who our potential enemies are likely to be.  Every nation guards against potential enemies.  They even guard against erstwhile friends who may become enemies because of changing circumstances.  We must have some ideas as to who our potential enemies are likely to be.  As far as I can judge the position, there is only England, and England's enemies. There is no one else.  Who else could there be?</P>

      <P>That is my point&mdash; England's enemies.  I do not foresee any danger of England ever again invading this country.  We will not march on the North.  We have stated that. But, if we did, we might have to confront the British Army.  We have stated, however, that that is not our policy.  Indeed, it would be insane to make the attempt and I do not believe we ever shall try it.  Therefore, there <Col N="44" /> will be no need for this country to guard against invasion from England.</P>
      <P>Despite what Churchill said, I do not believe there was any danger of invasion by England during the last war. It is one thing for a politician to talk &mdash;that is what politicians specialise in &mdash;but it is quite a different thing when a Prime Minister consults the High Command as to the possibility of actual invasion.  It would have been a nonsensical step on the part of Britain because, for the benefits she might obtain, she would be tying down probably 100,000 valuable men here, and tying them down much more seriously as compared with 1918 and 1921.  I refuse to believe Churchill was serious when he spoke about a possible invasion. Equally, I refuse to believe we are serious when we talk about it.</P>
      <P>I believe our future relations with England will be friendly.  That will be best for both sides, and for our side in particular.  I do not see any possibility of conflict with England.  Therefore, when we talk about an enemy I rule out any possibility of interference with this country by Britain.  There is, however, one aspect worthy of consideration. England is an empire and, as an empire, she has always been involved in wars.  She always will be.  If some continental nation grows too strong that nation becomes at once England's natural enemy.  Now England is right in the policy she adopts because, by adopting it, as has been proved in the past, she is able to line up with others and to emerge victorious. She still has her empire largely because of the policy she adopts in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we see the situation to-day, there is danger of a conflict between Russia and England.  That is where the question of defence on our part comes in. We have not got an army just for the fun of it, just for the purpose of marching around the town in Easter week.  Neither have we got an army merely for the purpose of emergency. The emergency was no experience. Therefore, if we maintain an army, we maintain it because of the possibility of actual invasion.  We are concerned with the question of defending the country.  A conflict is possible.  It is idle, <Col N="45" /> however, in this context to talk about this bomb and that bomb.  There have been all sorts of surprises throughout the centuries.  When the bow and arrow was first introduced it was thought that war would henceforth cease.  But the other fellow got the bow and arrow too.  That happens all the time.</P>
    <P>One can foresee a possible conflict in which we will be involved.  Russia may overrun the Continent.  She is in a better position to do that than the Germans were.  Russia may knock out England as Japan was knocked out in 1945.  But, even in that case, I do not foresee any defence here.  I want to be honest about this: I do not see any danger of war in this country at all. If Russia overruns the Continent and forces England to surrender we shall have to surrender too.  There is no use in our deluding ourselves.</P>
    <P>Just imagine England surrendering as Japan surrendered at the end of the last war.  Northern Ireland would be invaded by Russia.  Does anyone think we could put up a defence against an enemy like Russia?  We certainly could put up no conventional defence. While there is justification, then, for having a Defence Force, that Force in any conventional form is absolutely useless.  If we sold every gun, plane and tank it would cost the country less and it would save us the job of having to blow them up in a sudden emergency. Any emergency arising out of invasion by a vastly superior force must automatically mean the annihiliation overnight of this country and its army in the conventional sense.</P>
    <P>It is no use thinking we will be able to mobilise as we did in 1939.  That was no experience at all.  Deputy de Valera spoke as if he were expecting another 1939.  I am thinking in terms of an actual invasion&mdash;not merely an experience like 1939.  We mobilised but nothing happened.  We have no experience of anything having happened, and we do not know what it would have been, if it did happen. Deputies know what happened in Egypt.  There, they had a fleet; they had a mechanised force.  What happened? Before they know what was happening, they had no fleet and they had no mechanised force.  Let us use <Col N="46" /> our commonsense.  If any country decides&mdash;it can only be England, or her enemy; it may be a stronger enemy than England&mdash;to invade this country, overnight we shall have no force.  We should not, therefore, waste money on a conventional force.</P>
    <P>I agree we must maintain a force like the F.C.A., based on brigade areas. But our only defence proper will be to let the enemy in and to make no attempt at defence.  To make any conventional stand would be suicidal.  We ought to organise in such a way that if an enemy came in here, he would have to contend with such a force as would tie down hundreds of thousands of men and make life unbearable for them.  If we organise on unconventional lines only, they will think twice about coming in at all, but so long as they see that we are organised in some conventional form, it is right into their barrow.</P>
    <P>Let me just read one brief extract from the writings of Liddell-Hart, who is an accepted military authority on this question of conventional defence and guerilla defence.  This may convey what I am trying to get at.  He was referring to the invasion by France of Spain during the French Revolution and he said:</P>
    <P>The French had beaten, and continued to beat any regular Spanish Forces&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Get my point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the thoroughness of these defeats was of the greatest benefit&mdash; to the defeated.  For it ensured that the main effort of the Spanish was thrown into guerilla warfare, an intangible web of guerilla bands replaced a vulnerable military target&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Do you see my point?</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;while enterprising and unconventional guerilla leaders instead of hide-bound Spanish generals conducted operations.</P>
    <P>Do you see what I am getting at? That is the same principle as I am outlining here and suggesting should be applied here.</P>
    <P>Look back at the invasion of Holland?  What happened in the invasion of Holland?  The Army <Col N="47" /> Staff was cut away from the main body and one did not know where the other was.  There was wholesale confusion.  That is what would happen here.  Do not think in terms of 1939.  That was only an emergency; it was not an invasion. If you think in terms of actual defence, we ought to concentrate on the F.C.A. and the I.R.A., and some kind of shadow headquarters, and not this conventional form of defence involving planes and tanks and heavy guns and headquarters centred in Dublin, because, in an actual invasion, they would all be destroyed.</P>

      <P>We should think on the lines of the Black and Tan war but on a more intensive scale and with far more fire power.  Picture the situation.  Do you imagine the enemy will tell us he intends to invade us and he will land only two tanks here and there?  They will drop thousands of paratroopers and thousands of tanks and they will wipe us out overnight. What are we spending £7,000,000 for?  During the year, certain guns were sold to Hollywood.  I suggest we should sell the rest of them to Hollywood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see defence properly organised in this country like a web. Let the enemy come in if he wants to.  If you put up a resistance, you must remember that it involves the destruction of the civil population.  If we put up any conventional defence, we are inviting the destruction of the cities and the civil population.  Therefore, my point is that I do not expect any invasion and I do not see what point there is in having a regular armed force equipped in the conventional manner.  I do not see the need for the spending of £7,000,000.  If the Army is only a hobby to show off on occasion, that is O.K., but when it comes to combat, never mind an emergency, conventional defence is no use to us.  The emergency of some years ago was not really an emergency. Only one bomb was dropped by accident <Col N="48" /> and that is not an emergency. My point is that we should give up all thought of heavy equipment, planes and so on.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, we have no underground shelters in Dublin.  I raised that question at a meeting of the Dublin Corporation some months ago and I was told that we had had two, but they were filled in, so we are talking about defence while we have no underground shelters.  In Sweden, they have shelters for 20,000 persons in all parts of the country.  The same applies to the rest of Europe and most of Europe has underground railways which provide protection for the civil population.  In the final stages of the last war, the Germans lived in the tunnels.  Where would we live?  Let us get down to brass tacks.  As Hitler said: Army officers are wrapped up and get lost in the coils of their techniques, and there is a lot of truth in that.</P>
    <P>One more point is that we have no munitions factory.  It is a joke.  During the Black and Tan war, some of the men had only a few dozen rounds of ammunition.  People were sent to the Continent to get anything they could and we are now inviting the same situation again.  If the country were attacked and had to fight on guerilla lines, probably the munitions we have would be destroyed and the men would be searching, as they were in 1918, for a few rounds of ammunition. I argued that last year with the Minister, that we should have a munitions factory, but he said it would not be wise and that it would not pay. Still it pays to spend £7,000,000 and to buy a lot of old guns and tanks which are useless.</P>
    <P>Switzerland is a country which has a situation similar to us&mdash;hemmed in by great powers.  They have not a conventional staff or a regular Army.  They have organisations in the various areas like our F.C.A. and I.R.A. but they have no headquarters staff problem. There are a few staff officers and civilians who act as types of caretakers in the maintenance of barracks and carry out administrative duties.  They do not believe in any conventional formation except for the purpose of training men for guerilla warfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Men are compelled to do a certain period of training.  They are compelled to do 180 days and after that, they just do 20 days per year. There is no permanent armed force.  It is just a voluntary force and there is only a small cadre for the purpose of training.  They realise only too well that if they were organised on conventional lines and were attacked they would be wiped out.  They believe in letting the other fellow attack; in other words, let the other fellow be vulnerable. After all, if we were invaded by a superior force, we should let them spread out and take the country and we can harry him in different areas, if we have the supplies.  If the enemy launched an attack on us and we resisted, that would be useless, and we would be likely to destroy the civilian population.  The men who continued to fight would be left in the lurch for lack of headquarters staff or ammunition. I hold that to talk of defence without having some sort of munitions factory where men can be trained and having been trained, distributed around the country to train others in the manufacture of ammunition, is wrong. As I have said, in 1918, they had to search around for a few rounds of ammunition and I was on one job&mdash;I shall not say where&mdash;and I had one bullet&mdash;one bullet and no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the position you are inviting for his country by thinking in terms of conventional defence.  If the country was taken over the main force would be both helpless and armless. I want to appeal to the Minister to think in terms of a munitions factory for the manufacture of small arms ammunition.  There is a market for about £1,000,000 worth of sporting ammunition and, in that regard, I should like him to know that the Swiss Government encourages the formation of rifle clubs.  They actually compel all citizens to join these clubs.  If we had something like that, clubs licensed for the use of 22 rifles, I am sure a lot of people would be interested in joining them, quite apart from the fact that such clubs would be invaluable from <Col N="50" /> the point of view of training.  The formation of rifle clubs would also promote a demand for sporting ammunition and that would help to justify the provision of a munitions factory which, in the event of an emergency, would provide us with our own ammunition, if we could not get it elsewhere.  We are depending on England for supplies and yet we do not know what will happen to England in an emergency.  It may be bombed out and compelled to surrender overnight and, if that happened, it could not supply us with arms and ammunition. I want to repeat again that I have no great faith in any conventional force. I believe in a guerilla force because I am not blind to our potentialities, and neither is the Minister.  We are only a small country, without great resources of iron and steel or materials of that kind, and we can only make a certain effort.  I do not subscribe to the view of those who say we will make a good show.  I am not interested in a good show, in patting ourselves on the back that we put up a good show in which thousands of men are killed, and afterwards the country is taken over and we surrender.  I want this country to be on the winning side, for a change, and not just to put up a good show.</P>
    <P>Possibly I have expressed my views in an unconventional form, but I am quite sure that if any gentlemen are thinking of invading this country they will pay more attention to what I am saying than to what some other Deputies are saying.</P>

      <P>My purpose in speaking on this Estimate is to ascertain what benefits the taxpayer is getting out of this expenditure on Defence.  Generally I look on it with a feeling of despair, and in no other way.  If it is going to take the Army as long to make up their minds, in regard to any action they will take in defending this country, as it takes them to make up their minds on ordinary matters put up to them, all I can say is God help the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is about sixteen years since I first raised, in this House, the question of the training of civilian apprentices at Haulbowline.  It is a traditional matter in Cobh and Cobh area, and since <Col N="51" /> then, I am sorry to say, a lot of the technique and training that could be given at that time has been lost, because the men who had the requisite knowledge to impart the training are now gone.  Since that time I have tackled half a dozen Ministers on this question.  Every time I put down a question I was told that the matter was under consideration, or under active consideration.  One Minister went so far as to say that I could forget about the problem because he was looking after it himself.  During that time a couple of hundred young men on leaving the technical school in Cobh had to go abroad without the finishing knowledge that they could have got at home while, at the same time, we were bringing in foreign technicians to do the jobs that these young men could have been trained to do had my scheme been adopted.  The general taxpayer is paying for a service and he is entitled to get something out of it.  The matter has been under consideration for 14 years and I do not know what team are considering it now.  It would be rather amusing if there were not a tragic side to it.</P>
    <P>The next thing I would like to deal with is the question of the water supply to Haulbowline.  On Haulbowline Island some 700 men are in constant employment, between Irish Steel Limited and the Department of Defence itself.  They are dependent on a water supply brought across from Cobh, which also serves the Army in Spike Island.  Some months ago the pipeline which carries the water across went out of order, and for five or six days divers had to be sent down to locate a leak and repair it.  Had the breakage lasted another two days the men employed by Irish Steel Limited would have been thrown out of work. I saw what came up from the pipe and I can say that there is not a single bolt or nut in the mile and a quarter of its length that is not corroded, and I am concerned with the employment of the many men who are dependent on that water supply.</P>
    <P>I raised the matter here and I put several questions on it direct to the Department but it was like the scheme <Col N="52" /> for the Haulbowline apprentices.  I want results.  I suggested, and it has been put up to me that the only hope is the installation of an auxiliary water supply so that in case the other one fails, and while it is being repaired, at least a supply will still be provided. Every bolt and nut in the old pipe will have to be replaced and it is something which cannot be put on the long finger or hundreds of men will be thrown out of work.  I would ask the Minister to speed up that and look after it.</P>
    <P>The first duty of our Defence Forces is the protection of our citizens and, as far as the naval side is concerned, the primary question is the proper protection of our fishermen around our coast. I do not think that the present service is sufficient.  More than that I will not say but I do certainly suggest that in return for the expenditure of some £7 million we expect the protection of our own people and their interests. That is one of the first things which should be looked after.</P>
    <P>Although we have succeeded in getting the Department of Defence to change their attitude as regards being bad landlords, I suggest that they speed up the handing over of land.  In one area in my constituency we have a state of affairs which is a disgrace and should not be allowed to continue.  I have sent to the Minister notifications for another half year's rent which people have received from his Department although it has been published that their land has been taken over by the Land Commission.  To whom are they to pay rent?  Are they to pay one rent to the Department of Defence and another to the Land Commission? Those people are entitled to get all the benefits of the Land Acts put through this House.  They are entitled to a reducchase and they are entitled to a reduction in their annuity.  It is my job, while I represent them, to see that they get those benefits and I intend to see that they get them.</P>
    <P>We see in the Estimate that instead of a reduction in the cost of maintenance of military land there is an increase from £1,280 to £1,700.  Surely if the Department is getting rid of large areas of land there should be a reduction in maintenance costs?  I do not <Col N="53" /> want to waste the time of the House but a statement was made here this morning by Deputy Major de Valera who is, I suppose, an authority on military matters, in which he brought us back to the time of the Emergency.  I do not want to think about the time of the Emergency, nor of a lot of the muddling done then, and I have no intention of thinking of it if I can.  I know of men in my area who were prepared to fight and who were equipped with blunderbusses and buckshot.</P>

      <P>We wound up with Springfield rifles with defective magazines. At the same time there was not the ordinary co-operation that there should have been between the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice.  If anything had happened, those men were expected to go out with the buckshot and defective rifles while hundreds of tip-top rifles and plenty of ammunition lay idle in the Depot.  The rifles are there yet, if somebody has not put holes in their barrels lest they might be any good.  I know, because I have had personal experience in the matter.  Two rifles were sent from my area to the Department of Justice so that at least two of our boys would have a couple of rifles.  I followed them up and one genius in Kilmainham said of one rifle: &ldquo;There is no ammunition for this rifle and, therefore, it should be destroyed.&rdquo;  I succeeded in getting hold of the rifle and I did not give it back to the Depot. There were good rifles there, far superior to the articles brought in from America which were only poor imitations of what Krüger had in 1902.</P>

      <P>I was indeed very glad to hear the Minister pay tribute to the work of the Army and I should like to join with him in those tributes. I was also particularly pleased to hear the compliments paid by the officers in charge to our men in the Lebanon.  We should all be proud that our nation can produce officers who can hold their own with the élite of some of the great military nations of Europe and the world generally.  It is a grand gesture to hear our young Minister for Defence, who has served in our Defence Forces, pay tribute to his <i>quondam</i> colleagues.</P>
      <P>While I think that the efficiency of the commissioned officer in the Army is as high as it ever was, I am afraid that down through the ranks we cannot say the same.  Most military States have an élite body for ceremonial purposes.  Although the British Army was mechanised a good many years ago they still maintain a small cavalry unit for ceremonial purposes.  I do not suggest for one moment we should do that in this country but we should have a show piece in our Army, an élite corps, and one of the places where such a corps should be mounted is outside the Parliament of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to criticise in any way <Col N="55" /> the private soldier who does that monotonous sentry duty here but one need not go very far from Leinster House to see the sentries on their beat who would certainly find themselves in the guard room some 10, 15 or 20 years ago if they carried out their duties in the slovenly manner in which they are at present carried out.  I know it is a monotonous job and I have nothing but sympathy for them but it is just as easy to do a thing well as to do it in a solvenly way.  I hear very unfavourable comments on the rank and file of our Army who do sentry duty on some of the public buildings in our State.</P>
    <P>One of the battalions of which we are particularly proud is the First Battalion, An Chéad Cath.  They are as fine and as well drilled a body of men as I have seen in the army of any country, but unfortunately they, too, are becoming browned off.  Their battalion headquarters is Renmore.  They are lucky if they get a month at Finner and Finner, in inclement weather, is not a very encouraging place to go, as Deputy Booth knows.  For a certain period of the year I suggest the First Battalion should be brought up to Dublin for ceremonial parades and to mount guard on our public buildings. It would break the monotony of life and, if I may use an army expression, it would jizz up the rank and file and possibly set an example to the troops stationed in the military quarters in town who are inclined to become browned off.  I think I made an unsuccessful appeal to the Minister's predecessor that it would be a good thing for the army generally.  It would be a good thing for the First Battalion and it would be an incentive to prospective recruits to join that battalion.  Most of them are from Connemara, Dingle and Kerry and they would welcome a visit to the metropolis not only to display their knowledge of the language but to display their knowledge of foot and arms drill.</P>
    <P>Are we getting the service from the F.C.A. we would expect from the amount of money we are spending on that force?  I do not wish to criticise the personnel of the F.C.A. because I <Col N="56" /> think they are a wonderfully enthusiastic bunch, but I am afraid they are carrying a lot of dead wood on their rolls.  I am speaking from experience. I have seen musters of F.C.A. in some parts of the country where there were only two men and an officer. We should cut out the dead wood and confine the F.C.A. to the small band of enthusiasts who are willing to give their service and their time to the force.</P>

      <P>I know it is but they are costing the ratepayers money and unless they are willing to give their time and services free we should cut out the wastage of supplying them with uniforms and giving them two free weeks in the Summer in a military camp at the seaside.  The example set by the North County Dublin Battalion should be followed throughout the country.  I admit they may have the strength and can afford to cut out the dead wood, but perhaps if we did that in other places the battalions and platoons might crumble away.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I have no objection to their not turning out but what I do object to is that we should pay for their uniforms, their transport and the ammunition they fire on their courses.  I agree it is most difficult to deal with a voluntary force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another force being allowed to disband which I should like to see revived, that is, the Officers' Training Corps in the Universities.  That corps was established about 1928, disbanded about 1934 and was succeeded by the Regiment of Pearse, who did work equally as good as the Officers' Training Corps.  I am not advocating the revival of the Officers' Training Corps <Col N="57" /> or of the Regiment of Pearse but the revival of some body, call it what you will, organised and recruited on the same lines.</P>
    <P>The young men of the Officers' Training Corps were a voluntary body who gave their spare time during their university courses to that Corps and later they sacrificed, I must say with pleasure, portion of their summer vacation to do an annual camp course at some of the military centres.  At the time of the emergency some 400 or 500 officers were immediately commissioned on the basis of the training which they received in the Regiment of Pearse and in the Officers' Training Corps.  We had the nucleus of a commissioned force ready to step into uniform, ready to take over platoons, companies and battalions, fully trained volunteers costing very little.  It would be a very good thing if we could revive such an organisation.  The Minister himself is an ex-member of the Regiment of Pearse just as I am an ex-member of the Officers' Training Corps and we have both attended reunions of these bodies and undertook to endeavour, if not to revive one or both, to revive some force in substitution for them.  I know the Minister will be handicapped by lack of finance but if we cut out the dead wood from the F.C.A., as the North County Dublin Battalion has done, we might find sufficient money to form the nucleus of an Officers' Training Corps.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also introduced, I understand, the word of command and instruction in the Army through the medium of Irish.  I wonder is it a wise thing to do?</P>

      <P>The Minister is going further and eliminating the English language.  It is a good thing and a very good example to the rest of the country but I think it should be bilingual for this reason, that if an emergency arises we will have a maximum <Col N="58" /> of only 24 hours' notice.  We shall have to pull in men from all the various walks of life and we shall be depending upon the hard core of the present Army to be the N.C.O.s and commissioned officers of this new body.  If they know the word of command only through the medium of the Irish language it will be very difficult for them to transmit their instructions to a mixum-gatherum such as would be pulled in at short notice. It would be foolish to switch over completely to instruction and word of command through the medium of the Irish language.  I have no objection. It is a grand thing to show the example&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I am saying.  The Parliamentary Secretary has corrected me.  He said that down through the years it has been the custom to give the word of command or instruction through the medium of Irish.  I say that is not so. I pointed out that a commissioned officer who is a Deputy of this House, Deputy Booth, knows no Irish.  His reply to me was that those who knew it gave the instruction through Irish and those who knew no Irish gave it through the medium of English.  Who taught Deputy Booth?  Surely if it was an officer who could only give instruction through the medium of Irish, was he not at a disadvantage in <Col N="59" /> passing it on to a recruit such as Deputy Booth or any other person who had not the advantage of knowing the Irish language?  We should continue it bilingually except in the case of the First Battalion, who will be operating in an area where Irish is the spoken language.</P>
      <P>I should also like to refer to the part played by our Naval Service in fishery protection.  I know it is a very difficult matter.  I know the answer the Minister will give me: our coastline is so long and scattered that it would cost a lot of money to patrol and protect it in the manner in which it should be done. I quite agree with him.  The cost of corvettes and keeping them at sea is very expensive.  But during the war, when Britain wanted all the manpower she could possibly get for her armed forces, the British fishing fleet still had to put to sea and had to be protected. It was not protected by destroyers.  It was protected by placing abroad at least one vessel in each small fleet a machine gun, plus a machine-gunner, who was usually a retired veteran of the forces.</P>
      <P>We have not got very many fishing ports in this country.  We have three in Donegal, one or two in the West and a few in Kerry and Waterford.  It should be possible to mount a gun on one of the boats fishing out of these ports; and some member of the crew skilled in the use of that gun, preferably an ex-N.C.O. of the armed forces, should be paid something small, not very much, for operating that gun in an emergency.  That would not cost very much and if the poachers got a burst of that gun and came to realise that at least one of our innocent-looking ships carried something more than a popgun, they would think twice before coming inshore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is something in our army regulations prohibiting us from supplying arms to civilians, it might be possible to have that civilian attached for the time being to some branch of the Defence Forces, such as Slua Mhara.  It would be a cheap and effective method.  I should not like to get the answer that we could not trust one of them with such a gun.  I am told <Col N="60" /> that civilians in rural Ireland were trusted with guns when it was difficult and highly dangerous to have such arms and they conducted themselves in an appropriate manner.  I do not see why they would not do so again.  It is something worth considering.  It would be a saving to the State.  Otherwise, I would advocate the allocation of a small, fast speed-boat to each of the ports.</P>
    <P>Fortunately or unfortunately, our fishing is seasonal.  There is the herring fishing in Dunmore at the back end of the harvest, the matje fishing in Donegal, the harvest fishing in September and the winter fishing.  It might be possible to have one of these boats located at Killybegs, one at Galway and one at Howth.  I hope Deputy Burke will not suggest sending one to Balbriggan.  One at Howth would protect that particular stretch.  Balbriggan is a very good fishing centre, but it could be protected from Howth. That boat could serve as far as Arklow.  You could also have one at Waterford, which would protect the fishing fleet at Dunmore East.  It would not be required in any particular locality for more than six weeks.  What I am thinking of is a boat of 30 foot or 40 foot keel capable of up to 20 knots, armed with one small gun.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It will do up to 20 knots.  Remember, Iceland has not the resources we have, but she was not afraid to defy one of the greatest fishing fleets and navies in the world when that navy violated its territorial waters. I do not suggest we should be aggressive towards our neighbours, be they Germans, Norwegians, French, Spaniards or British.  All we want to do is to protect what we have, and I think we could do it, and do it very cheaply, if we put our heads together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been advocated many times that we should have a helicopter <Col N="61" /> service.  Nobody appreciates the Minister's difficulties more than I do.  I know his Department is a spending Department and that it has no income.  He has to depend on the national purse and the Minister for Finance for his allocation.  It is good that we should have at least a few modern weapons and planes merely for the purpose of training our personnel, but we should not go beyond the nucleus of these modern machines.  At the same time we might be able to spend a little on the purchase of helicopters.</P>
    <P>It is a little bit humiliating at times when we have a little tragedy off the coast, particularly off the Donegal coast, and we have to ring up the hated, despised and detested British naval base in Derry and beg them to send down a helicopter to our aid.  Let us give all thanks to them; they have never yet refused to come to our rescue.  But it is a little bit humiliating, especially when we blackguard them and say this and that about them.  At the same time we put our hands behind our backs and say &ldquo;Come to our rescue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we could afford it at all, we should endeavour to have helicopters for fishery protection, the protection of our islands and for coming to their aid in times of distress, if only for the removal of a patient from one of our islands or the dropping of much needed supplies on certain occasions.  I am thinking particularly of Tory Island off the West Donegal coast, where they are sometimes without supplies for up to five or six months. That may be an exaggeration but it is up to nine and ten weeks at a time.</P>
    <P>I shall finish on this note.  During the war years very often the bodies of the personnel of other nations landed on our shores or fell from the skies.  We rendered military honours on the occasion of their burials and rightly so.  We did not render them military honours because they were Russians, Germans or Americans. We did it because they were soldiers, irrespective of the policy of the nation for which they fought.  When a German came down here he received at his burial the military honours that we would give to our own soldiers. <Col N="62" /> The same applied to the British, the Free French and the Norwegians.</P>
    <P>To-morrow morning, if the Taoiseach or any member of the front bench passed away, I would hope to see our Army pay its respects to them as men who fought for their country just as I would like to see the same honours given to Deputy General Mulcahy or Deputy General MacEoin.  It is the proper thing to do. But the first Chief of Staff of our Irish Army was General Michael Collins.  There is a little memorial service held once a year at Beal na mBlath to honour a brave soldier. People go there every year, people who fought against him.</P>
    <P>I have talked to the man who was in charge of the ambush party when General Collins was struck down.  He was afterwards a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He told me that he was in charge of the ambush party at Beal na mBlath when General Collins was struck down.  He comes there religiously every year to pay respect to General Collins, not as a pro-Treatyite, a Minister for Defence, or as a member of the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  He comes there every year to pay respect to General Collins as a soldier.  All we ask the Minister to do in respect of General Collins is to render to him the honours which I hope we shall pay to the Taoiseach and to all others who fought for Ireland. Let us forget the little bitternesses.  Let us honour General Collins as a soldier by sending the Army there to pay its respects to him.  If we do so we shall be assisting the President of Ireland in his appeal for unity and in asking us to forget the past.  We shall also be honouring a great Irish soldier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>One good thing among others was achieved by the change of Government in 1948.  It brought realism into the attitude of all Parties in this House towards the Defence Forces.  At that time it was a very controversial question.  The incoming Government decided that the target to be maintained as regards the number on full-time service with the regular Army was unrealistic, that a lower number would suffice in our circumstances and that greater attention should be paid to our Reserve Forces. That attitude was taken up by the Party now in office and used pretty effectively with the existing forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I claim that that attitude however had an undesirable effect because it aroused in the minds of the regular soldiers an antagonism against those invited to come forward to join An Foras Cosanta Aitiúil.  I regard that force as one of the most excellent we have in the State not alone for its contribution towards the defence of the State itself but because it is assisting in a very effective way in bringing so many of our young men to a realisation of true citizenship, giving young men an opportunity, while still living with their families, while still engaged on their normal vocation in life, to contribute to the State, to give of their spare time in military training which is not alone an asset to the country but also of benefit to themselves both <Col N="64" /> in their moral character and in their physical well-being.</P>
    <P>I think one of the most regrettable incidents in the history of our defence forces was the manner in which the members of the L.D.F. were left like Mohammed's coffin suspended after the Emergency when they did not know whether they were wanted or what they would do.  It was during that period that a glorious opportunity was lost to cement that force and the personnel at that time into the Defence Forces of the State.  The present move on the Minister's part to integrate that force in our Defence Forces is an admirable one and cannot but bring good results from the enhanced recognition implied in it for the members of that force.  Too many of them have been bored stiff by the repetitive training they have undergone during the years when they did not have the facility of more advanced weapons and more interesting training which members of the Regular Forces had.</P>
    <P>This integration will consolidate the position of that force in the country. Above all, we now have a more realistic attitude towards what is necessary in the country in relation to the numbers that are vital so that we would have the cadre of an Army which, if the necessity arose&mdash;God grant it does not&mdash;will be capable of expansion into the size necessary to meet an emergency.</P>
    <P>I want to protest about one matter associated with the recruiting drive and that is the form of the recruiting poster published when the Minister sought additional recruits for the Army.  The &ldquo;Have a Go&rdquo; poster was a frightful production.  It had nothing more than a teddy-boy approach to the men we would like to see enter the National Army.  Among the general public, it occasioned considerable misgiving.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have been interested in getting parents, in getting people who are responsible, to encourage young boys to go into the Defence Forces certainly found that an obstacle was created when we saw in the public Press the spectacle of a man in uniform with a weapon held in front of him and the words emblazoned across: &ldquo;Join the Defence Forces and Have a Go.&rdquo; This was unfortunate.  Let us hope that <Col N="65" /> the resentment it created will bring home to those who are responsible that it is something that should never be repeated.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to another matter in a very good way.  It is a matter on which we do not wish to engender any heat or any animosity or any going back on history.  We think, however, it is within the province of the Minister and of the Government to contribute in no mean fashion to the appeal of the President and of others who were active in the fight for freedom to bring about a closer understanding and to bring about the end of any bitternesses that exist from the time of the split on the Treaty issue.  In withdrawing the military respect at Beal na Blath, the Minister has created in the minds of many thousands, who would wish that the memory of Collins would be revered, considerable resentment at the fact that the Army of which he was founder and Commander-in-Chief are prevented from attending the simple ceremony which is held annually at the spot where he lost his life.</P>
    <P>It cannot be said that at any time that occasion was used by any political Party for political purposes.  It is a simple ceremony.  The Rosary is recited.  Old colleagues on both sides, as Deputy O'Donnell said, gather annually to pay that simple tribute to the memory of one of the greatest Irishmen of all time.  It is regrettable, therefore, that one of the first actions of this Government has been to withdraw the right of the military tribute the Army paid to their former Commander-in-Chief.  Let us hope it it not too late to have that action reviewed and to overcome the resentment caused by the withdrawal of the military honour to General Michael Collins.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter which I raised before for the Minister's attention relative to injuries sustained by an officer of the F.C.A. in the battalion with which I was once associated. Lieutenant O'Connell attended at Kilworth Camp for annual training on the 5th June, 1955, and, while in training, he was struck by a vehicle on the public roadway and very seriously <Col N="66" /> injured.  He was taken to the Military Hospital at Cork where he received admirable treatment over a long period. Nevertheless, after his discharge from the Military Hospital, in order to recover the full use of his limbs, he had to undertake very expensive and very extensive treatment in a private capacity.  At the time, this man had bought a farm.  Incidentally, his membership of the Defence Forces brought with it the credit of his prowess as an athlete.  He holds national records gained at championships where he represented the Army.</P>
    <P>Lieutenant O'Connell, unfortunately, was seriously injured in that accident and, in consequence of his injuries, was compelled to abandon his livelihood of farming.  The consequences, physically and in every other way, have unfortunately been serious.  At that time, he applied to the Department of Defence for compensation in respect of the injuries he sustained.  At the same time, he instituted civil proceedings against the driver of the vehicle that knocked him down.  It was understandable that, while the civil proceedings were pending, the Department could not consider his application but it was intimated to him that it would be examined when the civil proceedings were resolved.</P>
    <P>If Lieutenant O'Connell had to wait until the proceedings had gone through the courts, he might still be awaiting award of compensation. Because he settled out of court for a sum of £2,500, the Department now claim that he contravened the regulations which provide that any settlement should be without prejudice to any claim the Department may have.  The extraordinary thing is that no claim was lodged by the Department against the car owner and it was only when Lieutenant O'Connell settled for that sum of compensation that the Department levied the charges for the treatment which he had received in the military hospital.  Lieutenant O'Connell is now informed that unless and until the amount of those charges, which is pretty considerable, is paid, his claim to an <i>ex gratia</i> payment in consequence of the injuries he sustained cannot be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> When men leave their homes and give of their time to the Defence Forces, as they do, they should be secured against any set-back.  These regulations, no doubt, have in mind the loss involved in providing a substitute for an officer or N.C.O. or member of the permanent Defence Forces where the necessity arises but where a man volunteers for An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and goes into training and is injured in consequence, that regulation should not be invoked in order to delay the decision.  The matter has gone on quite long enough, and, in all justice, the claims made by Lieutenant O'Connell should be considered favourably because of the unfortunate circumstances in which this young man finds himself as a result of the injuries he received.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been very interested in this case and I am satisfied that he is making every effort to give this unfortunate man the measure of compensation that is his due.  I would impress upon him with regard to this regulation, which, as Deputy MacEoin points out, is clearly indicated in the case of a serving soldier, that it is quite unjust to apply it to an officer or member of the Defence Forces who is not a paid member of the Defence Forces permanently engaged in military activities.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are interested in this case felt that the matter had gone on quite long enough before the claim was resolved and it came as a considerable shock that Lieutenant O'Connell was billed for the treatment he had received in the military hospital, no regard being had to the fact that this officer had to undergo expensive treatment in order to recover the use of his limbs which had received terrible injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was very pleasant indeed to hear Deputy de Valera paying tribute to the <Col N="68" /> officers, N.C.O.'s and men of the Army whom he got to know first in 1932 and indicating that we had such a disciplined force and competent force, on which to expand when occasion arose in the last emergency.  It is true that we have today in our Defence Forces men who are a credit to the uniform they wear.  It is incumbent upon us, in so far as we can, to see that their requirements are met in pay and conditions so that they will be encouraged to remain in the Forces and so that recruits will be attracted to take their part in the Army.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Having complimented the Minister on his efforts on behalf of the language and the furtherance of the true Gaelic spirit in the Defence Forces by his own good example and without any compulsion whatsoever, I should like to <Col N="69" /> come to a few points I want to raise in relation to the Estimate.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Corish who suggested that the Army should publicise themselves and that the ordinary civilian population do not see enough of the Army or appreciate their true worth.  With other members of the House, I was invited to attend the annual Mass and memorial service at Arbour Hill.  That was the first opportunity I had of being present at such a ceremony.  It left a deep impression on my mind.  It was a wonderful experience to see the way in which the salute was given and the colours and swords presented during the Consecration and later at the graves of the 1916 leaders.  The colour and ceremonial left a deep impression on me.</P>
    <P>If our people could see the Army on ceremonial occasions like that it would leave on them, too, a deep and lasting impression.  The commands were all given in Gaelic.  I hope that, if we get television here, ceremonies like that will be televised and the people given an opportunity of seeing these things for themselves.  Not alone will our own people see them but the people in other countries will see them as well. Everywhere they will be left with a profound impression of the competency and efficiency of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the F.C.A. uniform.  I had the honour to be a member of that force.  Being a voluntary force, I hold no expense should be spared on it.  I am glad the Minister held a conference recently with all the battalion officers throughout the country. I am glad he has taken them into his confidence.  I am sure that his action will do a great deal of good. Henceforth the F.C.A. will be an integral part of our Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the apprenticeship school and he commended it to parents and to vocational students. I am a member of a vocational committee and I am glad to know that we have this school at Naas.  The Minister told us there are 55 boys undergoing training there.  We have, too, the school at Baldonnell, the Army School of Music and the Signals Depot at the Curragh where apprentices are trained <Col N="70" /> in crafts connected with radio and radar.  I suggest a circular should be issued by the Minister's Department to vocational committees notifying them of the facilities available.  These openings would be ideal for boys anxious to learn a trade and, at the same time, do national service.</P>
    <P>I join with other Deputies in appealing for more members for our civil defence force.  Some Deputies said this force was not sufficiently publicised. Some of us had the privilege of seeing the films shown and we found them most enlightening and most interesting. I understand that these films are borrowed from the War Office and cannot be shown to the general public.  We also saw demonstrations.  There was one in Galway at which the Minister was present.  We saw members of the civil defence force in action there.  If lectures and demonstrations were held in the big towns, the force would be considerably increased.  Prospective applicants could be informed that even though their services may never be required&mdash;we all hope that, please God, they never will be required&mdash;the training in first aid, fire fighting and other subjects would be of tremendous benefit to them in ordinary civilian life.</P>

      <P>I do not know very much about the Defence Forces.  I am not fully qualified to speak on defence, but there is a contribution I can make to this debate.  The Estimate for the Department of Defence is up by £215,735.  When an Estimate carrying such an increase as this comes before the House, Deputies must bend their attention to the fact that a solemn undertaking was given by the Government to cut down expenditure and to make things easier and lighter for the taxpayers.  We were told every effort would be made to prune with a view to furnishing this House with a Book of Estimates which would not be such a tremendous strain on our already overburdened taxpayers.  That was the theme of the song sung by every Minister constituting the Government and the Minister for Defence was no exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxpayers are now being asked to foot a very big bill for defence. Indeed, the bill has increased year by <Col N="71" /> year.  The taxpayers are beginning to ask themselves: is the Army really worth the expense?  This year, the taxpayers will have to meet a further demand of £215,735.  That increase justifies comment.  What value does the taxpayer receive from the Army? Have we not reached the stage at which the usefulness of the type of army we have has become a thing of the past?  If our country were invaded tomorrow morning, how long would we last, faced with a modern army armed with modern equipment?  We might last a couple of hours; we might last half a day.  We certainly would not last half a week.  Every thinking taxpayer knows that.</P>
    <P>Pay for members of the Defence Forces is responsible for increasing this Estimate by £215,000.  No one objects to our Defence Forces being paid, but what is responsible for that increase but deliberate Government policy, the policy of the Government in increasing the price of food, in increasing the price of clothing and in increasing the cost of the various essentials which the members of the Defence Forces and their wives and families have to obtain?  If it is a result of Government policy with regard to the cost of living, and that is the view of the members of the Defence Forces, it reflects and rebounds on the double on things of this nature where we have to make provision for allowances for pay increases which probably would not have been necessary, if it were not for the general and substantial increase in the cost of living, due to the reckless manner in which the Government have conducted themselves.</P>
    <P>Let us go further into the Estimate. We see that the estimate for our show jumping teams which are available for horse jumping contests is down by something like £6,000.  I wonder why? A few years ago, our Army Jumping Team conducted themselves abroad in a manner which reflected great credit on this country.  For some reason which I do not know, and which nobody seems to be able to explain, there has been a great deal of failure in their efforts and very little success has been <Col N="72" /> achieved in very recent years.  I wonder if the Minister's Department would inquire most carefully into this to see if we have the right type of horses and if the proper care and attention is being paid to this matter.</P>
    <P>We cannot attribute any great fault to the riders, but how does it come about that practically every other country in the world which compete is now able to beat us?  Is it the fault of the horses or the men?  Is it that they have better horses and better riders in other countries, because it seems to me, as an ordinary bystander looking at our Army Jumping Team, that they were better and had a higher standard some years ago. Instead of improving, it looks as if they are falling lower and lower and they cannot be expected to improve with a decrease in the Estimate of £6,000.  The Minister should give the House a clear explanation as to the future of the Army Jumping Team.</P>
    <P>Marriage allowances are up according to this Estimate to the extent of £17,161.  We see an increase in the Estimate for chaplains and clergymen to the extent of £313.  There are 13 chaplains in the Army and they receive something in the region of 35/- a day, plus an allowance for a housekeeper. I put it to the Minister that for Army chaplains to receive 35/- a day is something which does not reflect any great credit on the Defence Forces.  Surely if there are any people in the Army who should be well paid, it is the chaplains.  In addition to feeling that the chaplains of the Defence Forces should be paid on a more generous scale and at a higher standard, I feel there should be a substantial increase in the allowance provided for the housekeepers.  I trust that the Minister will have the Estimate examined by the Army authorities responsible, before next year.  There are only about 13 chaplains in the Defence Forces and the least that can be expected is that those 13 will be singled out, if I may so describe them, as special members of the Defence Forces.  Arrangements should be made to have a review and a complete redrafting of the scale of pay and allowances of Army chaplains.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> The cost of transport of troops shows an increase of £1,419.  The cost of petrol and oil is up.  Could we not have some economies exercised in that regard? Those of us who travel from the south, the east, or the west, very frequently meet a line of Army lorries.  I often ask myself where are they going to, and where are they coming from? Sometimes, if one looks into the backs of these lorries, one sees that they are empty.  Sometimes there are two or three soldiers sitting in the back.  Some of the lorries consume quite a good deal of petrol and oil.  They are the old type of lorry and they are antique in design and antique in engine and they seem to burn oil at an extraordinary rate.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why, if we have transport of troops, if we have a bill here for the transport of troops, better transport arrangements are not made. The Army lorries are entirely out-of-date. I personally do not like them.  I do not suppose it will make any difference to the Minister, but I do not like them, and the ordinary person does not like them, because they seem to be something in the nature of the old Black Maria, the closed-in coaches which were used to take prisoners from courthouse to courthouse and from jail to jail.  A brighter type of vehicle should be provided, a more attractive type.  I sometimes feel that if that were done, people would work on more economical grounds both from the point of view of the use of petrol and oil.</P>
    <P>Again, I often ask myself when I see the lorries on the roads and the movements of the troops, is there not a good deal of overlapping in Army transport? Those of us who have occasion to pass through Kildare, the Curragh or parts of the Midlands, wonder why we meet these detachments of Army lorries so frequently?  Is it possible that members of the Defence Forces are permitted to use these vehicles at the taxpayers' expense for missions which are not of prime importance?  There is no day, and certainly no week, that we do not see detachments of heavy lorries consuming oil and petrol which do not, to the eye of the ordinary taxpayer, seem to be on missions of any great <Col N="74" /> importance.  Some economies should be effected in that respect.</P>
    <P>Mechanical transport is up in this Estimate to the extent of almost £10,000.  I am not quite clear on this and I should be glad if the Minister could intervene now or make a clear statement when he is replying. Transport of troops is up to the extent of £1,419; mechanical transport is up to the extent of £10,000.  The petrol and oil bill of the Defence Forces is £84,650.  Is it not clear that some inquiry or investigation as to the complete overhauling of that section of the Army which is dealing with transport is necessary?  Could the Minister tell us, or explain more clearly, because, the Estimate seems to be rather vague.  Mechanical transport is up to the extent of almost £10,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if it is proposed to buy new machines, new lorries or new vehicles or what will be purchased as a result of that increase. Does the Minister for Defence not consider&mdash;if he does not, at least the taxpayers will&mdash;that the accounts presented for petrol and oil used by the Defence Forces to the extent of almost £85,000 is something that can be described as outrageous, and that if we had more modern and up-to-date transport, the petrol and oil bill would not be so substantial.  Trying to use the old vehicles which are out-of-date, is a penny wise and pound foolish policy.  I trust an effort will be made to have this matter dealt with by the Army authorities.  If the Minister submitted any recommendations or representations to this House in that regard, I feel they would be sympathetically considered.</P>
    <P>Clothing is up to the extent of £72,984 and that brings me to the question as to whether, included in this clothing, is the type of uniform worn by members of the Defence Forces.  The F.C.A. uniform is a disgrace, and the material in it reminds me of the old poorhouse rough tweed and rough cloth.  It is of the poorest possible quality.  It is impossible for members of the Defence Forces, without great strain and attention, to keep their clothes properly pressed <Col N="75" /> and as clean as they should because of the useless and pauperish quality of the material.  If clothing costs have gone up to the extent of £72,000, does this mean it is a bill for only one year's additional clothing for members of the Defence Forces, or does it mean it is proposed to get some type of material that will be more in keeping with modern times, and that the old workhouse material at present used for a soldier's uniform will be completely done away with?</P>
    <P>The uniform of the officers of the Defence Forces is attractive in itself, but comparing the type of material used for the uniform of the officers of the Defence Forces with the poorhouse type of material used for the uniform of the ordinary soldier&mdash;we do not expect the ordinary soldier to be fitted out with the same type of material as the officer&mdash;I think something in between the two could be arrived at.  Or is it the position in the Army that any type of old rag is good enough for the ordinary private? Is it the position that for the uniform of the officer, with his cane, his stripes and his medals&mdash;if he has any&mdash;a special type of clothing is provided, while the man serving under him, who is equally as good in the discharge of his duties, is provided with clothing made from what I describe as this type of poorhouse material?</P>
    <P>An attempt should be made to have the accounts for the clothing of the members of the Defence Forces reviewed, and an effort made to provide a new type of material which will be something between the existing type of material for the ordinary soldier and for the officer.</P>
    <P>Civil defence is up to the extent of £78,774 and I should like to say a word on that.  There is a Director of Civil Defence in this country.  I do not know if I had an opportunity in this House before to do so, but I should now like to avail of this opportunity to say that the Director of Civil Defence has made himself known throughout the country because of his lectures, because of certain film shows he has arranged and because of the energy and enthusiasm he has put into <Col N="76" /> this important work.  I want to pay that tribute to him.  If there were more men of his type in the Army, men with the same facility for imparting knowledge, it would be a good thing.  We should be mighty proud to have a man of that type in charge of civil defence and I want to place on record&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I say that the moneys which are being provided in the Estimate do not contain sufficient for civil defence?  Will the Minister tell the House whether it is a fact that certain civil defence operations cannot be successfully carried out because of the lack of money?  It would be much better that moneys provided for the Defence Forces, and even for the F.C.A., were entirely devoted to civil defence.  I wonder has the Minister for Defence gone into the question of the F.C.A. in relation to their duties in regard to civil defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to have a first-class civil <Col N="77" /> defence organisation, the basis of that organisation should not be a few employees of the various local authorities. You want to have greater numbers interested in it, particularly when we realise that the radio-active fall-out from one atomic bomb dropped over Glasgow would not lose its effect until it reached the town of Navan.  Having regard to the seriousness of such a situation, and more curious things have happened in the past, it is quite possible that in years to come, the atomic bomb may be used and, if that happens in England or Scotland, it is bound to have a serious effect on this country, having regard to the winds, having regard to the serious effects in the great loss of life, the poisoning of livestock, and the poisoning of water supplies.</P>
    <P>That is why I think the F.C.A. should be interested in this problem. At the present time the F.C.A. are a very useful body.  They may be training and may appear very effective on the parade ground.  They may take part in shooting competitions, but I feel they could do more valuable and more useful work if they made a thorough study of all the facets of civil defence.  They should be given lectures frequently on civil defence and the Director of Civil Defence should have a number of assistant directors, if he has not got them already, to do the work he does in areas which he himself cannot reach.  I feel that the F.C.A. is not as important at the moment as we feel it is, and if we wanted to make it really something, we should encourage more of its members to do something worthwhile in civil defence.</P>
    <P>The greatest benefit they could bestow on the country is to endeavour to be fully trained, to be fully equipped and to have a full knowledge of all requirements for civil defence purposes. The film shows given in connection with civil defence are of immense value to the general public, but how many of the general public have seen these films?  I feel that all the members of the F.C.A. should be paraded into seeing these films.</P>
    <P>I know that a number of these films are on loan from the British and they were of immense interest, but only a <Col N="78" /> very limited number of people can see them, those who are intimately connected with the Red Cross or the civil defence organisation.  These films are available to them, but, if there were general parades of the F.C.A. to attend the showing of these films, it would certainly be of great advantage and great help to the country.</P>
    <P>I think there should be more lectures on civil defence, particularly to the members of the F.C.A. and I assure the Minister that any money spent in that regard will be well spent.</P>
    <P>You cannot educate the general public fully enough on the importance of civil defence.  We are living in a different age now, and living in a different world completely, so far as warfare is concerned.  What we want now is not to educate our Army or the active members of the civil defence organisation but to educate the general public.  If possible the matter should be brought down to the school level. Our people should be educated on the importance of the precautions necessary in civil defence.  Danger may be nearer than we expect and there will be no use trying to lecture the people on the results of radioactive fall-out when it happens.  The time to do that is now.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister for Defence has sufficient go and energy to undertake that task and if he does, not alone will he have the support of all members of this House but he will be doing a good day's work for the general public who wish to be educated in this regard and who are anxious to be given information in greater detail.  I am sorry that voluntary effort in regard to civil defence has not been more successful. I do not know what steps the civil defence section of the Department have taken for the purpose of soliciting support throughout the country.  Do members of the county councils realise their responsibilities, or the members of town commissioners, in cases of large towns with big populations where the public should be educated and where they would be willing to attend lectures on the very great dangers that can befall a community from radio-active fall-out?</P>
    <P>There should be committees formed <Col N="79" /> in every county, or some county authority should undertake the organising of this work and see that there are frequent meetings and lectures so that there would be a greater measure of support and co-operation from the public.  The public are absolutely ignorant of the nature of civil defence and they are being allowed to remain ignorant.  The manner in which the Department is tackling the job is not sufficient.  We must keep in line with other countries and while it is true to say that we are not capable of providing a lot of finance for the work it is also true to say that we must do the work to the very best of our ability. If the Minister for Defence asks any member of the general public what serious effects a radio-active fall-out would have, that person would be unable to answer him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody must take the responsibility and somebody must be available locally to start the ball rolling.  In that regard, members of this House can do a lot.  The work must be looked upon as our job.  We have a responsibility to those who sent us here.  They sent us here, rightly or wrongly, to do a job in their interests, and we should advise them on an important matter of this kind.  I feel that voluntary effort is not sufficient and <Col N="80" /> someone in the local authority must give the lead rather than wait for people to volunteer.  Already we have the nucleus of a terrific civil defence organisation in the shape of the F.C.A. I do not know whether the Army authorities would wish completely to disband the F.C.A. as it at present exists, and convert it into a civil defence movement.  If such action were taken, I should welcome it because, in the interests of the public, I think some steps in that regard should be taken.</P>
      <P>I want to return now to the question of finances for civil defence.  What is provided is a mere flea-bite compared with what is required.  If we are to build up an organisation which will safeguard the public, local authorities should be asked to contribute a little more generously to it.  It is true that already ratepayers have a very big drain on their resources but could there be a better way of spending money than by trying to save the people from complete disaster?</P>
      <P>As I said, it is not outside the bounds of possibility that this disaster could happen, and, if it does happen, it will result in a serious loss of life and property.  I think the Director of Civil Defence and his assistants, and the representatives of the Minister for Defence, should consult with the General Council of County Councils and with the county councils themselves, and organise some movement which will arouse greater enthusiasm in the country in relation to civil defence.  The work which is being done is good work and very valuable work, but it would take about 40 years to educate the public as to the dangers that exist and what should be done in a case of an emergency, unless it is tackled in a businesslike way and has the support of the general public. Merely to address five or six people in a hall will not attract the tens of thousands of people whom we must attract.  We should solicit the help of owners of factories, mills, industries and cinemas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could arrange to have it done. There are large numbers employed in factories and industries and is it too much to expect that in the national interest even half an hour, or an hour for one or two evenings each week should be devoted to civil defence? Why not solicit the support of the industrialists, those in charge of factories, and others responsible for absorbing labour on this important question of civil defence?  In particular, the cinemas could do a great deal to help in this regard.  The I.N.T.O. could also give a helping hand.  They have always assisted in everything that is national in this country.  Short lectures in the schools would also help because it is amazing what parents can learn from their children.  The time and energy devoted to the language might perhaps be far better devoted to something more practical in the way of lecturing on civil defence.</P>
      <P>Our schoolteachers are as good a body of public citizens as you would find in any country, and the same applies to those in charge of our workers.  Could not the trade unions &mdash;for instance, the Workers' Union of Ireland, or the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, and indeed, all the trade unions and their Congress &mdash;not be approached by the Department of Defence and a scheme worked out to attract a certain amount of voluntary support from workers, in co-operation with employers and industrialists? I think that is of the greatest importance.  I do not propose to dwell any further on civil defence. The matter is of the utmost importance and anything I have to say I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Government may realise the dangers, they are not conveying them to the country.  More work in the line of civil defence is carried on in France and in Britain with a higher degree of success than in this country. The reason is that, unlike us, Britain and France have had a taste of war. If we do get a taste of it, it will be too bad if we are not prepared for it. No matter what the circumstances may be, if another war comes, nothing will <Col N="82" /> keep us out of it.  There is a grave responsibility on the Minister for Defence to protect the general public by means of civil defence.  It is a very difficult job which requires the co-operation of Deputies of all Parties.</P>
    <P>I am not uttering those words in regard to civil defence in a critical sense and I hope the Minister will accept them in the spirit in which they are meant.  What has been done has been done well but more needs to be done quickly.  The efforts to protect the people are not being made at the speed with which we might expect disaster to overtake us and our people may be caught out.  There is no use in closing the stable door when the horse has gone.  I trust the Minister will take some steps to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the modern Barracks in Kildare, there are a number of Army barracks which are costing a great deal of money to keep in repair and painted.  A general scheme of repairs is necessary for a number of them.  That brings me to the point as to the reduction in the number of tradesmen.  Last year, the Estimate showed there were 1,017 tradesmen employed with the Army and this year there are only 984. Does that mean that these tradesmen have retired or gone away for one reason or another, or does it mean that their services have been dispensed with?</P>
    <P>I am told reliably that there is a great deal of work for tradesmen in the Army, for carpenters, plasterers, and so on.  The tradesman personnel of the Army are at a very low level and if there is general repair, decoration and maintenance work to be carried out, that staff should be increased.  It is penny wise and pound foolish to cut down on the number of tradesmen in the Army when there is such important work to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Naval service has never reflected very great credit on the country for the reason that we have virtually no Naval Service.  Our Naval Service is only in the region of 513 men.  It has neither vessels nor adequate personnel.  Is it not true to say <Col N="83" /> that the only obligation on our Naval Service is to protect our fisheries? I do not propose to go into that because I shall have a great deal to say on it on the Fisheries Estimate.</P>

      <P>There is only a limited amount of protection because it is not possible to watch the south coast and at the same time keep a close eye on our other shores.  Our Naval Service is a farce.  Their work cannot possibly be done efficiently with only 513 men, with the very limited amount of shipping, gear and equipment, and also the very limited resources at their disposal.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Minister for Defence what, apart from protecting our fishery limits and seeing that there is no trespass by foreign trawlers, does our Naval Service do?  I cannot see what else they do, although those in charge have been doing a good job within the resources available to them.  It is time either to have a proper naval service or to scrap what is only masquerading as one.  If the taxpayers' money is to be spent on a Naval Service, why can we not have a service that will do the work efficiently and quickly instead of expecting a force of 513 men to watch the shores of this country and see that protective measures are carried out when required?</P>
      <P>There is a bill included in the Book of Estimates for telegrams, postage and phone calls to the extent of £50,000.  The sum of £50,000 is not unusual because it is only up by £770 on last year's figure.  Is it not possible to prune that bill of £50,000 for the Army?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Colman's Hospital, Macroom, was formerly a fever hospital.  In June, 1949, it was transferred to the Cork Sanatoria Board for use as a tuberculosis hospital.  The hospital was never used &ldquo;for general purposes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When I discussed with the Deputies from Cork on the 15th January last the present proposal to accommodate elderly persons in St. Colman's, I informed them that it had been the experience of my Department that hospitals of such a small size as St. Colman's tended to be uneconomic. I pointed out that there is at present a large number of very small hospitals throughout County Cork and I stated that I did not view with any great enthusiasm the suggestions that some of them should be perpetuated as County Homes.  I promised, however, to examine the matter further and, as arranged with the deputation, requested the County Manager to furnish information regarding the annual cost of running the proposed unit. This information has since been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the truce, Dáil Éireann decided that a multiplicity of workhouses was wholly unsuited to the circumstances of this country, that many of these workhouses should be abolished and that a central institution should be established in each county for the care of elderly persons. Effect was given to this policy by the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, under which County Schemes were established.  The County Schemes provided for the <Col N="86" /> closing of a number of workhouses and the establishment of a single County Home in most counties.</P>
    <P>While I feel it would be a retrograde step to reverse this policy in the case of St. Colman's hospital, I am still considering the matter and I hope to convey my final decision to the local authority shortly.</P>

      <P>I was asking the Minister a question in regard to the provision in this Estimate of £50,000 in respect of postage, phones and telegrams.  It is an extraordinary large sum.  I shall not dwell further on it, but it is hard to justify it.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to the hospital treatment of soldiers' dependants which is down by almost £2,000.  That is a portion of the Estimate which should not be reduced.  What is responsible for that reduction?  Are there now fewer dependants receiving hospital treatment or are more of them having to pay for their own treatment?  That is something that should be explained by the Minister for Defence.  In the past, free hospital treatment was available for the dependants of soldiers.  Are the local authorities now being obliged to pay for the medical and hospital treatment of these people?</P>
      <P>I want to make reference to the Red Cross Society.  The amount in the Estimate for them is about £2,500. I do not want to criticise the Red Cross Society for the reason that I do not know anything about it.  Nobody else in the country seems to know anything about it either.  We are told that it exists and we see that functions are held at which certain people are present.  I think the House should be furnished with a more detailed account of the finances the Society has in hands.  A fabulous sum has gone into the Red Cross Society over the years and there are frequent collections for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know what amount is available to the Red Cross Society, in what loans they have invested the money and what rate of interest they get on it.  A good many people are suspicious of the amount of money going into the Red Cross Society and it would be wise if those responsible were made aware of the importance of making available to the general public the details of the financial situation. The people want to know where that money is going and what it is being used for.  Is it being used for equipment or what is it for?  The Red Cross Society gave valuable service to the country during the Emergency and it <Col N="92" /> seems to me that it could render similar service with regard to civil defence but the financial standing of this society is viewed with suspicion in the country.</P>
    <P>I do not desire to say anything about the F.C.A.  What I had to say on that matter I said in relation to civil defence.  I think that the Force, as at present constituted, is not a great source of strength to the nation.  If it was disbanded and its activities transferred to civil defence it would be much better.</P>
    <P>I want to deal for a moment with the question of training.  As far as the F.C.A. is concerned that whole matter should be reviewed.  In many areas where the Force exists there are supposed to be large numbers belonging to it but the parades are poorly attended.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the sum of £10,000 should be in this Estimate for the operations of the Offence Against the State Act, 1940, but I do not want to probe into that.  A state of affairs existed in the Curragh some time ago when a number of internees made a break from the Curragh Camp.  The Army was ordered out on duty on the main roads and many of the general public travelling from the South of Ireland to Dublin were stopped by those soldiers.</P>
    <P>I have no blame for those men.  They were doing what they were told to do, but I saw young fellows of between 18 and 20 holding heavy guns faced in the direction of motor cars that were stopped and, through fear, very little would have made them put those guns into use.  They were shaking to bits with fear.  I never saw anything like it in my life.  Worse still was the tone of the language used.  They asked: &ldquo;Where are you going?  What is your business?  What have you in the boot?&rdquo; Shots were actually fired that night.  I understand that a lorry was fired at.</P>
    <P>One case was raised in this House and the Minister has a file from a solicitor in a case.  A number of soldiers stood out under a lorry and the driver had to jump on his brakes to avoid them.  There was no warning signal given and a motor car which <Col N="93" /> was coming behind smashed into the lorry.  There was a serious accident resulting in damage to the car and a doctor had to be called.  Through neglect on the part of the Department of Defence, the insurance companies refused to accept responsibility for the damage done and the driver of the car behind the lorry had to pay his own medical expenses and foot the damage to the car.  When he protested to the officer in charge the reply he got was: &ldquo;You got off damned lucky.  What business had you driving so closely behind him?&rdquo; There was no expression of apology.  They lost their heads that night through sheer cowardice and excitement.</P>

      <P>I shall describe it as sheer inexperience.  Through sheer inexperience, they were inclined to lose their heads on that occasion.  I do not say for one minute that that is casting any great reflection on them.  They were given a job to do.  The job seemed to rest on the shoulders of fellows who appeared to be so young that they seemed as if they had just left school. They just stood there shivering, watching the lines of traffic as they were held up on that occasion.  I do not know where they were but the experienced old warriors were not available on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> I want to make a protest on behalf of a number of people who were rudely treated on that occasion.  It would be much better for the Minister if, instead of encouraging Irish in the Defence Forces, he encouraged a little more manners.  I say that in the full knowledge I have of the conduct that took place on the Naas Rd. on the night in question.  I do not beg for courtesy very often but I was the subject myself, on my way home from the Dáil, of intrusion by those men. I shall not say any more than that. They should at the very least have endeavoured to be courteous to the people injured in an accident if it had taken place on their own responsibility.</P>

      <P>The Department of Defence did not.  It was an outrage.  It is one of the reasons I speak on this debate.  I want to let some of the Army Officers know that the conduct of those on the road that night did not reflect great credit as to courtesy so far as those responsible are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the subject of the Army Nursing Service.  In order to get into that service one requires not alone a good deal of medical and nursing skill but, I am afraid, a good deal of political influence.  It is a very important service.  At present, it comprises 212 persons.  I venture to say that if the files were made available of the people taken into that service in recent years it would be found that there is hardly a single person in that service who had not to have on her personal file letters from influential <Col N="95" /> persons and Fianna Fáil Teachtaí Dála.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very recent. Even if I went back to the time of the first Government, it is very wrong that any good Irish girl who is a qualified nurse should have to get a job through political pull if she cannot get it on her merits.  In the Army Nursing Service, there are good girls who are first-class nurses, fully qualified in every respect. Nevertheless, unless they had political pull they could not get into that service. In my view, the method of appointment to that service stinks.  I make that observation in full knowledge of the position.  I have been informed, even by people within that service, that, unless there is a certain amount of political pull, there is no such thing as entry.</P>
      <P>A substantial sum is provided for the conveyance of stores, and so on, from the main depôt to distribution at the various units.  That is a case in which I think there has been a good deal of overlapping.  The Department of Defence would be very well-advised to ensure that, so far as stores, equipment and distribution to the various units are concerned, not alone would there be a little more efficiency but some better method of distribution to the various units concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that £15,000 is provided for advertising.  That is a very big sum. What is the advertising?  I wonder if the £15,000 is required for more of the teddy-boy posters which Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned some time ago&mdash; teddy-boy posters that would be inclined to turn young people against being associated with the Army?  Whoever was responsible for that poster should be publicly tried in O'Connell Street.  That poster was a disgrace.  It reflects no credit on the Defence Forces.  It is an insult to the future of the Irish Army, to the good old-timers we have in the Army at the present time and to the younger men who are <Col N="96" /> now trying to climb up on the shoulders of the old-timers.</P>
    <P>Was the guidance of any of the old high-ranking and experienced Army Officers, who have been associated with the Irish Army since its establishment, sought in respect of such a poster?  I want to know if the poster was placed before the Minister first for his approval as a suitable means of encouraging young people to join the Defence Forces.  If the taxpayers' money is to be spent on such a poster, it is right that some protest should be made here.  Deputy O'Sullivan was too mild in describing it as a teddy-boy poster.  It could properly be described as a skit upon the Army.  If you cared to, you could describe it as indecent and as a poster likely to bring the Army into disrepute and ridicule.</P>
    <P>In my view, the poster was a disgraceful piece of advertising which has cost a good deal of money.  I do not know who was responsible for it.  I do not know whether the Department get these posters through an advertising agency or whether there is an expert in the Department who gets a bonus for his efficiency as a poster designer. I do not know how it is done but whoever was responsible for the poster in question should be fired forthwith.  To have him fired forthwith would be a mild punishment for having the country flooded with an advertisement of that type.</P>
    <P>What has been done in the Army about encouraging more athletics&mdash; G.A.A., boxing, wrestling?  Has any move been made in the Army to ban rugby and soccer?  Has any move been made in the Army to discourage those who like soccer from playing it? Has any move been made in the Army to discourage those who like rugby from playing it?  We all know very well that the Minister for Defence is a very narrow-minded man so far as the Irish language is concerned.  If he wants to shove the Irish language down the necks of the soldiers, that is no reason why he should try to prevent them from being associated with soccer or rugby, if they so desire.</P>
    <P>The other evening we all saw a photograph in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of one of the best rugby players in this <Col N="97" /> country.  I shall not mention his name now.  If an effort is being made in the Army to discourage our soldiers from playing such games as they wish to play, I think it is wrong.  The Minister can make an effort to shove Irish down the necks of our soldiers.  He can insist on Irish commands being bawled at them as often and as loudly as he likes but I protest at any action by the Minister or his Department to stamp out the playing of soccer or rugby by any member of the Army who wishes to do so.  Furthermore, those who attend soccer matches or rugby matches ought not be held up to ridicule in the Army.  If any instance of such an occurrence is brought up to my notice I shall table Parliamentary Questions on the matter so that it will be exposed to the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister's conduct in shoving the Irish language down the necks of the personnel of the Army is I think interfering with the Constitutional right of the citizen.</P>

I would fight an election against it and venture to say that I would win an election on compulsory Irish because the people do not want it any more than the members of the Defence Forces want it thrown upon them either.  I want to issue a warning to the Minister not to put any restriction <Col N="99" /> on the rights of members of the Defence Forces to play rugby, soccer or cricket.  They should be permitted to do so and there should not be a certain clique organised in the Army for the purpose of being the Minister's Irish Ireland confederates to point their fingers and say, &ldquo;Here you are in an Irish Army, encouraging foreign games and encouraging this, that and the other.&rdquo;  It takes a good man to play rugby or soccer or to play on the G.A.A. field or to play 18 holes of golf or to participate successfully in any sport.  Why should one be so narrow-minded as to deprive soldiers of participating in any sport they wish?</P>
      <P>I feel that I would be wrong to refer to Army pensions and Service medals because these matters will come up on another occasion.  I was impressed by Deputy Sherwin when he referred to the erection of a munition factory.  The Minister for Defence would not remember the time when it was one of the promises of the Fianna Fáil Government that a munition factory would be established.  Like all the other promises they ever made, it has faded out and been forgotten.  I do not see the necessity for a munition factory because if any munitions are wanted, they can be easily got by Deputy Briscoe this time as he got them before.</P>

Tá rudaí ann gur féidir linn cógháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Aire agus le lucht na Roinne, as a bhfuil á dhéanamh aca, mar shompla, ar son na Gaeilge san Arm agus ceangal níos dlúithe a dhéanamh idir an tArm agus an Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil agus, freisin, Scoil Printíseach an Airm.  Ach, tá cúpla cúis ghearáin ag lucht an Airm, go mór mhór maidir le hardú céime agus tá míshásamh san Arm faoi sin agus, mura mbíonn lucht an Airm sásta, is cuma Arm ann nó as.  Ba mhaith liom, má's fíor go bhfuil aon rud ag cur isteach ortha sa tslí sin, go <Col N="100" /> ndéanfaí rud éigin chun an scéal, a leigheas.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an éalódh ón gCurrach, ní aontaím ar chor ar bith lenar dhúirt an Teachta Ó Flannagáin. Bhí mise ar an mbóthar abhaile an oiche chéanna agus cuireadh stop liom naoi n-uaire agus, idir fhir agus oifigí, bhí gach duine béasach, deamhúinte. Ní aontaím ar chor ar bith lenar dhúirt an Teachta.</P>
      <P>I should like to refute the allegations of Deputy O.J. Flanagan from my own experience of my journey home on the night of the escape from the Curragh.  Between Kilcullen and Athy, I was held up eight or nine times in a distance of about 14 miles and I can pay tribute to the men and officers who held me up for their courtesy and civility.  There was no question of ramming a gun through the window of the car or anything like that.  It is most unfair to give the description that Deputy O.J. Flanagan has given of the holds-up that night.</P>
      <P>I said that there are some matters of complaint in the Army, the principal one that I have heard being with regard to the question of promotion. Rightly or wrongly, the feeling is abroad in the Army that some group, either within or without the Army, is in some way using influence with regard to promotions.  Whether that is correct or not I cannot say but if that fear could be dispelled it would be to the advantage of the Army personnel and to the working of the Department of Defence.  Even though the Army is becoming more and more mechanised, there is always the human element and if the personnel of the Army are not satisfied we will not get the co-operation and service that we should get.</P>
      <P>The officers of the First Line Reserve have a genuine cause of complaint. The Minister may be looking into the matter because there was a question asked about it on a previous occasion in the House.  If it is possible to do anything in that regard, it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter on which I hear complaints from time to time is the question of married quarters for serving <Col N="101" /> personnel.  I do know that efforts were made to improve conditions on the Curragh by the erection of a new housing scheme there and the transfer of those who were in A quarters to B quarters or from B quarters to C quarters, and giving them better conditions there, but something further could be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister if he has had any report from the committee that was set up to deal with the improvement of Curragh grasslands.  The Department of Defence handed over some land to the Department of Lands for the relief of congestion in the area or for the use of migrants there and I should like to know if anything more could be done in that line by giving over some of the lands that might not be needed for defence purposes, while not interfering with racing interests in the Curragh or those who have sheep claims in the area.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other matters about which the Minister may be able to do something.  The Naas Urban Council were negotiating about houses at the Apprentice School.  I do not know whether that would be a solution of a problem that exists, but it might relieve housing needs to some extent if these houses were returned to the urban council.</P>
    <P>It would be of tremendous benefit if agreement could be found in relation to the vocational school at the Curragh. The Minister and his Department have shown themselves to be interested in education in the Army. From that point of view, the difficulty between the vocational education committee and the Army authorities should be overcome; a solution of the difficulty would be helpful and would contribute to the good feelings which exist as between the ordinary people in Kildare and the Army.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of the national school in the Curragh. I understand it comes under the aegis of the Department of Defence.  During the coming Summer vacation, the school is to be decorated and necessary repairs carried out.  The school is at the moment overcrowded and huts are being used to help solve the problem of overcrowding.  While these <Col N="102" /> huts may not be dangerous, I do not think they are suitable for the purpose for which they are being used.  Huts ought not to be used in place of proper school buildings.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister and his Department have decided on a closer liaison between the F.C.A. and the Regular Army.  That is an appreciation due to the F.C.A. in return for the services they have given.  I should like to see this purely voluntary force getting the best possible conditions and adequate recognition of the importance of the work they are doing.  Those who join the F.C.A. are mainly young lads just out of school.  If conditions are made sufficiently attractive, they may be induced subsequently to join the Regular Army.  From that point of view, the conditions under which they carry out their courses are important.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note the effort being made to promote the use of Irish in the Army.  I do not agree with Deputy O J. Flanagan that this is again compulsory Irish; neither do I subscribe to the view that it is doing harm to the Irish language.  I was very pleased recently to be told by an officer in charge of a corps in training that the recruits had no difficulty in following commands in Irish and in doing their course of training through Irish.  I asked him if he had specially picked men and he said they were just ordinary lads with a national school education.  I regard that as a high tribute to the work being done for the language and a tribute to the people in the Army that they are able to do their courses through Irish and those under them have no difficulty in understanding what is required of them.</P>
    <P>The baby of the Army is the apprenticeship system introduced within the past few years.  Technicians are trained at Baldonnell, in Naas and in the Signal Corp School at the Curragh. Tribute is due to those responsible for this work.  The school I know best is the one at Naas.  Commendation is due to those who have co-operated to make this school a success&mdash;the trade unions, the vocational education authorities and the Department of Defence.  Likewise, those who pick the boys are worthy of a well-deserved tribute.  I <Col N="103" /> do not know whether they are selected by the Army or by some Civil Service board.  Wonderful work has been done in selecting the type of young fellow admitted to the school.  The conduct of the boys is excellent.  Complaints have been very few.  This reflects admirably not only on the boys themselves but also on those in charge of the boys and those who selected them, in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The people of Kildare have a high regard for the Army.  There is, admittedly, an odd black sheep, but, on the whole, the officers and men are very good.  They have taken their place in the life of the community and many of the cultural and social activities in the county are due in large measure to Army personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to compliment the Minister, his Department and the Army.  I was more than astonished at Deputy O.J. Flanagan taking advantage of this House to criticise soldiers for doing their duty.  I thought his conduct most ungentlemanly.  I am, of course, only too well aware that the Deputy can err in many respects, but I did not think he would ever stoop so low as to criticise soldiers for doing their duty.  It is a pity public men should descend to that sort of vilification.  I doubt if a trained soldier would suffer from nerves when instructed to go out and, in the course of his duty, stop a car on the public road.  I cannot conceive of any danger whatsoever in such a set of circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister, too, on introducing vocational education into the Army.  I am very interested in vocational education.  Our Army is small.  If possible, I should like to see it better paid.  I should like to see an improvement in Army conditions and barrack life generally.  I should like to see pensions increased. In fact, I should like to see an Army of which every soldier would be delighted to be a member.  I should like to see grievances eliminated. While there are a number of excellent officers in the Army, there are a few who lack the requisite gift of leadership. <Col N="104" /> An officer who can lead men and command their obedience by his leadership is an asset not only to the Army but to the country.</P>
    <P>Some soldiers living in my constituency have a few grievances.  They feel that barrack life has not been improved very much.  Provided he gets assistance from the Department of Finance, the Minister could over the years, try to improve the living quarters of the ordinary soldiers and the married soldiers.  An improvement in that line will lead to a contented Army and will encourage a better type of soldier to enlist.</P>
    <P>The importance of vocational education is something which cannot be over-stressed because when a soldier is trained and can carry out his ordinary duties, he should be encouraged to do a course in a vocational school in one subject or another. If he does so, he will be in a position to rehabilitate himself in civilian life when he leaves the Army.  We could raise the standards of the soldiers by giving them that encouragement. I again congratulate the Minister on the introduction of vocational classes.  I believe he will have the backing of all members of the House in developing that training more and more, because it will be to the advantage of the country, as well as to the advantage of the soldier.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I was asked to refer was the salaries of captains, and commandants who hold executive ranks.  A married commandant with five children gets approximately £1,068 while a married higher executive officer with five children in the Civil Service gets £1,421.  The Army feel, since they have to retire at 51, that it is time the scale of pay of the executive officer in the Army was brought nearer to the scale of pay of the executive officer in the Civil Service.  That is a matter, of course, for Government decision, and it would cost some money.  I have with me a long detailed document which I do not propose to go into now, but the whole matter should be examined with a view to arriving at a more equitable salary scale as between the two.  The Minister did not create these conditions. <Col N="105" /> They were already there when he took office.</P>
    <P>I have also been asked to refer to the pre-1938 medical officers.  They are: one colonel, seven lieutenant-colonels and six commandants.  I understand that medical officers can serve until they are 65 years of age but some of them feel they should have the option of retiring at 64 and that they should get two years' pay, as do some of the other officers.  I understand there is only a small number involved.  I ask the House to consider that matter since when one section of the Army gets a concession, other sections feel they are entitled to it also.</P>
    <P>Another question about which representations have been made to me concerns officers on the Reserve. Some of them have been on the Reserve for a long time.  I have discussed this with the Minister on previous occasions.  It is a big problem, but, nevertheless, it is worthy of consideration because a Reserve officer who gives loyal and faithful service for a number of years feels that he should be raised to the rank of captain.  I am sure the Minister is examining this problem, so I shall not deal with it any further.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear that money is being provided to buy better horses for the Army.  I believe our Army horses were the show-window of our country and I am sure everyone, no matter what his political views are, will agree that we should at least try to have the very best possible horses for international jumping.  They help to build up the esteem in which our country is held abroad and, of course, they help our export trade in horses. Money spent in that direction is money well spent.  If our jumping horses abroad are bad, they do more harm than good to the country and the industry, so I am very glad to hear from the Minister that steps have been taken to get better horses and to have them trained properly.  They and the personnel of the jumping teams will be worthy to bring home the honours. We very much appreciate the work they have done in the past, and we hope they will succeed in bringing <Col N="106" /> more honour to our country in the future.  Finally, I want to thank the Minister and his Department for the courtesy we have received at their hands during the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have many points listed here on which I proposed to speak, but which have already been dealt with by other speakers, so I shall content myself merely with dealing with one or two of what I regard as the principal items.  In doing so, my intention is to add to what has already been said by previous speakers.</P>
      <P>The recruiting drive for the Defence Forces, under the new arrangement, is something that was well received in the House.  The only appeal I make in the short time at my disposal is that the recruiting campaign should now be prosecuted in a more energetic and vigorous manner than in the past. There are many sources of recruitment which could very usefully be taken in hand.  I refer particularly to the vocational schools and the secondary schools were boys of military age are about to leave school and go out into the world to take up their positions in life.  At that age, it is very important that young boys should be approached and enticed to go into the Army.  It is a sort of transition period in their lives, and at that juncture they should be dealt with on the lines I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army Band was referred to by one or two Deputies and I had some notes made in that connection.  I had the experience of the Southern Army Command Band coming to my town some time ago, where they gave a number of recitals in the F.C.A. hall. I attended one of these recitals and was very impressed by the manner in which the band performed.  A large number of people in the town were also very impressed, but I feel that the Army Band and the School of Music in the Army are things the people know very little about, and the fact that the Band went through the country on what was known as a goodwill mission was a step in the right direction.  Quite a number of people came to me afterwards and said it was my duty as a Deputy to bring to the Minister's notice <Col N="107" /> that the goodwill mission which the band undertook on that occasion was long overdue.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, one party, who seemed to have some knowledge of music, suggested to me that the Department of Defence would be very well advised to consider sending the Band from time to time to seaside resorts and to certain social functions at which they could give public recitals.  I do not know whether any steps have been taken in that direction already, but I wish to avail of this opportunity to recommend the suggestion to the Minister for his earnest consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to civil defence, I must say I have to agree, to some extent, with Deputy O.J. Flanagan in the references he made in that connection. It is deplorable that the people as a whole do not seem to be taking this question seriously.  One would imagine that our people have no facilities for receiving news from abroad because at the moment we seem to be completely easy with regard to this problem.  I often find it is dealt with in local authorities as a sort of superfluous item, and very little provision seems to be made for it, on the ground that the rates of local authorities are already above the capacity of people to pay.  While we all agree that is so, at the same time, we must examine what civil defence means and, moreover, examine very particularly the apparent necessity for it at the present time.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech introducing the Estimate, the Minister dealt with the problem to some extent and, as far as his Department is concerned, it would appear they have taken the necessary initiative.  I am sorry to feel, however, from the results of the campaign that has been conducted by the Department that there is not the measure of public co-operation forthcoming which there should be.  I do think that local authorities could give considerable assistance in this connection and I suggest that the Minister, through the Director of Civil Defence, should follow up a campaign that has already been initiated, whereby films are shown.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> Public meetings should be held in the bigger centres of population, and people should be told how necessary it is that we should at least prepare on the lines of the civil defence programme which the Government have recommended to us.  I hope more effective steps will be taken in that connection during the coming year.  It is a vital necessity and we cannot deal with it soon enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire Cosanta (Caoimhghin Ó Beoláin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is féidir liom mo bhuíocas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí uile a labhair ar an Meastachán seo, ach duine amháin.  Thaispeáin siad uile, ach an duine seo, go raibh ard-mheas acu ar na Fórsaí Cosanta, ar an Slua Muirí, na Buan-Óglaigh, an cúltaca (céad líne), agus lucht an Fhórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.</P>
      <P>Sin mar is ceart agus is cúis áthais domsa gur mar sin a bhí sé le linn na díospóireachta sa Dáil, go raibh gach uile dhuine ag tabhairt moladh do fhorsaí na tíre, agus gur mar sin a bhí na hóráidí uile anseo.  Bhí anmheas fosta maidir le cúrsaí eile na Roinne.</P>
      <P>Bhí sé soiléir gur theastaigh ó na Teachtaí uile cabhair a thabhairt don Arm agus don Roinn Cosanta maidir leis na cúrsaí go léir atá ar láimh acu.</P>
      <P>Rinneadh cuid mhaith tagairtí don iarracht atá ar siúl faoi láthair chun úsáid na Gaeilge a leathnú i measc muintir an Airm agus, maidir leis an ní sin, bhi gach uile dhuine a labhair i bhfhábhar na gluaiseachta ach amháin an Teachta céanna, an Teachta Ó Flannagáin.  Mar is eol do chách, is mar sin a bhíos an scéal leis an Teachta sin i gcónaí, maidir le cúrsaí Gaeilge, agus cúrsaí náisiúnta.</P>
      <P>Is cúis áthais domsa go bhfuil dímheas ag teacht ar an Aire ag an Teachta Ó Flanagáin toisc na gluaiseachta sin mar, nuair a bhíonn sé im aghaidh, sílim go bhfuilim ar na líntí cearta.  Maidir leis an dímheas a chaitheann sé ar na saighdiúirí, is féidir linn a thuiscint go bhfuil gach rud ceart san Arm.  Sílim fein, mar dúirt mé, nuair a chaitheann sé dímheas ar mhuintir an Airm go bhfuil gach rud ina cheart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an iarracht atá ar lámha leis an teanga a chur chun chinn, sé <Col N="109" /> mo thuairim féin go bhfuil ag éirí go measartha maith leis, agus go dtiocfaidh leathnú mór ar úsáid na Gaeilge amach anseo.  Tá sé róluath a rá go bhfuil ag éirí go fíormhaith leis an ngluaiseacht ach tá súil láidir agam go n-éireoidh leis. Maidir leis sin, is mian liom a rá gur chabhraigh oifigigh an Airm, sean is óg, liom san obair thábhachtach sin, agus ba chúis áthais dom spiorad na saighdiúirí a fheiscint san obair sin.</P>
    <P>Ghlacadar leis an dúnghaois chun an teanga a leathnú go fonnmhar agus táim cinnte go bhfuil siad ag déanamh a ndícheall.  Tá an teanga á múineadh anois sna scoileanna le beagnach 40 bliain anuas agus ba chóir go bhféadfaí an teanga a leathnú i measc na bhFórsaí Cosanta.</P>
    <P>Táim buíoch de na Teachtaí a labhair ar an ábhar seo.  Bhí moltaí maithe ag cuid acu le tabhairt dom. Mhol cuid acu go ndéanfaí iarracht ar an leathnú seo a chur i measc comhaltaí an Fhórsa Chosanta Áitiúil, agus déanfar é sin chomh maith agus is féidir é.  Bhí tuairim shuimiúil ag an Teachta Mac Cárthaigh.  Mhol sé campaí samhraidh don F.C.A. a chur ar bun sna Gaeltachtaí, agus geallaim dó go ndéanfaidh mé iniúchadh ar an gceist sin agus, más féidir é, beidh mé toilteanach é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Bhí orm bheith amuigh ón díospoireacht ar feadh tamaill bhig agus níor chualas an méid a bhi le rá ag an Teachta Ó Domhnaill ach deirtear liom gur labhair sé go láidir i gcoinne na dunghaoise seo agus nár theastigh uaidh go mbeifí ag leanúint ar an úsáid i measc na bhfórsaí cosanta, agus go raibh sé ag clamhsán freisin i dtaobh na bhfocal ordaithe a bheith í nGaeilge.  Is mar sin a bhi na focail ordaithe i gcónaí.  Bhí baint agam féin leis an Arm roimh an gCogadh agus bhí mé san Arm i rith na hÉigeandála freisin agus bhí na focail ordaithe in úsáid as Gaeilge i gcónaí. Ni raibh aon deacracht ag baint leis sin agus níl aon athrú tagtha ar an scéal maidir leis sin.  Tá sé fíor a rá go bhfuil iarracht á dhéanamh ar úsáid níos mó ná san teanga a fháil san Arm, agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis.</P>
    <P>Rinne cuid mhaith de na Teachtaí <Col N="110" /> freisin trácht ar an gcosaint shibhialta agus tá áthas orm go raibh an méid sin suime ag na Teachtaí sa cheist thábhactoch seo.  Gabhaim buíochas leis an iar-Aire as ucht an chabhair a thug sé don ghluaiseacht seo chun córas cosanta sibhialta fiúntach a chur ar fáil sa tir.  Bhí an scéal céanna fiú amháin ag an Teachta Ó Flannagáin, agus d'aontaigh sé leis an méid atá deánta ar an gceist seo.  Ní féidir aon mhilleán chur air sa chás seo.  Bhí sé go láidir i bhfábhar na cosanta sibhialta.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Mac Cuinneagáin tagairt don cheist faoi chreidiúint a thabhairt do ath-shaighdiúirí a bhí ag iarraidh postanna sa Stát Sheirbhís. Níl sé ceart a rá ná tugtar creidiúint ar bith dóibh.  Tugtar, ach tá athrú déanta le cúpla bliain anuas.  Tugtaí creidiúint do ath-shaighdiúirí ina seirbhís leis na Fórsaí Cosanta agus rinneadh é sin ó am na hÉigeandála anuas go 1956.  Sa bhliain sin tháinig athrú ar an scéal agus d'ordaigh Rialtas na huaire sin go ndéanfaí an t-athrú seo agus as san amach ní raibh an chreidiúint sin le fáil ag athshaigdiúirí ach ar feadh dhá bhliain tar éis a seirbhís mhíleata a chríochnú agus aoinne a bhí i dteideal an chreidiúint sin a fháil níor bhfholáir dó 5 bliana ar a laghad a bheith caite aige insna Fórsaí Cosanta.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúras, nuair a tugadh an scéim seo isteach i dtosach go díreach i ndiaidh na hÉigeandála, b'fhuirist aontú an Rialtais agus aontú na ndaoine i gcoitinne d'fháil, ach níl an méid céanna buíochais i gcroíthe na ndaoine agus a bhí an t-am sin, agus níl sé chomh héasca dul ar ais go dtí an socrú a bhí ann roimhe seo.  Tá mé ag féachaint isteach sa chás, áfach, agus más féidir liom socrú níos fearr a dhéanamh do na hath-shaighdiúirí déanfaidh mé é.  Tugadh an tosaíocht chéanna a tugadh d'iarchomhaltai de na Buan-Óglaigh do na fir a thug seirbhís mhíleata sa tréimhse 1916-1923 agus ar deonadh boinn fhianais nó sheirbhíse ginearálta dóibh agus iad ag lorg na bpost seo.</P>
    <P>Bhí ceist eile ag an Teachta Mac Cuinneagáin faoin laghdú sa mhéid a íochadh i mbliana le Comhairle Chontae Thir Chonaill mar shíntiús <Col N="111" /> in ionad rátaí i leith Dún Líonáin. Níl an meíd céanna á íoc againn anois. Maidir leis na rátaí, is í an Oifig Luachála atá i mbun an ghnótha sin. Sé an rud a thárla ansin ná gur siar i 1956 deineadh athscrúdú ar an scéal seo go léir.  Dá bhárr sin iniúchadh an sceál ó thaobh na húsáide a bhi á baint as gach post míeata sa Stát agus cuireadh an toradh in iúl don Oifig Luachála. Is fíor go bhfuil gléasraí míleata sa Dún ach níl na háitribh uile ann in úsáid agus ní foláir nó go bhfuil an laghdú ar mhéid an tsíntiúis in ionad rátaí ar comhréir leis an méid áitreabh nach bhfuil in úsáid san áit. Mar a dúras, áfach, is é an Oifig Luachála atá i mbun an ghnótha sin agus níl aon dul as.</P>
    <P>Deirtear, maidir le Dún na nGall, nach bhfuil siad ag fáil an deontais chéanna.  Ní féidir linn áitribh a dhéanamh d'aon ghnó chun cabhair a thabhairt do chomhairlí contae.  Má tá aon ghearáin maidir le méid an tsíntiúis anois, ba cheart na gearáin sin a dhéanamh leis an Oifig Luachála.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil botún á dhéanamh acú ach ní dóigh liom féin go bhfuil.</P>
    <P>Ceist eile a chuir an Teachta Liam Mac Cuinneagáin ab ea ceist mar gheall ar árachas breac-dhíomhaointis nó &ldquo;ama fhluich,&rdquo; mar a thugtar air de ghnáth.  Is amhlaidh atá an scéal faoi sin mar a leanas.  Faoi alt a 5 den Acht féadfaidh an tAire Leasa Shóisialaigh, ach é a bheith sásta i dtaobh rudaí áirithe, deimhniú eisceachta a thabhairt amach i leith aicme ar bith lena mbaineann an tAcht.  Is iad na rudaí nach foláir don Aire bheith sásta ina dtaobh ná:</P>
    <P>(a) gur buan-fhostaíocht fostáiocht na haicme sin daoine, ag feachaint do ghnáth-chleachtadh an fhostóra, agus</P>
    <P>(b) ná baintear éinní as pá na haicme sin daoine mar gheall ar aimsir do chailliúint de dheasca doinninne, agus</P>
    <P>(c) go dtagann de thosca eile fostaíocht na haicme sin daoine nach gá daoine den aicme sin a árachú faoin Acht.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh an scéal seo maidir le <Col N="112" /> hoibritheoirí sa Roinn Cosanta faoi scrúdú.  Bé toradh an scrudú sin ná nach raibh siad i dteideal an eisceacht a fhail.  Níl aon rud is féidir liomsa a dhéanamh mar gheall air.</P>
    <P>Rinne roinnt Teachtaí eile, freisin, a labhair as Gaeilge, tagairt do cheist na hiascaireachta.  Labhair an Teachta Mac Cuinneagáin faoina thábhachtaí atá sé an chosaint is fearr is féidir linn, a thabhairt don tionscal iascaireachta sa tír seo.  Sin é mo thuairimse ar an scéal freisin.  Ba mhaith liom an chosaint is fearr is féidir linn a thabhairt dóibh agus táimid á dhéanamh sin chomin fada agus is féidir linn faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol do Theachtaí, níl ach trí báid againn agus ní féidir leo bheith i ngach áit san am céanna ach déanaimid ár ndícheall chun an chosaint cheart a thabhairt.  Sílim go n-éiríonn linn é sin a dheanamh sách maith.  Maidir le roinnt de na gearáin a gheibhimid mar gheall ar thráiléirí ó thíortha eile a bheith ag obair lastigh don teorann trí mhíle, ní bhíonn siad go léir ceart.  Uaireanta ní bhíonn eolas ceart ag na daoine a dhéanann na gearáin sin.  Nuair a fhéachann muinitir na Seirbhíse Cabhlaigh isteach sa scéal uaireanta gheibheann siad amach nach bhfuil an dií á briseadh ag na tráiléirí sin ar chor ar bith.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Mac Cuinneagáin freisin faoi cheist na teorann trí mhíle agus bhí in aigne aige gur cóir í a leathnú amach go sé mhíle slí.  Ní ceist í sin donn Roinn Cosanta.  Rud eile adúirt an Teachta go mba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh dó dúirt sé go mbeadh sé níos fusa an chosaint is fearr a thabhairt dá leathnófaí an teorainn go sé mhíle slí.  Níl sé sin fíor.  Ní mar sin atá sé ar chor ar bith.  Bheadh sé i bhfad nios deacra teorainn sé mhíle slí a chosaint ná an teorainn trí mhíle slí atá againn faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Is féidir liom aontú leis an moladh a tugadh don F.C.A.  Níl aon mholadh ró-ard dár féidir a thabhairt don Fhórsa sin.  Tá siad ag tabhairt seirbhís thábhactach don Stát agus gheibheann an Stát an tSeirbhís sin go han-saor.  Tá caighdeán an-árd ag an bhFórsa sin.  Bhí an caighdeán chomh <Col N="113" /> hárd sin go raibh ar ár gcumas i mbliana iad a chur ar an gcéim chéanna leis na buan-óglaigh agus tá an scéim chun iad a thabairt isteach ar an gcéim chéanna leis na buan-óglaigh ag dul ar aghaidh.  Tá muid buíoch freisin do na Teachtaí sin a labhair ar an F.C.A. agus as na moltaí a thug siad don Fhórsa sin.  Rinne cuid acu tagairt do na héadai a bhíos le caitheamh acu.  Ba mhaith liomsa, freisin, iad a dhéanamh níos fearr, ach ceist an-deachair í sin.  Rinne mé tagairt, freisin, do champaí samhraidh.</P>
    <P>Labhair roinnt Teachtaí mar gheall ar an scoil do phrintísigh I Nás na Ríogh agus i mBaile Uí Dhomhnaill agus ar an traenáil atá a thabairt don Chór Comharthaíochta sa Churrach. Aontaím leis an méid a dúirt na Teachtaí faoi na scéimeanna sin.  Tá traenáil an-thábhachtach agus anluachmar á thabhairt do na buachaillí sna háiteacha sin.  Molaim do Choistí Gairm-Oideachais suim do chur ins na scéimeanna sin.  Dhein Teachta éigin tagairt do chearcaláin a chur amach. B'fheidir go mba mhaith an rud é sin a dhéanamh ach tá fhios ag na Teachtaí go gcuirtear fógraí sna páipéirí gach bliain ag iarraidh iarrthóirí do na scéimeanna sin agus níl móran deachrachta ann chun an líon iarrthóirí is gá a fháil.  Tá mé cinnte go dtugann na múinteoirí sna scoileanna gairm-oideachais aire do na fógraí sin agus go gcoimeádann siad faoina mbráid iad agus go n-innsíonn siad do na scoláirí go bhfuil iarrthoirí á thabhairt isteach.  Is mór an trua nach féidir linn a thuilleadh a thabhairt isteach mar, faoi mar adúras cheana, tá traenáil an-thábhachtach á fháil ag na daoine sin.  Ní dóigh liom gur féidir liom aon athrú a dhéanamh ar an scéim sin faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Labhair roinnt mhaith Teachtaí mar gheall ar an mBuíon Ceoil san Arm.  Tugadh ard-mholadh dóibh.  Bí na Teachtaí go léir i bhfábhar an Bhuíon Cheoil a chuir amach ar cuairteanna ar fud na tire, níos mó ná mar a dhéanann siad, i dtreo go mbeadh caoi ag an bpobal i gcoitonne iad a fheiceáil agus go ndéanfaí bolscaireacht don Arm sa tslí sin.  Tógtar isteach daoine sa Bhuíon Ceoil sa talí chéanna ina dtógtar isteach printísigh i mBaile Uí <Col N="114" /> Dhomhnaill agus i Nás na Ríogh. Tógtar isteach iad mar bhuachaillí óga.  Dúirt mé nach bhfuil aon deacracht ann iarrthóirí phrintísigh a fháil ach ní mar sin atá an scéal ag an mBuíonn Ceoil.  Tá sé deachair go leór iarrthóirí a fail don Bhuíon Ceoil.  Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfadh Teachtaí aon rud is féidir leo chun níos mó iarrthóirí fháil don scoil cheoil, agus dá bhféadfaidís aon rud a dhéanamh chun eolas ar an scoil a leathnú i measc na mbuachaillí ina ndáilcheantair féin, bhéinn buíoch díobh ach é sin do dhéanamh.  Cuirfear fógraí sna páipéir, freisin, maidir leis sin.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Ó Dúbhlaoich tagairt do ghearáin atá ann maidir le hárdú céime san Airm ach ní raibh sé ró-chruinn maidir le céard a bhí i gceist agus nílim cinnte an raibh sé ag tagairt d'oifigigh nó d'oifigí neamhchoimhisiúnta. B'fhéidir go gcuirfeadh sé in iúl dom céard é go díreach a bhí i gceist aige, agus má tá aon rud bun ós cionn geallaim dó go ndéanfar iniúchadh air.  Má tá aon rud mí-cheart, féachfaid mé chuige ná leanfar den scéal.</P>
    <P>I can thank Deputies who spoke for the manner of their approach to the Estimate.  It was apparent that they desired to be helpful with regard to the important matters that come within the ambit of the Department of Defence.  I can be thankful for helpful suggestions and for the attitude of Deputies in general.  It would be too much to expect that there would not be some exception in that respect. While Deputies paid tribute to the members of the permanent Defence Forces, the First Line Reserve and An Fórsa Cosanta Aitiúil, there was, of course, the notable exception of Deputy O.J. Flanagan who chose, instead, to heap abuse on the members of the permanent Defence Force in regard to the manner in which they perform their duty.  That was a notable exception and possibly the best thing to do would be to ignore it because Deputy O.J. Flanagan's disapproval and scorn is hardly likely to have any great effect.</P>
    <P>Many people would prefer to have Deputy O.J. Flanagan's disapproval than his approval and certainly I do not feel that the members of the Army <Col N="115" /> will suffer in any way in the estimation of the public because Deputy O.J. Flanagan thinks so very little of them. While I intend largely to ignore his contribution in that respect, I should be failing in my duty if did not refute his imputation of cowardice to the members of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the phrase used.  His other allegations of discourtesy were equally unfounded.  I investigated the conduct of the Defence Forces on the particular occasion and can only repeat what I said when the matter was previously raised in the House, that is, that I am proud of the manner in which every individual member of the Defence Forces conducted himself.  The fact that Deputy O.J. Flanagan thinks otherwise will serve only to confirm that opinion.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, and, indeed, apart from that particular part of Deputy O. J. Flanagan's speech, all the contributions to the debate were of a helpful and constructive nature.  There was, of course, the other aspect of Deputy O. J. Flanagan's contribution, the attack on the language position, but that is nothing new either and, as the general trend of the debate showed support for the policy in that regard, as Deputy O.J. Flanagan rightly remarked, his views on that matter are not likely to affect me in any way.</P>
      <P>I can be very thankful to all the other Deputies.  I should like to thank my predecessor, in the first place, for his contribution, for his tributes to the Defence Forces and for his support for the civil defence campaign.  There is one point of Deputy MacEoin's contribution, with regard to the question of policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked was there any change in the policy&mdash;what was the view.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy actually said was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the first Inter-Party Government was formed in 1948, the then Minister for Defence and the Government <Col N="116" /> took the view that the proper line to take was to plan for a period of peace of at least 10 years.  I should like to remind the Minister that when we took that decision there was a very violent attack made upon that policy.  It will be agreed by all and sundry now that our approach to the problem was the correct one and I should like to know from the Minister what his view is today and whether he is continuing that policy.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is no doubt, we have had 10 years of peace.  If Deputy MacEoin thinks that the fact that there have been 10 years of peace justifies the decision to act on the assumption that there would be 10 years of peace, there may be people who will agree with him, but I am afraid I shall not. If that decision were come to&mdash;and I cannot find any trace of it&mdash;that there would be peace for 10 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessor announced that in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;even though there have been 10 years of peace, I still think it was not a very wise decision. However, I cannot find any trace of a definite decision in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be any kind of general agreement, either, with regard to Deputy Booth's contentions as to the strategic importance of the country in the event of a future world conflict.  As far as I am concerned, our policy must still be to be ready to the full extent of our resources to defend our country in the event of attack and to do everything possible for the preservation of our freedom.  That is in fact the policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, there were tributes to the Defence Forces from all sides and I should like to add my voice to them. They were very well earned.  The standard among the different components of the Defence Forces is very high indeed.  The F.C.A.  I was glad to see, got the support of every Deputy who spoke.  The question of uniforms was raised and in that respect there has, in fact, been some improvements <Col N="117" /> in the uniforms, in the type of cloth that has been used during the past two years, and there have been certain changes in the design of the tunic.  Just as my predecessor would have liked to have made more far-reaching improvements so would I, but I have just the same difficulties as he had.  However, the matter is being kept under review. It must be realised by Deputies that there are existing stocks and that issues that have been made must be used before there can be any change in design.  It is not a very simple question and personaly I do not think that the strictures about the design of the uniform are entirely deserved.  I think it is quite a presentable uniform and that the members of the force look quite well in it.</P>
    <P>One Deputy suggested that there should be some form of recognition for long service in the F.C.A., as there is in the permanent Defence Force.  I shall undertake to look into that suggestion which I think is a very good one.  I think it was Deputy Brennan who raised the question of the co-operation of the employers with members of the F.C.A., and of the civil defence service, going on annual training.  There is no great evidence of lack of co-operation in that regard.  There may be isolated instances, but generally speaking the co-operation is reasonable.  In some cases, when complaints are investigated, it is found that employers are not given proper consideration in the matter of getting due notice.  However, I shall be only too pleased to have any specific complaints investigated.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin raised the question of the ranks that officers will be able to attain in the F.C.A.  The position at present is that the battalion commander can go to the rank of captain and under the new integrating proposal there are early prospects for some officers obtaining the rank of commandant. The question of further promotion of officers will be a matter for consideration as the F.C.A. advances in training and efficiency, as we hope it will under the new scheme.  I can assure Deputy MacEoin that I shall be very anxious to do what I can.  I hope it will be possible to have promotion even to a higher rank than that of commandant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> A number of Deputies referred to the question of helicopters.  It is not the intention to purchase helicopters for military purposes at the moment. They have some uses, of course, but their usefulness for military purposes is very limited and our current policy does not envisage their purchase.  With regard to their use for fishery protection work, their usefulness would be very small.  Money would be a lot better spent on an extension of the naval service, rather than on the provision of helicopters.  It is hard to see what useful function a helicopter could, in fact, perform.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with regard to fishery offences is to apprehend the offending vessel and a helicopter cannot operate effectively in that respect.  One requires a surface vessel for that work.  Certainly the expense of providing helicopters, and providing for their maintenance and their servicing, would be out of all proportion to the value that they would give.  The question of helicopters for rescue or relief work is not a matter for my Department.  Deputy Blowick asked for even one helipcopter for that purpose.  I can only say, from my own knowledge of the matter, that one helicopter would be absolutely useless.  A detailed investigation into the matter has revealed that one would be no use at all and that there would have to be at least six helicopters.  They would have to be serviced, bases would have to be set up for them and personnel employed to operate them. There again, the usefulness of helicopters in that respect is very greatly exaggerated. There are tragedies, unfortunately, but they usually occur during very inclement weather and helicopters are not very effective under those conditions either.  However, as I say, their use for that purpose is not a matter for my Department.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of fishery protection generally, which was referred to by a number of Deputies, the Naval Service is doing its job very well, having regard to its limitations both as to men and equipment.  It may be, as Deputy Corish says, that there are not enough boats.  In fact, without doubt that is true but that was not the factor in the particular case to which he was <Col N="119" /> referring, during the concentration of foreign trawlers off Dunmore East last year.  At that time there were two corvettes there and fishing was going on in rather a limited area.  It was possible to patrol the area effectively and I am satisfied that it was patrolled effectively.</P>
    <P>It is very understandable that people who earn their livelihood from that industry are perturbed about the destruction of their fishing grounds, and about the large quantities of fish caught by foreign trawlers within a short distance of our coast.  The fact is, however, we have no legal right to prevent them taking these fish outside the present limit.  My information is that while unfortunately those huge quantities of fish were taken by trawlers of other countries, nothing could be done about it under the law as it stands at present.  The Naval Service is doing all it can in that regard. Many of the complaints made about trawlers fishing within the limits are found on investigation not to be correct.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth again referred to the cost of the soldiers' pay section.  Last year, I explained the matter to him. He seems to be under a misapprehension in regard to that section.  In fact, it does a great deal more than he appears to think.  I think I can do no better than refer him to my reply on the last occasion.  I know that on this occasion he said he was not interested in any explanations.  I cannot give him any further explanation than that which I gave on the last occasion.  In fact, there has been some reduction in the provision for that section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera referred to the fact that it had not been possible to maintain an adequate First Line Reserve.  That is regrettable, but it is due purely and simply to the fact that the turn-over of men from the Army has not been sufficient.  The estimates made as to the strength of the First Line Reserve was likely to reach have not been realised.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the desirability of promoting certain officers of the First Line Reserve who <Col N="120" /> are still at the rank of lieutenant.  I do not think it helps their case to exaggerate their claims in any way.  I am quite sympathetic to it.  I realise that as an officer advances in years, he would like to have the third bar, but there are other considerations.  It does not help their claim to try to put it forward that there is an entitlement to it, when in fact there is not.  Comparing them, for instance, with officers of the same age in the permanent Defence Force, does not make sense.  However, I agree that these officers gave very good service, both while in the permanent Defence Force and on the Reserve.  I am quite favourably disposed towards giving them some recognition for that service.  I also see the advantage of retaining their services in the First Line Reserve for a longer period.  There are a number of difficulties to be overcome, but, if it is possible, some scheme may be formulated to give promotion to some of them, at any rate.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the desirability of publicising the army in every way possible, particularly in towns in which there is no Army garrison. During the recent recruiting campaign, that was done as far as possible. A number of areas were visited and, generally speaking, those methods were successful.  The last recruiting campaign was the most successful for a number of years.  I agree with Deputies that it is a good idea to let the people see more of the Army, through the Army Bands, parades and so on.</P>
    <P>A number of different aspects were referred to in regard to the School of Equitation.  I described the state of affairs there in my opening remarks. There is an increased provision this year for the purchase of horses.  A large part of the disimprovement in the performance of the school was due to the fact that over a number of years sufficient attention was not paid to providing the team with suitable horses. Now an effort will be made to correct that, and I hope it will be successful.</P>
    <P>The debate generally in regard to civil defence was very helpful.  Every Deputy who spoke on the subject approached it in the proper manner. I was delighted to see that there was <Col N="121" /> among Deputies such a keen appreciation of the importance of civil defence. It is true that the recent recruiting campaign for the civil defence service was not as successful as we would have wished.  That was in spite of the best efforts of the Director and my Department to convince the public of the vital necessity of having an adequate civil defence organisation available within the shortest possible time.  We find it particularly difficult to drive the importance of that home to the local public representatives.  Recently, as Deputy O.J. Flanagan mentioned, a tour was made of the different localities with a view to enlisting their support in securing an influx of volunteers into this organisation.  That is one of the best ways of getting in touch with the people it is desired to recruit. Members of local bodies have contact with the people in their areas and should be able to influence them, if, first of all, we can convince them of the importance of this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> The debate generally on civil defence should be very helpful to us.  My Department will continue to make every possible endeavour to get the required volunteers and give them the best possible training.  It is a very necessary and urgent thing.  As a number of Deputies pointed out, it is something we cannot wait to do until the danger is actually here.  Preparations must be made in advance and the Government are determined to try to provide the country with an adequate civil defence organisation within the shortest possible time.</P>
