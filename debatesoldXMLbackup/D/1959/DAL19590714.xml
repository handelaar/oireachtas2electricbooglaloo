      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the tonnage of oats, including seeds for sowing, imported from each country in the period 1st September, 1958, to 31st May, 1959, the latest date for which these figures are available, and the average c.i.f. price per ton in each case.  Particulars of imports are brought to account only by reference to the commodity descriptions specified in the Official Import List and, as this list does not distinguish between white oats and black oats, separate figures for white oats are not available. It is not possible to give particulars of the ports of delivery of imports of oats for the period in question.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he has received any proposals from Kildare County Council for a reorganisation of the dispensary districts in County Kildare; when the proposals were received; and when it is likely that a decision on the proposals will be conveyed to the Kildare County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for the reorganisation of nine dispensary districts in County Kildare were submitted to my Department on the 7th October, 1957.  The proposals are very complex, involving the abolition of an existing dispensary district, the creation of a new district and considerable alterations in the other districts concerned.  The matter has been closely examined in <Col N="1009" /> my Department, in consultation with the local authority.</P>
      <P>I have referred the proposals to the local authority for further examination by the county manager and when I receive his observations, I hope to arrive at a decision.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether local authorities are obliged to give consideration to the circumstances of each individual applicant for a medical card; or whether any general scale is laid down by county managers within which medical cards are issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Health Authorities are bound to take into consideration all the circumstances of each applicant for a medical card.  In a circular issued by my Department in February, 1955, health authorities were urged strongly to arrange that, before each application for a service is determined, the health authority should have a full report on the circumstances of the applicant and that the decision on the application should be taken in the light of all the circumstances.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any general scale adopted by County Managers, setting out income limits for eligibility for medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here a letter from the Kildare County Council in which the county manager said that the application was refused on the grounds that the income was found by the council to be in excess of the general scale.  May I ask if any such statement by the county manager that a scale of means is in operation is contrary to the Minister's intentions in the implementation of the Health Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I can answer that question.  The manager is bound to consider the circumstances of each applicant, one of the circumstances being the applicant's income.  If, <i>prima facie</i> the applicant appears to have a greater income than would entitle him to these services, I take it that the onus of <Col N="1010" /> proof is put back on him and that, I think, is the purport of the manager's letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question I asked the Minister.  I asked whether what the county manager said, that the person's income&mdash;this is a man with less than £7 per week&mdash;is in excess of the general scale, is contrary to the method by which the circumstances of the applicant should be investigated; in other words, a scale. If you are under it you get the card and if you are over it, you do not.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I reply to the Deputy's supplementary in these terms?  The county manager is not responsible to me for the administration of the Health Act.  He is responsible to the health authority for which he is manager.  That question by Deputy Norton should be addressed to the Kildare County Council.</P>

    <P>The Imposition of Duties (No. 60) (Special Import Levies and Miscellaneous Customs Duties) Order, 1959, effective from 16th April, 1959, altered the scope of certain of the Special Import Levy headings.  The receipts shown above for the year ended 31st March, 1959, represent the receipts from the headings as they were prior to 16th April, 1959.</P>
    <P>Some of the above headings were also amended by the Imposition of Duties (No. 28) (Special Import Levies and Miscellaneous Customs Duties) Order, 1958, with effect from 10th April, 1958.  In these cases the amounts shown include receipts from such headings as they were in the period 1st-9th April, 1958.</P>
    <P>Receipts under the heading Parcel Post include an amount of £38,305 in respect of wearing apparel; it is not possible to allocate the balance of these receipts to the appropriate headings without undue expenditure of time.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STATEMENT (<i>b</i>).</P>
    <P>NET RECEIPTS from Special Import Levies in 1958-59 from each Reference Number in force in that year but now abolished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will remove the import levy on rowing boats and equipment used by rowing clubs for racing in view of the facts that such boats and equipment are not manufactured in this country, that the amount accruing from such levy is negligible, and that it imposes grave hardships on the rowing clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Special Import Levy on rowing boats designed for racing and equipment therefor was considered on the occasion of the last review of the Special Import Levies and those items enjoyed the benefit, as from 16th April, 1959, of a reduction of 25 per cent. in the rates of levy applicable to appliances and requisites for sports and outdoor games, under which head they are liable to Special Import Levy.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my Budget speech, I can promise no further review of the Special Import Levies until I come to frame next year's Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the Minister's statement that there was a reduction of 25 per cent. refers to the reduction of the import levies from 40 per cent. to 30 per cent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the import duty was removed completely off golf caddy cars, would the Minister not consider that a very manly sport such as rowing should get equal facilities since these boats are not made in the country at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is included in the question.  I stated &ldquo;such boats and equipment are not manufactured in this country&rdquo;.  In view of the fact that they are not manufactured in the country, would the Minister not consider giving them the same facilities as those people who use these golf caddy cars?  May I suggest to the Minister that if he is going to have an import levy he should have it on all? No exception should be made.</P>

      <P>I am unable to give the information asked for in the first part of the Deputy's question as the Valuers' reports do not necessarily indicate whether the occupiers of the properties are farmers or not.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, I am informed that during the five years ended 5 April, 1959, the Valuation Office dealt with 3,470 requests for revision of valuation in Cork City and the nine Urban Districts in Co. Cork and with 17,903 for the rest of the county.  Some of the requests resulted in increases, some in decreases and others in no change in valuation.  Overall there was a net increase amounting to £89,298 on a total valuation of £1,525,959 as at 1 March, 1954.</P>

These figures, for each year from 1951 to 1958 inclusive, are, respectively: 2,647, 2,727, 2,744, 2,682, 2,665, 2,926, 2,824, 3,028.</P>
      <P>I have included the years 1957 and 1958 because the Deputy asked a question about these years last week.  In my reply to that question, I gave, as the most informative of the available figures, the number of aliens who registered in each of these years and who are still on the register.  Corresponding figures for earlier years would, however, be very misleading in the context of the question asked, since many aliens who registered in these earlier years have left the country or become naturalized.</P>

      <P>The following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)  The latest accounting date for which figures are available is the 31st March, 1959.  Up to that date the total cost of the Scheme, excluding salaries and staff expenses, was £4,183,040.  As an allocation of £700,000 was received from the Grant Counterpart Fund and a sum of £1,653,669 from the sale of reactors the net cost to the Exchequer was £1,829,371.</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)  The estimated expenditure for the current financial year is £3,500,000.  As £1,680,000 is expected from the sale of reactors the net estimated cost for the year is £1,820,000.</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>)  It is not possible at this stage to estimate the total ultimate cost of the Scheme.</P>

    <P>The decline in direct employment in 1957 and 1958 arose from the development of the policy of selling timber standing and of purchasing stone for roadmaking from contractors instead of raising and carting stone by direct labour.  Accurate figures for the number of men employed under these two heads are impossible to ascertain and for this reason total employment on forestry cannot be determined, but there is no doubt that present total forestry employment, direct and indirect, shows an increase on the employment levels of previous years.</P>
    <P>In 1958 the road programme was drastically reduced by bad weather. If conditions continue favourable this year it is expected that at least 150 additional workers will be employed on carrying out arrears of work under this head.</P>

At this stage I cannot do more than refer the Deputy to the terms of the official communiqué, which stressed the desire of both Governments to maintain and strengthen the special trade relationship between the two countries, referred to possibilities of improving trade suggested by us, and recorded agreement to put in hand a study of these suggestions.</P>
      <P>We have undertaken to develop our suggestions in greater detail, and we contemplate that this will be done during the next couple of weeks.  In accordance with the normal procedure, officials of both Governments will meet to study them, and it is intended that they will then be discussed further by Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to share with some of the Deputies who spoke the high appraisal of the work of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta since it was founded.  I have not had as much experience of its workings as Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Norton, both of whom paid tribute to Córas Tráchtála, but in my short experience of the Department of Industry and Commerce, I have seen tribute paid to it on a surprisingly large number of occasions, in the course of memoranda that have been coming before me, on interviews of officials of the Department with people who are engaged, or who hope to be engaged, in export business.  Deputy Norton is, no doubt, familiar with these memoranda.  The tributes that have been paid are very high and, certainly, from the point of view of Córas Tráchtála, are very satisfactory in general.  Deputy Cosgrave who spoke first from the other side, asked how the new Company was to be financed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The new Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry&mdash;the new Board.  The position is that £1,000,000 will be provided by the Exchequer. The sum is, in fact, limited to £1,000,000.  Hitherto, the Company was given funds yearly out of voted money.  The current provision is for £255,000 and so it is anticipated that the £1,000,000 provided should last roughly for a period of four years. If, at the end of that period, the necessity for the continuance of the Board's activities will have been proved&mdash;and I am sure it will have been&mdash;I, or somebody else, will have to come back to this House to secure further financial provision for it.  As far as the sum of £255,000 in the Estimates is concerned, the amount of <Col N="1035" /> the unexpended Vote will be surrendered to the Exchequer and will form part of the £1,000,000 provided under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave also suggested, though I could not really understand the import of his remarks, that the activities of the Government in certain respects retarded the work of Córas Tráchtála, and he referred in particular to whiskey exports.  It is very difficult to understand how the level of taxation on whiskey for sale in this country would retard the export of whiskey to other countries and, in particular, to the dollar countries.  I think it is a well-established principle that in order to achieve export capacity, an exporting company would require to have a well-established market in the home country, that is, here in Ireland.  Nobody can doubt that the whiskey distillers have such a market.  It may be that the consumption of whiskey has fallen off to some extent in recent years.  I have not got the figures to show that, but, nevertheless, I believe the distillers have a market in Ireland to such an extent as will not hinder their capacity to export.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, there was provision in the 1958 Budget for assistance to Córas Tráchtála through the distillers themselves to enable a campaign of publicity to be undertaken to promote an increase in the sale of Irish whiskey in the United States.  In the original Estimate for 1958-59, the sum provided was about £30,000 and to that was added £25,000 provided by way of rebate of duty on whiskey, making in all, a provision of £55,000 in that year.  In the current year, the sum provided for the boosting of sales of whiskey in the United States is £80,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton rightly commented that no organisation had, to any appreciable extent, undertaken market research of their own volition and said for that reason it was very important that the services of Córas Tráchtála should be available.  I agree with him there but I would also urge on individual companies that, in so far as they can afford it themselves, they should engage in that market research.  They <Col N="1036" /> should equip some of their executives with technical knowledge, and it is well known that there are many techniques in selling goods abroad.  I believe that they should do that in order to expand their own exporting capacity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also said that companies should rely on their own resources and should send members of their executives abroad in order to make personal contacts.  In passing, I should like to say that some years ago as a result of an approach by the Federation of Irish Industries and the Exporters' Federation to the High School of Commerce, as it was then, in Rathmines, and which is now the College of Commerce, a course in foreign trade was established.  I myself had the pleasure of presenting the first certificate to a person who had concluded that course.  Before that, I saw the syllabus of the course, and I must say I was very struck by the extent of the studies a person following that course would be required to undertake. It was most extensive and anybody who succeeded in qualifying for the certificate would certainly have had a very wide knowledge of the intricacies of foreign trade.  Apart altogether from the activities of Córas Tráchtála, I would urge companies able to do so to provide themselves with such knowledge and such techniques.</P>

      <P>Deputy Russell asked what was the necessity for the change. First of all, Córas Tráchtála had certain difficulties in so far as their services depended on voted moneys from year to year.  The establishing of them into a semi-State Board will give <Col N="1037" /> them that security of tenure, so to speak, to enable them to plan activities over a long term.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>A State Board&mdash;yes. It was discovered that Córas Tráchtála, having recruited young men of the required ability, found they were losing them to different organisations because of a certain lack of security in employment.  The establishment of this Board will enable these young men to look forward to that security which they require, and it will assist Córas Tráchtála in recruiting possibly better men for the job.  In addition, it certainly will assist them in retaining them in employment.  I think that is one of the important things which the establishment of the Board will achieve.</P>
      <P>I do not think that any other points were raised in the course of the debate, and again I should thank the House for the welcome that it has given to this Bill.  I am sure that, encouraged by the remarks of Deputies and encouraged by the strengthening of the organisation this Bill will give, the activities of Córas Tráchtála will increase and will give a very good return to the country in general in an expansion of export trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before the Minister concludes, I should like to ask him this question: will he consider directing the attention of this, or any other Board, to the fact that sales persons representing Dutch firms, Danish firms or Italian firms, ordinarily speak the vernacular of the country where they are sent to promote sales?  Would the Minister direct the attention of each Department to the fact that, desirable as it is to acquire a diploma in foreign marketing, it is infinitely more desirable to ensure that representatives of this country visiting foreign markets are equipped sufficiently to speak the vernacular of the markets to which they are sent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree with the Deputy more and, as Minister for Education, on all appropriate occasions, I urged it on companies to ensure they had on their staffs people qualified to speak the vernacular of the countries to which they sent trade representatives, and I urged on these companies the desirability of availing of the facilities for education in foreign languages in vocational schools. That education is available very freely and certainly very cheaply and very widely.  I would urge them to avail of it.  I thank Deputy Dillon for directing my attention to this point which I had intended to mention in the course of my reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask is a new principle being imported in Section 14.  There is a well-established principle that members of these boards shall not be members of the Oireachtas but we appear to be carrying that a step further when we say: &ldquo;Where a member of the Board is nominated either as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas or as a member of the Seanad Eireann&rdquo;&mdash; I do not know what the meaning of that is; it seems to be tautology&mdash;&ldquo;he shall thereupon cease to be a member of the Board.&rdquo;  Is that not a new principle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a comparatively new principle.  First of all, to answer the suggestion of tautology in the wording, as the Deputy knows, a person may be nominated a member of Seanad Éireann by the Taoiseach.  I think that is the distinction there.  With regard to the provision which Deputy Dillon has referred to as a new principle I think it arose first in connection with the E.S.B. Bill.  We had a case in point in the House and it was decided then to follow the principle adumbrated in the E.S.B. Bill in new legislation setting up companies of this kind.  This provision is consistent with that principle.  That is all I have to say on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little bit puzzled about this.  I remember that before Deputy Maher got elected here, it seems that he inadvertently disqualified himself and ought not to have stood for election but the general impression I got was that we all determined to put the telescope to the blind eye.  I believe he incurred appalling penalties and that everybody agreed that this was fantastic.  Far from deciding to follow that I thought we decided, by our inaction in that case, that we thought that was an unreasonable provision and that a man ought to <Col N="1040" /> be allowed to try his hand and, if he failed to get elected, he could resume the even tenor of his way but that if he got elected he would have to resign. Is there any other Act of the Oireachtas in which this provision appears?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot say if there is any other Act but there is a distinction here between the members of the Board and staff.  The same principle does not apply to the members of the Board as to members of the staff under Section 14 subsection (1), but it is felt that, by and large, it is better to keep active politicians, so to speak, off these public Boards. If a member of the Board feels he ought to enter politics, I think at that stage he is committed in politics as much as if he is, in fact, a member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from the Government benches this is indeed a new principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is a very dangerous principle.  There is a good deal of ignorant tripe talked in this country and in certain other countries by people who really do not understand, or perhaps do not like, the functioning of Parliamentary democratic Government.  In this type of tripe it is sought to attach to the name of politician a derogative sense.  I am utterly refusing to subscribe to the supposition that because a man is prepared to spend his life in public service as a politician&mdash;which next to the priesthood I consider to be the highest vocation a free citizen can have&mdash;he has thereby disqualified himself from functioning on a public board.  Infinitely, I prefer, and I trust much more readily, a man who has the moral courage to come out in public and declare himself to me as an honest supporter of Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party or Fine Gael than I am inclined to trust that modern pest, the hurler on the ditch who is prepared to spend his life telling everybody who is in the dust of the arena how things ought to be done but grows old in apprehension of soiling his own lily- white hands by undertaking the <Col N="1041" /> ardours of public service without reward.</P>
      <P>I deprecate the suggestion that because a man offers himself as a candidate at an election he thereby disqualifies himself from functioning on a board of this kind.  I do not think it is practicable for a man to serve on a board of this kind and serve in the Oireachtas at the same time but I do not think that we in this House should be made parties to the proposition that if people differ profoundly in politics it is impossible for them intelligently to collaborate in any sphere.  I think that is all cod and those of us who have experience of politics know that it is not true.  We know by our own experience that there are committees of which the public hear nothing sitting continually in this House doing public work on which all Parties in the Oireachtas are represented and they are collaborating quietly to get public business discharged.</P>
      <P>I could sit on a Board of this kind with a member of the Fianna Fáil Party or the Labour Party and transact the business of this Board without eschewing my political convictions or expecting them to do the same.  In practice it is unlikely that a member of one of these Boards would feel constrained to offer himself as a candidate at an election but I think it is wrong in principle that this House should say that to do so automatically disqualifies him from continuing to be a member of the board.  I would ask the Minister to consider that question.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that after the incident associated with the election of Deputy Maher to this House when it was suggested his association with the E.S.B. disqualified him from being a candidate, the view taken was that all subsequent legislation should follow legislation enshrined in the E.S.B. Act. I was a member of the Government for a considerable period after that incident transpired and I do not know of any case where we adopted that principle.  Deputy Norton and Deputy Mulcahy were associated with me in the Government and I do not think there is fresh in their memory any decision in which we adopted that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> I am pretty certain I am right, because I am virtually certain I would have opposed the decision with all the vigour at my disposal, as I think it is bad in principle.  I do not honestly think it will make very much practical difference, but I refuse to subscribe to this detestable doctrine that those who bear the heat and burden of the day in public life are in some way inferior to the contemptible minority of our community who are always ready to tell everybody else what they ought to do but who are never prepared to come down into the arena and undertake the work themselves.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the provision in the 1927 Act, which caught Deputy Maher offside so far as membership of this House is concerned, was an archaic provision and ought to have no place in legislation in the 20th century.</P>

As a matter of fact, trying to remember what I can now of 1927, I think I opposed that at the time it was going through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new provision contained in the last E.S.B. Bill is a very substantial improvement in the situation which existed up to then.  It is possible now for persons who are officers or servants of the Board to stand for election to either House of the Oireachtas and, if elected, then they are seconded to their public service in either House of the Oireachtas, but they are not required to lose their jobs in the body which employed them prior to their standing for election.  They are seconded to the public service by reason of their membership of either House of the Oireachtas.  If at a subsequent date they desire to go back to their employment with the authority concerned, they are free to do so, without being obliged to relinquish that employment, <Col N="1043" /> as they were prior to the last E.S.B. amending Bill.  I think it is a good provision. It is not desirable, in a small State like this, especially, that we should automatically debar from either House of the Oireachtas those who are employed in State and semi-State organisations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to urge upon his colleagues that, where this situation is not taken care of in respect of other State bodies, a general and omnibus Bill should be introduced to extend to the employees of all State and semi-State undertakings the liberties which have been given in the recent E.S.B. Act and which are being given now to officers and servants of the Export Board.  It is a reasonable provision.  In fact, I see no reason why the same provision should not be extended to employees of the public service.</P>
    <P>There may be need for putting some control over certain high ranks in the service, who are engaged in particular jobs, but I see no reason, as a general principle, why a person employed in the public service should not be allowed to stand for election to the Oireachtas and, if he is elected, to regard himself as seconded to another branch of the public service, namely, the Oireachtas.  In that way, he could serve there as long as he enjoys the confidence of the electorate, with the right to go back to his former employer if ever his title deeds to sit as a member of either House are withdrawn by the electorate concerned.  That is a good principle and a democratic principle. All the necessary safeguards and checks could be taken to require the person to leave the employment for the time being whilst he is serving in the Oireachtas.  Generally speaking, it is a democratic development which has much to encourage it.</P>
    <P>I travel as far as Deputy Dillon does, too, in the matter of members of the Board.  Under this Bill, if a member of the Board is nominated for election, he is obliged to retire from membership of the Board before he knows whether or not he has been elected to the Oireachtas.  Of course, if he is nominated by the Taoiseach he is a certainty and he will not have to <Col N="1044" /> worry about the election, as he can be taken as having passed the post. However, in the case of a person who allows himself to be nominated for election to the Dáil or Seanad, under this Bill he is required to retire before he knows the result of the election.  I think we are excessively cautious.  It would not be unreasonable to say to these people: &ldquo;Well and good, you can stand for election to the Seanad or Dáil, but you must understand that you will have to relinquish your position as a member of the Board if you are elected.&rdquo;  Until the person is elected, I certainly would give him a right to remain a member of the Board&mdash;on the understanding, of course, that the legislation is drawn in such a way that if elected he would be obliged, at least during his membership of either House, to stand down from the Board.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not see why many prominent, capable, trustworthy and in some respects brilliant, people who serve the State on these boards are deprived, so long as they are giving that service, from ever entering the Oireachtas unless they resign from the Board.  I do not think it is incompatible with membership of the Board that they should aspire to membership of the Oireachtas.  Many of them may say: &ldquo;I do not want to carry my enthusiasm for public life so far that I must resign from a State body until I know whether or not I am elected.&rdquo; We can easily have safeguards and checks to cover that point.  If one allows a person to stand for election whilst retaining membership of the Board, one would expect him to be fairly prudent and circumspect as to the language which he would use and the kind of matters on which he would talk in the course of the election.  There again, I see no difficulty in a prudent person standing for election for any Party he likes, so long as it is made clear to him that if elected he must resign from the Board during the currency of his membership of either House.</P>
    <P>In any case, I want to say that this section is a decided advance on the previous position, that is, the position prior to the recent amendment of the <Col N="1045" /> E.S.B. Acts.  This is a provision which should be extended.  It certainly should be extended by the Minister to all the other boards under his control or for which he is responsible.  The better method of dealing with the whole problem would be to introduce a blanket Bill which would cover all State and semi-State bodies, which would give employees of those bodies the facilities given now to E.S.B. employees and which, under this Bill, will be given to employees of the Export Board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether this Board has within its scope of responsibility the possibility of any sort of trading transaction, but I want to direct the attention of the Minister to a practice growing up of casually appointing the Comptroller and Auditor General as the appropriate auditing authority for State and semi-State undertakings, some of which have trading functions.  I want to suggest to the Minister he should look into this matter because I yield to no one in my admiration of the Department of the Comptroller and Auditor General, with which I worked closely as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I recently retired from that position on conclusion of our labours of last year.  However, I may resume at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that I regard the Department of the Comptroller and Auditor General in every respect admirable for the purpose for which it was set up, but it is wholly unequipped to deal with commercial audits.  I think there is a complete misapprehension growing up in this House through the archaic use of the word &ldquo;auditor&rdquo; in the title of the Comptroller and Auditor General. &ldquo;Auditor&rdquo; in the context of his title <Col N="1047" /> is quite a different thing from what is publicly understood to be an auditor, and the personnel of the Department of the Comptroller and Auditor General have no training in commercial accounts and no means of preparing them in a form to make them comprehensible to anybody who expects to find the ordinary kind of information normally to be found in commercial accounts certified by commercial auditors.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Department of the Comptroller and Auditor General is the appropriate authority to deal with the accounts of a Board of this character if this Board is to have purely civil service functions to discharge. I invite the Minister to examine that question in respect of Section 18 and also to bear this in mind.  Hereafter, if by Statute we propose to set up bodies which have trading functions, or if in any other circumstances we desire to avail of the services of an auditor to provide the Oireachtas with mercantile information in regard to accounts, would the Minister encourage his colleagues, and indeed the Oireachtas itself, to open their eyes to the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not equipped to provide that service and that it is an illusion to believe that the word &ldquo;auditor&rdquo;, in his constitutional title, can be interpreted in the ordinary mercantile meaning of that word?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall do as the Deputy suggests.  As far as this section is concerned, I do not think his argument affects the situation because the new Board will have no trading or commercial functions and it would not be difficult in any way for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the financial statement and present it to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid a map would take some time to prepare.  This Bill has, primarily, a threefold purpose:&mdash; (1) to clarify the present position regarding the exercise of jurisdiction in the territorial seas; (2) to enable the system of straight baselines to be applied to the Irish coast thus resulting in a substantial increase in the area in which this country has exclusive fishing rights; and (3) to empower the Government to extend the exclusive fishery limits of the State by order subject to approval by both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an accepted principle of international law that the sovereignty of a State extends beyond its land territory and its internal waters to a belt of the sea adjacent to the coast.  That belt is described as the territorial sea.  This principle was recognised in our Constitution of 1937 which, in Article 2, states that the national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas. Within that belt the coastal State is, subject to certain rules of international law, entitled to exercise sovereign rights&mdash;one of which is to reserve for its own nationals the exclusive right <Col N="1049" /> of fishing.  The breadth of the territorial seas has not, under Irish law, been defined, but exclusive fishery jurisdiction has in practice been exercised in the sea areas lying within three miles of the coast.</P>
    <P>For many years, Deputies will be aware, the work of fishery protection, which the Naval Service has carried out with such efficiency, has been hampered by uncertainties, the precise legal position has sometimes appeared obscure; prosecutions for fishery infringements have given rise to many legal complexities.  It is to be hoped that this Bill will resolve these difficulties.</P>
    <P>For centuries, the law of the sea has been perhaps the most complex of the subjects that fall to be classed as international law.  It has, undoubtedly, been one of the most fruitful sources of dissension and difference between otherwise friendly States.  Following on the work of some ten years of the International Law Commission in this field the United Nations General Assembly convened a conference on the subject in the Spring of 1958. Generally speaking, that conference which met in Geneva, has been regarded as a failure because agreement was not reached on the most important topics, namely, the breadth of the territorial sea and exclusive fishery limits. It was far from being a failure, however, and in fact an extraordinary degree of agreement was achieved resulting in the formulation of almost the whole law of the sea in four concise Conventions, namely: (1) The Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone; (2) The Convention on the High Seas; (3) The Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas; and (4) The Convention on the Continental Shelf.  I am glad to say that Ireland has signed each of these Conventions.</P>
    <P>The failure of some 86 States to agree on the very fundamental issue of the breadth of the territorial sea was not surprising.  One of the main factors which inspired the convoking of the Conference was the increasing trend to extend unilaterally the territorial sea on one or other of the <Col N="1050" /> usual grounds, namely, those of defence or economics.  Many States considered that the three mile limit was the general rule of international law; many others contended that States were entitled to extend their territorial sea up to twelve miles from the coast; some, indeed, had gone so far as to claim jurisdiction in a 200 mile belt. The International Law Commission had given up the struggle to achieve uniformity on this issue, eventually recommending that the matter should be settled by an international conference.</P>
    <P>The surprise, therefore, was not the failure of the Geneva Conference to solve this acute problem but rather that sufficient agreement was arrived at to enable one proposal&mdash;made by the United States&mdash;to come within a few votes of achieving the necessary two-thirds majority.  The very considerable degree of agreement reached on this, and other subjects, was not achieved without a great amount of sacrifice on the part of some of the States concerned. That such a spirit was manifest in Geneva in 1958 augurs well for the success of the second Conference on the Law of the Sea which is due to be held in the Spring of 1960.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the differences which existed before and at Geneva may be said to find their roots in the divergent interests on the one hand of the great maritime States with large merchant fleets, naval forces and distant water fishing fleets and, on the other, of States generally small, perhaps newly emerged, whose principal interest lay in the fishing problem around their coast.  As a result of a Canadian proposal, it became clear at an early stage of the conference that a successful effort might be made to divorce the concept of exclusive fishing jurisdiction from that of the territorial sea, thereby separating the broadly economic from the other issues.</P>
    <P>I should explain that while the coastal State's sovereignty extends to the outer limits of the territorial sea subject only to rights of other States such as that of innocent passage&mdash; which itself may be modified in certain circumstances&mdash;the jurisdiction the coastal State exercises over exclusive <Col N="1051" /> fishery limits is merely that of excluding non-nationals from fishing.  While an extension of the territorial sea attracts great implications for strategy and for commercial shipping and air services, a similar extension of exclusive fishery limits has no corresponding ramifications.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland's main interest in this great problem lay in the fishing aspect, it was possible to support the Canadian proposal&mdash;and later the United States proposal&mdash;both of which would have permitted a narrow belt of territorial sea together with an exclusive fishing zone extending up to 12 miles from the coast.  The main difference between these two proposals was that the United States proposal conceded historic rights of fishing in the outer six miles of the Zone, while the Canadian proposal did not.</P>
    <P>Apart from strategic problems, however, it will be obvious that the clash between the economies of the countries which for many years have fished off the shores of the coastal State and those of the coastal State which enjoys productive fishing grounds in its vicinity is almost inevitable.  Some form of agreement is clearly necessary or a situation may result in which you have some States fishing virtually where they please while others appropriate great slices of the high seas as part of their exclusive fishery areas. International cooperation is not aided by such a situation.  It is to be hoped that the second Conference in the Spring of next year will bring agreement to the nations on this vexed subject. For our part, it is our present intention to support any reasonable proposal which safeguards the interests of the coastal State; we are not blind, however, to the fact that the welfare of the international community as a whole &mdash; or even that of friendly regional groupings&mdash;should not be ignored.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the territorial seas shall be measured from the low-water mark on the coast or, where straight baselines are drawn, from such baselines.  The former method has, as the House is aware, been the customary one employed in this country.  The <Col N="1052" /> system of straight baselines received its greatest fillip in the decision of the International Court of Justice in the fisheries dispute between Britain and Norway which was decided in Nor-way's favour in 1951.</P>
    <P>The principles of law enunciated by the International Court of Justice in that case have now been incorporated in Article 4 of the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone.  That Article reads:</P>
    <P>1.  In localities where the coast line is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.</P>
    <P>2.  The drawing of such baselines must not depart to any appreciable extent from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas lying within the lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to be subject to the régime of internal waters.</P>
    <P>3.  Baselines shall not be drawn to and from low-tide elevations, unless lighthouses or similar installations which are permanently above sea level have been built on them.</P>
    <P>4.  Where the method of straight baselines is applicable under the provisions of paragraph 1, account may be taken, in determining particular baselines, of economic interests peculiar to the region concerned, the reality and the importance of which are clearly evidenced by a long usage.</P>
    <P>5.  The system of straight baselines may not be applied by a State in such a manner as to cut off from the high seas the territorial sea of another State.</P>
    <P>6.  The coastal State must clearly indicate straight baselines on charts, to which due publicity must be given.</P>
    <P>The Geneva Convention of 1958 has not yet been ratified but it may justly be said to express the present position under international law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> Having regard to the principles enunciated by the Court and now accepted internationally, and considering the nature of the Irish coast, it is the intention of the Government to prescribe straight baselines from a point in Donegal in an anti-clockwise direction along the north-west, west and south coasts to an appropriate point on the Wexford mainland.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that one result of applying the straight baseline system is that areas of sea on the landward side of the baselines which formerly had been considered part of the territorial seas&mdash;or perhaps of the high seas&mdash;will now be regarded as the internal waters of the State.  In accordance with Article 5 of the Convention referred to, a right of innocent passage for foreign ships has been preserved through these areas.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for the measurement of the territorial seas as three nautical miles from the baseline, whether it be the coast or a straight baseline.  Our choice of a three-mile limit does not imply any preference for or against the three-mile limit as being the present rule of law.  Interesting as this topic is, it is now largely academic; the fact is that a great majority of States do not enforce a three mile limit. Our choice of this distance may be said to have two basic reasons:&mdash; (1) We consider that a narrow breadth of territorial sea&mdash;as distinct from exclusive fishery limits&mdash;is in our own interests; and (2) We do not wish in any way to anticipate the conclusions of the pending Conference on this subject and I have repeatedly stated that our preference is that any extension should come by way of international agreement.  Accordingly, pending the result of the Conference next Spring, the breadth of our territorial seas will under the Bill remain as always save that in the parts of the coast where straight baselines are applied it will be measured in a different manner.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it quite clear, however, that while we confidently expect and hope for success at the Conference, our position will be open should the Conference fail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> The Bill contains a very important provision whereby the Government may, by order, extend the exclusive fishery limits of the State.  Such an order would require resolutions of approval by both Houses.  As I have already stated the expressed preference of this country has been for a separation of the concepts of territorial sea and exclusive fishery limits and we trust that the trend towards such a separation which was manifest in Geneva in 1958 will attract the maximum support at the pending Conference. While we cannot claim to be in the same category as some European countries whose economies are overwhelmingly dependent on fishing, nonetheless our fishing industry is an important and expanding one and it is only natural that in conformity with the general international trend we should have under consideration the extension of the area over which we may exercise the exclusive right of fishing.  Representations have been made from time to time about extending our exclusive fishery limits; both the Minister for Lands and I are mindful of the interests of the fishing community in this respect.  I wish to repeat, however, what I have already said, namely, that we would desire, if possible, to have international approval for any extension contemplated by us.  Accordingly, we do not propose to make an order extending the exclusive fishery limits pending the outcome of the 1960 Conference. After that Conference, we will review the position.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a provision whereby the Government may take conservation action in areas of the high seas adjacent to the territorial seas. This is a new departure in the international field and is based on Article 7 of the 1958 Geneva Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas.  This Convention has not, of course, been ratified and is not in force, and action under Article 7 is not contemplated in the immediate future.  Before measures of conservation are taken unilaterally, there would have to be negotiations with the other States concerned and evidence must be forthcoming of the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> (a)  That there is a need for urgent application of conservation measures in the light of the existing knowledge of the fishery;</P>
    <P>(b)  That the measures adopted are based on appropriate scientific findings; and</P>
    <P>(c)  That such measures do not discriminate in form or in fact against foreign fishermen.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is thought advisable to make provision in the Bill for the taking of conservation measures when such action becomes feasible.</P>
    <P>Power is taken in the Bill for the Minister for Lands to issue a permit authorising fishing within the exclusive fishery limits for experimental purposes by a foreign sea fishing boat.  Such a permit would only be issued in exceptional circumstances, for example to allow study of a particular unfamiliar method of fishing.  The Minister is empowered to attach various restrictive conditions to the permit.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill deals with offences in the territorial seas and internal waters.  Such offences are offences within the jurisdiction of the State.  However, although we claim such jurisdiction, it would only be exercised in suitable instances.  It is recognised that under international law offences on board ship in the territorial seas are subject in the first place to the law of the ship's flag and the coastal State has concurrent jurisdiction only; furthermore, the jurisdiction of the coastal State is exercised only in certain well defined instances which are set out in Article 19 of the Geneva Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone.  As a further safeguard for the rights of aliens, Section 11 of the Bill provides that proceedings against an alien for an alleged offence in the territorial seas on board or by means of a foreign ship, shall not be instituted without a certificate from the Minister for External Affairs that the proceedings are expedient.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for the prescribing of charts which will be received in evidence.  Advantage has also been taken to repeal the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act, 1878, <Col N="1056" /> and also some old enactments relating to fishing.  In the absence of adaptation or by reason of implied repeal, it is doubtful if these statutes could be said to be in force at all, but they will be now repealed in so far as they are or ever were in force.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill is designed to come into operation on 1st October, 1959, the day on which the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, which is now law, also comes into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>The Minister, as I understand, in this Bill defines our territorial waters as &ldquo;that portion of the sea which lies between the baseline and the outer limit of the territorial seas&rdquo; and the outer limit of our territorial seas is defined in Section 3 as, &ldquo;the line every point of which is at a distance of three nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline.&rdquo; The baseline is then defined in Section 4:</P>
      <P>(1)  Save as otherwise provided, the baseline is low-water mark&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  on the coast of the mainland or of any island, or</P>
      <P>(b)  on any low-tide elevation situated wholly or partly at a distance not exceeding three nautical miles from the mainland or an island.</P>
      <P>I shall go on to the second subsection in a moment.</P>
      <P>I thought that the Minister spoke of some Convention which provided that any low-tide elevation situated wholly or partly at a distance not exceeding three nautical miles from the mainland or an island had to be an elevation on which some permanent structure was erected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You can use it only for the purpose of the straight baseline, if there is a permanent structure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we come to the definition in subsection (2) of how the Government shall prescribe straight <Col N="1057" /> baselines, and I take it that this is an alternative to what is provided in subsection (1):</P>
      <P>(2)  The Government may by order prescribe straight baselines in relation to any part of the national territory and the closing line of any bay or mouth of a river, and any line so prescribed shall be taken as the baseline.</P>
      <P>There is a provision further on in the Bill which requires the Government to make available charts, which will be available to all for inspection, showing the baseline prescribed by the Government under subsection (2) of Section 4.  I find it very difficult to discuss this Bill at all in the absence of that chart or of some sample of what the chart is likely to show if and when the Government has prescribed its straight baseline under subsection (2) of Section 4.  I shall give the Minister an indication of my difficulty. If you take that part of the coastline which lies between Connemara, on the one hand and Loop Head, on the other, one asks oneself is it permissible to draw a straight baseline from Slyne Head to Loop Head, or would our jurisdiction for the purpose of drawing a baseline be confined to drawing it from Barna to Lahinch?  I take it that it is manifest that our right to draw a baseline would extend from the Mullet of Belmullet to the outer shore of Achill Island.  I am not clear whether that baseline would then have to go back to follow the coastline or whether we would be permitted to extend the baseline from the westernmost tip of Achill Island down to a point north of Clifden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that the Minister's reference to &ldquo;islands adjacent to the shore&rdquo; would include a group of islands such as the Aran Islands, but I am not clear as to how the baseline would be drawn in relation to the mainland.  Of course, if it emerged that the concept of the baseline permitted us to draw a baseline from Slyne Head to Loop Head, that would include the Aran Islands but if we were permitted only to draw the baseline, say, from Barna to Lahinch, then the special position of the group of islands such as the Aran Islands would at once <Col N="1058" /> arise.  I cannot help wondering what is going to become of Tory Island.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister announced the Government decision to start drawing its baseline somewhere in the vicinity of Lough Swilly and to stop somewhere in the vicinity of Arklow. I do not blame the Government for taking that decision in the special circumstances in which we are, but I should like to speculate with interest on the tears Deputy P.J. Burke would shed, if we were the Government and he were in Opposition, over our scandalous abandonment of Six Counties of our national territory, to the grave detriment of the fishermen of Balbriggan.  Do I misrepresent the Deputy?</P>

His eyes will be as dry as the sands of Brittas or Skerries because the Minister is introducing this Bill and approaching this whole problem of territorial jurisdiction on a very factual and practical basis.  Perhaps Deputy P.J. Burke, just to keep us in good humour, would tell us what he would have said if he had been in Opposition and the Bill was brought in.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do.  The plain truth is that, as the Minister say, this is all a very difficult situation, very largely dependent on agreement amongst nations, which is extremely difficult to get.  The bigger the country, the more indifferent you can appear to be to the feelings of other countries.  I think the Russians at one time claimed jurisdiction over 20 miles, whereas the Minister himself had said that certain nations claim jurisdiction over 12 miles.  Although I ought not to be making the Minister's case, I was handling this problem for so long myself that I cannot help saying, with some of the extra-enthusiastic advocates of extreme caution, that when you are pressing the Irish Government to extend our maritime jurisdiction to 12 miles, 6 miles, and so on, it may be well for those who have these thoughts <Col N="1059" /> in mind to look at the situation into which Iceland has manipulated itself. They have got out on the end of a limb by climbing a 12-miles jurisdiction. Now they have the British Fleet cruising up and down inside waters which they claim to be their territorial waters.  Two nations and two peoples who have been bound together by centuries of intimate relations and most cordial goodwill now find themselves in daily danger of some clash which could result in a deplorable situation which I have not the slightest doubt both communities most earnestly desire to avoid.  That situation need not ever have arisen if a unilateral assertion of rights had not been made which the other party was under no circumstances prepared to concede.</P>
      <P>I think if we were in office and introduced this Bill, every member of the Fianna Fáil Party would be roaring like the Bull of Bashan to extend our territorial waters to 6 miles, 12 miles and indeed maybe 20 miles&mdash;and they would make a lot of capital out of it.  I do not think it is any harm to remember what happened in Iceland as a result of certain elements there who adopted that course and helped to create the situation which at present exists there.  There is a long story behind all that difficulty into which it is not expedient for us to go here.  I am sure the Minister will give it to anybody who wants it, if he asks him.  Its only interest for us ought to be a warning of how, in the desire to do too much at one stroke, you can in fact fail to achieve what is truly desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Government are wise at this stage to proceed cautiously and to express, as the Minister has expressed, our desire in so far as is humanly possible to proceed by agreement with other countries legitimately sharing our interest in the fishery part of the whole question of coastal waters.  I think the Minister is right again and that our Government are right in saying they welcome the Canadian suggestion that in so far as it is practicable, the fishery interest and the economic interest of territorial waters should be separated from strategic and other considerations which arise.  We ought <Col N="1060" /> all be able to find common ground in the purely economic sphere, whereas it is manifest that common ground in the strategic sphere and in a variety of other considerations relating to the sea might not so easily be attainable.</P>
    <P>I wonder if it would be unreasonable to ask the Minister whether, if the principle of this Bill were agreed to today on the Second Stage, before the Committee Stage, some kind of an outline map could be furnished which would give some indication of what baselines will look like, if and when the Government exercise the powers they seek under subsection (2) of Section 4.  I do not think any Deputy would expect the Government to bind themselves by any such broad indication, but the Minister will find that on a previous occasion when I was dealing with this question in another context, I was trying to explain to the House the general location of the fish and I furnished the House with an outline map showing the approximate position of the Continental Shelf and comparing that with the approximate position of the Continental Shelf off the Scandinavian shore and a variety of other information of that kind which did not purport to be scientifically accurate but gave Deputies a broad indication of the nature of the problem.</P>
    <P>It would facilitate intelligent discussion of this Bill if we had some such general indication from the Minister of what the situation will be like after the Government, as at present advised, have exercised the powers they seek under subsection (2) of Section 4.  I appreciate what the Minister has said in regard to jurisdiction under Sections 10 and 11 but I take it that subsection (2) of Section 11 effectively preserves the right to prosecute a trespassing trawler in our waters.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps necessary to emphasise a little more that Sections 10 and 11 are primarily designed to provide that, if one sailor murders another on a foreign ship, ordinarily the person charged with such a crime will be surrendered to the Government of the country whose flag the ship is flying at the time of the commission of the <Col N="1061" /> crime, even though the crime is committed within our territorial waters. Does that apply to a ship at anchor in a port?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know either. Perhaps, at some stage, the Minister might tell us that.  I should be grateful if he would also confirm what I think is true, namely, that Sections 10 and 11 do not in any way alter our present procedure in holding up a trespassing trawler and bringing its master into the port and imposing whatever penalties a court of competent jurisdiction in Ireland may apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add except one note of regret that the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, will be amended before it comes into operation.  I do not suppose it is ever possible finally to consolidate the law. It is rather that, having laboured for seven years to bring within the compass of one Act the entire fishery law, on the day this consolidation Act comes into operation, Section 219 will materially be amended.  I am obliged to confess that I recognise that that is inevitable.  We can only hope that the consolidation Act will continue to enshrine the total fishery law, with that minor exception, for a long time ahead. Many people will be somewhat disappointed by the provisions of this Bill but I am not prepared to say it would be reasonable at this stage to press the Government to go further than they see their way to go.  However, I reserve the right to query the user of this Bill, unless and until I have had an opportunity of seeing some indication of how the Government intend to prescribe straight baselines under subsection (2) of Section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill which is necessary for the protection of our fishery interests. Nevertheless, I cannot help but think back to an occasion some five or six months ago when in this House, by way of a Parliamentary Question, certain Deputies sought information as to whether or not there was need for such a Bill as this.  I remember the <Col N="1062" /> Minister who was speaking on an Adjournment Debate on questions raised by Deputy Corish and Deputy Esmonde from Wexford, denying that there was any reason for doubt as to whether we had a fixed baseline and assuring the House that our maritime defence forces had all the information and all the legislative support necessary to enforce the law under the legislation at that time.  The mere fact that this Bill is being introduced is an indication to me and to any normal person that that was not so, that the Minister was wrong in that statement, that he now admits that and is seeking to rectify the position.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Dillon, I congratulate the Minister on the very sane, practical way in which this Bill has been drawn up.  We have no sweeping claim to wide stretches of water adjoining our coast which we cannot in fact enforce. All of us in this little country must realise that any extended fishing right beyond the normal three-mile limit which is now recognised in international law must be achieved by way of agreement between the various countries which fish in our waters.  It is reasonable that the Minister should suggest waiting until the Conference of 1960 has taken place before we decide on what limits shall be prescribed by the Government.  While leaving himself room to do that, the Minister has not taken up a stupid position in somewhat the same manner as Iceland did. Whatever the moral right of the case might be, if we were unable to enforce the law, it would be ridiculous for our country to have taken up a similar position and to find our enactments being flagrantly violated by any foreign trawlers which desired to come in because of want of the force necessary to protect our rights.</P>
      <P>It must be clear to the Minister that for the limited extent of seas we claim at present, protection is not adequate at all.  During the season from December to February, we had along the coast of my constituency all types of foreign boats coming within the three-mile limit and we were unable to supply a sufficient number of boats to protect the fishing interests of the Irish fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be keenly interested in <Col N="1063" /> having an outline of the proposed fixed baselines on the south coast between Waterford and Wexford.  It is a well-known herring fishing ground and during the herring fishing season, it is very much in the headlines in regard to foreign trawlers poaching within territorial waters.  During last season, there was a prosecution which was subject to appeal in our courts on the question as to whether a fixed baseline existed or not.  I should like to know from the Minister, prior to this Bill being enacted, whether a line between Hook Head and Mine Head would be considered as a baseline on the southern coast.  The fishing interests in that area believe it is absolutely essential to give that protection.  I do not know what are the views of the Minister or of his officials on that, but I suggest that if that line is taken, the Minister should, as well as declaring the baseline, endeavour to see that when it is declared, adequate protection will be given against infringements by outside interests.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the House to pass this legislation quickly so that the protection which was not there last year will be available for our fishing interests when the season opens on 1st October this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  It will be of great assistance to our inshore fishermen and while the Minister in his own diplomatic way has considered all the international implications of the Bill, he has gone a good way towards meeting the requirements of our inshore fishermen.  He has also succeeded in upholding our international status and not causing any ill-will.  It is a very difficult position and any Deputy representing an east coast area is up against this problem from time to time. Our inshore fishermen have been clamouring for protection from foreign trawlers.  I hope when this baseline comes into operation under this Bill it will remove the causes for complaint in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke has referred to the fact that this Bill would be of considerable help to the <Col N="1064" /> inshore fishermen.  I agree with the observations of Deputy Kyne that this is a Bill to which the support of the House should be given so that it may be passed with the least possible delay.  If there is any matter which has given a good deal of trouble over the years, it is the question of our fishery rights and the limit and the extent of our territorial waters.  Since the establishment of native Government no serious effort was made by any Government to have this matter clarified.  All down through the years the problem arose and became more difficult.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne made reference to the appalling state of affairs which existed on the borders of his constituency last year when there was unprecedented poaching by foreign trawlers. Naturally enough, as the Minister for External Affairs correctly pointed out in opening his remarks on this Bill, our fishing industry must be ranked as one of the best and highest when we consider the number of families engaged in it and its value to the country.  Any Government cannot turn the blind eye or give the deaf ear to anything that will further the interests of such an important branch of our economy.</P>
      <P>I am glad this legislation came before the House because I feel that at least in the years to come the problems and the difficulties we have had with regard to our territorial waters will at least be defined.  I should like to join with other Deputies in asking the Minister for External Affairs to prepare a suitable map giving us in detail the outline of the proposed fixed baselines.  It is necessary.  As a matter of fact, I expected that, when this Bill was being circulated, the Minister for External Affairs would have facilitated Deputies by letting them have suitable maps, particularly a map giving them the proposed fixed baselines.  I would ask the Minister, for the information of Deputies and the country which is interested in this legislation, to have such a map prepared and circulated to members of the House with the least possible delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Government <Col N="1065" /> acted with great caution with regard to the question of the extension of our fishery limits.  Our fishery organisations and the organised groups of fishermen around our coast have made repeated requests for the extension of our fishery limits.  Those requests were always made with sincerity. There were always good grounds for such an appeal and such a request.</P>
    <P>Assuming for a moment that we decided to extend our fishery limits from, say, the three miles, as it is at present, to six, ten or twelve miles, what advantage would that be to us unless it was generally recognised? Therefore, I feel that the Government acted wisely and cautiously in this matter.  They are right to leave it to the International Convention so as to ensure that whatever extension we give to our fishery limits, whether it be five, six, ten or twelve miles, will be respected by all other nations.  Unless our fishery limits are respected by all other nations, there is little use in our declaring it for ourselves because of the difficulty of protecting the fishery limits.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs and every member in this House know that at the present time with our three mile fishery limits we have been more than put to the pin of our collars to provide suitable protection for our fisheries within that limit.  As a matter of fact, the existing limit cannot be properly protected by the protection services we have.  I can imagine the endless difficulties which would exist if we had to endeavour to protect ten miles of a fishery limit on the existing fishery protection services we have.  I am glad it is to be left to international agreement.  Whatever decision is taken after the Spring of 1960, I would recommend to the Government that the representatives of the Irish Government at that Convention will be quite satisfied that whatever limit is taken it will be with the entire approval and agreement of the conference and that no difficulties will arise after that.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (1) of the Bill says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister for Lands so thinks proper, for experimental purposes in connection with sea-fishing, the Minister may issue a <Col N="1066" /> permit authorising fishing by means of a specified foreign sea-fishing boat (as defined by section 219 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959) within the exclusive fishery limits of the State or any defined area or areas thereof.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, it may be necessary to have such a section in this Bill but I feel that, unless it was for the purpose of experimenting entirely, it would be wrong if a foreign trawler were allowed to dump fish, say, in this country.  I think this House ought not to give the Minister for Lands or any Minister for Fisheries in this State authority or approval&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter does not arise on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I am glad to see that Section 9 is entirely for experimental purposes only.  Section 10 of the Bill deals with jurisdiction in the case of offences in respect of those who may be guilty of trespass on our territorial waters.  Whilst we could not at any time interfere with the law as it stands, I have always felt that there should have been some form of defined punishment for the offenders.</P>
      <P>We had numerous occasions upon which Spanish trawlers and even French fishing vessels were guilty of repeated offences and despite the fact that their gear was confiscated and that the catch might be confiscated, they always saw fit, because of the great value of our fishing grounds, to return again.  I feel that in legislation such as this some suitable sections should be provided, if necessary, for the confiscation of the entire vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may be rather drastic.  However, an occasion can arise when some of those trawlers may be forced into our coast because of weather conditions. A sympathetic view must be taken of entry which is due to bad weather conditions, illness of the crew or to the need for urgent repairs to the vessel or ship.  On the other hand, when we see that our fisheries are being deliberately trespassed upon, that the trespass is continually taking place and that, despite the full rigour of our laws, many of the offenders still return and <Col N="1067" /> repeat the offences, I think that in the interests of protecting our fisheries and, having regard to the importance of the lives of our fishermen, the law should provide for the maximum amount of punishment for such continual offenders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we were dealing with our fishery limits and the question of the proposed fixed baselines, I thought this might be an opportunity at least to air that grievance and direct the attention of the Government or whatever Minister is responsible to the fact that some suitable legislation is necessary in order to deal with continual offenders.</P>
      <P>I would again appeal to the Minister to provide a suitable map for the guidance of all those interested.  The extension of our fishery limits is something which has been pressed forward very much by the fishermen along our coasts and I trust that when the time comes a suitable extension will be granted, at the same time bearing in mind that it will be entirely with the approval and agreement of all other countries taking part in the international conference.</P>

      <P>I take it that it will be possible for the Minister to provide the map for which Deputy Dillon asked but in dealing with the Bill at this stage I wonder is the Minister in a position to give some information to the House.  In order to define the outer limits of the territorial seas, certain straight baselines have to be drawn and the Minister indicated that one end of that operation would stretch to some part of the coast of Wexford.  There has been a certain amount of difficulty in that area of Waterford and Wexford recently and there are certain well defined points that might very well figure in the drawing of a straight baseline in that area.  Would the Minister be in a position, in regard to the drawing of base lines towards the end of the south-eastern end of his planning, to use say, the Metal Man Point and Brown's Head Point at Tramore, Hook <Col N="1068" /> Head, Kilmore Quay, Carnsore Point and Cahore Point?  The baselines will be drawn at certain well-defined points and it seems to me that these points are bound to be the bases of the line that will be drawn.  In relation to Kilmore Quay there is the question of the Saltee Islands which are straight opposite it.  I wonder if the Minister would be in a position to say how the baseline will stretch from point to point at these points?</P>

If I could, I would have circulated it before circulating the Bill or I would have circulated it with the Bill.  However, there were difficulties in that the map is not yet completed to the satisfaction of the officials dealing with it.  All I can say is that if the leaders of Fine Gael and the leaders of the Labour Party want to have a look at it and get in touch with me I shall give them a glance at it, at what is the first shot at drawing the lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what I intend to do.  To-morrow perhaps we can have it there.  The House can rely of course on our taking full advantage of the law in regard to the <Col N="1069" /> drawing of these baselines so as to give us an extension of our exclusive fishery rights as quickly as possible. Under the international law as it stands, wherever the straight baselines can be justified there is no objection to extending the exclusive fishery rights in accordance with these lines. There is no objection to that and we are going to take as much advantage as we can of the international law as it stands.</P>
      <P>Deputies have alluded to the fact that our fishermen are keen to extend our exclusive fishery limits as quickly as possible.  So am I, but I need not repeat what I said in my opening remarks that we should do it and do it only when an International Convention has been signed by all the countries agreeing to the extension of the exclusive fishery limits.  Our team at Geneva last year did very good work in helping to get a draft resolution which almost got through.  There were only a few votes short of the two-thirds required to get agreement upon the resolution on the exclusive fishery limits.  We are very hopeful that next year, in the Spring of 1960, we shall finally arrive at an agreement accepted by at least two-thirds if not the full membership of the conference.</P>
      <P>There is very little more I have to say.  The Bill is short and it is reasonably clear and if Deputies get in touch with me to-morrow I shall try to have the map and give them a glance at it, showing them in a general way how the straight base lines operate.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to amend the Sea Fisheries Acts, 1952 to 1956, a group of Acts not included in the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act which recently became law.  The Act of 1952 is that which, among other things, established An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The main provision of the Bill is to be found in Section 2 which authorises the making of advances from the Central Fund to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara up to a limit of £3,000,000.  The present limit of £1,000,000 will soon be reached: a balance of only £14,867 remains and, when that amount is drawn, the Board would be unable to carry on their normal activities without additional funds.</P>
      <P>These advances are repayable by the Board with interest and are used in the main to finance the purchase of boats and gear.  They are also applied to meet part of the cost of fish processing stations, ice making plants and other premises and equipment.  The additional £2,000,000 now being authorised will meet the Board's requirements for some years to come.</P>
      <P>The Board consists of six members and their period of office is two years &mdash;a rather short time in which to become familiar with the complex business involved.  Section 3 of the Bill extends the normal term of office to three years and introduces a system under which two of the six members will complete their term each year.  The two members retiring by rotation would, of course, be eligible for reappointment. I think this provision will help to secure stability and continuity in the Board's policy&mdash;which is an important factor in the development of the sea-fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill and the new sub-section which I propose to move on Committee Stage are not of immediate practical significance: they amend provisions which, although on the statute book, are not actually in operation.  The provisions in question are in Section 9 of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, and relate to the licensing of vessels for sea-fishing.  If those provisions <Col N="1071" /> were in operation, no vessel exceeding thirty-five feet over all in length could be used for sea-fishing except under and in accordance with a licence under the section.</P>
    <P>To qualify for a licence, a vessel would have to be owned by an Irish citizen or a company the whole of the share capital of which is held by Irish citizens.  This reference to share capital could prove unduly restrictive in present circumstances.  A few years after the 1952 Act became law, another Act&mdash;the Mercantile Marine Act, 1955&mdash;was passed declaring that a body corporate established under and subject to the law of the State and having its principal place of business in the State is qualified to own a ship registered here.  It will be noted that there is no reference to share capital in the later legislation.</P>
    <P>A case could arise in which an Irish vessel&mdash;owned by an Irish body corporate, duly registered here and legally entitled to fish within our exclusive fishery limits&mdash;would not be eligible for a licence under Section 9 of the 1952 Act as it stands.  That position could be quite untenable&mdash;particularly if the body corporate in question had been encouraged to engage in the canning or processing of fish or the production of fish meal and had found it necessary to acquire the vessel to provide raw material for its factory owing to lack of supplies from other sources.  Section 4 of the Bill avoids this possibility by deleting the reference to a company and its share capital and substituting an Irish body corporate as defined in the Mercantile Marine Act, 1955.</P>
    <P>Another restriction in Section 9 of the 1952 Act relates to a vessel operated by a person directly engaged in either the wholesale or retail sale of fresh fish.  If the section were in operation, the catches of such a vessel would have to be delivered for sale to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara or disposed of according to the directions of the Board.  I consider that this may be a deterrent to private interests who could appropriately be expected to invest in fishing vessels and that such a deterrent is out of place in present <Col N="1072" /> circumstances: there is urgent need for expansion of the fishing fleet to provide supplies for processing stations etc. and it is desired to attract private capital for that purpose.  The restriction is therefore being repealed by Section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>For the convenience of Deputies perhaps I might here refer to the new subsection which I propose to move on the Committee Stage.  I am advised that, if it were decided to introduce the licensing of fishing vessels under the 1952 Act as it stands, the provisions would have to be applied to every vessel exceeding 35 feet over all in length.  In practice it might be quite unnecessary at the outset to go to the trouble and expense of licensing boats up to say 50 or 60 feet.  In other words, the vessels desired to be brought under control might be those exceeding say 60 or 70 feet.  The object of the new subsection is to enable the licensing provisions to be applied to vessels exceeding whatever length would be considered appropriate in the prevailing circumstances. Boats between 35 feet and the prescribed length would then be exempt from licensing requirements and vessels above that length would have to be licensed.  This flexibility is desirable for the convenience of the general body of fishermen.</P>
    <P>I hope I have adequately explained Sections 2 to 5 and the new sub-section: Sections 1 and 6 are usual provisions for definitions and citation and do not call for comment.  If Deputies desire further information on any other point arising from this measure I shall endeavour to help them.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer briefly to the general question of fish supplies in view of the protests recently made against landings by certain vessels.  I think these protests are based on the mistaken belief that the market cannot satisfactorily absorb all the fish at present being landed.  The evidence before me, however, points to the conclusion that the market is not sufficiently supplied to meet the demand for fish.</P>
    <P>Comparing the first five months of the present year with the corresponding <Col N="1073" /> period last year, I find that landings of demersal fish increased by 10% while the total prices received by fishermen increased by 19%, landings of pelagic fish increased by 14% and the prices by 50% and the value of all varieties&mdash;demersal, pelagic and shell-fish&mdash;increased by 33%.  Not only are these figures an indication of a buoyant market but I am also assured by wholesalers and retailers that they could readily find outlets for more fish if regular supplies were available.  This buoyancy is well illustrated by the price received by the fishermen for whiting which is the most plentiful variety in their catch of demersal fish. In the last quarter of 1958 landings of whiting rose by some 78% over those for the same quarter in the previous year and, despite the increased quantity, the average price realised was about 9% higher.  In the first five months of 1959 landings of whiting were over 25% higher than in the corresponding period last year and the average price rose by almost 16%.</P>
    <P>In addition to the existing and the untapped market for fresh fish, very substantial quantities are needed for quick-freezing, canning, curing and fish meal production.  There are quick-freeze plants and a fish meal factory which have never received more than a fraction of the supplies they can cope with; canneries are being erected. They are all confronted with a shortage of raw material.  They would provide considerable employment and increase our exports if only they could procure supplies of fish.</P>
    <P>Against this background, it seems to me to be quite unrealistic to speak of surplus landings at the present time. Scarce supplies and exorbitant prices would be a most short-sighted objective: they would lead to declining demand and be detrimental to the fishermen's interests in the long run. The industry can only be developed on the basis of increased landings and reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>It is only natural that proprietors of factories of any type, faced with a chronic shortage of raw material, should seek the means of providing supplies: it would be deplorable to see valuable premises and plant lying idle.  Accordingly, it should not be regarded <Col N="1074" /> as abnormal when a fish meal factory or a cannery with a very large capacity for fish acquires a limited number of fishing vessels to help in supplying its requirements.  That there is scope for many more Irish vessels on the fishing grounds off our coast&mdash; including grounds outside our exclusive fishery limits&mdash;is clear when we realise that huge quantities of fish are taken from those waters by the fleets of other countries: according to international statistics our share of the total catch is scarcely 10%.  There is, however, no question of an influx of large vessels to this country dissociated from factories and processing plants.</P>
    <P>In referring to foreign capital invested in the fishing industry it should be borne in mind that foreign connections are most important in establishing export markets.  I need hardly add that the investment of foreign capital in an Irish company does not preclude the company from owning an Irish registered vessel.  All such vessels are, however, expected to employ Irish crews as soon as suitably trained personnel become available.  I hope that increasing numbers of our fishermen will avail themselves of the training facilities provided for them.</P>
    <P>Some growing pains may be unavoidable in the early stages of development of the fishing industry. The welfare of our fishermen will, however, be carefully safeguarded and their legitimate interests will be respected.  As evidence of good faith I need scarcely remind the fishermen of the various schemes introduced for their benefit in the past twelve months &mdash;arrangements to train fishermen as skippers and boys as fishermen, grants and reduced interest for boats, cheaper ice at various ports, exploratory fishing vessel on the stocks, plans for harbour development, and so on.</P>
    <P>The fears which some of the fishermen have recently been expressing are unfounded.  Should the need arise, however, I shall not hesitate to exercise the powers at my disposal to regulate the landings of larger vessels.</P>
    <P>If at any time it becomes necessary to introduce the licensing of vessels for sea-fishing, section 9 of the 1952 Act, when amended by sections 4 and 5 of the Bill and the new subsection to be <Col N="1075" /> inserted, should be quite effective for that purpose.  In particular I would refer to the powers contained in sub-section (5) which is not affected by the amendments and reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A licence may be granted subject to such conditions as the Minister thinks fit, including restrictions on sea-fishing either generally or in regard to methods of sea-fishing in particular places and as to disposal of the catches and the Minister may from time to time vary any condition or impose new conditions.</P>
    <P>In commending the Bill to the House I might repeat that the authorisation of further advances for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is its main object.  The opportunity is also taken to make more satisfactory arrangements for membership of the Board and to amend a section&mdash;which is not in operation&mdash;by removing some restrictions relating to licensing and catches of certain fishing vessels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely hard to be patient&mdash;to use restrained language &mdash;when the Minister for Lands says that the main provision of this Bill is to increase the authorised capital from £1,000,000 to £3,000,000.  That is just pure and undiluted eye-wash put in to fool the House.  I was Minister for Fisheries for six years and I was never short of money.  Any money I ever wanted to provide boats for the fishermen was forthcoming.  There was never any question about it.  I solemnly certify to Dáil Eireann that I was never 24 hours short of any money I asked of either Minister for Finance with whom I was concerned, Deputy McGilligan or Deputy Sweetman, and to say that this section raising the availability of money from £1,000,000 to £3,000,000 is the principal section of the Bill is cod and fraud and is designed to cover up the main intention of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a fishmongers' Bill; it was brought in at the request of fishmongers and it is being passed on to this House&mdash;I am obliged to use this word&mdash;deliberately and fraudulently and the attempt being made by the Minister today is, in my opinion, an <Col N="1076" /> attempt to mislead the House.  Section 2 has come as a shock.  When I was Minister for Fisheries, there was no limit set to the finance available to me and I believe that was so when Deputy Tom Walsh was Minister for Fisheries during the Fianna Fáil administration and again, when I was Minister for Agriculture with Deputy Oliver Flanagan as Parliamentary Secretary in charge of Fisheries from 1954 to 1957. So far as I know, since the State was founded, there was never any difficulty about getting any money we wanted.</P>
    <P>I remember giving a direction to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to set every boatyard in Ireland at work and to search the boatyards in Scotland to see if additional boats could be found there in order to meet the demand for boats by the Irish fishermen.  That is the measure of the financial stringency which the Department of Fisheries has ever experienced in the provision of money for the financing of boats or gear for fishermen who want to acquire boats of their own.  This Bill has been brought in for the fishmongers.  They have been at this for the past 15 years. They have been trying from as far back as when An Bord Iascaigh Mhara was established, to get it down and smash it, and incidentally, smash the boat-owning fishermen of our north-west, west, south-west and eastern shores and now they are going to succeed.  To me, it is a perfect horror because I was reared among these people all my life to see their trust in an Irish administration being so shamelessly betrayed.</P>
    <P>Last week, we were debating here a Bill designed in effect to wipe out the Undeveloped Areas Act which set a premium on establishing industries in the undeveloped areas.  This is a Bill to wipe out the boat-owning fishermen of the west, south-west and north-west coasts of this country. Sometimes I feel that my capacity for <i>saeva indignatio</i> is waning, but thank God, this revives it.  The people I am thinking of are the salt of the earth; they are not angels.  The salt of the earth never are angels but they are an independent, self-supporting, energetic group of families living in a part of the country where there is no conceivable <Col N="1077" /> possibility of providing them with employment.  These are people who catch fish, who build boats and who live in the heart of the Gaeltacht and if this means of livelihood is taken from them, a large proportion of the families at present self-supporting in the Gaeltacht will be rendered destitute and will simply clear out.</P>
    <P>Now I must undertake the wearisome task of trying to remind the House of the background to this situation.  When I think that only four short years ago we inaugurated the Gaeltacht boat scheme in order to persuade these Irish-speaking families of the west, the south-west and the north-west coasts to buy boats and persuaded them to sit down and learn how to acquire a master mariner's certificate and when I find now that the whole scheme is to be blown sky-high for the benefit of the fishmongers in Dublin and Cork, it makes me almost savage with indignation.  The maddening thing is that this kind of thing can be done and the people can be fooled and it is not by any means easy to clarify the position for them, because it is so difficult to explain the whole background of the situation. What shocks me is that I know there are Deputies sitting opposite to me at this moment in the Fianna Fáil benches who know these facts as well as I do but I bet they will not say a word. They will sit there like dummies and stand over this, but if they do, they will be betraying their own people in a most shameless way.</P>
    <P>What is the history of this?  The price structure for demersal fish has been created for the purpose of preserving between 1,000 and 2,000 families who live in the Gaeltacht and indeed in Howth and Arklow and Dunmore and who get their living by taking boats to sea, catching fish and disposing of it on the domestic markets in Ireland.  Let us go back to the very beginning.  There are two categories of fish, pelagic fish, that is, fish which shoal and demersal fish, the fish which live on the bottom.  Demersal fish are sole, turbot, haddock, plaice, whiting and fish of that kind.  I often wonder why whiting is not put with the pelagic fish because it appears to shoal periodically.  It is not; it is put with <Col N="1078" /> the demersal fish.  That is what is known ordinarily as prime fish, wet fish or flat fish.  Pelagic fish is herring, broadly speaking, and mackerel.</P>
    <P>In this country, consumers of fish are paying approximately 30 per cent more for fish than people pay in England.  There are two reasons to justify that.  One is that all the demersal fish consumed in England is from three to six weeks old before it is put upon the fishmonger's slab, because demersal fish is brought into England by trawlers which go long distances out to the Greenland banks.  They fish on the way out and put the fish into the holds in ice; they fish on the banks and they put their catch into the holds in ice and they fish on the way back.  The greater part of their entire catch, by the time it reaches the fishmonger's slab in London or Birmingham or Manchester or Liverpool or wherever it is sold, is anything from three to six weeks old.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, 90 per cent. of the fish consumed is consumed within 48 to 72 hours of its being caught, because our fishermen do not go out those great distances.  What they catch today they sell to-morrow and it is delivered into Dublin the following day and eaten or consumed then or within 24 hours. Therefore, there is that consideration, that all the demersal fish consumed in this country is far fresher&mdash;but that in itself is, of course, a minor consideration.</P>
    <P>The major consideration is that there is only one form of employment for those families, in the Gaeltacht primarily&mdash;but also in certain centres on our eastern coastline.  It is important to bear in mind that the preservation of the fish market for these people results in their being given a reasonably high standard of living in that remote part of the country and in their being enabled to provide for the boat building community in Baltimore, in Galway, in Fanny's Bay and Killybegs, a most lucrative and highly skilled occupation, in the manufacture of those 50ft. to 60ft. boats with which we are at present equipping our owner-fishermen fleet.</P>
    <P>Now, the fishmongers have always longed for the chance of starting a racket.  It is in many ways like the <Col N="1079" /> wheat business.  The wheat price structure was originally designed to enable small farmers in this country to grow wheat at a profit.  We ended up with no small farmer growing wheat and wheat being grown by men growing anything from 100 to 1,000 acres of wheat, within the price structure designed for the 40 acre farm.  What the fishmongers have always wanted was the authority and right to bring in with trawlers into the port of Dublin demersal fish and have the right to sell it under a price structure designed for people who were bringing it in in their own boats to the west coast of Ireland.  More than that, what the fishmongers wanted was a licence to import fish from Grimsby and sell it here at prices related to a price structure designed to provide a living for a peculiarly vulnerable section of our community, whose special difficulties induced one Government after another in this country openly and frankly to ask the fish-consuming public here to help out in the solution of their social problem by paying 20 to 30 per cent. more for demersal fish caught by these fishermen than they would have to pay if they were given free access to Grimsby and the big fishing ports of Great Britain. This Bill is designed to permit the fishmongers to do that very thing.</P>
    <P>I want to warn this House&mdash;and let there be no illusion about it&mdash;that if you establish a trade in trawlers here bringing in demersal fish, you cannot operate deep sea trawlers in this country fishing for demersal fish, without their bringing into the port of Dublin or the port of Cork quantities far in excess of the capacity of our domestic market to consume.  The moment that happens, every ounce of fish captured by the boat-owning fishermen of the Gaeltacht and elsewhere will become unsaleable.  It is all pure eyewash and fraud for the Minister to say that his heart is wrung by the fact that the domestic demand for fish is in excess of the existing capacity of the fishermen to supply.  What if it is? Can we not go on doing what we have been doing for the past ten years&mdash;let An Bord Iascaigh Mhara bring in any fish that is wanted?  One would really think that this was some revelation. <Col N="1080" /> That is what upsets me with the Minister for Lands.  If he plants a tree, one would think he was the first man since Adam was a boy who ever did so.  If he suddenly discovers that occasionally fish have to be brought in, primarily because of rough weather, over a week or ten days, it is a revelation comparable with the words of fire that appeared upon the rock when Moses was abroad.</P>
    <P>Do we not all know that when we have stormy weather around this country and calm weather in Newfoundland, temporarily there is no fishing here and elsewhere there is plenty; and similarly when there is calm weather around Ireland and wild weather in Newfoundland, there is a famine in fish in Grimsby and abundant fish here.  However, we have had no difficulties in dealing with that.  If there was any shortage of fish, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara brought in the fish and we supplied any gap that weather conditions, or circumstances of that character which affected our relatively small boats, might create.  As soon as the weather settled, the normal intake of fish continued and imports of fish stopped.  <i>Ad interim,</i> imports of fish were distributed by public auction to whoever was short of fish; and any profit that accrued was held by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and, I believe, put into a fund to promote the consumption of fish on the domestic market. That was a scheme worked out in order to avoid the appearance of allowing the profits of these temporary imports to react peculiarly in favour of any interest in the fishing industry and the idea of expanding domestic consumption of fish was that it conferred a favour on the fishmongers and fishermen and everyone else interested in the fish trade.</P>
    <P>That was a rational approach.  Surely it is manifest that you cannot ask the domestic consumer in this country to continue paying a price for fish, designed to create an equitable price structure for boat-owning fishermen in the Gaeltacht, if every wealthy fishmonger in Dublin and Cork, every fish retailer and wholesaler, can be allowed to import fish freely?  Is it conceivably possible that Dáil Éireann is going to wipe out the property-owning fishermen <Col N="1081" /> of this country?  I find that hard to believe; but I do assure you that, if this Bill passes in its present form, you are following the principle of the Undeveloped Areas legislation, and you are abandoning as hopeless the fishermen of the West of Ireland, the fishermen of Kerry, Galway, Mayo, Donegal and indeed of North County Dublin, Wexford and Waterford.</P>
    <P>As property-owning fishermen, they will disappear.  They may become the servants of trawler-owning companies and be offered wages for going to sea as trawlermen.  God deliver them from such a fate as that.  I would not want to see my worst enemy employed as a deckhand in an ocean-going trawler. It is about the most degraded form of human occupation that it is conceivable for any man to imagine.  I would much sooner see my neighbour go and do penal servitude than go as a deckhand in a deep sea trawler.  Any Deputy who has any familiarity with that kind of trade will agree with me.  &ldquo;I am informed,&rdquo; says the Minister &ldquo;by the wholesalers and retailers that they could sell more fish.&rdquo;  Is it not a very significant thing that when the Minister gives us that certificate, he does not go on to say:&mdash;&ldquo;and it is confirmed by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>It was the fishmongers. They staged a considerable campaign against me, ably supported, as usual, by Deputy P.J. Burke and Deputy Childers, as he then was.  The Deputies wept oceans of crocodile tears for the poor fishmongers who were so badly treated.  Now the fishmongers have them by the hasp; they have them on the run.  I want to ask the members of the Fianna Fáil Party: do they want the property-owning fishermen of this country to continue enjoying a monopoly of the Irish fish market or not?  That is a simple question.  I do. This Party does.  We justify the present price structure on the ground that it is designed for a monopoly of the domestic fish market by the boat-owning fishing community of the Gaeltacht, Waterford and North Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do we want to put an end to that? I say this Bill is the first step to putting <Col N="1083" /> an end to that.  I am certain it is wrong, but the greatest evil of it is that, if this is once done, no subsequent Minister can put it right.  It was extremely difficult to rebuild the fishing fleets of our west coast.  Immense sums of money were spent reequipping our fishermen and putting them to sea with tackle and boats suited to modern conditions.  If that work is put in jeopardy now, no subsequent exertions by any Minister can repair the damage that will have been done.  It is a source of amazement that any Minister for Fisheries could come here with these proposals.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies know what the Minister said in his opening statement?  &ldquo;Some growing pains may be unavoidable.&rdquo; That is the modern version of the aphorism that you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.  Is that a fair description?  That is a lovely doctrine as long as you are not the egg.  But I warn the House that all the eggs that will be broken for this omelette will be broken along the sea shores of this country, and once broken, they will never come together again.  The tragedy is that only those Deputies who come from these areas realise the magnitude of the catastrophe this will be, if it is allowed to go through.  A whole way of life will be wiped out.  I believe it will be wiped out in the sacred cause of efficiency.</P>
    <P>Let us have no ambiguity about this. You can get a much higher degree of automation and efficiency in the fish trade here by implementing this Bill. Let there be no doubt about it.  I have told this House before, and I want to do so again, that I was approached from a variety of sources when I was Minister for Fisheries to authorise the establishment here of trawler companies who were prepared to set up large industrial concerns to operate trawlers from our territory.  I turned them down with the full approval of the Irish Government, on the ground that it was our policy to preserve the domestic fish market for our own fishermen.  I am a convinced free trader all my life, but I never looked on this as an economic problem.  I looked upon it almost entirely as a <Col N="1084" /> social problem, in which we find ourselves in the dilemma that if you apply the full rule of economics to this, you wipe out a whole way of life in the certain knowledge that you have no conceivable substitute to offer to the families whose way of life is gone, except emigration.  You wipe out the whole industry of boat building.  I wish to God the Taoiseach had been here sooner, because this is something so horrifying that even his automated mind would blanch at the prospect of what his passion for industrial efficiency can do.</P>
    <P>Not only will you wipe out the fishermen, but you will wipe out the boat building industry.  Not only does this industry provide remunerative employment for the fellows working in it but it provides them with an industrial training which enables those of them desiring it to go abroad into very highly paid work in the ship-yards of Great Britain and America.  It is astonishing the number of young fellows who got their training in Fanny's Bay&mdash;a small, little boatyard with a capacity of two boats in a remote part of north-west Donegal&mdash; and who walked into highly paid work in Devonport and Portsmounth when the notion took them to go abroad. To wipe all that out, without the slightest possibility of having any alternative employment for these people, is to me reckless and iniquitous folly.</P>
    <P>I do not like to charge any man with bad faith but I think the Minister is being disingenuous to the point of deceiving the House when he refers to the question of the herring shoals. Most of the Deputies know nothing about the pelagic fish question, but the few of us who are interested in this and turn our minds to it know perfectly well that at the moment the whole world is agog by the fact that the pelagic fish seem to have disappeared from the North Sea and contemporaneously they have appeared off certain points of our coast where they have not been seen for generations. Even the least informed Deputy here is aware that the pelagic fish have arrived off the Wexford coast but the fact is that they have also arrived off <Col N="1085" /> the Donegal coast.  It is something for which we have every reason to be grateful.  I set up a fishmeal factory at Killybegs to deal with the surplus landings of herrings.  When I started to build that factory, the problem was that we were throwing the herrings back into the sea because we could not sell them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. This Bill is required to give effect to the decision, which I have already announced to the Dáil, to set up a new Government Department, the Department of Transport and Power.  Since the announcement was made, there have been a number of Press comments on the proposal which were, I think, generally favourable.  Similarly, observations made by organisations interested in particular aspects of transport suggest that the proposal to set up a separate Department of this kind has found fairly general approval. The Bill is in the form which was used previously when the Department of Social Welfare was created.  The functions to be transferred to the new Department will be set out in a Government Order which may be amended from time to time.  The immediate intention is to transfer to the new Department the following services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Marine Services&rdquo;, there is shipping policy and development; the administration of various Acts dealing with merchant shipping, marine survey services, coast life-saving services, the control of the foreshore, and Irish Shipping Ltd. Under the heading &ldquo;Harbours&rdquo;, there is the administration of the Harbours Act, and general control of harbour authorities, the administration of grants for harbour improvement works, and the Pilotage Acts.  Under the heading &ldquo;Inland Transport&rdquo;, there is transport policy generally, the administration of the Acts dealing with all forms of internal transport by road, rail and canal, and C.I.E.  Under the heading <Col N="1086" />&ldquo;Civil Aviation&rdquo;, there is civil aviation policy and development, administration of the Air Navigation Acts and the Customs-Free Airport Act, and other Acts dealing with air traffic control and telecommunication services, meteorological services, construction and maintenance of airports and management of Shannon Airport. Under the heading &ldquo;Power,&rdquo; all matters relating to the procurement and distribution of all types of solid fuel, oil and petrol, the Gas Acts, the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The new Department will take over the staffs of the Department of Industry and Commerce now dealing with these matters.  As those staffs are in self-contained divisions in that Department, no serious problem arises in that connection and no additional staff will be required.  The need for a new Department responsible for these functions has been seen and was, indeed, urged on many occasions for years past.  I am satisfied from my personal experience in that Department that the administration of government will be improved by its creation.</P>
    <P>It may be that at some future time when activities in regard to these matters have diminished, it may be possible to have the new Department under the charge of a member of the Government who is also in charge of some other Department, but I do not think that is likely to arise for some considerable time, as a number of major policy matters will require attention in the period immediately ahead of us.  Indeed, as a general rule, I would regard it as undesirable to have one Minister in charge of two Departments.</P>
    <P>The Bill will involve some changes in the Government which I hope to announce before the Adjournment.  It is clear that the situation that now exists is one that should be resolved quickly.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is aware of the intention to establish this new Department and, consequently, has been occupying himself mainly with the functions of the Department which will be permanently his.  There are a number of matters which should be coming forward for consideration now from the transport <Col N="1087" /> section of the Department of Industry and Commerce, which will be the concern of the new Department, on which I hope to see progress made during the Summer recess.  I, therefore, ask the co-operation of the Dáil in securing the enactment of this Bill before the Recess, so that the necessary Governmental arrangements may be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, as the Taoiseach has said, that a case can be made for the segregation of certain portions of the work of the Department of Industry and Commerce into divisions.  The real issue is whether or not this is the appropriate time, and whether the manner in which the Taoiseach has decided to do it is the appropriate way of achieving his purpose.</P>
      <P>Everyone will agree that the Department of Industry and Commerce is too big, but I do not know, when a change of this kind involving the creation of a new Ministry is taking place, whether it would not have been an appropriate time to have some sort of reorganisation of other Departments with a view to bringing into the new Ministry&mdash;if we decide to create it&mdash;some of the functions of other Departments analogous to it which would involve no increase in the existing number of Ministers.</P>
      <P>I gathered from what the Taoiseach has said that the really important functions which will be entrusted to the new Minister concern transport, aviation and power.  Other matters were referred to by him in his speech, such as marine services and harbours, but I think the amount of administrative work involved in those would certainly not justfy the creation of a Department so that matters concerning marine services, merchant shipping and harbours could really be dealt with by a small section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Therefore, I think I am correct in saying that the really essential functions which will be the concern of the new Minister are civil aviation, power and transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will not think I am being unduly critical when I say <Col N="1088" /> that in reference to these three headings their functions are really carried out by public boards or bodies of one kind or another.  In connection with civil aviation, we have Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.  I hold the view that the less interference there is with these bodies the better the affairs of these concerns are carried on.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in connection with power, the real problems of power are dealt with by the Electricity Supply Board. I know that the Department of Industry and Commerce has functions in relation to matters dealing with gas, but those functions are comparatively small and are, therefore, from that point of view, of minor importance, and merit only minor consideration.</P>
    <P>The real functions this new Ministry will have will be in dealing with electricity. I hold the view strongly that the original conception of the Electricity Supply Board should be as closely adhered to as possible.  The framers of that body, away back in 1927 when the Board was first established, had in mind that the Board would be almost independent of Government.  The object of the scheme was to enable the Board to act as a business concern; they were not to be hampered in the exercise of their functions by any of the controls or any of the vexatious interferences that invariably occur when a Government Department intervenes in the running of a business concern.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board has been an outstanding success.  The members of that Board have, to their credit, I think, carried on in the way that the original framers of the scheme intended that they should carry on. They have acted as a business concern would act.  Because they had that measure of independence, they have never come to be regarded in the way that a socialistic body in charge of electricity would be regarded.  They are a business concern.  They take the proper risks that a business concern would take in the handling of their day-to-day affairs and in dealing with the problems that arise from time to time.  I am convinced that Board would never have been the success it <Col N="1089" /> is had there been undue interference in their day-to-day activities by any Government Department.  I hope that the establishment of this new Ministry does not indicate any intention further to grasp authority, or power, or direction over the conduct of the affairs of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>The same remark applies in regard to the operations of Aer Lingus.  We are very proud of the record of achievement and the business capacity of Aer Lingus.  They have done a very good job in a very businesslike way. The less they are interfered with by Government, or Government Departments, the better it will be for civil aviation and the better it will be for the country ultimately.</P>
    <P>I cannot unfortunately say as much about Coras Iompair Eireann.  Different policies have been operated in regard to Coras Iompair Eireann, in regard to railway transport and public lorry transport and the problem of private transport by private lorries. Various policies have been implemented. The problems that subsist in relation to Coras Iompair Eireann are difficult problems.  Sometimes they have aroused acute controversy. Coras Iompair Eireann was set up by an Act of this House.  It is unfortunate, perhaps, that they are dependent upon grants from public moneys to enable them to carry on.  Even though all Parties would, I am sure, wish to see Coras Iompair Eireann independent of the taxpayers' money and a self-sufficient unit, that is more in the nature of a pious hope rather than an aspiration capable of achievement. Obviously the old axiom operates, as it operates so acutely in Government Departments themselves: the person who gives the money wants to control the expenditure of the money.  There is, therefore, a closer connection with, and a more complete control of, Coras Iompair Eireann&mdash; more interference, if you like&mdash;than there is in relation to the Electricity Supply Board and Aer Lingus.  The aim ought to be to let Coras Iompair Eireann act on its own as a business concern and do their work, if possible, in the way in which a business should be run, without interference from Government officials.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> When we were in office, I got the impression that there were far too many files.  One file inevitably leads to the generation of another file and that, in turn, gives birth to still more files, with a consequential waste of time and paper on the part of a firm which should be operating as a business concern.</P>
    <P>If it is the intention that there will be little, or no, interference on the part of the Government or Government Departments with either Aer Lingus or the Electricity Supply Board, then the work of the new Ministry should be very light indeed. When dealing with transport, air, and power this might be the appropriate moment&mdash;possibly the Taoiseach has considered the matter&mdash;to consider other functions akin to these three, namely, the functions of the Post Office.  Would it be possible to amalgamate in this new Ministry the functions of the Post Office and the functions of Industry and Commerce which are analogous to the new Ministry, and have only one Minister for the two?</P>
    <P>That would leave the problem of Radio Éireann, and possibly television. I have always held the view&mdash;whether it is right or not, I do not know; it is a personal view&mdash;that Radio Éireann is in alien surroundings in the Post Office and that the Post Office is not really the proper venue for it at all.  We hoped at one time to prise loose Radio Éireann from the control that exists in the Post Office and from the rather peculiar set-up that exists at the moment; you have, under statute, a body which was supposed to be set up to give advice in connection with Radio Éireann; that body is ignored and a new non-statutory body is set up which is supposed to be the inspiring genius of Radio Éireann.  Radio Éireann should be prised loose and should be allowed to operate on its own.  That may furnish a headline for television if it is set up here.</P>
    <P>Every Government with which I have had anything to do since 1922, including my own, all laid down the principle that the Post Office should be run as a business and should pay its <Col N="1091" /> way.  If that is so, surely having it under the control of a Minister is not the proper way to run it.  Some arrangement should be made by which certain functions of the Post Office&mdash; telephones, telegrams and so forth&mdash; would be integrated under an independent body on the lines of the Electricity Supply Board with the same relationship between it and the Government as exists between the Electricity Supply Board and the Government.</P>
    <P>When the Gaeltacht Ministry was established we were severely criticised by the Taoiseach and his friends in Opposition here.  They took the view that anything our Government did was bound to be wrong.  It is, of course, the duty of an Opposition to oppose and say all the nasty things they can. But the Gaeltacht Ministry was established and the only directions I gave in so far as I could give directions&mdash;I did not have long enough to see they were put into effect&mdash;was that there were to be no files in the Department of the Gaeltacht.  I am sorry to say that that direction has not been carried out.  It is impossible to have a Government Department without files and without a multitude of files.  If the Gaeltacht Department was to do anything either for the language or for the economics of the Gaeltacht, with which I was primarily concerned in connection with that Ministry, the less writing you had about it the better, and the more files you had the greater evidence there was that the Department was not doing its job, which should be down in the Gaeltacht looking after the economic and cultural interests of the people in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that it is impossible for any human person, be he Minister, Taoiseach or anybody else, to prevent the growth of files in a Government Department.  I have come to that conclusion although I did what I could, while I was in a position of authority, in connection with the Gaeltacht Ministry, to see that there were no files.  But, files there will be and work there will be created in a Government Department.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach has read the new economic theory of the <Col N="1092" /> application of Parkinson's Law to Government Departments.  When I was speaking on the appointment of the new Government when he became Taoiseach, I referred to that law.  When I was speaking, the actual name applied to it eluded me for the moment.  I thought of it, too late, when I sat down.  It is Parkinson's Law.  That means that once you set up even one or two people they create, generate, regenerate and recreate officials and work for themselves to do.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did say that there was no necessity for additional staffs. The Taoiseach has been a long time connected with the affairs of Government and Government Departments and I am sure that he will have had the same experience as we had that, no matter how you bent your energies or how sincere your desires and resolution to prevent staff from growing and to cut down the number of staff and to utilise staff that appeared to be supernumerary or surplus, you could not do it and, no matter what you do in connection with this new Department, I am afraid it will create work for itself in order to justify itself and that there will be very much more staff than the Taoiseach anticipates.  I am sure he genuinely anticipates, and sincerely thinks, that there will be no additional staff.  No matter what he does and no matter what any of us does, staff will grow and there will be additional expense.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach did say when he was introducing this measure that, on the whole, the Press comments were favourable but I think that explicit and, certainly, implicit in all those comments was the solemn warning: &ldquo;There is to be no more expense in connection with this Department.&rdquo;  I know perfectly well that the Taoiseach may try to have no more expense but we shall have to face it that, once you set up a new Department of this kind, it will cost money. I agree entirely with what the Taoiseach has said, that it is undesirable for one Minister to be in charge of two Departments.  It would be better to amalgamate Departments and put under the charge of Departments <Col N="1093" /> analogous functions rather than to have one Minister in charge of two Departments.  There will be less work, less impetus to create new work in order to justify existing officials in their jobs.</P>
    <P>These are the only comments that I wish to offer on the proposal.  I think that it might be, as I say, a desirable opportunity for the Taoiseach to consider some of the matters I have mentioned, to bring some other functions into this and, above all, to make it as a clear declaration of policy, for which he will get from this side of the House and, certainly from me, full support, that there should be no interference with boards of such a character as the Electricity Supply Board and Aer Lingus, who are doing a business job, doing it efficiently and doing it very well.  The less writing there is between the Department of Industry and Commerce or the new Department and them, the better it is for both the Department of Industry and Commerce or the new Department and the boards in question and the more efficiently the work will be done and the better the nation will be served.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a case can be made for dividing the Department of Industry and Commerce into two Departments because it is quite clear to anybody who has practical experience of the work of the Department that it is altogether too big for one Minister. The effect of that is that the Minister is crowded from morning to night, not merely with files which originate in sections of his Department, but with files which come in from the various State-sponsored bodies for which he is also the Minister and for which he has a responsibility and whose footsteps he must guide from time to time, when requested by these State-sponsored bodies.  Therefore, a division of the Department into two sections is warranted. In fact, when I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce, that was my view and I mentioned that at times to my colleagues in the Government.  Of course, if we had suggested at that time creating a new Department and appointing a new Minister, there would not be enough <Col N="1094" /> church gates in the country to accommodate all the meetings that Fianna Fáil would arrange in order to denounce us and to prove conclusively, to their own satisfaction, that this was not a scheme to make for better administration or greater efficiency but was for the purpose of planting some pal in a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And &ldquo;Pravda&rdquo; would have come out with black tapes all around it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You all know the hullabaloo that was kicked up when we appointed a Parliamentary Secretary to the Gaeltacht.  Fianna Fáil denounced the setting up of the Department and that kind of thing.  Then, to show their versatility and mercurial properties, when they came into office they appointed a Minister.  But, if we had suggested the creation of two Departments out of the Department of Industry and Commerce we would have been denounced hook, line and sinker on the grounds that it had no better basis and no higher motive than to find a job for a pal.  I hope the Taoiseach recognises the entirely different atmosphere in which his proposal is being received today.  It is being received with understanding, with appreciation of the situation.  Nobody is trying to make political capital out of it.  Intelligence, understanding and tolerance are being brought to bear on the problem and it is being recognised by those with experience that this is the right thing to do in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience of the Department of Industry and Commerce was, as I said, that it was an extremely large Department for one Minister.  At that time, of course, there was effective price control in operation.  Price control and all the ramifications of price control necessarily meant that a whole lot of matters relating to prices of commodities, reports from the Prices Advisory Board, the making of price Orders, and cognate matters required attention, not merely from day to day, but some days from hour to hour.  That situation, of course, has been relieved by the virtual abolition of all price control by the Government and, therefore, <Col N="1095" /> that side of Industry and Commerce does not impact as heavily now on a Minister as it did when price control was really effective.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as part of the organisation of the Department, is obliged to hold two sessions with his officials each week.  These are sessions in which a number of items varying from 20 to 40, appear on an agenda and these are matters which require urgent decisions so that the work of the Department can be kept flowing smoothly and efficiently.  Aside from these two sessions, which can be heavy, complex and diversified in character, the Minister always has before him endless files on a whole variety of things that happen throughout the Department, which also have to be dealt with.  That is an impossible burden and, in the long run, it cannot be efficient because, if a Minister is beset with a complexity of matters with which it is not physically possible to deal, no matter how nimble-minded he may be, some things cannot get all the attention and consideration that is necessary and there is not sufficient time for thinking out what is to be the objective in certain directions in future.  Therefore, I think on these grounds a case can be made for the splitting of the existing Department into two separate Departments.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this new Department of Transport and Power will be a very onerous one for whoever becomes the Minister.  Some of these new activities which it is proposed to assign to the new Department are in fact at present under the control of certain independent boards. To the extent that a very substantial amount of development has taken place in the field covered by these boards, that development work has not to come back to the Minister and his view ascertained on these proposals from time to time.</P>
    <P>If we take three of these State-sponsored bodies, we find they are excellent examples of different enterprises. Irish Shipping is a first-class enterprise.  It has provided us with a substantial portion of a mercantile <Col N="1096" /> marine.  It does not yet supply the full requirements of the nation from the point of view of its shipping necessities but a very substantial fleet has nevertheless been built up.  It is a modern fleet with very well-equipped ships.  One might say that Irish Shipping is sailing in calm waters at present.  It has probably ridden out the worst part of the freight war and the skies seem to be set fair for another few years in that field.  Irish Shipping, therefore, ought not to take up very considerable time of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I agree that the question of harbours may take up quite some time.  Certainly it takes up a considerable time of the officers in the Department.  Every harbour board in the country wants an annual grant to deepen the harbour, to remove the silt, to divert the tide, to change the North Sea, to get the Gulf Stream to wash the sand and stones away from the foreshore.  Annually, you are presented with demands from all kinds of harbours throughout our country. The biggest task in that connection for the Minister is the task of refusing applications for grants because he gets applications for grants which are about twenty times more than he can ever contemplate and sometimes even fifty times more.</P>
    <P>Certain harbour authorities regard themselves as not doing their duty unless, annually, they look for a very substantial grant for the harbour as if it were the only one in the country. However, the decisions are not such as call for protracted cogitation by the Minister because the Minister for Finance usually decides how much money is available for that purpose.  A short calculation is sufficient to enable him to know how much is left for all the insistent pilgrims who come to the Department of Industry and Commerce from time to time looking for harbour grants.</P>
    <P>In the field of aviation, I think Aer Lingus is an excellent example of private enterprise pioneered in that field very successfully.  Its accounts of its activities are creditable not merely in the operation of the air services but also in the financial results which <Col N="1097" /> the company, in spite of considerable difficulties, have been able to attain. There again, I think Aer Lingus, on the whole, should not trouble any new Minister very often particularly if satisfactory and non-disputative relations can be worked out between Aer Lingus and the Department.  I shall come to that matter again.</P>
    <P>In the field of power, which one would assume to be the generation of electricity and the procurement of turf, oil and coal for the operation of power plants, again I think the E.S.B. has now virtually reached the full stature of manhood.  It seems to be near the end of what can be contemplated in the form of hydro-electric schemes.  It looks as if, with the capacity at present installed and the additional capacity which may be utilised and which is now being brought into commission or will be brought in within the next few years, our power-generating plant will be adequate for our requirements at least until the country is much more industrialised than it is or until our population substantially increases.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if you take shipping, aviation, power, you find that these three activities are catered for by three pretty good boards where the financial position does not occasion any great headaches for the Minister and where from time to time probably the greatest demand they may make on the Minister is to apprise him of what they propose to do and perhaps to ensure that the requisite capital for the further expansion of their activities will be made available or in some way guaranteed by the Government.</P>
    <P>Transport is probably the problem child of that family of four.  The financial results of C.I.E. which, in the last financial return so far as I can recollect, totalled a loss of approximately £2,000,000, will be a headache for the Minister as problems arising there may necessitate more attention by the new Minister than any problems likely to arise from the three other boards or semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I should like to re-echo in perhaps a somewhat different way a suggestion made by Deputy Costello.  Some <Col N="1098" /> people have a passion for writing and for creating files.  They think they are leaving something of really great value to the world the moment they get the first sheet of foolscap, the cover in which to encase it, and start the file.  Some of them take an inordinate pride in what they are bestowing on humanity the moment they put the first endorsement on the file.</P>
    <P>It was an experience of mine that very frequently you got long letters, longer endorsements, cross-references, flagged files sent from a State Department into the Department of Industry and Commerce.  They involved endless reading and all kinds of searching in order to get the appropriate references.  One would imagine that the Department of Industry and Commerce was in Siam and that the State-sponsored body was at the other end of the world.  It often seemed to me rather a stupid method of conducting business.  It would be far better if you had some liaison officers in a State-sponsored body with appropriate people in the same section of the Department of Industry and Commerce so that, when anything was wanted, they could phone and say: &ldquo;We want a conference on such and such a matter.&rdquo;  They could meet, express their views, distil their different points of view and, arising out of that, some kind of memorandum might be made on which it would be possible to take decisions.</P>
    <P>I have seen files passing from State-sponsored bodies into the Department, out again, back again, until you almost got lonely if the circulation of these files stopped.  It should be possible to cut down a good deal on that work. I do not want to mention the name here but I know in my time there were rather testy relations between one State-sponsored body and the Department. You heard the Department's view about the State-sponsored body and that was eliminated from your mind if you asked the State-sponsored body what was their experience with the Department.  All these people are working in the public service where that attitude should be <Col N="1099" /> anathema.  Their function is to serve the people as best they can.</P>
    <P>I discovered there was quite a rivalry between the Department, on the one hand, and this State-sponsored body, on the other hand, as to who would write the most &ldquo;narky&rdquo; minute and what was the best reply to make to the last saucy minute that either came in from the State-sponsored body or went out from the Department.  I tried, I think with success, to eradicate that attitude and that atmosphere.  I sewed up an arrangement by which the State-sporsored body would come to the Department whenever it had suggestions to make and put these orally and in a cordial atmosphere, and whenever the Department wanted information from this body they would phone somebody to come over and discuss the matter and get the information without the dozens of drafts which had to be made until finally a picturesque document was produced to indicate what the body or what the Department wanted.</P>
    <P>A great saving of time and money could be effected if people were to stop the writing process and meet to discuss matters in a way in which they were striving or appeared to be striving to get the best possible results.  The Taoiseach might very well give some consideration to that method of doing business not merely in the Department of Industry and Commerce but in other Departments as well.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is appropriate to raise a specific matter on this Bill but I shall not spend long on it, that is, the relationship between, for example, the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna.  One of these bodies is producing turf for use very largely by the other.  It is also producing some turf for sale.  I reveal no secret if I say there was quite an amount of rivalry between these bodies on a number of heads.  There was quite a contest as to whether you could produce electricity cheaper with turf, with coal or with oil and many disputations revolved around that simple question.  The Minister could give some consideration to the possibility of merging the E.S.B., which is the generating authority, with Bord na Móna, which is the fuel-producing <Col N="1100" /> authority, and in that way try to marry the activities of these two bodies.</P>
    <P>If we had started at the one time to produce electricity through the medium of the State-subsidised body and at the same time to produce turf, we would probably have created the one body to do both, but because the E.S.B. was created long before Bord na Móna, and because a job had to be done at a time when the E.S.B. was probably fully taxed with other activities, we created a separate body known as Bord na Móna.  However, the Board's activities in the future will be connected with the production of fuel for the E.S.B. and it seems to me that the operation of marrying these two activities could well be undertaken.  It would lead to substantial saving in many directions and, while I do not offer a blueprint for the amalgamation scheme or the merger scheme, it is a matter that ought to be considered by the Government.  It is a mistake to allow these two bodies to run along parallel lines when efficiency could be improved and expenditure probably reduced by a marriage of Bord na Móna with the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I welcome the Bill.  If there is a case for any further consideration on the matter it is as to whether there are not more activities that could be taken from the residue of the Department of Industry and Commerce which will be left when these sections are transferred to the Department of Transport and Power. The Department of Industry and Commerce will still be the heavy side of this undertaking.  It might be possible to put in some smaller and ancillary activities into the new Department of Transport and Power so as to give the Ministry for Industry and Commerce, which is esentially the industrial thinking-box of the country, more time to concentrate on problems which arise on the industrial front, the solution of which is much more urgent and much more deep-rooted from the point of view of the evolution of a national development policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome in principle the idea of setting up a separate <Col N="1101" /> Ministry to take over some of the responsibilities of the Department of Industry and Commerce but, like Deputy Costello, I feel it would have been much better to marry this new Department with one of the existing Departments.  I would have favoured the setting up of a Department dealing with transport and communications which are more closely associated than transport and power.  By &ldquo;communications&rdquo; I mean Posts and Telegraphs and all that goes with it.  Without casting reflections on any Minister, that Department is not one in which the Minister is overworked; there is a very efficient staff and the Department can almost run itself.  I would have left the control of power with Industry and Commerce which to my mind is much more closely associated with manufacturing industry and commerce than it would be with transport or communications. As has been pointed out by Deputy Costello and Deputy Norton power and fuel are almost entirely catered for by the semi-State bodies, the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna.  Apart from that, the only power or light produced is produced by the gas works, owned either by private enterprise or owned and managed by the different gas works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the different sections which the Minister read out in introducing this Bill, it struck me that with the exception of power, everything could be covered by the description &ldquo;Transport&rdquo;, that is the marine service, harbours, inland transport and civil aviation.  Each of these sections is largely catered for by some statutory body: the marine service by Irish Shipping industries; the harbours, of course, have no statutory body or semi-State body but the Minister has the appointment of nominees to the various harbour boards, and the various harbour boards are completely dependent on him and through him on the Minister for Finance for the necessary grants to carry out the type of development referred to by Deputy Norton.  In general these harbour boards work efficiently and work very well with the Minister.  The public have only a limited say through their representatives.  There is a very wide form of representation and I think it is <Col N="1102" /> the type of body that might be utilised for other interests.</P>
    <P>In regard to transport, there is C.I.E. If for no other reason, it would be worthwhile setting up a separate Ministery to cater for C.I.E.  As a matter of fact, I recall making this suggestion last year when the Minister's Estimate was under consideration by the Dáil.  Similarly, in regard to civil aviation, you have Aer Lingus, Aer Línte and Aer Rianta and now more recently the Shannon Airport Development Company.  I think it could be said that, apart from the one item of power, all the other sections could be covered by the description &ldquo;transport&rdquo;. I feel that transport and communications are closely associated and could be more effectively amalgamated. In wishing the new Department every success, I hope it will be an efficient Department and that it will not, as the Taoiseach hopes, mean any increase in our already very substantial army of civil servants.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the relationship between the statutory bodies, the Dáil and the people.  I think Deputy Costello was anxious that these statutory bodies, particularly the E.S.B., should operate with complete freedom of action and with complete freedom to decide their own policy. As a principle, I think that is very sound, but, unfortunately, this type of organisation, being a monopoly, of necessity, breeds a type of autocratic mind that does not seem to permit it to consider representations from small sections of our people.</P>
    <P>Certainly in my own constituency of Limerick, in regard to the question of electricity charges and the question of a fishery dispute near Limerick, we have found it absolutely impossible to make any impression whatever on the Electricity Supply Board.  I do not mention that in any tendentious spirit It is a fact that these statutory bodies, but not all of them, are generally very efficient.  The E.S.B. is certainly efficient but there does not appear to be any room for considering cases which may be of small moment to the directors of the Electricity Supply Board but which, to the section of the public concerned, are very important considerations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> The statutory bodies mentioned by the Taoiseach, when introducing this Bill, are all very efficient.  There is no doubt about that.  A tribute was paid to them by the two previous speakers. Not all statutory bodies are efficient.  I should like to see this new Department have some subsection which would be competent to carry out investigations into the efficiency of the running of statutory bodies where the Dáil required it.  I think we have sufficiently competent people in all Departments to set up a small section specifically charged with inquiring into the efficiency of any State body to see it is operating in the interest of the public. I think that is very necessary.</P>
    <P>I wish the new Minister, whoever he may be, every success in dealing with the transport problems which, I assume, will take up most of his time. Problems in regard to C.I.E., not, of course, due to its own fault but largely due to circumstances which have grown up in the past 20 to 25 years, are not easy of solution.  If the new Minister can master these problems and put C.I.E. on an efficient basis, that alone will justify the setting up of this Department.</P>
    <P>I hope that at an early date the new Minister will also bend his energies, his ability and the ability of his Department to the question of cross-channel shipping.  Again, that is a matter concerning transport which is of very vital interest to this country.  Having regard to the recently published report of the Tribunal set up to inquire into cross-channel freights, I hope the new Minister will not delay in giving this very vital matter his energetic attention.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will take his courage into his hands and appoint the best man to the position, whether he happens to be a remote backbencher of his own Party or one of the oldest members in the Dáil.  He has an opportunity now to appoint the right man and I hope he will avail of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>In the atmosphere prevailing in this debate, one thing is quite clear, that is, that all Deputies <Col N="1104" /> in both Fine Gael and Labour Parties and Deputy Russell, the Independent who has just spoken, as well as the Taoiseach, are anxious to see that the right thing is done and done more expeditiously.  I am quite satisfied that the reorganisation envisaged in the course of the Taoiseach's remarks when introducing this Bill, is not alone desirable but necessary.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied, however, in conjunction with the Leader of the Opposition, that a new Ministry is necessary because all the other things mentioned as coming under the heading of this new Department envisaged by the Bill could equally effectively be done by the present Ministry for Posts and Telegraphs, with the suitable divorcing of Radio Éireann and kindred activities from it. For that reason, I believe that this is a Bill which should not be rushed.  By that, I do not mean that I offer any opposition to its passing, but if it is to be done well and if the reorganisation contained in it is to be effectively carried out, it must be done thoughtfully and given due consideration.</P>
      <P>It is on that basis that we offer the fullest co-operation in this matter.  As has been said already, when the new departure is shorn of the State bodies that are already operating efficiently, there is very little else to be done by a new Minister except keep a watchful eye on policy and an equally watchful eye on expenditure.  I think the machinery is there already providing him with both those opportunities at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot help feeling that a departure such as this is one that could well be fraught with dangers.  At one time, we had a Department of Local Government and Public Health.  Now we have Local Government by itself and the Department of Public Health has become the Department of Health. I do not know that the results in that regard can be accepted by the Government, the Opposition or the public at large as satisfactory.  The position of a Minister strengthened by his Government is such as to make for strained relations, and even more strained relations with the people with whom he <Col N="1105" /> has contact and with the organisations over which he exercises some degree of control.</P>
    <P>It is on that basis that I would approach the formation of this special Ministry for Transport and Power with some feelings of apprehension.  Could it be that this new Ministry might be one for the furtherance of State enterprise? The Minister will have very little to do and may well occupy his time by looking around to see where he might profitably&mdash;to the Government in power or to his Party&mdash;take an interest in either the promotion of existing semi-State enterprises or the creation of new ones.  In that regard then, it might well be feared that this might be a furtherance of State enterprise and an inroad upon the private sector of our industrial business community.  Above all things that should be avoided.</P>
    <P>With that exception, I see no objection to the reorganisation envisaged but I think the Taoiseach would do well to reconsider this matter of having the Ministry in this particular stereotyped fashion as set out in the Bill. Again, there is that other aspect outlined by the Taoiseach when he says that apart from the functions which he specifies there may be, from time to time, other functions assigned to the particular Minister in charge of this Department by Government Order.  I should like some clarification upon that and if the Taoiseach has anything in mind in that regard he should tell the House and I am sure he will.</P>
    <P>If this reorganisation is to be effective I think it can be effective only on the lines of the words of the Taoiseach himself, that no additional staff will be required and consequently no additional money.  While the suggestion of having transport and power controlled&mdash;having regard to the already unwieldy nature of the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;has been favourably received in the Press on the whole, nevertheless, there has been the adverse comment that this departure is in direct contradiction to the promise of the Minister for Finance when, on the occasion of the 1957 Budget, I think it was, he said, that State expenditure <Col N="1106" /> would be cut down.  There has been, of course, some comment both in the metropolitan Press, and in some of the provincial newspapers particularly, warning the Taoiseach.  I think the headline in the <i>Kerryman</i> last week was &ldquo;Not One Penny More, Mr. Lemass&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If expenditure were necessary I would be the last to oppose such expenditure.  I well recall the time shortly after I was appointed Minister to the Department for the Gaeltacht and I am happy to say that the present Taoiseach at that time objected only in principle to the proposal.  If we were to seek an opportunity of opposing this Ministry now on the same basis I do not imagine that we would have either the men or the motives to carry out the same kind of campaign. Shortly after taking over that Ministry I remember being subjected to all kinds of questions in this House as to what it cost.  The cost of it caused a great deal of trouble to certain western Deputies and it even came as far as Deputy Brady of Dunlaoghaire-Rathdown on one occasion. It was also used with great vigour in by-elections.  I can promise, for my own part, that in the remaining week-ends before the three by-elections I shall make no use of the present proposal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal for reorganisation and I exhort the Taoiseach to consider the points made, not with a view to creating new Ministries but with the view to handing over these relatively small matters, which have been operated efficiently by boards, to an existing Minister. Finally, also, in his reply I would ask the Taoiseach to relieve my mind, and possibly the minds of certain members of the public, on the question as to whether this is not a furtherance of State enterprise and an inroad of the private sector with disastrous results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am struck by the fact that the Taoiseach is <i>au fait</i> with the reformed character which he gave himself in his inaugural speech and which has had such a striking effect on the proceedings here today.  The first point I want to make is this.  It is very proper that Parliament should <Col N="1107" /> keep a vigilant eye on expenditure but there is one aspect of the expense which I think should be, and could be with advantage, brought before the public. Take the case of the Taoiseach.  When he was returned to office as a Minister &mdash;I am leaving out his role of Tánaiste &mdash;he took over responsibility for a very large Department of State.  He had earned, by his prior service as a Minister, as part of his remuneration, £500 a year.  He received, as a result of his election to this House, a Parliamentary allowance of £600 a year.  He was then appointed Minister for Industry and Commerce whereupon he gave up the £500 and gave up the £600.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce he had £2,100 a year which, according to my reckoning, represents an additional salary for the responsibility of Minister for Industry and Commerce of £1,000 a year.  That was substantially less than his Private Secretary and I think is substantially less than a civil servant of the rank of Junior Executive Officer in his own Department.</P>
      <P>While it is wise to keep a close eye on extravagant expenditure, I think some steps should be taken to communicate to the public that the Ministers who serve them, in whatever Government they belong, elect to accept additional remuneration of approximately £1,000 per annum for the work they do as Ministers, not to speak of the expenses which accrue to them as a result of holding Ministerial rank. I am all in favour of economy and so forth but I think it an unhealthy thing for any free democracy to remunerate its servants on a basis which is, by any criterion, grotesque.  To say that a man who accepted responsibility for the Department of Industry and Commerce, as at present constituted, is adequately remunerated by giving £1,000 over and above what he already had, is fantastic and the sooner we wake up to that fact the better it will be for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking now about creating a new Ministry, a new <Col N="1108" /> Department.  I am not going to argue that case, but I do not think anybody would agree that anyone who accepts the responsibility of administering a Department of Industry and Commerce should have a sum substantially less than that paid to a junior executive officer, bearing in mind that in the hierarchy of the Civil Service, there are over him Higher Executives, Assistant Principals, Principals, Assistant Secretaries, Department Secretaries, and Secretaries.  I think it might be said with truth that the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce gets four times as much as the Minister, on the basis of my calculations.  That is obviously an anomalous and absurd situation which some day will have to be faced.</P>
      <P>I have said that much because I think it is a public duty to say that, though most people consider it very indiscreet to say it.  How well I remember the glorious days when the present Taoiseach used to be saying &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to the President when he was laying down the doctrine that nobody in this country should be worth more than £1,000 a year.</P>

However, we shall abstain, but I cannot help recalling the happy days when none of us was worth £1,000 a year.  Mind you, we taught them plenty but it has taken blood, sweat, and tears to teach them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make an observation on another aspect of this Bill.  This new Minister is going to accept responsibility, broadly, for State bodies and, as the Taoiseach has said on other occasions, and the Minister for Finance, it has tested the ingenuity of everybody to establish a satisfactory system of control by Parliament over <Col N="1109" /> State bodies, which does not so circumscribe the State body as to make its functioning inefficient, and I admit that both Governments of which I was a member were confronted with this problem.  I recall that the British House of Commons was bedevilled by that problem for years and nobody, so far, has come up with a satisfactory solution of it.  I want to repeat what I said in another context here today. There is one interim suggestion I want to make to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Take bodies like Irish Shipping, Bord na Móna, Aer Lingus, Aer Linte and various other trading bodies&mdash; Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and the like.  In at least some of these bodies, the auditor appointed is the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I think the same is true of the Dairy Disposal Board; the auditor there is the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I have personal knowledge of the problems involved.  As a Minister, I had experience of the inadequacies of that arrangement but they struck me with particular force as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee when we were charged with the responsibility of reviewing the accounts of another trading body of an analogous character.  When we applied to the Comptroller and Auditor General for certain kinds of information, such as a shareholder might legitimately ask for at a general meeting, he was not in a position to give it and, when we came to look into the problem, of course it became quite manifest that the Comptroller and Auditor General's staff are not trained to conduct commercial audits.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is rather a good point.  It certainly is no solution to appoint a Minister to deal with these semi-State bodies if the essential information requisite effectively to keep himself informed as to their progress is not available.  I heard Deputy Norton speak today of the gratifying affluence of Irish Shipping, of Aer Lingus, and of Bord na Móna.  I defy anybody to tell me what is the financial position of any of these bodies.  I do not think the annual returns they make are calculated to provide the public with any comprehensive information at all, and I think the reason is that, in many cases, the accounting procedures adopted are not in character calculated fully to inform those who are concerned to find out the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to make any point about Irish Shipping at the present time but I think Irish Shipping, in common with every other shipping company in the world, great and small, are experiencing extremely difficult, thin times at present.  Indeed, their own Chairman, speaking recently at their general meeting, pointed out that that was true but when you come to study the accounts, you could legitimately complain that a number of items of information that would ordinarily be available in the accounts of purely mercantile shipping lines were not made manifest.  I think the <Col N="1111" /> same complaint could be made in regard to a variety of other enterprises which are State, or semi-State bodies, and what I want to be certain of is this: if we are to have a Minister primarily responsible for these, one of his first duties should be to ensure that effective accounts are rendered regularly to Dáil Éireann which will be calculated to inform Dáil Éireann what the facts are.  At the moment I am not prepared to suggest an appropriate procedure by Dáil Éireann to comment on these accounts when we get them, but I do clearly postulate that one of the functions of a Minister charged with a responsibility of that kind is to ensure we get properly certified accounts for our information.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take any advantage of you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I had a slight difference with the Ceann Comhairle about the Comptroller and Auditor-General, but I make the case to the Taoiseach that such a new Ministry should be served by commercial auditors rather than the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I want to make.  Deputy Russell spoke about the difficulty of bringing home to a large State monopoly the grievances of individuals, and I think suggested that what may be a very material grievance to a citizen is so microscopic in the eyes of the big national monopoly that it is hard to get any action at all.  They are inclined to brush it aside as a matter of insignificance.  That is a difficulty which is not peculiar to this country.  It is, of course, a difficulty that has emerged as this general pattern of State monopoly has emerged. So far as I know, in Great Britain, they have been quite unable to do anything to control it; I believe some day they will, but Scandinavian countries have made an effort and I do not know whether their plan has been brought to the attention of the Taoiseach and if so, whether it would commend itself to him.  Where you have, in Scandinavian countries, and, I think, in Holland, a Ministry of this character, which is responsible for a number of semi-State bodies but which is at the same time <Col N="1112" /> excused from answering in Parliament for the detailed activities of these bodies, there is an individual person set up under the Constitution similar to the Comptroller and Auditor General. He has that kind of quasi-judicial tenure of office rendering him independent of Secretaries and of Ministers and any citizen who is aggrieved by the proceedings of any State company, as distinct from a Ministry or State Department, can report his grievance to this constitutional person who is authorised, if he is satisfied there is any <i>prima facie</i> case, to carry out, with the full powers of the Minister himself, an inquiry into the complaint.  He can either reject it as being quite unsustainable or require the body concerned to take remedial action.</P>
    <P>When I think of the magnitude of the correspondence that reaches Deputies from people who believe that they have grievances which require redress, without in the least desiring to disembarrass members of the Dáil of their obligation of looking into these things which, as most of us know, is often a very valuable opportunity of keeping in touch with our constituents, it often occurs to me that there is something to be said for the establishment of somebody in the character of the Scandinavian person to whom I have referred who would have a duty to receive complaints, and &mdash;what is much more important&mdash; who would have a right fully to investigate them.  Whether a plan on those lines could be extended to provide the means of adequately reviewing on behalf of the community the activities of these State bodies, I am not quite sure, but I feel the point raised by Deputy Russell, in which there is undoubtedly some substance, would be met by the creation of an office of that kind.</P>
    <P>At present, I think the circumstances are that if one of us is approached by a citizen who believes himself to have a genuine grievance and you go to the relevant authority, usually you get a fairly reasonable reception and your complaint is fully investigated, but it is not always easy to go back and tell your constituent <Col N="1113" /> that he is talking through his hat.  I am not altogether certain that all Deputies are prepared to declare to their constituents that they are converted to the side of the State body, having interviewed them.  I am afraid on occasions you take the letter you have received from the State body and send it to your constituent saying that you regret the reply is not more satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that this matter arises on this Bill.  The Deputy is discussing the administration of various Departments which does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I am discussing the administration of semi-State bodies and this is a Ministry for semi-State bodies.  Deputy Russell said earlier that he hoped the new Minister would be in a better position to grapple with complaints and difficulties arising out of the relations between semi-State bodies and individuals: I am merely making a helpful suggestion.  I do not think it is a bad one because I believe the Taoiseach will say that it is no part of his intention to invest the new Minister with the obligation of answering in Dáil Éireann all the queries constituents put to Deputies about the activities of Aer Lingus, Aer Linte, Irish Shipping Limited, Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann, etc., but if such new Ministry is created, I think it leaves unprovided for the problem mentioned by Deputy Russell which of course might be extensively elaborated.  The Scandinavian solution for it is, I think, at least worthy of consideration.</P>
      <P>I think the Department of Industry and Commerce have probably grown too large.  I feel that Deputy Norton, when he re-reads the tales he has told us out of school, will feel that in some particulars he has been a little frank. However, I am prepared to say that I agree with the general proposition that no matter how nimble the mind of any man may be, the scope and size of the Department today is unusually large and that it will make for greater efficiency to set up a new Ministry of Power and Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the suggestion made by Deputy Costello is eminently worthy of <Col N="1114" /> consideration&mdash;that this opportunity might be availed of to incorporate in the new Department the postal, telegraphic and telephonic services of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and to detach television and wireless into a corporation on the lines of the B.B.C.  That would probably result in the provision of a reasonable day's work for the Minister which I apprehend will not be available if we are to do no more than charge him with responsibility for semi-State bodies. At the same time, I think that in reviewing the number of Ministries, the Taoiseach should also consider amalgamating Health and Social Welfare. I know that, in practice, that is an existing fact, but I recall, and I think the Taoiseach will confirm it, that the Minister for Health himself made it known that when he accepted that Ministry on the formation of Mr. de Valera's previous Government, he accepted the Department of Health and, rather typically, announced that he accepted this rather minor office at his own request because he felt that his health would not permit of his accepting the burden for a more responsible Department.  Accepting that declaration at face value, harassed as he declared himself to be, he subsequently voluntarily undertook the additional burden of the Department of Social Welfare and under this dual impost he seems to be as fresh as a bee.  If he was as frail as he told us he was two and a half years ago and he is looking so well&mdash;as I hope he will continue to look so far many long years to come&mdash;under the dual burden of these two Departments, does that not suggest that the Taoiseach, in the event of reshuffling his Cabinet at a later date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to get rid of some of these.  I say that they can have this Bill if they get rid of some other Department.  Since the Taoiseach's frail colleague has since accepted responsibility for the Department of Social Welfare and for the office of Tánaiste, I say that we have here another occasion for an economy which might be effected.  I am not pressing the Taoiseach to do it here and now.  I think he might avail himself of the occasion, when concluding this debate, to announce his intention of adding this Ministry to his Government but reducing it by the abolition of Posts and Telegraphs and Social Welfare, for which he will find room on the stalwart shoulders of the existing incumbents of those Ministries or of some new appointee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot lose sight of the basic fact that this Bill envisages the creation of a new national institution. No matter how favourable the comments are from certain sections of the Press and certain bodies outside, it will be hard to convince the great mass of the Irish people that there is absolute necessity for this Bill or for the setting up of the new Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept unreservedly that it is physically impossible for any Minister for Industry and Commerce to carry out his duties efficiently and in detail with the multiplicity of matters which he has to face in that Department now. I appreciate that full well.  Nevertheless, we know that Ministries have been created over the years and that as a consequence there followed the recruitment of staffs, the creation of a Civil Service which has proved entirely efficient, very competent and completely dependable.  It is due to the efficiency, competence and dependability of those operatives in the Civil Service in this country today, that in <Col N="1116" /> many matters the office of Minister can be very pleasant and his functions can be matters of real routine.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, no matter in what Department a Minister is, judging by the duties we ourselves are asked to perform on some occasions, he must occasionally have to work the whole round of the clock and no financial consideration can compensate him for his time, energy and devotion to duty.  I appreciate all that.  Nevertheless, it is paradoxical that we are here today creating a new institution of State, at a time when our population is dwindling and when we have acute economic problems.</P>
    <P>I could understand this Bill if it were to create a new Department of Industrial Development.  That title would give the people some new hope, when there is so much concentration on industrial development.  Such a Minister could co-ordinate the various bodies which cater for industrial development, whether they are voluntary bodies outside or bodies within the Department itself.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Costello that the time does not seem opportune, especially so soon after the new Taoiseach has taken office, for a creation of this kind.  It has emerged clearly from the debate this evening that many reforms are possible.  If they were put into effect, there could be a co-ordination and amalgamation of Departments.  We could do away with some of the overlapping Ministries we have now.  There could also be a reduction in the over-representation of this House.  For our population, there is no nation in the world so liberally catered for in the way of Ministers as we are here and there is certainly no nation so liberally over-represented as we are in our national Parliament.  These are matters we must face some day.</P>
    <P>It was pleasant to sit here this evening and listen to the debate being carried on in an atmosphere of calmness, goodwill and mutual understanding. If we always had that calmness, goodwill and mutual understanding, there are many things we could do for the nation, without losing our heads or becoming hot under <Col N="1117" /> the collar.  I hate to be the purveyor of gloom and I do not want to be criticised as such, but we are living in critical times and facing a critical future.  We must be more realistic about our conceptions and our views and we must try to get them over without antagonising our opposite numbers.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Taoiseach on the statement he made here, on the day he was appointed Taoiseach that it will be his aim while he holds the post never to utter a harsh word here.</P>

      <P>If we do that, we shall get over our difficulties and create the goodwill necessary in the country today, where people are losing faith, largely because of what eventuates in this House.  It is regrettable that, in a national Parliament, people should so behave as to bring discredit on the nation.  We are judged abroad by the standards we set up here.  The office of Government or of Minister is not an enviable one at any time and we certainly will make it far more pleasant for Ministers and for the existing Government if we are more conscious of their responsibilities and their difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather strange, surely, to appoint a Minister to take charge of certain activities in the Department that are so well catered for already by existing bodies.  I appreciate that at the moment the office is too big for one man, but I doubt if the Taoiseach has been wise in the division of the duties he has announced this afternoon. Perhaps he would reconsider some of these as time goes on and would implement some of the suggestions developed here this afternoon.  Some of them were very helpful and were objectively made and constructively put.  If they were implemented and <Col N="1118" /> carried out, they would be of future benefit to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to ourselves, I should point out, in reply to Deputy Manley, that the number of separate Ministries here is a great deal fewer than is normal in most countries operating our type of Government. Indeed, in some countries&mdash;admittedly larger in size and of greater resources &mdash;it would not be unusual to find double the number of Ministries that we maintain.  However, that is only by the way.</P>
      <P>The proposal to establish this new Department of Transport and Power arises out of my personal conviction that it will improve the efficiency of Government administration and, in time, will lead to more expeditious disposal of matters heretofore dealt with in the Department of Industry and Commerce, including matters arising on the industrial side.  Deputy Costello asked is this an appropriate time to set up a new Department.  I think the answer to that must be &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  We have a situation where a new Minister is taking office in the middle of a Dáil term with a great deal of business in progress.  In my view it is desirable that this change, if it is to be made, should be made now rather than later. It would be difficult to make it after a general election, even with a reconstructed Government coming into power, and still more difficult to do it during the normal course of administration of a Government when the Minister originally appointed had become familiar with all the problems arising and wished to complete the plans he himself had made.  Indeed, one could hardly imagine a more appropriate time for making this change, if the change is to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello queried whether the amount of administration work that will arise in the new Department will be sufficient to occupy the time of a Minister.  I am sure he will agree with me that a Minister who is fully occupied with matters of administration only is merely doing half of the work he should be doing.  Indeed, it is desirable that in every Department the Minister in charge should have the opportunity occasionally to sit back <Col N="1119" /> and re-assess the policy he is applying and have time to meet the representatives of organisations and of individuals wishing to discuss these general policy matters with him.  It will be understood also that a Minister is not merely the head of a Department; he is also a member of the Cabinet and, as such, has tasks to perform and duties to fulfil which extend outside the particular functions of which he is personally in charge.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the proposal I have made here will result in the division of the Department of Industry and Commerce on a fifty-fifty basis. Indeed, the problem was primarily to draw a dividing line which would involve the least possible administrative difficulties for the Department and avoid the need for any additional staffs. There are still one or two functions concerning which I am not quite sure as to which side of the line they should be placed.  I mentioned already that in the course of time it may be considered desirable to transfer additional functions to the new Department. It may also be that experience will show that some of the decisions we have taken now will require reconsideration.</P>
    <P>One of the problems, for example, arose in connection with coalmining. We propose to give the new Department the responsibility for procuring and distribution and for production policy generally, but it seems to me to be desirable to leave with the Department of Industry and Commerce the administration of the Mining Acts, which extend to all forms of mining, the responsibility for granting mining licences and for the application of the laws relating to safety in mines and so forth.  But, again, that may prove to be an arrangement that will not work very well.  I think it will work all right, but some problem may arise which may require reconsideration of our present decision.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that this new Department will be, in respect of a large part of its functions, operating through the instrumentality of statutory Boards and public companies which have been set up from time to time by <Col N="1120" /> law.  I agree fully with Deputy Costello that it is undesirable that there should be any interference in matters of administration by the Minister with these Boards.  But I do not agree at all that the Minister should not have a very complete knowledge of, and a very definite voice in, the determination of policy by them.  After all, these Boards are established to fulfil public policy. It is the responsibility of the Minister under whom they work to ensure that their operations are in accordance with public policy as determined by the Government of the day.  Indeed, the Government of the day would certainly be held to blame if its general aims were being frustrated in any way by the failure of any one of these Boards to direct its affairs in accordance with them.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion here concerning the extent to which the operations of these statutory Boards should be under parliamentary control. I do not want to go into that matter in any detail now.  I gave an address to the Institute of Public Administration on that matter earlier this year, which the Institute decided to re-publish as a pamphlet.  The pamphlet also contained some quite useful contributions on the subject from the present Chairman of C.I.E. and from the Chairman of the Industrial Credit Company.  It is available for 2/6&mdash;that is the value they put on it&mdash;but I am sure it would be possible to secure a copy for influential Deputies free of that charge.</P>
    <P>Among the matters which I dealt with in the course of that address was this question of the extent to which it was desirable to operate a system of parliamentary control over the affairs of these Boards and companies.  Deputy Dillon said that no solution of that problem has been found here or elsewhere. Personally, I am not yet prepared to accept that there is a problem. We set up these Boards for the purpose of giving them the administrative freedom of private companies, subject to that degree of control over them by the Government as was necessary to ensure that they carried out the purposes for which they were established in accordance with the general policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> I do not think it would be desirable for us to try to have things both ways. If we want to give them the administrative freedom that will enable them to operate in the same way as private enterprises, we cannot at the same time subject them to the same type of detailed supervision as that to which Government Departments must submit. I may say that in my experience I found it difficult in the Department of Industry and Commerce to find sufficient time for the full discussion of policy matters with these Boards which I thought was desirable.  Indeed, I was quite conscious of the fact that I did not meet these Boards often enough, not even as often as they themselves wished.  It would be a good thing for them and for the country, in so far as these Boards have an important part to play in contributing to the development of the country, that there should be frequent reconsideration of previous policy decisions in consultation with the Minister concerned by these Boards.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate also that there have arisen in the past problems of co-ordinating the activities of these Boards.  Deputy Norton referred to the conflicts which occasionally emerged between the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna on policy matters.  There was nobody who could resolve these conflicts except the Minister to whom they were both responsible.  As far as I know, the relationship between these two Boards is now eminently satisfactory and they are working in complete harmony, but there are other directions in which there may be a need for co-ordination of policy.  Indeed, it has frequently been suggested that in the matter of the utilisation of the public transport services, there should be greater harmony and co-operation between a number of our statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay asked me for an assurance that the establishment of this new Department would not mean a further development of State enterprise. I am not going to give him that assurance.  Indeed, I can readily contemplate that result.  As was stated in the White Paper on Economic Expansion all these statutory Boards and <Col N="1122" /> State-sponsored and financed companies have been asked to consider possibilities for new developments related to their existing activities.  In so far as any of them have projects or proposals of that character to put forward, it is very desirable that there should be a Minister who would be available to discuss these ideas in detail, and to convey expeditious approval of such developments to the extent that circumstances and the general aims of the Government would require.</P>
    <P>I would not at all disagree with Deputy J.A. Costello regarding the possibility, at some stage, of changes in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. My assessment of the position there, however, has conveyed to me a picture of a Minister who is very fully occupied.  Admittedly, in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister gets a higher proportion of routine administrative work as against policy or legislative activities, than may apply in the general run of Government Departments.  Nevertheless, he appears to me to be fully occupied. It is only now and again in that Department that matters reach the point where legislation or where major policy decisions are required.  I certainly would not like to contemplate proceeding along the lines suggested by Deputy Costello towards the establishment of some statutory authority to administer the postal and telephone services, unless it was quite clear from investigation that substantial advantages would accrue.  I am not sure that they would.  Perhaps, to relieve anxieties, I should make it clear that we are not contemplating any such major reorganisation in that Department at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay asked did we gain by the division of the old Department of Local Government and Public Health into two Departments, one concerned solely with local government and the other with public health. I think we gained enormously and that the general development of our public health services which has taken place since the war might not have taken place at all if public health affairs were just the part-time concern of a Minister <Col N="1123" /> mainly occupied with matters of local government administration.  Indeed, the picture I have already obtained of the work of the Department of Health indicates that the burden falling on the Minister is a very heavy one.  I am not by any means sure that it is desirable that the combination of Health and Social Welfare should continue. I mentioned some time ago that we were contemplating a detailed examination into the practicability of a contributory retirement pension scheme for insured workers.  That would be a major development in social welfare legislation and it might be difficult under the present arrangement to secure the detailed attention of the Minister to the problems which would arise.</P>
    <P>I do not recollect having participated in any debate here on the proposal to establish a Department of the Gaeltacht, but I had an opportunity of witnessing personally the difficulties which confronted the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach in charge of Oifig na nGaeltacht agus na gCeantar gCúng. He was located in the Industry and Commerce building in Kildare Street and I could witness the impossible task had been given to him of carrying out the development projects in the Gaeltacht which were his concern, without having the advantage of being a Minister with direct access to the Government.  Indeed, I argued strongly at the time that it might be necessary to elevate that office into a Government Department.</P>
    <P>There is another question on which I do not agree with Deputy Costello. I think Departmental files are essential instruments of democratic government and that if you abolish Departmental files, you must abolish Parliamentary Questions as well and even perhaps the Committee of Public Accounts. At a moment's notice Ministers are in the position of being able to answer any question in detail, on the work of their Departments, affecting any individual in the country no matter how remote from the central Government he may be.  That is very <Col N="1124" /> important in the interests of democracy.</P>
    <P>I have a very vivid recollection of the fact that when I became Minister for Industry and Commerce for the first time in 1932, the then Secretary of the Board of Works sent me a copy of a book by a former Secretary of the British Board of Trade which visualised an enormous Government Department entirely occupied with its own administrative problems, growing and growing in size, but with no contact with the outside world.  He was unkind enough to suggest that that was a not inaccurate description of the Department of Industry and Commerce of that day, but certainly the book left a picture in my mind which has influenced my approach to the work of that Department ever since.  That was long before Parkinson's Law had been invented.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that this new Department need not involve the recruitment of any additional staff.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has chosen to carry on for the time being without a Parliamentary Secretary, so the only difference I can see is that there will be a Minister now instead of a Parliamentary Secretary. All the work with which the new Department will be concerned is being done at present and it is being done as I said, by self-contained sections of the Department.  It will, in fact, help to improve the efficiency of these sections when the channel of communication between them and the Minister responsible for their activities will be shortened.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps safeguard myself by saying that one could contemplate the possibility in the future of an extension of the functions of the Department.  Deputy Russell referred to some matters which he says require early consideration.  I think they do and it could be that that consideration will lead to a decision that some extension of activities will be justified in the interests of national development. If that should prove to be the case, it will of course have to be justified to the Dáil as a separate matter.  The transfer of these functions to a new Minister does not, and will not, of <Col N="1125" /> itself involve the recruitment of one additional civil servant to the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke about his experience in trying to co-ordinate the activities of State-sponsored bodies with the various matters which came to his notice as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the problem of reading long files in order to get to understand the issue arising in each case.  I think that one of the advantages of this new Bill will be that it will facilitate dealing with these matters by consultation, by meeting around a table and talking about them, rather than by writing long minutes about them.  I, like Deputy Norton, would regard that as a very great improvement.</P>
    <P>I did suggest in my opening remarks that at some stage developments in relation to all these matters&mdash;power, fuel, shipping, transport and so forth &mdash;may reach a point at which no major policy matters would be likely to arise for a time.  If that situation arose it might conceivably be possible to put in charge of the Department a Minister who had also got other responsibilities. By and large, I think that is an arrangement which always requires justification because, on the face of it, it cannot generally be good and I certainly do not see it arising in this Department for a very long time.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point I should like to deal with.  Deputy Russell queried the desirability of putting power under this new Department. Power and fuel are identical.  It seems to me that the fact that power and fuel development policies over the past years, and particularly since the end of the war, were the responsibility of one Minister helped enormously to get some of the developments of which we are now aware and to smooth out the difficulties that emerged in that regard. It would be quite undesirable in my opinion to separate power from fuel. Wherever responsibility for policy for the one rests, it must also rest for the other.  I think it will prove to be wiser, therefore, to do what we are proposing in this Bill rather than as Deputy Russell appeared to suggest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the justifications for this Bill in connection with pelagic fish vouchsafed by the Minister was that persons engaged in canning, fishmeal manufacture and deep freeze fish might find themselves short of supplies. It is astonishing the way the world can be turned upside down for the purpose of argument.  I find it hard to believe that the Minister for Lands is not familiar with the background to this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishmeal factory was started by me in Killybegs.  If the Minister wants to look up the discussions that led to it he will find them all recorded solemnly in the files of the Department. It was patently manifest to us that unless and until you had fishmeal manufacturing capacity you could not say to Irish fishermen: &ldquo;Go out and catch all the herrings you can in the absolute certainty that, no matter what quantity you bring in, you will never again be asked to throw it back into the sea.&rdquo;  The purpose of establishing the fishmeal factory was to enable us to say that to the fishermen <Col N="1127" /> The fishmeal factory was put np as a safeguard for the fishermen.</P>
    <P>I know, and the Minister knows, that since that decision was taken the European situation with regard to the supply of herrings has radically changed.  Three years ago there was a chronic condition of surplus.  Now this mysterious disappearance of herring from the North Sea has transpired and temporarily, at least, we can sell all our herring in the fresh fish trade.  There is no question of surplus. But the fact that there is no question of surplus should, I imagine, be raising entirely different considerations in the Minister's mind.  Instead of announcing that he is going to authorise all and sundry to go out and fish for herring, he ought to ask himself: are the fellows to whom we gave boats using them to bring in herring in greater quantity?  I do not believe that all the existing boats are being used 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has any confidence in the continuance of the present herring situation, and if he believes that the existing boats are being used to the limit of their capacity, here is the glorious opportunity for which we have been waiting for years in order to multiply and increase the number of owner-fishermen on those parts of our coast where the herring fishing is abundant.  Just imagine the desirability of doubling the number of fellows who own their boats on the Donegal coast, up around Burtonport and Killybegs, in Ring in Waterford, and in Dungarvan, where the herring appear to be abundant, and in every part of the coast where the herring are present.</P>
    <P>We are now in a position to say to the fishermen: &ldquo;Go now and take full advantage of the abundant market that there is for fresh fish with the assurance that, if the situation ever deteriorates in the herring market into the state in which it was in 1955, 1956 and 1957, we are building in Ireland fishmeal factories which will absorb any surplus herring in the future, albeit not at the price that the &lsquo;fresh&rsquo; market is in a position to pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I planned to build the fishmeal <Col N="1128" /> factory at Killybegs through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department of Fisheries.  Then there came along a German firm which expressed its desire to get the concession to build the fish meal factory there.  I asked the Government to give them that permission, but I certainly would not have given that permission had there been any suggestion whatever that they would found on that permission a claim to operate trawlers themselves.  I have no hesitation in saying to the Minister that, before putting his foot on that slippery slope, he should not hesitate to say to these people: &ldquo;If you find yourselves in difficulty we will take the factory over from you.&rdquo;  We want the factory there in order to put the herring fishing on a permanent basis.  We probably want another factory of a smaller character somewhere in the South East, if experience teaches us that there is a chronic surplus of herring to be had. But we certainly should not allow the concessionaires in Killybegs to make any representation to this Parliament that the fact that they built a factory in Killybegs gives them any sort of prescriptive right to operate trawlers in order to bring in herring to supply themselves, because that was not the purpose for which the fishmeal factory was located there.</P>
    <P>The whole thing is haywire, if you once allow companies to operate trawlers into this country.  The whole price structure is founded on the proposition that fish will be landed here by owner-proprietor and, if you once depart from that, then the sensible thing to do is to do away with the whole system of a protected fish market in this country and, if you want to go in for manufacturing fishmeal, canning fish and industrial operations of that character, let these industrial operatives buy their raw material from the cheapest source of supply.</P>
    <P>That is what has happened and I am warning Oireachtas Eireann but they will not listen to me for the time being until, probably, it is too late.  This Government will get the bit between their teeth.  Fishermen, farmers and everybody else whose livelihood is not based on an entirely industrial foundation will go down the drain in order <Col N="1129" /> that industrial considerations should prevail and, with that decision, a whole way of life will be shattered in this country which no subsequent administration can revive.  It bewilders me that in a representative Parliament of this character a policy of that kind can possibly be foisted on our people.  I look at the representatives of the western seaboard of this country who, a week ago, have seen the people of the undeveloped areas thrown overboard in the Undeveloped Areas Bill and now see the Government making ready to throw the fishermen overboard avowedly, according to the Minister for Lands, because he said that the canneries, the deep-freeze plants and the fishmeal plants are not assured of adequate supplies of fish.</P>
    <P>I remember perfectly well fish canners coming to me when I was Minister for Fisheries and asking, if they set up a fish canning plant in Waterford, where would they get the herring?  At that time, Bord Iascaigh Mhara did not deal with herring.  They handled only demersal fish.  I remember well saying in the Department: &ldquo;We cannot as a Department of Fisheries, turn down a manufacturing enterprise based on fish on the ground that there will not be fish to supply them with and, whatever the cost to us, if these people are prepared to tell us that they want so many cran of herring per week, wherever we get them, we must provide the raw material.&rdquo; We did.  It was not our failure to provide the raw material that brought the fish canning experiment to an end; it was the fact that they were unable economically to can fish.  We insisted that the principle should be preserved that the importation of fish into this country, whether it was from the ocean deep or from external sources of supply, should be the exclusive prerogative of Bord Iascaigh Mhara representing the owner-fishermen of our own shores.  If we depart from that principle, we will do an irremediable injury to that section of the community for which I understood the Department of Fisheries was established to cater. To think that this should be done at the instance of a group of wealthy fishmongers who are already addressing letters to the paper saying that the <Col N="1130" /> Minister is a Daniel come to judgment and that they, as the champions of the consumer, congratulate him most heartily on taking these measures to facilitate them in selling more fish!</P>
    <P>I recollect no period&mdash;and I want this to be perfectly clear&mdash;during which the fishmongers of this country could not get all the fish that they were in a position to sell, except brief periods when weather conditions made it impossible to land fish here or in Great Britain, and I never saw a period of weather conditions of that character occur, when everybody who was associated with the fish trade knew perfectly well that there must be a temporary shortage of fish because either the boats were not able to put to sea or those at sea were not able to fish, that the fishmongers did not immediately raise a wail of woe that the scarcity of fish was due to the obscurantist policy of the Minister for Fisheries who was restricting free access of supply, they knowing perfectly well that, if they had all the freedom in the world at that time, they could not get fish because there was not any fish either in Great Britain or here.  But, of course, as soon as the bad weather passed, fish supplies immediately became available again and there would be peace until there was another interlude of stormy weather and exactly the same hullabaloo started all over again.  But, they never succeeded in bluffing our Government out of the sound position that the fish market of this country was the prerogative of our own fishermen.</P>
    <P>This Bill has only one significant purpose and that is enshrined in Section 4 and Section 5.  So certainly as we are in this Dáil, those two sections are designed to destroy the market of our inshore fishermen for the benefit of the fishmongers, wholesale and retail, in this country and it will be a wicked shame if Oireachtas Eireann allows this act of folly to be consummated.</P>
    <P>I want to say that, in regard to Section 2, the Minister is, to put it mildly, disingenuous when he says that great significance is to be attached to the words, &ldquo;substitution of £3,000,000 <Col N="1131" /> for £1,000,000.&rdquo;  I never was conscious as long as I was Minister for Fisheries of the slightest difficulty in getting any money I wanted for providing boats and gear to fishermen on the hire purchase system.  I never even adverted to the fact that the figure £1,000,000 occurred in any Statute and it would never have crossed my mind that there was any such unalterable limitation on our activities. So far as I was aware&mdash;and I believe I am undoubtedly right&mdash;we were authorised to go full steam ahead so far as equipping fishermen was concerned until we ultimately reached the stage in the Gaeltacht boat scheme that our problem was, not to supply boats, but to find skippers for them.</P>
    <P>These things are so familiar to us who are connected with the Department of Fisheries that one gets weary of repeating them in Dáil Éireann.  I remember the day dawning when we had two boats and nobody to operate them.  We had more boats than skippers and we had to get an officer of the Naval Services to go down to Killybegs and take one of the boats to sea with a competent fisherman who was not competent to navigate the boat and stay with him for about nine months to teach him the elements of navigation in order to make it possible to send the boat to sea.  So far as I know, the same had to be done in respect of the second boat.</P>
    <P>We were eager to place boats on the Connemara shore.  I could not get skippers.  I got one skipper on the Connemara shore competent to take a boat.  My recollection is that we could not get another.  The problem was to train them to take the boats that were available.  I have never known an application for gear to be turned down on the grounds that we had not the means to finance it.  I do not believe that any case has ever arisen in which an application for a boat or gear has been turned down on the ground of scarcity of finance.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this Bill can pass without a man like Deputy J. Brennan having something to say about it.  He lives near Killybegs.  He <Col N="1132" /> knows the conditions there.  I cannot believe that Deputy P.J. Burke, who is familiar with the conditions of the fishermen in Howth and in North County Dublin, would allow this Bill to pass without contributing to the debate.</P>

I should be interested to hear men with whom I had contact when I was Minister, even though they were on the opposite side of the House, and to note what they would have to say on this.

I do not believe the Minister for Lands has any contact with the way of life which I certainly was concerned to preserve in the Gaeltacht and in the fishing areas of the country.

I find that hard to believe because I am convinced he has adequate advice at his disposal to warn him of the true ambition of the fishmongers who are now so loud in his praise.</P>

      <P>He comes along then and cries for the inshore fishermen. I had the pleasure of travelling with the Minister from Howth to Balbriggan.  He went out of his way to meet the fishermen.  He did not want to see them in his office.  He wanted to see them in their harbours.  He wanted to see them with their boats. He wanted to see their way of life. That took place in my constituency. The Minister got a harbour expert with considerable experience to come over and report on the harbours.  The Minister took that action in order to improve the harbours for the inshore fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries chooses to misrepresent a measure to the extent to which he has just done so.  I have the utmost confidence in our Minister for Lands and Fisheries.  I believe he is the best friend our inshore fishermen ever had. Before this Bill ever came along, he had power to regulate this market.  He <Col N="1135" /> has established a board to do the job. If, at any time, the livelihood of the inshore fishermen was in any way being jeopardised, the present Minister for Lands and Fisheries would immediately go to their aid.  I have the utmost confidence in his ability to do the job well.</P>
    <P>In the course of the past week, along with the Minister, I met some of the inshore fishermen who were labouring under the strange fear that, because a boat came into Dublin with fish, their market would be destroyed.  One of their representatives and myself got a personal assurance from the Minister that he was only too anxious to improve our fish market, that he was anxious to get people to eat more fish and to expand this industry.  To some other countries such as the Baltic countries, the fishing industry is worth about £5 million.  We are trying to develop our fishing industry.  We must get more and more into the export market if we are to find increased employment for our people and carry on as economic unit.  Why should the Minister or why should the Fianna Fáil Party who have always been deeply concerned about the interests of all sections of our people, irrespective of class or creed, do as Deputy Dillon suggests we are trying to do, take away the livelihood of approximately 1,600 inshore fishermen?  I hope during the life of this Dáil, even before the next election, that the Minister will succeed in giving employment to hundreds more inshore fishermen and that he will succeed in expanding our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that a responsible ex-Minister like Deputy Dillon should take up the time of the House dealing with this Bill in such a scathing manner as he has done this evening.  We all welcome constructive criticism.  It is understandable that when an industry is going through a transitional period, the people immediately concerned will be anxious in case their position is jeopardised when any change is made.  If I, as a Deputy representing a constituency where there are a large number of inshore fishermen, thought their interests would be <Col N="1136" /> adversely affected, I would be the first to go to the Minister.  I have no doubt about the Minister's sincerity.  If I blame him at all, it is for being overzealous in the job he has taken on.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill for £3 million in relation to the disposal of fish.  When Deputy Dillon was Minister he had money for everything. When he was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, he made many wild promises about what he intended to do in North County Dublin. He led me to believe that £150,000 would be available for the development of the harbour at Skerries, but the scheme never materialised.</P>
    <P>No one can say that our fishing industry has been expanded to the extent to which it should be.  We are importing fish here at certain times of the year.  We have fishmeal factories which are not able to carry on for want of a supply of fish.  There is no use in having quick-freezing plants, fishmeal factories, and so on, unless we have fish to supply to them.  These are the problems with which the Minister and the Board are faced.  I know the members of the Board and I have found them reasonable men who are anxious to help everybody concerned. My advice to the Minister is to continue with the work he has set out to do.  The training of our boys to be good fishermen is a very important step the Minister has taken.  If it was his intention to destroy the inshore fishermen, he would not have undertaken that work.  He is going further than that by training skippers for the boats.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon's attitude to this Bill was that we in Fianna Fáil came in here to destroy the inshore fishermen and I am replying to statements that have been made from the other side of the House.  Our Minister has gone a long way to protect the inshore fishermen.  He has made provision for the training of young fishermen to man boats and for the training of skippers.  Boats have been given to these fishermen for which they have to put down only five per cent. of the cost.  Fishing tackle can be procured very reasonably.  The only axe I have to grind with the Minister is in relation to some of the harbours, especially the harbour at Skerries, County Dublin.  We have so many inshore fishermen there who have acquired boats that the harbour is completely cluttered up.  I would ask the Minister to expedite the extension of that harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that, when I looked at this Bill, I did not see any hidden motive in it as imputed to the Minister by Deputy Dillon.  I am not as conversant with the management of fishing from the top as Deputy Dillon or the Minister.  I must admit that I am slightly confused and uncertain arising out of the speech of a man who was in the position where he should know what he was talking about.</P>
      <P>The Bill appeared to me to be a very simple one&mdash;a Bill whereby the Minister desired to increase the sum available for the Board to carry out projects for the advancement of the fishing industry.  I certainly think I would subscribe to that and I feel that my Party would subscribe to it without any question or doubt.  A doubt has arisen in my mind due to the speech made by an ex-Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, as the service was then called, but I think that the solution to that will be easily found as I shall indicate towards the end of the short speech I intend to make.</P>
      <P>I am not committed because of the fact that I am a Deputy from a fishing area.  In County Waterford, fishing has appeared in the news to a great extent but I am not so sure that my county availed itself to the full of the facilities that we could have either from the employment content or the financial reward that could be secured from engaging in the fishing industry. I hope that will improve in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like all Deputies, I take it for <Col N="1139" /> granted that we would be jealous in regard to the question of the employment of 2,000 fishermen or so engaged in the fishing industry.  I would not want to be a party to any act that might place their livelihood in jeopardy.  I take that attitude myself and I think Deputies on all sides of the House have that honestly at heart. Whether or not this Bill might unwittingly create a position that would injure the inshore fishing is another thing.  If an injury arises from it, it has the same effect as an injury deliberately planned and manoeuvred. Because of that I have some doubts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon went on to point out that the public purchased their fish at some 30 per cent. above British prices because of the fact that we wanted to reserve for Irish fishermen the home market.  While we are all desirous of reserving for Irish fishermen the home market and while we are all desirous of seeing them in steady employment, I am not at all so sure that the prices of 30 per cent. above normal marketing prices in Britain find their way into the pockets of our Irish fishermen.</P>
    <P>I had on an occasion some short time ago to point out to the Minister the fact that the fish prices which obtained in Dublin on certain days were in no way reflected in the prices paid over to the fishermen who went out and braved the dangers of the deep to bring in the fish.  Since then, without mentioning any names or making any individual claims, the Minister has got sufficient correspondence to warrant an investigation into it, which I understand he is carrying out.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that he will find my statement on that occasion was warranted by facts&mdash;which the Minister at the time doubted.  I do not blame the Minister for that.  I myself would have doubted it, had I not been absolutely certain of what I stated.  That is simply by the way.  My point is this: Because of the statements made by an ex-Minister here&mdash;Deputy Dillon&mdash;I feel it is necessary that the Minister should, in his reply, make clear whether or not I misunderstood him when he said that the members of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara supported this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> I have a high respect for the members of that Board.  I believe they are non-political.  I believe they are inspired by motives of endeavouring to promote and protect the fishing interests of this country.  Did I understand the Minister correctly that he, by way of interjection or answer to Deputy Dillon, said that the members of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara believed in this Bill and supported it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct.  They do support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>That to me means a good deal.  I approach this Bill purely from the point of view of whether or not it is a good Bill for the fishing industry.  The Minister's speech impressed me as a reasonable attitude to it.  I was amazed, as I say, when in his speech Deputy Dillon suggested that the Minister simply used Section 2 of the Bill as an excuse to get through various other sections that would be detrimental to the fishing industry. While I am keenly interested in the rights of fishermen to secure the home market, I am also keenly interested in the right of the public to get value for their money.</P>
      <P>I am aware that fish is not available on market days in my own area.  All the fish available is sent to Dublin.  This is a Catholic country and every Friday we must have fish or some alternative to meat on Fridays.  On most Fridays in a town of 5,000 population within two miles of one of our fishing areas, there is no fish available.  That is a deplorable situation.  It shows that the market could be extended. If the Minister's project makes fish available to the public in my area in Waterford and in the rural areas around Waterford at a reasonable price, by means of the extension of our fishing industry, I feel that will be a good thing for the public in general.</P>

    <P>As the Minister has given an assurance that any outside trawling will be subject to licence and the conditions in the licence will enable him, or enable whoever will be in charge, to see that the exercise of their rights as fishermen will not be detrimental <Col N="1141" /> to those of the native fishermen, I see no reason to refuse him this Bill. Because of the fact that Deputy Dillon made such a ferocious attack I was left in doubt but I feel now that the members of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are in agreement with this Bill and I, for one, believe that the Minister is seriously and honestly trying to help the fishermen and I support him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I know nothing about fishing and I want the Minister, when he is concluding, to explain how he proposes to reconcile what appears to me to be irreconcilable, that is to say, the interest of the person who is going to go out in the big deep sea trawler with the interest of the inshore fisherman.  I agree that possibly with the bigger deep sea trawlers we are going to get a more regular and more plentiful supply of fish landed in the country.  If we do get that from the deep sea trawlers, and we shall get it, I cannot see how by the landings from the big trawlers we shall avoid displacing the markets that the small inshore fishermen have at present.</P>
      <P>If we displace these markets then we may get greater fish landings here at home but we create another problem for ourselves in so doing.  All along the western seaboard the inshore fisherman is somebody who tries to eke out a livelihood, in the difficulties inherent in that area, by some inshore fishing.  If the effect of bigger trawlers means that his market is eaten into, or that his market is gone, then you are creating another problem for him and it is not going to be a problem that will be easy to solve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that we are on the horns of a dilemma.  If we are going to carry on, as I understand it is the Minister's desire to carry on, with heavier, deep sea trawlers which will bring in very much greater landings of fish, then equally you will have social problems in the western seaboard thrown upon you more and more as time goes on. We have to make up our minds whether we want fishing on the western seaboard to be something akin to a social service to some degree, or whether we are ruthlessly to cut out <Col N="1142" /> any portion at all of that fishing as being a social service.</P>
    <P>Some of the Gaeltacht industries are in exactly the same position.  They are not the most economic or the most businesslike proposition but they assist a very substantial number of people in that congested area and if it were not for the assistance they give in that way a very much greater sum would have to be spent in direct social services.  The Minister for Lands will need to be careful, in his efforts and in his anxiety to produce what I might term streamlined fishing and a much bigger fishing industry by means of bigger trawlers and more regular and larger landings, that he does not at the same time create an even worse problem on the western seaboard.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to know how to deal in sequence with the extraordinary statements made by Deputy Dillon.  Perhaps I might begin by pointing out that a good deal of the arguments of Deputy Dillon would seem to relate to some gigantic factory ship, or shipping liner, which could, by landing huge quantities of fish on the Dublin market in a single day, paralyse the market and bring down prices.  Of course, one of the obvious answers to that is that the liner itself if it ever did land fish would lose money because prices would be low for it as well as for the inshore fisherman. That does not seem to have occurred to Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, Deputy Dillon has entirely misunderstood the relative sizes of the various classes of trawlers which could operate from our type of harbours and under our circumstances. Perhaps the best way I can deal with that is to say that the handful of larger trawlers which I think in most cases will be associated with processing plants of one kind or another will be of a size which can best be described in the following way.  Most of our fishing is done by 56-foot boats.  Five 72-foot boats are equivalent to eight 56-foot boats so that to say that 72-foot boats could overwhelm the market is nonsense.  They can go out into deeper waters; they can go out when the weather is bad and individually each of them can supply larger quantities <Col N="1143" /> of fish to a cannery but their relative size is not of a character which would have a paralysing effect, unless I allowed a very large number of them to operate and did not exercise the controlling power which I have, and which is quite clearly indicated in the Bill, to ensure that methods of fishing should be of a kind which would bring and retain prosperity to the industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>Even if we were to take the next largest size, the 80- to 90-foot boat, then five of those boats are equivalent to twelve of the large boats that we now have, so let us not have wild exaggeration in this matter.  We are not introducing 10,000 ton factory ships which could land one month's supply all at once.  We are simply raising slightly the size of boats to be used mostly for cannery purposes and processing plants and, now that Deputies have been given those relative figures, they will immediately see that Deputy Dillon was exaggerating just as wildly as he was when, some time in 1947, he said that &ldquo;some day wheat like peat and beet will go up the spout and God speed that day.&rdquo; Deputy Dillon gets into that mood sometimes and makes most extraordinary statements.  His observations on this Bill can be compared exactly with those remarks on three of our most important agricultural and rural industries.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon suggested that the Bill was unnecessary and that the only important part of it was that relating to the licensing of fishery vessels whereas, in fact, in 1956 he himself introduced, and had passed through this House, a Bill increasing the amount which An Bord Iascaigh Mhara could borrow from £500,000 to £1,000,000.  This Bill is absolutely essential because, without it, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara cannot borrow any more than the £1,000,000 and of that, only £14,000 is left.  In addition to that, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will have very great responsibility in the future because now, for the first time, State grants of 15 per cent are provided for the purchase of boats.  Now, for the first time, the rate of interest is controlled at 4 per cent, irrespective of the prevailing Bank rate and now, for the first time, a rate of deposit as low as 5 per cent can be accepted from an applicant for a boat.</P>
      <P>All that represents new policy designed to encourage our own fishermen to procure new boats.  I might add that the fishermen evidently have some faith in the present policy because total applications for boats have to be sifted, and the number of applications by Irish fishermen for boats of all classes on the 31st May this year was over double that on the 31st May last year, indicating that their own industry is in a lively state. I am told we have received quite a large number of applications for the new training scheme for training fishing hands, deckhands, and that again indicates the interest of our own people in the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is a dire pessimist.  He appears to be hostile to all sections of the industry except those in inshore fishing.  The fishing industry in every country in the world consists of the fishermen themselves and the many people who handle the fish, people working in canneries, in processing plants; and the people working on the shore bear, in relation to those working on the sea, a proportion of anything from three to one to ten to one, according to the type of industries on the shore.  Deputy Dillon does not seem to want to develop a full-scale <Col N="1145" /> industry to give both employment on the shore and employment on the sea. He seems to believe that our inshore fishermen cannot face up to or live with modern conditions.</P>
    <P>He apparently believes that the Irish people are unchangeable in their tastes and habits, that they are incapable of eating more and more fish each year, and that they are not subject to the reasoning of advertising.  I do not know whether his feelings on that subject are based on the fact that he himself once said in this House that he disliked fish, or not.  The fact that we have done a great deal of public relations work in the last two years to introduce the word &ldquo;fish&rdquo; into the minds of the people all over the country does not seem to weigh with him. I am glad to say that at the present time you can hardly open a copy of a newspaper, any day of the week, without finding the word &ldquo;fish&rdquo; somewhere in it, and it has unquestionably created a demand for fish throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know why we should be the only small country in Northern Europe where there are no canneries, where processing plants are empty, and where there is no export of fish, or very little export of fish save that of salmon and some herring.  I do not know why it can be that inshore fishermen can survive magnificently in Norway, Denmark and in the Moray Firth in Scotland.  I cannot understand how they can survive there if they cannot survive here.  Scotland is a small country; Norway has a small population and Denmark has a small population.  Why must our fishing industry here remain in the same shape that it has for the last 20 years while other countries can retain their inshore fishermen in employment and, at the same time, expand their markets and consumption of fish with middle water trawlers and larger boats?  Those are the boats that seem to be successful, not boats that are very very large, which are not involved in our case, or else boats of the kind I have described where five boats&mdash;I think that is the lowest common multiple&mdash;are roughly equivalent to eight or 12 of the boats we have at the present time, that is, <Col N="1146" /> the largest boats we have at the present time.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I have more faith in the future.  At least I am going to make an effort, and the Government have agreed and indicated quite definitely in the Programme for Economic Expansion that an effort will be made to try to effect some total expansion in the fishing industry without endangering the fortunes of our inshore fishermen.  Already there have been some very hopeful increases in turnover and in exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major reasons for making some changes in the licensing system&mdash;which has never been put into operation but which is there to be put into operation as an emergency arises or when the case demands it&mdash;is that we wish to establish canneries for canning mackerel, sprat, and herring, and the promoters are naturally anxious to procure sufficient supplies of fish.  There is no reason why we should not employ 2,000 more people ashore if we can expand the industry but we do require <Col N="1147" /> a considerable increase, and a guaranteed increase, in catching power for those particular processing plants.  The result of that will be that not only will there be inshore fishermen making a living from the sea but their families will be able to work in the canneries, to associate themselves with the many operations involved in handling great quantities of fish landed at our ports and harbours.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of the House I must repeat some of the facts in regard to fish intake and fish markets, which show that the market is extremely buoyant and shows no danger of being over-supplied at the present time.  The weight of fish of all kinds, pelagic and demersal, brought to our ports in 1956 was 377,000 cwts.  By 1958 it had risen to 547,000 cwts., an increase of 45 per cent., and the total value of the pelagic and demersal fish went up by 30 per cent. in the same period.  No one can say that there is any suggestion there that the market is beginning to collapse, or there is any danger of inshore fishermen suffering grave loss in revenue.  I wish we could show the same results in all other aspects of our economy as the figures represent there.</P>
      <P>The value of shellfish, lobsters, crayfish, prawns and the other species, increased from £233,000 in 1956 to £291,000 in 1958, and the total value of all fish caught in this country has gone up by 28 per cent since 1956, from £1,020,000 to £1,316,000 in 1958. The number of boats have not increased proportionately showing there has been a really lively and satisfactory increase in the turnover which is benefiting an increasing number of fishermen and which is a very satisfactory feature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Landings last year went up 4 per cent in price on an average.  I should like to stress again the fact that in the last three months of 1958, the intake of whiting suddenly increased by 76 per cent and the price went up by 9 per cent.  I was amazed at the fact that a market could suddenly take so much additional whiting, without quite a severe contraction in the price, indicating that there were people looking for fish all over the country who had <Col N="1148" /> not been able to get it in the last three months of 1957 and who were able to buy it in 1958 and in spite of the increase, were able to pay a higher price per cwt. than they did in 1957.</P>
    <P>For the first four months of this year, the total value of fish of all types caught has gone up compared with the first four months of last year by 35 per cent.  Again, that increase consists to a large degree of a big increase in the intake of whiting which is our commonest fish.  And, again, the total catch of whiting went up by 40 per cent and the total value by 75 per cent.  There is no one who knows anything about the fish business or any other business who can say there is an immediate danger, barring accidents and unforeseen circumstances, of a collapse in fish prices at the present time, or that there would be any danger if a few trawlers, of the larger type, whose capacity I have indicated is not so much greater than the trawlers operated now, were to come and land fresh fish on the Dublin market.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is not the main purpose of their operation.  The main purpose is to supply canners.  But I want to be absolutely frank about this matter.  It so happens that there are three larger trawlers operated.  They all happened to put their fish on the Dublin market in the same week.  In that week, there was a total of 3,834 boxes of fish auctioned on the Dublin market.  That was about two and a half weeks ago or some time within that period.  Of that total, 538 boxes came from these three larger trawlers and the price of fish did not decrease that week, although there was a sudden immediate increase in one week of 14 per cent. in the amount of fish thrown on the Dublin market.</P>
    <P>I was again surprised.  I have already referred to these big increases in the intake of whiting in the last three months of last year and in the first five months of this year which were not reflected in decreased prices.  It would have seemed that a sudden increase of 14 per cent. in one week when the weather was fairly warm and when a number of our education institutions, boarding schools, had closed, there should be some decrease in demand. But there was not, and I asked for a <Col N="1149" /> report on the market.  I found that a considerable proportion of that extra 14 per cent.&mdash;not necessarily the fish that came from the trawlers but of the total amount of fish that came on the market&mdash;was bought by the wholesalers who specialise in selling fish in the working districts of Dublin so that the working people of Dublin were able to buy 14 per cent. more fish in the same week without there being any reduction in the price.</P>
    <P>I mention these things to show how far it is possible to exaggerate the effects of a few slightly larger trawlers operating to supply fresh fish to the Dublin market.  In the first five months of this year the price of whiting, whose intake was very much increased, went up from an average of £1 12s. a cwt. to £2 a cwt.  We can ask ourselves what is to be the limit in regard to these increases in price.  Have we reached the stage where we want a diversified industry in which every section will be able to make a reasonable profit and in which at the same time the interests of the inshore fishermen will be preserved?</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that we are the only maritime State where there are not canneries all along the coast, where there are unfilled quick-freeze plants, where there are no trawlers going out to the middle waters, and I should state in that connection once again, that nobody can give me any reason why, as a maritime country, we should be taking only 10 per cent. of the total fish caught in waters classified as Irish when we have an export market available and when we can export fish into Britain, either landing them directly at ports or consigning them from our own ports free of duty, and when the British annually import fish to the total value of £33,000,000.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly aware that there are difficulties in all these things and I do not promise any rapid changes of any kind.  If we can bring about an increase in the turnover of the whole industry ashore and afloat, a steady increase, we shall be doing the best thing possible.  Of course it depends on the general co-operation of private enterprise and equally on the continuing work of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> I should mention the fact that it so happens that the Galway processing plant and the Schull processing plant which are now opened, were finally sanctioned by Deputy Dillon.  In the case of the Galway plant the plans had been made by the previous Government but in 1955 Deputy Dillon had the opportunity of examining the plans before the working drawings were accepted.  The same thing applies to the Schull processing plant.  In fact, I think that plant came into being as a result of sanction by Deputy Dillon. There is also the Killybegs An Bord Iascaigh Mhara quick-freezing plant. Those three plants, operating full time, can take anything from 70,000 cwt. to 140,000 cwt. of fish per year and two of them are situated in places where, up to now, there has not been any great herring fishing.  That means they were intended to quick-freeze white fish, demersal fish, cod, plaice, whiting and so on.  That represents an increase of anything from 20 to 33 per cent. of our present demersal catch.</P>
    <P>Why were those plants built unless it was envisaged that there would be sufficient catching power to fill them? The position at the moment is that we have not what is termed in other countries the dual price system for fishermen under which the amount of fish that is coming in sufficiently large so that in times of relative scarcity the price of fish is at a higher level and at other times the supplies of fish can be quick frozen and preserved for a number of months and put on the market again when the scarcity comes, at a lower rate than normal.  The market for fish among our own people for immediate consumption is so large that it is almost impossible to purchase that fish either for those plants or for the fairly considerable quick-freeze storage facilities in Dublin. There are, I think, three firms who have cold storage where normally fish is quick frozen and is retained for scarce periods.</P>
    <P>As I have said the market has been so lively and the market for fish has grown to such an extent that we are probably the only country in Northern Europe with quick freeze plants empty and our fishmeal plant unused and closed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> I am very glad that the people are eating more fish.  I am delighted to see that it is possible for us to encourage a new policy in an atmosphere of buoyancy, which I am not exaggerating in the slightest degree.</P>
    <P>To give another illustration of market buoyancy, three or four years ago, at this time of the year, everybody rather dreaded the state of the fish market.  If the fish was extremely fresh, it was possible in warm weather to buy some for quick freeze.  If the weather was very warm, there tended to be a temporary collapse, at least, in prices, due to the closing of institutions and the weather conditions.  Nothing of that kind has occurred this year or in 1958.  We have to go back to 1957 for a period in June, when for a brief period of two weeks there was a collapse in price for some varieties of fish, because of these conditions, the closing of institutions and the very hot weather.  We have not had to face anything of that kind this year.</P>
    <P>No one wants to see a fishmeal plant, that can take 10,000 tons of fish a year, idle.  The plant has been built under the auspices of the Atlantic Fisheries Company, which is ultimately a branch of the Venner-Gren Enterprises. Mr. Venner-Gren has decided to leave all his enterprises, when he dies, as trusts for the scientific education of people who are concerned with the industry.  In view of that, I should like to see the fishmeal plant operate as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that, even although the east Anglian herring fishery has declined and that, as a result, prices are livelier for herring and, therefore, it is difficult to supply the fishmeal plant with herring because prices are so high, the fact remains that in a number of countries in Europe there is an industry which specialises in fishmeal and in Denmark there are boats that even under present conditions do nothing but fish for fishmeal.  I am not saying that we could, easily, repeat those conditions here.  I am merely saying that I think I am correct in stating that this is the only country in Northern <Col N="1152" /> Europe where the fishmeal plant facilities are unused.</P>
    <P>In other countries, the fishmeal plants are operating, even though prices for herring are high.  The company which established this fishmeal plant have stated that they intend to build a cannery, so that they will be able to diversify their operations and employ their workers in Killybegs for some parts of the year on fishmeal and at other times of the year in canning. It is because of that diversified operation that I was particularly anxious to ensure that they could provide adequate catching power for themselves. The purpose of the Dutch trawlers in Killybegs is mainly to supply the cannery and the fishmeal plant and, when the occasion serves and without bringing down the value of fish to catastrophically low figures, they will put fish on the market.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear again that this horrific picture, of the inshore fishermen being ruined, also affects the economies of the larger trawlers.  The overhead costs of large trawlers are very high; they cannot afford a big decrease in the price of fish.  That has to be considered in examining this whole question.</P>
    <P>The home consumption of fish, I am very glad to say, bounded by approximately ten per cent. in one year.  There are very many towns where no fish can be obtained.  As Deputy Kyne said, there are towns within 20 miles of harbours where fish is impossible to procure on Thursdays and Fridays. There are inland towns where there is a grossly insufficient supply of fish. Fish is so expensive in Dublin, both in relation to the price paid to the fishermen and to the retail price that for weeks at a time many people have ceased to buy it.  I am convinced that the general standard of living in this country has increased sufficiently to ensure an increased consumption of fish of anything up to 50 per cent. in the next three years.  Any person circulating in the country and going to public functions, seeing the many occasions of reunions of the many associations of every description, will notice that wherever fish can be obtained, more often than not it is put <Col N="1153" /> on the menu at the dinner or lunch provided.  Even in the case of associations of all descriptions representing all sections of the population, the whole tradition is changing in regard to the consumption of fish.</P>
    <P>There was a very terrible time in our history when the last recourse of the desperately poor was to buy salted mackerel.  People remember that.  That tradition is passing away.  The establishment of modern stoves in countless rural residences makes it easier to cook fish in a variety of ways.  One of the satisfactory features of our modern life, thanks to rural electrification, is to go into the houses of farmers of 15, 20 or 30 acres and although they have a hard fight to live and although the incomes are naturally small, you will see a modern cooking stove; and a modern cooking stove means the capacity to cook fish in a variety of ways and to have it when it is available.</P>
    <P>We have not even begun to advertise fish.  I, unlike some people, have a real and absolute belief in the power of advertising.  We have that recourse, if it should be necessary at any time to stimulate the sale of fish.</P>
    <P>There are a great many grocers and other retailers throughout the country to whom I have spoken myself in my wanderings, who tell me that they are not prepared to stock fish, with all its difficulties and messiness, until they can be assured of an absolutely certain supply, at least every Thursday and Friday.  They say it is not worth while and I do not blame them.  Nobody would want to set aside a place in a shop, to provide all the cleaning facilities and to take all the care to ensure that the fish would remain fresh, if it is to appear one Thursday and then not appear for three weeks because of scarcity.</P>
    <P>We know that absolutely fresh fish is the best of all; absolutely fresh fish quick frozen under perfect conditions and maintained at a low temperature can be very much more satisfactory than second-class fresh fish, and it retains its taste.  We have not even begun the work of extending the quick-frozen distribution, using quick-freeze cabinets, throughout the country. <Col N="1154" /> That is only in its infancy.  Some of the grocers who had enough initiative to instal quick-freezing machinery of that kind have found supplies irregular. I hope they have been able to use the plant for other goods&mdash;for turkeys, chickens and other foods.  The supply of quick-frozen fish has been grossly inadequate for the expanding market. I think I have shown that we anticipate an increase in the consumption of fish in this country.</P>
    <P>In regard to the export market, I have to rely on the experts in relation to exports of pelagic fish&mdash;herring, canned mackerel and sprat.  There is no doubt that we can see an era of expansion.  In regard to white fish, as a result of contact with the Billingsgate market, as a result of sending our own officers over to Great Britain and as a result of sending some of the executives of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to Great Britain, I am absolutely certain that we can take advantage of the extreme freshness of our fish.  I know from my own contacts with Billingsgate that if we can ensure that white fish, surplus to our own needs, is absolutely fresh and well iced, it will get a satisfactory price on the British market.  They will be willing and anxious to take it.</P>
    <P>We have already arranged for certain reduction in freight rates along the whole southern coast, from which the exporters are deriving benefit.  A special freight rate can be arranged for bulk quantities, I am quite certain, from Dublin to London as soon as the supply becomes regular.  The one essential requirement in the export of white fish is that the supply must be regular.  Nobody will bother dealing with odd quantities of white fish.  The fish must be known for its quality and its origin must be reasonably ascertained. If it is really and genuinely fresh, then I am certain we have an export market for our white fish.</P>
    <P>There is nothing particularly remarkable about that export potential. As everybody knows, in the past ten years the variety of our exports has grown enormously.  We have today a great many exports we did not have before the war and we did not have in 1947, and why should not fish be one of them?  Why should we be forever <Col N="1155" /> deprived of an export market for white fish as well, as for pelagic fish, herring, and so forth?  Some of our fishermen, even in large boats, are fishing for lobster and making a very satisfactory income therefrom, particularly at certain times of the year.</P>
    <P>A number of fishermen have specialised in the catching of what we call Dublin Bay prawns along the north eastern coast and have made additions to their income in that way. It has been very fortunate that there has been a supply of prawns available because the general intake of fish in the Irish Sea has not been very satisfactory either this year or last year. We are unable to determine the reason with certainty.  It may be overfishing or some temporary condition, but that has been reflected in the figures from British boats in the inshore and middle water fisheries in the Irish Sea.  But there has been the growth of the Dunmore East industry and also the growth of Dublin Bay prawns, or what is known in the world at large as Norwegian lobster.</P>
    <P>Summing up the position, I believe and trust that there will be a considerable increase in consumption.  I believe and trust that exports are possible, and, in fact, exports have increased by thirty per cent. in the last two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The total exports of fish have gone up in value from £1,000,000 to £1,300,000.  The export of salmon has remained more or less the same.  Most of what we exported was herring or shell fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the retailers are capable of making a far bigger effort at selling fish as soon as supplies become regular.  I believe we should establish canneries and increase shore employment.  We have a rigid quota on the importation of fresh fish as a protection for the Irish fishermen.  We have also the clause in this Bill which enables me, as Minister in charge of Fisheries, to ensure that trawlers of over a given size fish by methods which are conducive to the general prosperity of the industry.  In that way, it is possible for me to ensure that these <Col N="1156" /> disasters which have been predicted will never eventuate.</P>
    <P>I need hardly add it would be most unlikely for me to increase the grants for boats, lower the rate of interest, subsidise ice and provide training schemes for fishermen if I really intended to demolish the inshore fishing industry.  I do not know whether any other Deputy thinks I am insane, but I should like to reiterate that it is not my intention to destroy the fishing industry.  Such operations have been carried out in a number of small European countries; and, through this method of control quite clearly left open for me to use, I do not believe that any of these disasters will happen.</P>
    <P>I should say, in conclusion, that I have spoken with the National Fishermen's Association on the matter.  While some of them are disturbed at the fact that there has been a change and that three trawlers slightly larger&mdash;not much larger&mdash;than the boats which are fishing at present are supplying white fish to the market, I think they have accepted my promises.  I attended a meeting on Saturday last and at the end of the meeting there was no indication that they were not prepared, at least for the moment, to trust my judgement in regard to the matter. When I speak of my judgement I mean the advice given to me by the very excellent officers of the Department and by the directors of An Bórd Iascaigh Mhára.  When I receive that advice I have to use my own common sense and judgement, for what it is worth, in making the necessary decisions.</P>
    <P>I believe that the fishermen understand the position now.  I am very glad in some ways that there was a procession of fishermen through Dublin.  They have never been organised before.  Long before any of these events took place, I asked the fishermen in the major ports to found a National Fishermen's Association.  I hope it will long survive and that, by that means, we can have more close consultation between all sections of the industry.  I do not want to see the position in which the inshore fishermen, the retailers and the wholesalers are at loggerheads with one another. <Col N="1157" /> There is a far more friendly feeling between all interests than there used to be; and, as is the case in agriculture and industry, there are contacts between all the groups.  I hope that the Fishermen's Association will help us to establish much closer contacts at all levels of production and distribution.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say any more except once again to point to the fact that I have the power to control the numbers of larger trawlers, that I intend to use it for the benefit of the existing fishermen and also to enable us to diversify the industry and increase the volume of inshore employment which, in turn, would benefit the fishermen and their families.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Bankers' Books Evidence (Amendment) Bill, 1959&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of this Bill is to remedy defects in the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, to which attention has been drawn by the Irish Banks Standing Committee and in the report of the Committee on Company Law Reform.  To come within the provisions of the Act of 1879, a bank must either comply with the definition of &ldquo;bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;banker&rdquo; in Section 9 of that Act or comply with the provisions of Section 11 of the Revenue Friendly Societies and National Debt Act, 1882.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To fulfil these requirements a bank must either have duly made a return to the Revenue Commissioners pursuant to the provisions of Section 22 of the Bankers (Ireland) Act, 1845, or else have duly furnished to the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies a list and summary as required by the second part of the Companies Act, 1862, with the addition of a statement showing the places where it carries on business.  The list referred to is that required by Section 26 of the Companies Act, 1862, which has been repealed <Col N="1158" /> and re-enacted by Section 26 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, and is a list of members with a summary of the share capital and balance sheet.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bankers (Ireland) Act, 1845, expressly absolved the Bank of Ireland from the obligation of making a return thereunder and, since it is not a Joint Stock Company, it has always been excluded from the privileges of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act.  This was never intended and is due to the fact that the special position of the Bank of Ireland was overlooked when the provisions of Section 9 of the Act of 1879 were being framed.  The other banks, that is to say, those which were in existence in 1882 and are still in business were, to begin with, all entitled to the benefits of the Act of 1879 as they were in a position to fulfil one or other of the requirements of the statutory definition.</P>
    <P>However, on the establishment of the State, doubts arose as to whether the provisions of the Banker's Books Evidence Act continued to apply to banks registered in England and Northern Ireland.  These banks no longer furnish the requisite list and summary under the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, which has been repealed in England and Northern Ireland, and have been relieved by Subsection 6 of Section 42 of the Currency Act, 1927 from making the return required by Section 22 of the Bankers (Ireland) Act, 1845.</P>
    <P>The advice I have got is that the Act does not now apply to such banks, including such well-known banks as the National Bank, the Northern Bank, the Provincial Bank of Ireland and the Ulster Bank.  Thus, under the law as it stands, no fewer than five of the principal banks carrying on business here, including the Bank of Ireland, are outside the scope of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act.</P>
    <P>It is primarily to remedy this defect that the present Bill has been introduced but advantage is being taken of the opportunity to simplify proofs by specifying by name the eight banks mentioned in the Third Schedule of the Central Bank Act, 1942, the Post <Col N="1159" /> Office Savings-Bank and the Trustee Savings-Banks.  A new interpretation is being given to the expression &ldquo;bankers' books&rdquo; which takes account of modern methods of record keeping and of the fact that the old-fashioned books and ledgers have been largely dispensed with in the banking business and replaced by loose-leaf filing systems and cards.  The statutory enactments which it is proposed to repeal will be rendered obsolete by the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, was designed to relieve bankers from the great inconvenience of having to attend Court and bring with them the books in daily use in their business.  To this extent, it is an Act for the relief of bankers.  It is also an Act for the benefit of suitors since it enables copies of entries in a banker's book to be given in evidence and facilitates the procuring of such evidence by allowing any party to a legal proceeding to apply to the Court for permission to inspect and to take copies of such entries for the purpose of such proceeding.  The object of the Bill is to make the Act work in the way it was intended to work and I commend it to the consideration of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister started off by saying that the purpose of the Bill was to remedy a defect in the 1879 Act.  I do not think that is exactly true. The 1879 Act was entirely satisfactory, in itself.  The object of the Bill is to make the 1879 Act work in our modern conditions, if one may use the term &ldquo;modern&rdquo; to apply not merely to 1959 but to the period since 1922.  Of course, there is no objection from this side of the House to such a suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little intrigued in relation to certain aspects of the drafting of the Bill, but they are purely matters of detail.  The banks which are named in the Bill are, of course, the principal banks carrying on business here.  They are some of the banks, I understand, which hold licences under the Central Bank Act, quite apart from being named in that Bill.  I was, therefore, rather at a loss to understand why the Schedule has been drafted to name the banks which are named in sub-clause (a), and then sub-clause (b) refers to <Col N="1160" />&ldquo;any other person who is the holder of a licence issued under Section 47 of the Central Bank Act.&rdquo;  It would appear to me that one clause would cover it and that it would apply to all those people who were licensed under the 1942 Act.  Maybe the purpose, as these are the main banks, is to avoid the main banks having to produce the certificate which is covered by sub-clause (3).  I do not know whether it is to ease proofs in evidence in that respect.  If so, it is understandable.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, right and proper also that advantage should be taken of the opportunity to take official statutory cognisance of the modern method of keeping books, with loose-leaf ledgers, micro-filming in certain circumstances, and so forth.  I am frankly at a loss to know what is the meaning, in clause (b) of sub-clause (2), of the new Section 9, of &ldquo;cover documents in manuscript.&rdquo; That is a new phrase to me and if the Minister can tell me what &ldquo;cover documents in manuscript&rdquo; means, I shall be grateful for his assistance.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of sub-clause (3) is to provide the modern Irish equivalent of the proof of what is a bank in substitution for the somewhat cumbersome provision in the original Act of 1879.  In any event, it has no application here since the Central Bank Act was passed in 1942 and indeed, possibly, earlier, for all I know.  I wonder can the Minister tell me why, in addition to the reference to the savings banks in the four big cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, there is also reference to a savings bank in Monaghan.  Perhaps Deputy Dillon could enlighten us in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a savings bank in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but Cork is a city and Monaghan is not.  It is a town.  What is the significance of that, that Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford are mentioned and then we go into the country district of Monaghan?  Is there any particular significance?  Is it that the people in that part of the country are hardheaded? Or is it a survival of a wider savings bank movement that once had its roots in the Six Counties?  It does <Col N="1161" /> seem somewhat peculiar that we should have Monaghan alone of all the country areas, outside the big cities.  I presume there must have been some reason for bringing Monaghan in but I am afraid my history is not sufficiently strong to be able to give the explanation.  Perhaps the Minister is more steeped in the history of savings banks than I am.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to make it quite clear that a document produced by any photographic or photostatic process does include a microfilm.  I presume it does.  I am not, however, an expert on photographic work and I do not know whether or not that is so. It would seem to me clearly desirable that it should be covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has practically explained the situation as far as the Bill is concerned.  We are naming these banks for the specific purpose of avoiding proof of the issue of a licence.  I understand that suitors will be facilitated by this.  We are bringing in other banks so that they will get the benefit of the Act.  The Act does not apply to them at the moment.  We are naming the trustee savings banks for the same reason.</P>
      <P>I cannot say very much about the history of the banks to which the Deputy referred other than to say that we are trying to cover all these banks. Some of them are of a very minor type, but it is our endeavour now to cover the whole lot of them.</P>

      <P>There are quite a number of concerns that are not banks in the ordinary sense but which carry licences.  We hope to bring in all of these.  In future, instead of some bankers having to bring in ledgers and other weighty documents, it will be possible for the suitor to go in and examine the books in the bank.  It will also be possible for the court to accept the evidence produced as being <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the fact that the copies produced are part of the accounts of the bank concerned.  The same law will apply to all banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a limited company to revive the project for the production of grass meal from grass grown on reclaimed bogland in the Bangor Erris area, Co. Mayo.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that the Grass Meal (Production) Act, 1953, provided for the establishment of a limited company&mdash;Min Fhéir Teoranta&mdash;to undertake the drainage and cultivation of bogland in the Bangor Erris area, the processing of grass and other plants, and the carrying on of kindred and incidental activities.  Min Fhéir Teoranta was incorporated in March, 1954, and in accordance with the provisions of the Act, its principal functions were the acquisition, drainage and cultivation of bogland and the processing of grass and other plants for sale, including, in particular, the manufacture of grass meal.</P>
      <P>The nominal share capital of the Company was £100,000, to be subscribed by the Minister for Finance, and the Act also provided for grants, not exceeding in the aggregate £165,000, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas to be applied in defraying capital expenses.  The Company commenced operations in the spring of 1954 on the ploughing and sod fencing of lands at Glenamoy leased from Bord na Móna.  It was proposed to have 500 acres ready for grass growing in 1955, and to bring a further 1,500 acres into cultivation at the rate of 500 acres a year.  The Company also proposed to proceed immediately with the erection of a grass meal factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June, 1955, the then Government decided that the plans for the erection of a grass meal factory should be abandoned and that portion of the lands occupied by the Company should be used by the Department of Agriculture for experiments on the reclamation of blanket bog and that the balance of the lands should be <Col N="1165" /> used by the Department of Lands for afforestation purposes.  In accordance with these decisions, the affairs of the Company were wound up early in 1956.</P>
    <P>In August, 1957, my predecessor appointed a Committee to examine the practicability of reviving the project, and the Report of the Committee was published in November, 1958.  The principal conclusions in the Committee's Report which was unanimous, were that grass meal can be produced competitively in relation to current market prices from grass on reclaimed bogland after a period of five years from the commencement of reclamation, and that, taking account of the potential home and export trade, a market over and above that catered for or likely to be catered for by existing grass meal producers should be capable of development to provide an outlet for the output of a plant at Glenamoy.</P>
    <P>The Committee recommended that the project should be revived and that an independent statutory company should be established to operate the project, and that the company should be provided with a sum not exceeding £165,000 by way of a non-repayable grant to defray capital expenses and a further sum of £30,000 in the form of share capital for working capital.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House provides for the establishment of a limited company, Min Fhéir (1959) Teóranta, to which, with certain amendments, the provisions of the Grass Meal (Production) Act, 1953, shall apply.  The principal amendment proposed in the provisions of the 1953 Act is that the share capital of the company shall be £200,000 instead of £100,000, the provision for the making of grants up to £165,000 to the company being at the same time dropped. This is the normal method of financing a company undertaking activities of an industrial or commercial character and has been adopted on the advice of the Minister for Finance, who will subscribe the share capital.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the project will operate on an economic basis after an initial development period of five years.  Deputies will appreciate the very great need, on economic and <Col N="1166" /> social grounds, for a suitable form of industrial development in an area completely devoid of normal development opportunities.  The principle of granting financial assistance from State funds to counter the economic handicaps which would otherwise prevent the establishment of industries in such areas has already been accepted in the Undeveloped Areas Acts, and many centres in the less developed western part of the country have already benefited from the establishment of new industries with the aid of grants provided under these Acts.</P>
    <P>However, the competitive disadvantages arising from remoteness from the main centres of consumption and the lack of indigenous raw materials make industrial development in areas such as Bangor Erris a matter of peculiar difficulty. The natural resources of these areas consist almost entirely of extensive peat bogs.  Considerable progress has been made in the development of bogs for the production of peat as fuel. There are, however, areas of bogland that will not be required for the production of fuel for many years to come and the contribution of these bogs to the economy of the Western areas in particular and the country generally will be immeasurably enhanced by establishing that by drainage and cultivation they can provide the raw material for economic industrial activities.</P>
    <P>Having considered the unanimous recommendations of the Committee, whose report was duly circulated to Deputies, and which, incidentally, I would commend to Deputies who have not yet read it, the Government are convinced that the establishment of a grass meal plant in the area concerned using as a raw material grass grown on reclaimed bogland, is a project eminently worthy of support and one to which I would ask the Dáil readily to assent to by agreeing to this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a peculiarly daft Fianna Fáil aberration.  Grass meal is a raw material of the agricultural industry.  Its only use is its incorporation into animal rations for conversion into livestock and the end product which is saleable, from the point of view of the agricultural industry, <Col N="1167" /> is the livestock reared on the compound feed of which grass meal constitutes a part.  Up to about four or five years ago, grass meal was incorporated in compound feed for livestock, particularly for fowl, for two reasons: first, its protein content and, secondly, its carotene and vitamin content. About five years ago, the economics of using it for its protein content ceased because protein in other forms became readily available at approximately half the cost of protein derived from grass meal but there remained the consideration that for vitamin content it had a certain value.</P>
      <P>Since then, synthetic vitamins in solid form have become universally available and are now a very much cheaper source of vitamin than grass meal is or can be.  Prior to the war, the source of vitamins as generally provided for compound feed was cod liver oil, but it was discovered that storage tended to reduce the vitamin content made available through the incorporation of cod liver oil in animal feed.  It was then that the compounders turned to grass meal because it did not deteriorate so rapidly in storage but now that the synthetic vitamin is available, grass meal is worth even less than it was worth five years ago as a source of vitamins.</P>
      <P>People who go daft in this way lose all capacity for perspective.  This is a silly political stunt to revive the waning fortunes of a few poor old Fianna Fáil dead-beats in North Mayo.  We all know that.  If it is necessary to spend a couple of hundred thousand pounds to keep them afloat for a while longer, I blame them for appropriating the money for such a purpose.  I am afraid this will become a permanent burden on people engaged in the broiler industry or in highly competitive forms of agricultural output and that they will have to foot the bill for this folly.</P>
      <P>You could grow grass on Nelson's hat on the top of Nelson's Pillar or on the carpet of Dáil Éireann, if you were prepared to spend enough money in the operation.  You can grow grass anywhere.  You could grow grass on the Minister's head or on my head, if you were prepared to undergo the inconvenience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You could grow grass where you could not grow hair and that is just as true of the Minister as it is of myself.  The point I want to make is that you could grow grass on the table here or anywhere else, if you were prepared to spend the money. But surely our whole approach should be, if we want to establish a grassmeal factory here, that the raw material of the industry should be provided in the place where it is possible to produce it?</P>
      <P>If there is one place in Ireland where you ought not to grow grass as the raw material of a dried grass meal factory, it is on blanket bog in Glenamoy.  You have the whole of County Meath and of Westmeath.  You have some of the most fertile grassland in the known world on which to grow all the grass you want for conversion into grassmeal, and by heavens, the Fianna Fáil Government migrate to Glenamoy to grow grass as the raw material of a dried grass meal plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we came into office in 1954 this farce was in progress.  It was quite clear that it was a desirable thing to provide employment in Glenamoy in so far as it could productively be done. I had long desired to see established in this country, with its very wide acreage of bogland, what was urgently needed &mdash;a peatland research station on which we could try out how best extensive areas of blanket bog could profitably be used for any purpose.  Accordingly, we wound up this piece of codology and took steps to establish one of the best peatland research stations in Europe.  As we went along, we resolved the problems, which were quite formidable, of bringing power to the site, of erecting buildings on the quality of foundation that was to be found in blanket bog and of establishing a peatland research station.  All that has had this quite astonishing consequence.  I got a very civil invitation last week to attend the opening of the Glenamoy Peatland and Research Station by Mr. P. Smith, Minister for Agriculture, to which I was obliged to say that I thought my appearance there would be a little incongruous as I had opened it <Col N="1169" /> myself four years ago and twice inspected it as Minister for Agriculture. But we are about to open it again in the course of the next week and the Minister for Agriculture will open it.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister for Agriculture will sing its praises as they ought to be sung.  Really useful research work is proceeding and this work is attracting the attention of scientists from all over the world and will, I hope, be of very material value to this country.  I do not propose to enlarge on that now, but all sorts of strange and interesting things have been discovered already in the very early stages of that experimental station whereunder it would appear that certain raw materials in the form of cellulose might very well be grown on bogland and very remuneratively and also that this type of blanket bog could very easily be converted to the production of vegetables and other horticultural crops.</P>
    <P>The one crop that nobody but a lunatic would grow in Glenamoy is grass as a raw material for a dried grass meal factory.  It is not impossible that you might grow grass there on a certain rotation, provided facilities for consuming <i>it in situ</i> were available.  Certain experiments were in progress, I believe, to see in how far grass grown there might be depastured by cattle and sheep.  It is not impossible that something of value might emerge from those investigations.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose many Deputies have bothered to read the report of the Committee on the Glenamoy Grass Meal Project.  On page 12 of the report, it is pointed out:</P>
    <P>The Min Fhéir Teoranta estimate showed £17 7 6 per acre as the annual cost of uncut grass (excluding the initial capital cost of reclamation), whereas the Department of Agriculture estimate was £28 9 8 per acre.</P>
    <P>Which estimate is likely to be the more accurate?  On page 15 of the report, paragraph 20 says:</P>
    <P>In more recent years, Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann Teoranta interested themselves in bog reclamation. <Col N="1170" /> They carried out experiments on three plots of cutaway bog made available to them by Bord na Móna, and on one plot of privately owned virgin bog at Kenmare, County Kerry.  It was stated in evidence that crops and grass were successfully grown in all cases.  At a later stage the Company bought an area of 2,300 acres of high bog at Gowla, County Galway, with the primary purpose of producing beet. This land has been drained and cultivated, and a variety of crops, including grass, has been produced with satisfactory results.  Rotation is beneficial and grass has shown itself to be a particularly suitable reclamation crop.  Large areas of the bog are accordingly sown to grass, and the grass is converted into grass meal which is disposed of through the ordinary commercial channels.</P>
    <P>That is the conclusion of paragraph 20.  Has anybody any costings on the production of grass at Gowla Bog? Has anybody ever learned what the cultivation of crops on Gowla Bog has cost?  Am I right in thinking that the bulk of the grass meal on Gowla Bog was incorporated in the manufacture of compound feeding stuffs by Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann, Teoranta, itself?  There is nothing in this report which shows any reliable figure of the cost of producing crops on Gowla Bog.  I have never been able to get these particulars.</P>
    <P>There are certain other paragraphs in this report to which I wish to refer. Paragraph 52 on page 32 deals with the prospects of an export market:</P>
    <P>The Six County market, however, seems to offer the only worthwhile export outlet.  Occasional lots of grass meal have been exported to Britain and the Far East, but there is little prospect of developing any regular trade.  The most that can be hoped for in Britain is that there may be periodic shortages, as any likelihood of a continued shortage would possibly encourage the reopening of plants there which went out of production in the last three or four years; and in regard to the Far East, the high cost of <Col N="1171" /> transhipment and the availability of meal at low prices from other sources, make the export of grass meal from this country to such places as Singapore impracticable.  The position on the Continent is that there is a surplus of production.</P>
    <P>Can any Deputy imagine why the grass meal plants that were in operation in England have gone out of production? If they give it sufficient thought, it may dawn upon them that the market for grass meal has collapsed in England.  Will Deputies ask themselves why has it collapsed in England, and if the market for grass meal has collapsed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, why are we starting to manufacture grass meal in Glenamoy from the poorest possible raw material we can get?  I am full of hope that Deputy Haughey's incisive brain will be able to help us over this dilemma. I am sure he has read this account.</P>

      <P>I do not blame the Deputy.  I was wondering if he has read this report and applied his costing accountant's mind to the calculations that adorn these pages.  On page 34 in paragraph 56, words of rather sinister import are employed:</P>
      <P>Speaking of the scope for the greater use of grass meal, Professor Sheehy referred to the change which is taking place in the methods of producing pigs and poultry in recent years.  The tendency is towards production on factory lines and standard compound rations are in demand for convenience.</P>
      <P>If I may interpolate a comment upon that&mdash;a thoroughly unsound approach to the production of livestock in this country which should be founded on the growing of feeding stuffs by the producer.</P>
      <P>This is tending to increase the demand for compounds for pigs and poultry.</P>
      <P>However, the following are the significant words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said that it would be reasonable to include grass meal in all <Col N="1172" /> these compounds and that it would be justified, though not necessary, on nutritive grounds to make this compulsory.</P>
    <P>What a very nice method of providing a market for a grass meal factory in Glenamoy: if no other means is found of disposing of the output of this industry, make it compulsory.  It is just as simple as that.  The paragraph goes on:</P>
    <P>He mentioned, however, that in the case of broilers the pigments of grass meal produce yellow fleshed carcases, whereas the synthetic Vitamin A does not have this effect.</P>
    <P>While he mentioned that, it is even more important that synthetic Vitamin A now costs about one half the price of grass meal in providing corresponding quantities of the vitamins available.  I wish Deputies who have any interest in this would read this report.  It is a most informative document and reaches the astonishing conclusion that we ought to produce grass meal.  However, I should like Deputies to make a special note of the terms in which this conclusion is reached.  Paragraph 70 is a summary of conclusions and recommendations:</P>
    <P>Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) Conclusions.</P>
    <P>(i)  On the basis of estimated costs of production, grass meal can be produced competitively&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is a very informative phrase.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to current market prices, from grass grown on reclaimed bogland without a continuing subsidy after a period of 5 years from the commencement of reclamation, provided the rate of production is 2,000/2,500 a year...</P>
    <P>When you put in all those provisos and the happy provision that nothing is to be expected until five years have elapsed, you have a pretty good bet in passing this Bill because nobody will have the slightest interest in what will happen in about seven years from today, which is the earliest date by which this report forecasts grass meal <Col N="1173" /> will be produced on a basis which will enable it to be sold without substantial subsidy.  By that time, nobody but lunatics will be using grass meal and this whole place will fold up like the alcohol factories and everybody will have forgotten about it.  Having told us earlier that there was no prospect of any export trade except what existed in Northern Ireland and that four plants had closed down in Great Britain in the previous year owing to lack of demand, they say in subparagraph (ii):</P>
    <P>Taking account of the potential home and export trade, a market, over and above that catered for or likely to be catered for by existing grass meal producers, should be capable of development to provide an outlet for the output of a plant at Glenamoy.</P>
    <P>Glenamoy cannot function according to that except on the basis of an output of 2,000/2,500 tons.  Existing consumption of grass meal is already being catered for by the members of the Irish Crop Driers Association from grass produced in more likely centres than Glenamoy as set out in paragraph 58, which says:</P>
    <P>Taking all evidence and views into account and having regard to the confidence shown by the commercial producers in the future of grass meal by their continuing expansion of production, we consider that it is unlikely that the home market will <Col N="1174" /> fall below its present level of 7,500 tons in the foreseeable future.  The compounders and the other expert witnesses were all agreed that any change over from grass meal to synthetics would have to be very slow and gradual as farmers do not like to see changes in the appearance of the food they buy.</P>
    <P>Did you ever hear such tripe in your life?  Does the Minister really believe that?  The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we do not think that the threat from synthetic vitamins is as serious as was suggested by one of our witnesses.  Synthetics have been available and have been used by compounders since 1954, but in the interval there has been an increase rather than a contraction in the consumption of grass meal, particularly between 1956 and 1957. In 1956, 2,100 tons of a total production of 8,100 tons were exported so that home consumption would have amounted to only 6,500 tons (assuming imports of 500 tons from the Six Counties) as compared with about 7,500 tons in 1957.  The weight of the evidence given to us is that grass meal has special properties...</P>
