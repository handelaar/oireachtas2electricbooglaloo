      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>, in accordance with promise given at last meeting that he would have in form the amendment to the Constitution, presented the draft alteration and said he thought it would meet with the approval of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE, ART Ó CONCHUBHAIR</NameTxt>
      <P>,² asked that the draft should be typed and circulated to every Teachta before it was adopted as it was a very important matter.</P>
      <P>2.  Art Ó Conchubhair was described on 23 August 1921 as Substitute Minister for Agriculture. Robert Barton was Minister for Agriculture.  In the new ministry appointed on 26 August 1921 Art O'Connor became Minister for Agriculture.</P>

    <Title>ALTERATION OF MINISTRY OF IRISH TO MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>proposed that the Ministry of Irish be changed to one of Education. The question of education was an important one and of course Irish would be an important part of it.  It was obvious the Minister in charge should be capable of dealing with the part referring to Irish but he thought the Department should have a wider meaning than at present.</P>

    <Title>MOTION RE MINISTRY OF FINE ARTS</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>proposed that a Ministry of Fine Arts should be set up.  It was very important, he said, that the constructive work of their Government in literature and arts should get attention.  It gave the appearance of stability and progressiveness to their affairs if they set up a Ministry of Fine Arts.  Education and arts might be grouped together but he thought that it was advisable to show we were interested in these sciences and to emphasise it by creating a separate Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurGriffith" hpid="MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS Arthur Griffith">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS</NameTxt>
      <P>proposed the adoption of the Ministerial Powers (Delegation) Decree (Appendix 2). He said he would welcome any suggestions to improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexMcCabe" hpid="DEPUTY A. MACCABE (Member for Sligo) DEPUTY A. MACCABE (Member for Sligo)">
      <NameTxt>DEPUTY A. MACCABE (Member for Sligo)</NameTxt>
      <P>seconded.  He thought the suggested changes were well worthy of the support of the House.  He thought the powers should be delegated to the popularly elected co. councils and that the rest should be done by suggestion and by inspiration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgerald" hpid="DEPUTY S. FITZGERALD DEPUTY S. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>DEPUTY S. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>asked if Deputies of the Dáil would be on those committees to which would be delegated <Col N="61" /> the powers.  If so, it would be an anomalous position.  They could assist in an advisory capacity.  He asked for an explanation of the points giving those committees power to appoint any officers required or to delegate their powers to persons approved of by county or borough councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOCallaghan" hpid="DEPUTY DONAL O'CALLAGHAN DEPUTY DONAL O'CALLAGHAN">
      <NameTxt>DEPUTY DONAL O'CALLAGHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked would the police come under local control.  He strongly advocated that the police control should be centered in the local authorities of each district as was the rule in English districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>DEPUTY M.P. COLLIVET</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>replied he should represent as well as reside in a district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeGDuffy" hpid="DEPUTY GAVAN DUFFY DEPUTY GAVAN DUFFY">
      <NameTxt>DEPUTY GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>said this was the most drastic order ever presented to the Dáil.  The Ministers of the Departments mentioned could delegate most extensive powers to committees in the country without any check on the proper exercise of those powers.  He thought it was necessary to tone up clause 1.  It was far more drastic than the English D.O.R.A.  He suggested that all orders issued by Ministers under this Decree should be subject to Cabinet sanction.  He asked how the Minister of a Department was going to exercise control over these numerous committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="P.J. RUTTLEDGE P.J. RUTTLEDGE">
      <NameTxt>P.J. RUTTLEDGE</NameTxt>
      <P>maintained that the proposed committee would be somewhat unwieldy.  Members would be spread over a wide area and it would be hard to get them together to administer.  He suggested they would amalgamate three or four of those Departments or that they would confine the committee to the Ministers that would be appointed.  He disagreed with the member for S. Dublin (G. Gavan Duffy) that the proposal was too drastic.  He presumed every precaution would be taken to appoint the best men and that the appointments would be subject to the approval of the Minister in Dublin.  Clause 5 proposed to give certain matters into the charge of the chairman which he did not think was right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurGriffith" hpid="MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS Arthur Griffith">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS</NameTxt>
      <P>said that was put in at the suggestion of one of the Deputies for Donegal who pointed out it would be difficult to bring a Unionist member of a council on the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="S. MACENTEE S. MACENTEE">
      <NameTxt>S. MACENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Dáil to realise that they were now about, through their Ministers, to delegate to the nation all the powers of administration they possessed to committees some of which could not be made in any way responsible to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>said it was duties, not powers, that would be delegated.  They simply wanted to have a local machinery for carrying out the duties of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurGriffith" hpid="MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS Arthur Griffith">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS</NameTxt>
      <P>proposed they would take the discussion of the Decree clause by clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="SPEAKER SPEAKER">
      <NameTxt>SPEAKER</NameTxt>
      <P>said he thought it would be well to have the proposal made that the principle be adopted as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurGriffith" hpid="MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS Arthur Griffith">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS</NameTxt>
      <P>then proposed that the general principle of the Bill be approved and then that they consider the matter as if in committee, clause by clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrennan" hpid="P. BRENNAN P. BRENNAN">
      <NameTxt>P. BRENNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked how did the Decree interfere with the existing powers of the county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurGriffith" hpid="MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS Arthur Griffith">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS</NameTxt>
      <P>said it would not limit or restrict the power of co. councils in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="SÉAMUS DOLAN SÉAMUS DOLAN">
      <NameTxt>SÉAMUS DOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>seconded the proposal made by the Minister for Home Affairs.</P>
      <P>After a further very lengthy discussion the President said all they wanted to get could be got in 5 or 6 lines and the proposer of the Bill was quite ready to agree to this &ldquo;that the Cabinet be empowered to set up local administrative committees to whom it may delegate such administrative powers and duties as it thinks fit&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamdeRoiste" hpid="LIAM DE RÓISTE LIAM DE RÓISTE">
      <NameTxt>LIAM DE RÓISTE</NameTxt>
      <P>said they would not accept any committees to boss co. councils already in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>replied that the local committees set up would act as local inspectors or supervisors acting on behalf <Col N="62" /> of the Cabinet.  They wanted to have local supervision of administration, they could not manage otherwise.  They could make their recommendations but as councils differed, different methods would have to be resorted to.</P>
      <P>Motion withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurGriffith" hpid="MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS Arthur Griffith">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS</NameTxt>
      <P>presented the following motion¹ re Provisional Orders Decree.  He said it was on all fours with the Defence of the Realm Act passed by the British government during the great European war and as European powers considered such acts necessary for their protection he considered this Decree necessary for Ireland's protection.</P>
      <P>1.  Not entered in the record.  The decree is printed in Appendix 3.</P>
      <P>All the members realized it would be extremely difficult for the Dáil to meet again if hostilities were resumed and it was with a view to invest the Cabinet with powers to legislate pending meetings of the Dáil that this Decree was introduced.  He proposed adoption of the Decree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPColivet" hpid="M.P. COLLIVET M.P. COLLIVET">
      <NameTxt>M.P. COLLIVET</NameTxt>
      <P>supported the principle of the Decree but he asked if some means could not be devised by which those orders could be submitted to the Dáil members individually, if the Dáil was unable to meet, and get some expression of opinion, otherwise they might be enforcing regulations against the will of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>said that brought up a big question&mdash;that provision should be made that a body other than the Ministry should meet, one-third or one-fourth of this House.  The Cabinet had that in mind before and he certainly thought there should be some regulation delegating the powers of the Dáil and supervision of the Ministry to some committee of the House. A number of schemes were proposed but there was no unanimity about them.  His idea was that the members of each constituency should select one of their number to represent them in a committee of the whole House with legislative powers to meet in time of stress.  He believed they could not make arrangements for anything over 30 to meet at a time.  But as long as the members were sufficient to outvote the Ministry he considered it satisfactory enough.  A provision of that kind would have to be made, but he did not think anything could be done with this particular order at present except as it stood.</P>

    <Title>MOTION AS TO FORMATION OF GRAND COMMITTEE OF THE DÁIL</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>proposed that to provide for occasions when the Dáil could not meet as a Dáil a Grand Committee of the Dáil be formed by each constituency selecting one of its members to represent them in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>There were, he said, about 40 constituencies and if they had 40 persons in addition to the Ministry they would have a body which would keep a check on the Cabinet.  If the House was willing to delegate to a committee consisting of one member from each constituency instead of the number at present it would enable them to carry on in times of distress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisMByrne" hpid="P.J. BYRNE P.J. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>P.J. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>asked if the members for each constituency were to meet and select one of their number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>replied, exactly.  His idea was to have one member representing each constituency and they could make any arrangement they liked as to whether they should have a permanent representative or chose one for each meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamdeRoiste" hpid="LIAM DE RÓISTE LIAM DE RÓISTE">

      <P>asked would the representative carry the voting power of his group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>said he would be inclined to have one representative, one vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgerald" hpid="S. FITZGERALD (Cork) S. FITZGERALD (Cork)">
      <NameTxt>S. FITZGERALD (Cork)</NameTxt>
      <P>pointed out that in Co. Cork the eastern constituency had eight members while the western one had only three and it would be unfair to the eastern group to give them only one representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPColivet" hpid="M.P. COLLIVET M.P. COLLIVET">
      <NameTxt>M.P. COLLIVET</NameTxt>
      <P>suggested that a meeting of this committee should not be taken as a meeting of the Dáil but that their decisions should be ratified by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>said the member's for Limerick (M.P. Collivet) suggestion meant the committee would meet only in a consultative capacity.  That would not be exactly sufficient for their purpose.  His idea was that the committee should have legislative powers.  He did not see how a body the size of the Dáil was going to meet in any place during war times.  They would require no powers to bring a consultative committee together.  The point was, was the Dáil willing to delegate its own powers to this proposed committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="SEÁN MILROY SEÁN MILROY">
      <NameTxt>SEÁN MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>thought it was an extraordinary suggestion to ask members of this Dáil to extinguish themselves.  He was not convinced that this was the wisest way to provide for smaller meetings of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamdeRoiste" hpid="LIAM DE RÓISTE (Member for Cork) LIAM DE RÓISTE (Member for Cork)">
      <NameTxt>LIAM DE RÓISTE (Member for Cork)</NameTxt>
      <P>said it was not necessary at all.  Stress of circumstances in the past forced the Ministry to do things which the Dáil as a Dáil did not like.  The Ministry now had powers to deal with any circumstances that occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConstanceGdeMarkievi" hpid="MINISTER FOR LABOUR, COUNTESS MARKIEVICZ MINISTER FOR LABOUR, COUNTESS MARKIEVICZ">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR LABOUR, COUNTESS MARKIEVICZ</NameTxt>
      <P>, said she would like to support that view.  The members chosen might not be able to get to Dublin at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>said it would save discussion if he made it clear what he had in view.  He was trying to prevent them from effacing themselves altogether.  Supposing the Dáil could not meet for four or five months it would be a satisfaction to five or six of them who would be here in Dublin taking these powers to feel that they had at least a body that could outvote them. So they were looking for a check committee of the Dáil, but at the same time such a committee would be of little use unless it had the legislative powers of the Dáil.  If the House would not accept this proposal the only other thing that could be done was to risk calling the full meetings of the Dáil which would endanger the whole administration or else go on without meetings and risk getting out of touch with the country which might very well happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="S. MACENTEE S. MACENTEE">
      <NameTxt>S. MACENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>supported the President's motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeGDuffy" hpid="GAVAN DUFFY GAVAN DUFFY">
      <NameTxt>GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>thought the proposal ought to be looked upon with the greatest suspicion.  He was prepared to support the motion subject to modification.  It meant the Ministry would do what they liked and the Dáil would not be able to stop them. Naturally the Ministry would come to the next meeting with a substantial block of members behind them.  One thing he objected to was that the next actual meeting of the Dáil should be forbidden to go into the last business.  He thought the President should agree to have the committee consultative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="J.J. WALSH J.J. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>J.J. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>strongly supported the proposal.  All the members had a sporting chance of having an opportunity of keeping in touch with affairs.</P>
      <P>Dáil adjourned on motion of President till 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>Dáil resumed business at 4.15 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>said he would like the members to know that he proposed the motion to form a Grand Committee simply for a discussion.  He was not pleased with the proposal because he was afraid any arrangement they could make would be unsatisfactory.  He was not bringing it up as a Ministerial proposition at all.  If they would not accept some such proposal as this to put a standing committee to revise and criticise the work of the Ministry they would have to let the Ministry work without any supervision at all.  The machinery for setting up such a standing committee <Col N="64" /> was for them to form.  The larger the area from which members would be selected the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="SEÁN MILROY SEÁN MILROY">
      <NameTxt>SEÁN MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>said he saw plainly the necessity for it, but to keep in accordance with its constituencies it should be kept on the basis of a committee and he had drafted this motion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a Grand Committee of An Dáil comprised of 10 members for Munster, 10 members for Leinster, 10 members for Connaught and 10 members for Ulster be formed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>said he would be quite willing to withdraw his proposal in favour of that if they would make it say about eight members per province.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcGuinness" hpid="JOS. MCGUINNESS JOS. MCGUINNESS">
      <NameTxt>JOS. MCGUINNESS</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>GAVAN DUFFY</NameTxt>
      <P>proposed an amendment to add &ldquo;that all the decisions of the committee of the Dáil so constituted shall have effect only until the next meeting of the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>accepted this amendment but said to meet the question of proportion he was trying to find out the members for each province.  Connaught would be 7, Munster 10, Leinster 11, Ulster 2 according to present proportions.  That would give 30. Would the member who proposed some numbers accept that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="SEÁN MILROY SEÁN MILROY">
      <NameTxt>SEÁN MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>replied, certainly, he would accept those figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="SEÁN MACENTEE SEÁN MACENTEE">

      <NameTxt>SPEAKER</NameTxt>
      <P>replied, yes, and said Mr. MacEntee's proposal dropped as it was not seconded.</P>
      <P>He then put the motion: &ldquo;In addition to the Ministry that a Grand Committee of the Dáil composed of 10 members from Munster, 11 members from Leinster, 3 from Ulster and 7 from Connaught selected by the members of each province may be called together to act for the Dáil at such times as is not possible for the Dáil to meet as a whole provided that all decisions of the committee so constituted shall have effect only to the next meeting of the Dáil&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>said they would find on page four of his report a note of the estimates of the Departments for the coming half-year.  He thought there had been decisions which would increase these estimates.  Arising out of his own report there was a decision which would increase his estimate by £250.</P>
      <P>The Directors of the other Departments had better speak to their own estimates before they were taken in case there would be any increases.  In the Local Government Department the figure of £110,040 was somewhat misleading.  In that figure there was included an old amount of £100,000 loans to public bodies.  That £100,000 was already provided for and it could not be included in this estimate as it was already passed by the Dáil, so the effective estimate for this Department was £10,040.</P>
      <P>To these estimates they should add he thought £20,000 for contingencies and any such amounts as required for the new Ministry of Arts could come out of that fund.  He said he had details of each estimate and, if any member wished to ask a question, he could give details.</P>

Any committee that would go into these figures would not have the necessary knowledge of the working of the various Departments to do so.

      <P>,¹ said his estimate was for £6,800.  If war conditions developed he might have to ask for more in connection with food conservation and distribution if the Dáil approved of funds being made available for such purposes.  The ordinary estimate was down to bed-rock.  Details were as follows: Department was divided into two sections Land and Agriculture. On the Land side there were two Commissioners at a salary of £700 each; one occasional Commissioner who acted when required, one clerk at £330 and a typist at £3 per week, office rent £80 per year.  The Registrar was in jail and was receiving two-thirds of his salary of £330 per annum. Local Registrars were paid according to the court held for which he put down £100 provisionally and he put down £500 provisionally for two organisers.</P>
      <P>1.  Art O'Connor was described as Substitute Minister for Agriculture on 23 August 1921. Robert Barton was Minister for Agriculture.  In the new ministry appointed 26 August 1921 Art O'Connor became Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to agriculture, as the Deputies knew, the Dáil had not interfered with the enemy Department of Agriculture. There were many and long discussions on the matter last year and it was decided they would not interfere, allowing <Col N="67" /> it to continue to do the agricultural work so long as it did not conflict with them, with the result that he had merely endeavoured to shape the policy of the co. committees of agriculture and to direct the work of the enemy Department from without rather than from within and he had been fairly successful.  The estimate provided for a clerk £170, a typist £80, inspector £400, for possible agricultural development £1,000 to allow of an inspector to operate in connection with land development on the estates the Land Bank had made advances for.  For Forestry he had put down £1,000.  That was to enable the organisation of an Arbour Day and to have money available to get things going.  In 1919 it was found possible to organise an Arbour Day for £90.  Rent of office, etc., £150.  These were all provisional and might not be required.  Minister's allowance and expenses £250.</P>
    <P>The total amount of his estimate was £6,800 which would he thought be sufficient under the present conditions of half-peace, half-war, but if war was forced upon them he thought the Dáil would have to make large sums available for the conservation and distribution of food.  If they did not somebody would have to do it.</P>

The execution of <Col N="68" /> their decrees could not be undertaken by the local Dublin Volunteer Brigade and then other matters regarding the maintenance of law and order had to be seen to.

      <P>pointed out that what the members of the Dáil should understand was that the police as an organisation was separate from the Volunteer organisation.  They had been coming to that position for a long time.  The process was slow as it was felt that the army was the only body that the people of Ireland would put up with interfering with them.  They had now come to the point at which they had a separate police force.  At the present moment they were in a transition stage but it would be passed immediately.</P>
      <P>There would perhaps be some objection locally to a man being paid because he was a police officer considering that the job was pushed on to him because he was not fitted for the responsibilities of an officer in the Volunteers.  But education was wanted in the matter and propaganda he thought should take up the principal point among their own people that the different functions of the Republic were developing now and with an organisation taking on a definite shape for the first time they must have a separate body for that organisation.  The army had to have full time people and the police force should have full time people to run it. It was necessary to have full time police officers in the country, but the only thing he would like to see was that they would not turn round now and pay their Chiefs of Police but that the police organisation would be brought into line with the organisation of the local government administration.</P>

He did not intend to employ more than the present number but he thought it was absolutely essential that that number should be kept on the road. They covered considerable areas with the object of keeping the Boycott Committees working actively.  The Volunteers had enough to do without looking after the Boycott and they were only called in when drastic action had to be taken.  The spade work would have to be done by the committees.  Only for the organisers the Boycott would be a very dead affair as the committees originally set up had ceased to exist but the new committees were pretty generally active and, if it were not for the Truce, Belfast would be in a much worse condition than she was at present.</P>

Items for expenditure at home were salaries of staff £767, Director £250, special printing, prohibition orders, etc., £1,300, stationery and postage £30, office rent £50, railway expenses £100, contingencies £253, industrial exhibition £1,000.  This latter item was passed at the last meeting of the Dáil for the promotion of a permanent exhibition of Irish goods.  Those items made a total of £3,750.  In addition to that there was an item of £827 required for the commission of inquiry to pay debts they had for printing of reports.  Four reports would be ready before the end of the year which should be printed and for which he had got a rough estimate of £250, consequently he desired to add £1,000 to that portion of his estimate making it £4,750.</P>
      <P>Coming to the consular services he had put down £10,000 provisionally but he thought it would be considerably less than that.  The items were Paris £1,000, Antwerp £650, Rotterdam £800, Genoa £200, New York £6,000, Development (Consulate in Germany) £1,350.</P>
      <P>The normal expenditure of the New York office was £3,500 but he had made a provision for the opening of vice-consulates in Philadelphia and other cities which the President really required for political purposes but which he thought it would be better to open in the first instance as trade offices and later on they might be declared to be political offices.  It was probable this £2,800 would not be required but he had included it in case the President still desired to carry on with the scheme.</P>

      <P>said he realised that Irish manufacturers did not <Col N="70" /> understand the importance of advertising to anything like the same degree as foreigners.  Even those who had money did not understand the value of advertisement, but most of them had not the money to do it.  There was no comparison at all with the capital held by the manufacturers in Ireland and that held by the people against whom they were competing. This was a very laudable attempt to help the manufacturers.  He knew the very keen competition that Irish manufacturers had to meet and most unfair competition in a number of ways and every assistance they could be given should be given to them by this Dáil.  If the Dublin Development Association succeeded in getting up this exhibition and getting most of the manufacturers to show their goods the public of Ireland would see the goods were made in the country&mdash; things he was sorry to say people were least educated in.  The exhibition would be in one of the best thoroughfares in Dublin.  The people would get to know of Irish made goods and ask for them.  He believed it would be a well spent £1,000.</P>

      <P>said every country he knew of did its best to promote the sale of the manufactures of its own country. There were permanent trade exhibitions in London, Paris, Berlin, and all big foreign cities subsidised by their own governments and he only wished the Minister for Trade could expend about £20,000 a year instead of £1,000 altogether.</P>

      <P>said the question was how best to help Irish industries.  The idea was a good one but he agreed with Deputy O'Mahony that the Dáil ought not to do the work.  In Cork they would have a permanent industrial exhibition long since only for the war and the essential expense necessary.  He did not think the Dáil should go into the matter at once.  He thought it most inadvisable for the Director of Trade and Commerce to lay down the lines on which to work. The Development Association had suffered from lack of funds.  If they gave them funds they would do the work.  The Dáil should not pass this £1,000 and then say to the association, &ldquo;You must have an exhibition of goods and you must pay £1,000 for the rent of the hall&rdquo;.  He would agree to the vote if it was for industrial development and that no restrictions are imposed on its spending.  The Association had made a study of the subject for a long number of years and knew best how money should be spent.</P>

      <P>said they had adopted the economic weapon against England.  One of the chief difficulties they had found in pushing forward this policy was that the majority of the Irish people were not aware of articles manufactured in Ireland.  He thought the Dáil should be willing to spend £10,000 if necessary on such a trade exhibition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT William T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT</NameTxt>
      <P>said the items for his estimate were salaries and expenses of outdoor staff of inspectors and auditors £6,900; salaries of office staff £1,430; £500 for Minister's allowances; £400 for stationery and postage; £305 rent (4 offices in all); £155 for miscellaneous and £260 for contingencies, making a total of £10,040.¹ The estimate was not extravagant, having regard to the numbers employed. He had a staff of 43.  The amount of work coming into the office could not be done with a lesser staff.  One matter he was asked to mention with regard to the <Col N="71" /> £100,000 loan.  That was being distributed to the local committees in the proportion of one-tenth of the grants lost.  There was very great distress in Wexford town as the manufacturing companies were unable to dispose of the stocks of machinery on hands and had practically closed down with the result that six or seven thousand men were thrown out of employment.  After consultation with trade and labour representatives there they came to the conclusion that the only practicable scheme to relieve the distress was one for building concrete cottages which would cost from £250 to £400 each.  If £20,000 could be secured by the town council on overdraft from the bank they thought the Dáil might give some confidence to the people to take up this project by giving a loan of £1,000. The scheme was as far as he could see the only one that was suitable to relieve the serious condition of the town.  If the cottages could be built for that sum it would bridge over the time of distress for the people out of work.</P>
      <P>1.  The total of the items listed is not £10,040 but £9,950.  This discrepancy also occurs in the shorthand notes.</P>
      <P>He thought it would be necessary to alter the terms of the loan for the £100,000. The scheme would not be passed unless it was a thoroughly sound one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT William T. Cosgrave">

      <P>said he had been asked to give the items of Foreign Affairs Department's Estimate.  Details were: France £2,700; Germany £1,000; Spain £800; Italy £2,500; London £2,000; U.S.A. £20,000; Switzerland £800; Argentine £750; Chile £500; special amount for P.J. Little of £1,000; for L. Ginnell £1,000; making a total of £33,050.  There was provision made for general contingencies of £10,000.  He might explain that there was the utmost difficulty on the part of the Foreign Affairs Department in making out the estimate.  The figure for the U.S.A. was an approximation.  Total £43,050.  In addition to that there were six items for the Head Office: Salaries of staff £12,000¹, Minister's allowance £250, stationery £74, rent, etc., £85, miscellaneous £115.  Contingencies £926 making a total of £45,700.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>replied that he had not got the figures now.  They had in America first of all Frank P. Walsh's office where they had the representatives, a secretary and a small staff.  That was really a propaganda department from which was issued publications like the address to the foreign nations and a lot of work of that kind.  He said it was very hard to understand the cost of things there.  Take the cost of living, 100 dollars a week was as little as a person could live on here [<i>recte</i> there], so they could realise what money values were.  With the cost for consul and the representatives and the office itself £20,000 was necessary.  In fact they had a great deal of trouble when they tried to cut it down to that figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="SEÁN MACENTEE SEÁN MACENTEE">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>explained he had already pointed out that the new organisation being set up in U.S.A. would soon be able to do all the work done by the commission before.  A great deal of it was being done already, but they could not build up an organisation within a few months and get from it all the activities they required. The commission when he was there before had to bear the expense of all the propaganda work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="SEÁN MACENTEE SEÁN MACENTEE">
      <NameTxt>SEÁN MACENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>said he did not want to seem captious about this matter <Col N="72" /> but he would ask the President to remember that the total actually expended upon all the foreign activities amount to £1,200 for the last half-year and the estimate now submitted is £45,000 of which they were told £20,000 was to be expended on political work.  He submitted they should have some particulars of that. He would also point out that the financial position of the Dáil was not too satisfactory. Estimates for the coming half-year provided for an expenditure of £228,000 while the total balance at home was only £255,000.  In former votes there had been certain provision made for Defence.  There was a possibility they might not get money from America.  He suggested it would be in form that a detailed estimate should be tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins1919" hpid="MINISTER FOR FINANCE Michael Collins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR FINANCE</NameTxt>
      <P>pointed out there was a statement here in his report that these details could be got if notice was given.  These details were available.  There was no difference in the Ministry of Finance between funds whether they were kept in Ireland, France, England or America.  The amount for Defence was shown clearly in his report; the Department had a balance in its favour that covered its estimate for the coming six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>said he would like to make a few points clear.  It was said there was a great increase in the amount for America.  They would remember the Dáil put half a million dollars at his disposal to do the propaganda work necessary in America.  Until such time as they were satisfied that the new organisation was ready they would have to do the work themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>DIRECTOR OF PUBLICITY, E. CHILDERS</NameTxt>
      <P>¹, said the estimate for his Department amounted to £5,000.  The total expenditure for the past six months was given as £4,523.  That sum should have £1,000 deducted from it, as the cost of the mission to South Africa was charged to this Department, whereas it should have been charged to Foreign Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>1.  Desmond Fitzgerald was Director of Publicity.  Erskine Childers acted as Director during the imprisonment of Desmond Fitzgerald.</P>
      <P>The estimate included £1,200 for the purchase of a freehold house for offices. That expenditure was in the nature of capital expenditure so that the actual estimate for coming half-year would really be £3,800.</P>
      <P>Details were salaries £1,000 for 2 statistical clerks, 2 typists, 2 despatch clerks, private secretary to the Director, assistant Director and assistant Editor of the &ldquo;Irish Bulletin&rdquo;.  He would like here to say a word of commendation about Mr. Frank Gallagher in that capacity.  He would like to add that the work of the whole staff was such that the Dáil could congratulate them: efficient and excellent under conditions of extraordinary stress. Stationery £450, postage £900.  This latter figure was heavy owing to the fact that the &ldquo;Bulletin&rdquo; had to be sent out in sealed envelopes.  £240 for a small subdepartment in Cork, £100 for books, £600 for printing, £100 for rent, rates and taxes.  That with £400 for contingencies made a sum of £3,800.  Add to that the value of the freehold house £1,100 [<i>recte</i> £1,200]&mdash;£5,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>said his Department would be more expensive if he had to function publicly.  He was anxious to know how they were going to exercise powers when the Dáil could not meet. There were very extensive powers given to the Ministry on one occasion.  The Dáil would have to give discretionary powers either to the Ministry or to the Grand Committee which they were setting up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins1919" hpid="MINISTER FOR FINANCE Michael Collins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR FINANCE</NameTxt>
      <P>said the position up to the June meeting last year was that from a previous meeting the Ministry had discretionary powers for expenditure of something like £50,000. That power was not exceeded up to the June meeting and at that meeting certain estimates were passed and a contingency vote of £20,000.  After that June meeting they had meetings regularly, and at the last meeting the contingency vote carried them into February.  They always had enough to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position now was he expected these estimates would in the ordinary way <Col N="73" /> cover the workings of all the Departments, therefore the contingency vote need not be very great.  He did not know if the Dáil would care to give discretionary powers to meet emergencies which might arise.  The Trustees' Deed provided for occasions on which the Dáil could not meet.  Then the Trustees had power to disburse on their own account.  He dared say if a position arose that the Dáil or the Ministry could not meet the only thing then would be for the Trustees to exercise their powers.  If they wanted to meet emergencies the only way to meet the case was discretionary powers to the Ministry.</P>
    <P>He then read the estimates as they were passed.  The estimate for the President's Department £1,500 was based on expenditure since Christmas last.  He moved it be increased to £2,500.  Details&mdash;special work £400; salaries £200; Minister's allowance £300; contingencies £1,600.  He suggested that the new Department of Fine Arts and Economics be put into the contingency vote.  He asked for a contingency vote of £20,000.  There was one other point to be mentioned.  They got a special amount of £15,000 from the U.S.A. which did not appear on these accounts.  That £15,000 was collected by Mr. Ginnell and sent to the Dáil to be used in relief in any special way the Dáil wished.  He submitted that amount should be placed at the disposal of the Ministry.</P>
    <P>He then moved the total estimate amounting to £144,740 excluding the £15,000 placed at the disposal of the Ministry.</P>
