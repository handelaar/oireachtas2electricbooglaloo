    <Title>PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT.</Title>
<P>The PRESIDENT said he had no written report.  Anything he would have to say would simply cover the ground the Ministers would have to deal with, and he thought it better that he should stand aside till the Reports were read.  The general situat on was unchanged.  He was occupied in keeping in touch with the heads of the various Departments and in the organisation of foreign activities.  There was one important question for them to decide after the Reports were dealt with, i.e., the acceptance of full responsibility for the acts of the Army.  He did not think it right that their men should appear to be in the position of working as irresponsible forces.  He thought it absolutely necessary that the Dáil should let the world know that they took full responsibility for all the operations of their Army.  That would practically mean a public acceptance of a State of War.  He did not think there had been such formal acceptance up to the present.</P>

<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR IRISH said he expected that the Minister for Irish would have presented a Report, but owing to his untimely arrest a few days ago this was not possible.  Prosecution of the work of the Department was becoming necessarily more difficult owing to enemy activity, especially in the Irish-speaking counties such as Cork and Kerry.  A programme of Bilingual Education was being drafted.  It was the duty of Aireacht na Gaedhilge to see that the necessary text-books and other literature was available for the schools, and a scheme was being prepared for the publication of a certain number of books.  The scheme had not yet assumed definite shape but would be ready before next Meeting of An Dáil, and he proposed to ask the Dáil to empower the Ministry to allocate £2,000 for this work.  He formally moved the adoption of the Report. This was seconded by P. BEASLAI (Kerry, East).</P>

<P>The PRESIDENT presented the Report of the Propaganda Department.  They had appointed a Substitute Director who was not a Member of the Dáil. This gentleman had already taken up duty and was completely overhauling the Department, and they hoped to extend its work out of all proportion to what it had been doing especially in foreign countries.

    <Title>DEBATE ON REPORTS. - HOME AFFAIRS.</Title>
<P>The debate on the Report of the Department of Home Affairs was then taken.</P>
<P>P. BEASLAI (Kerry, East) said he considered the statement that the Ministry had decided to contest the Elections for the Ulster Parliament very important.  He was surprised that it was not put down on the agenda for discussion, and he thought it was a matter that should be discussed on the Report.  Most of them had no opportunity of discussing or considering it.  He had heard a number of arguments for and against contesting the election from representatives of Republican opinion, and he thought the subject should not be passed without full consideration.  He himself was in favour of a contest. It was, however, suggested to him that the effect of a contest would be to consolidate a solid Orange Block, <Col N="266"/> whereas by standing out altogether the effect would be to disintegrate the enemy by allowing their differences to develop.  He would like to hear the opinions of some of the Ulster Members.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT said in the first place this was to a large extent a question for the Sinn Fein Executive. The aspect which came before the Dáil was the acceptance of a Foreign law arranged by a Foreign Government. The whole matter had been gone into by Sinn Fein and by the Ministry, and they had decided in favour of a contest.</P><P>Every argument against contesting the elections could be met by arguments of equal importance.  If the elections were contested on an abstention basis, it meant that the Orange Block would be smaller in the Ulster Parliament by the 11 to 15 seats which the Nationalists would win.  The disintegration of that Block would then really take place in the Parliament. They wanted to consolidate Nationalist opinion in Ulster and draw it into Republicanism.  The time was opportune for this.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT then detailed the negotiations which had taken place between the Republican Party and Mr. Devlin, and said that there was a probability of an agreement being reached.  The basis of the agreement would be abstention.  The allocation of the seats would be automatic under Proportional Representation.  There could be no compromise on the subject of abstention.  If they did not have abstention it would mean consolidation of the Orange group.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) said that this question concerned not only Ulster but the whole of Ireland. It was the general opinion in Belfast that their chances of securing a representative Vote against Partition would be greatly enhanced if the Dáil issued a statement defining what their policy would be towards the Ulster Six Counties if they accepted Partition. He suggested that it should be made clear that if Partition were accepted (<i>a</i>) the Economic Boycott of Belfast would be extended to the whole of the Six-County area; (<i>b</i>) that this boycott be reinforced by a social boycott providing that no partitionist be allowed to enter Southern Ireland without a passport from the Republican Government, and that all representatives of partitionist interests be compelled to evacuate Southern Ireland; and (<i>c</i>) that citizens of the Republic be ordered to pay no taxes to the Partitionist Parliament.  He said that there was great uneasiness amongst the business element in North-East Ulster over the question of prohibition. An agreement with the Devlinites would be a great asset.  It would mean polling a large number of Protestant labour votes.</P>
<P>J.N. DOLAN (Leitrim) asked if the Ministry had considered putting a policy of devolution before the Ulster Secessionists.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT said that this was not the time to do so.  All he could say, at present, was that he was not against such a policy.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS said that the question of ignoring the elections had been fully considered by the Ministry and by Sinn Fein, and that they had decided to contest them. At the same time he hoped that their hands would be free, if they thought at a later stage that it would be desirable to ignore the elections, at the same time upsetting their machinery. With regard to the exchange of preferences, they could not ask any citizen of the Republic to cast a vote for a candidate not pledged to abstention.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR DEFENCE was in favour of going on with the contest, but this need not prevent the other suggestion from being put into operation if feasible.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT agreed that the Ministry should have a free hand.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS referred to the possibility that candidates would be required to deposit a Sheriff's Fee of £150.  This had not yet been settled.  He accordingly asked for a vote of £4,000 to meet this contingency.</P>
<P>P. O'KEEFFE (Cork, North) said that while the rest of Ireland was fighting <Col N="267"/> Ulster was sitting down.  He thought they should intimate to Ulster that if they were not prepared to finance the elections they would wash their hands of them.  He favoured contesting every seat in Ulster except Belfast, and they should leave Belfast alone. There were 80,000 Catholic families in the North, and they should be easily able to raise £20,000 for the election.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) said no money could be got in Belfast because Republicans there were in a state of destitution since July last. He seconded the proposal for a contingency vote of £4,000, but he did not think the money would be needed for Sheriff's deposits.  The question of contesting the elections was not one for Sinn Fein, but for the Dáil, since it was the authority of the Dáil which was challenged.</P><P>The motion for the adoption of the Report, including the vote of £4,000, was then put and carried.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="DEBATE ON REPORTS." RHead="- FINANCE">
    <Title>DEBATE ON REPORTS. - FINANCE.</Title>
<P>The PRESIDENT said he thought that the Minister for Finance was not taking too rosy a view of affairs in America when he said that he hoped the expenditure there would be covered by the receipts.  In America they had three million square miles to cover and it was only now being organised.  They should be very well satisfied with the work which had been done.  The Irish White Cross relief collections would be very large.  If the necessity for this collection had not occurred, they would have asked for authority to issue another Loan, and would easily have secured the same amount as the first Loan.  After all the expenses of the first Loan were paid, he calculated they would have 4,000,000 dollars left.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) asked if they intended to use all the money in hand during the coming year.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR FINANCE explained that the figure of £210,966 6s. 3d. represented the sum in hand in Ireland.  Provision had been made for an expenditure of, roughly £225,000. This made an apparent deficit, but, on the other hand, there was a considerable sum to their credit in United States, America.  The present Report should be read in conjunction with that presented in the January Session.</P><P>He drew attention to the item in Appendix A. of his Report of £2,000 voted by the Ministry to the Commission of Inquiry into the Resources and Industries of Ireland.  This vote now came up for confirmation.  The Acting President had promised the Commission of Inquiry that when their funds fell below £1,000 a further vote would be made to them.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) asked was this amount in excess of the £5,000 already voted, and was informed that this was the case.  He urged that the whole work of the Commission to date should be reviewed by a Committee of the Dáil.</P>
<P>T. HUNTER (Cork, North-East) agreed that a review of the Commission's work should be immediately undertaken.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR LABOUR suggested that the Department of Trade and Commerce should be made definitely responsible for the work of the Commission and should ascertain how far the results of its inquiries could be utilised for the good of the country.</P>
<P>After further discussion J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) moved, &ldquo;That having regard to the fact that the sum already allocated to the Industrial Commission was now exhausted and that the necessity for a further grant has arisen, a Committee of the Dáil should be appointed to review the work of the Commission and to make whatever recommendations may be advisable regarding it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>On the suggestion of the MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS this motion was withdrawn on an undertaking from the Director of Trade and Commerce that he would, with such assistance as he may require from members of the Dáil, inquire into the work of the Commission and make a report to the next Meeting.</P><P>It was explained that the Department of Trade and Commerce was in fact responsible for the work of the Commission.</P>
<P><Col N="268"/> SEAN HAYES (Cork, West) mentioned the question of Income Tax. He had heard that terrorism would be resorted to in the collection of this tax.  He suggested that collectors should not be allowed to collect.</P><P>The Report of the Finance Department was then adopted, including the vote of £2,000 to the Commission of Inquiry, which was confirmed on the undertaking mentioned above.</P>

    <Title>DEBATE ON REPORTS. - DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR.</Title>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR LABOUR said the Belfast Trade Boycott got a good fillip by what took place on the previous day.  He wished to acknowledge the active work done by the Volunteers and Cumann na mBan.  They could not get on with the Boycott without their assistance. Up to last Saturday he said he had a record of 184 Boycott Committees formed, and he thought these Committees could be utilised for an Irish Industrial Campaign as well.  He had set up a small Commission to go into the general question of a Labour Policy.  This Commission would report in two months.  He thought the Report should be published throughout Ireland.  It might be necessary to send someone to Italy to examine Labour conditions there, but the cost of this would be covered by the existing vote.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT asked was there only one Boycott Organiser in Connacht.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) thanked the Member for North Tipperary, on behalf of the people of Belfast, for the great vigour and life he had put into the Trade Boycott since he took charge of it.  He suggested that they try to organise supplies and wholesale distribution for the six North-East Counties where, owing to having no alternative sources of supply or distribution, people were compelled to purchase from Belfast.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES congratulated the Substitute Minister for Labour on the way he was working the Boycott.  He agreed with him that farmers should be urged to increase tillage.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR LABOUR replying, said there was only one organiser required in Connacht. Belfast goods entered Connacht mainly through Sligo.  They had a very good organiser there who would be able to stop all goods from getting through. This man said an organiser for South Connacht was not necessary.  He also had organisers at Clones and Limerick. The reports he got from these organisers were most satisfactory.  They could see from the papers that Belfast goods had been destroyed in Gort and Clifden, and that shopkeepers dealing with the boycotted firms had their shop fronts decorated.  He then detailed some of their activities in connection with Dublin Drapery Houses. He found that the boycott of the Banks was the most difficult part of the problem, as the other banks were acting in collusion with the Ulster banks.</P><P>The question of alternative sources of supply and distribution was being attended to.</P><P>The Report was then put and adopted.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="DEBATE ON REPORTS. - DEPARTMENT" RHead="OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT">
    <Title>DEBATE ON REPORTS. - DEPARTMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.</Title>
<P>The MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT in opening the Debate on his Report said at last Meeting of Dáil he got permission to appoint fourteen inspectors. They had now thirteen ordinary inspectors and one Medical Inspector.</P><P>His Department was faced at the present moment with the problem of dealing with garnishee orders.  Once the rates have been struck, any person holding a Criminal or Malicious Injury Decree can obtain a garnishee order against the rates.  Some orders had already been obtained.</P><P>The collection of rates was proceeding fairly satisfactorily, though there were large amounts outstanding in some counties.</P>
<P>His Department was engaged in compiling a history of the Local Government position since they came into existence.  This would show how the enemy strove to prevent them <Col N="269"/> rom carrying on their work.  He would like to have the assistance of the Member for West Clare in the compilation of this work.</P><P>He also mentioned the necessity of a code for Local Authorities so as to prevent jobbery.</P><P>One of the other difficulties which they were faced with was the issue of Mandamus Orders.  If these were pushed to the extreme length, the chairmen of all local bodies would be either on the run or in jail.  This would seriously upset Local Authorities.</P><P>The only other matter he wished to raise was the payment of arrears in wages and salaries, etc., due by Local Authorities.  He had a motion on the agenda to enable the vote of £100,000 made at the previous session to be applied for this purpose.</P><P>It was decided that this motion could be discussed simultaneously with the debate on the Reports, but that it should be moved separately at a later stage.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT said the real crux in connection with rates was the existing staff of Rate Collectors who were bound under their bond to lodge all monies collected with the Bank.  Any person holding a Criminal or Malicious Injury Decree, lodges it with the Bank, and, consequently, any monies lodged after the lodgment of the Decree, would be utilised for its payment. Nearly all the Rate Collectors were timid, and a great many were hostile and refused to fall in with the arrangements of the Local Authorities.  They had been able to get along for the past few months by strategy, but the British Local Government Board were stopping up the holes as they saw them. The Collectors would have to be dispensed with, and the Councils would then be unable to give valid receipts. He was in favour of putting the collection of rates on a military basis. It had been suggested instead that the collection be put on a police basis. That would involve the creation of a police force in every county.  The Rate collecting body would be that police force, and would issue receipts under the seal of the County Councils. These receipts would not probably stand in English Law, but he did not think the Enemy Authority would care to proceed against people who held County Council receipts.  The Department did not think this police scheme was strong enough to force it on the County Councils, and what they were doing now was offering it to the County Councils for acceptance or rejection.</P><P>The general position was better than it was a month ago.  So far from losing ground last month, they had gained it. Kilkenny Council had never broken with the Local Government Board, and they had now decided to break.  The Enemy Department thought they could smash up local administration all over the country with the Mandamus Orders they held against the Chairmen.  If they did so they would have the responsibility for carrying on, and this would be a difficult undertaking for them.  He did not think the Mandamus Orders would be enforced.</P><P>The Garnishee danger was very serious.  If, on the 1st April, people in Dublin went in on a large scale for these Orders, the Dublin Corporation would be in a difficulty.  He thought the only method of meeting this danger was direct action against the parties securing the Garnishee Orders or the parties who paid.  There was some difference between himself and the Minister, he said, as to the justice of attacking the man who made payment on a Garnishee Order which, according to English Law, he was bound to make. His point was that it was a question of a trial of strength between two Governments.  He was sending to every Deputy not in jail letters which they could sign and send out to local people in their constituencies urging the necessity for the absolute isolation of the Custom House.  A circular was going out this week over the name of the Minister for Home Affairs pointing out to Local Authorities and Councils that had given allegiance in the Dáil that it would be deemed a treasonable practice to have any communication with the Enemy Department, and would be dealt with accordingly.</P>
<P><Col N="270"/> The DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES said he would not agree that Rate Collectors who were deprived of their posts should be compensated.  In Wicklow any man who refused to work was dismissed and replaced by a man who would.  He thought Volunteers would assist in the collection of the rates.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS said he objected to jobs like the appointment of the husband of a Guardian, or a Guardian or any other member of a local body to a position of remuneration under the particular body.  He thought the Minister for Local Government should take very great care about the matter.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR DEFENCE thought that a simple code should be drawn up to cover such cases.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR LABOUR thought it would be a bad policy to set up a guarantee fund out of which Rate Collectors would be compensated.  Rate Collectors must be made to understand that they could not have one foot in their camp and the other in the enemy camp.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) considered that the time had come when they should re-consider their whole Local Government Policy.  The Department was assailed on all sides by Garnishee Orders, Rate Collectors, Mandamus Orders, etc.  If they did not make a radical alteration in their policy, the whole local administration of the Republic would be reduced to chaos.  He thought the County Councils would not be able to collect rates after the 31st March, and that they would then have to accept the inevitable and refuse to carry on. Before that happened they should issue a protest against the actions of the enemy in withholding their own money and mulcting them in huge Malicious Injury Claims.  They should definitely refuse to strike a rate, as if no rate were struck the Garnishee Orders could not be presented.  This would save the Dáil a considerable amount of money.  He thought they should accept the position of a country at war.  The territory of the Republic was invaded, and they should devote whatever funds they had to make the Army of the Republic as effective as possible.</P>
<P>JOHN HAYES (Cork, West) drew attention to the case of Cork County Council, where there were Garnishee Orders amounting to £60,000 lodged against them.</P><P>The Council expected to have a Credit Balance in a few days, and their difficulty was how to prevent that money being paid out.  The Bank would pay it unless they found some way to safeguard the money.  He suggested that steps should be taken against persons who displayed eagerness to secure these Garnishee Orders.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT said as regards Funds that the Minister of Defence had all the money he required.  He thought it would be a tremendous loss to give up the local administration. They should hold on to the end.  The question was, could they do it.  They should make every endeavour to do so, but the fighting forces of the Volunteers should not be interfered with.  If a police force could be set up as an auxiliary to the Army, everything the Ministry could do would be done.  The two big problems were the Military problem and the Local Government one.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT explained how monies should be safeguarded.  With regard to the suggestion of the Deputy for South Monaghan, they should remember that in this struggle they were fighting to preserve the ratepayers from being mulcted in £10,000,000 for Malicious Injury Claims.  If they ceased the functions of Local Administration they would open the way for some enemy authority to come along and place this burden on the people.  In Belfast the rates were up 5s.  In the pound, and Belfast Council had estimated for £150,000 for Criminal Injuries this year.  Considering that no Council in the Republican area of Ireland had estimated for any such sum, it proved they were in earnest when they said they did not assume any liability for these Decrees for Criminal Injuries. He thought, if there was going to be a break-down, it should not be a collapse but that each place should <Col N="271"/> hold out to the last, showing that it was their earnest desire to preserve the people from this 10 millions of a burden and to vindicate the claims they made that they were able to govern their own country.</P>
<P>D. BUCKLEY (Kildare, North) stated he was sorry to say that many Ratepayers in his constituency were taking advantage of the present state of affairs to refuse to pay rates.  A propaganda campaign should be initiated to educate the ratepayers in their responsibilities.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT said he forgot to mention that this matter of a propaganda campaign was being attended to.</P>
<P>The ACTING SPEAKER asked how far the Local Government Department considered it desirable to curtail work in connection with Volunteer activity. He had in view the expenditure on road upkeep.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT replied that the money collected for this purpose could be used on some work for keeping the staff employed. He did not agree with a system of doles for unemployment.  He suggested that the monies could be utilised for some Economic Scheme to deal with unemployment such as the Substitute Director of Agriculture was bringing forward to-day.  He wished also to direct attention to his Department's proposal for the amalgamation of Unions.  They intended to have only one Union in every county. Local provisions for dispensaries and hospitals would, of course, be retained. They wanted to get rid of the &ldquo;Workhouse Citizen,&rdquo; a class which had developed as a result of the Poor Law system.  This class was uneconomic and was a burden on Society.</P><P>Objections to the proposed amal-gamations came from vested interests, principally officers, contractors, etc. Deputies could assist very much in dealing with this opposition.</P><P>He instanced the reforms which had been undertaken in Cork and elsewhere under the Republican regime.</P><P>The Report was then put and adopted.</P>

    <Title>DEBATE ON REPORTS. - DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND COMMERCE.</Title>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE mentioned that he would require a vote of £5,000 for his Department in connection with the proposed campaign for the encouragement of Irish Industries.  Since the last Dáil Meeting he had a great deal of discussion with various people about a General Boycott of English goods, and he had set out his conclusion in the Report.  Some Members thought, he said, that the import of ales, beer, and cigarettes should not be prohibited, but he was of opinion that an article like cigarettes would be a good one to start with.  He would like to hear the views of the Deputies.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT agreed with the Director of Trade and Commerce that an article that everyone used, like cigarettes, would be a very good item to start on, but he wanted to know if the Director was satisfied that the home supply would be equal to the demand. He was in favour of the project of starting with specific articles and extending the list from time to time.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT said he thought the Director had made a very arbitrary choice.  He thought it would be a mistake to exclude Bass.  It was a medicinal drink, and it would be hard to get a corresponding restorative of Irish manufacture to recommend in its stead.  As regards cigarettes, the thought they could not exclude these until they had a really first-class brand made in Ireland.  He referred also to biscuits, another of the articles mentioned by the Director of Trade and Commerce, and said that Jacobs exported more biscuits from Dublin in one week than the whole of Ireland imported in a year.  Soap was an important item, but until they could produce something as much in favour as &ldquo;Sunlight,&rdquo; he did not think they could keep the English product out of the country.</P>
<P>D. BUCKLEY (Kildare, North) said he could not agree with the Minister for Local Government.  He had some <Col N="272"/> practical experience of the cigarette trade.  The demand for Irish cigarettes was increasing very much.  He had the same experience with soaps; the public were gradually turning to Irish products in preference to English.</P>
<P>J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary, North) said he felt sure they could knock out a great deal of English manufacture if they went about it in the right way. If sufficient public interest were aroused there would be tremendous decline in English exports to this country. He thought they should take up articles which were largely exported from England&mdash;boots, for example. There was an enormous import of boots into Ireland while Irish factories which gave as good value were closing down.  He was convinced that if the £5,000 asked for was passed and the machinery already set up for the Belfast Boycott adapted to the Industrial campaign, the people would, in six months, be educated to the idea that the Economic weapon is one which will hit England very forcibly.  For articles not made in Ireland, such as Drapery Goods, and they imported 31 million pounds' worth of such goods in 1919, they should try to obtain alternative sources of supply by propaganda in Foreign Countries through their Consuls abroad who could inform foreign suppliers that they would get preference above English merchants.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR DEFENCE pointed out that a stranger coming to Dublin would see no difference externally between it and any English city.  There were the same advertisements for Bovril, Fry's Cocoa, Beecham's Pills, etc., everywhere.  He thought the best way to bring the Boycott home to the ordinary public would be to have a definite decision that no English advertisement would be allowed in our city.  He referred to the articles published some time ago by K.R. O'Shiel, in which he developed a system of schedules which would be very useful in connection with the English Boycott.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT said what they wanted to know was could they go ahead with the English Boycott and select the articles one by one.  There was no use starting with articles which they could not succeed in stopping. He was doubtful about cigarettes, but thought soap could be managed.  He thought also that they should issue a general appeal to the people not to use&mdash;or to use only to a very limited extent&mdash;commodities on which a large revenue was got by the enemy, such as tobacco and spirits.  He would like to get the opinions of the Deputies as to what articles should be put on the list for exclusion, but they would finally have to leave the selection to the Director of Trade and Commerce.</P>
<P>JAS. BURKE (Tipperary, Mid.) asked what effect this campaign would have on the Belfast Boycott.  He thought it would be better to have that boycott on a firm working basis before proceeding with the English Boycott.</P>
<P>The ACTING SPEAKER said there was one point he would like to put before the Director of Trade and Commerce. The value of the imported goods should be the real criterion.  The cigarette trade and other goods mentioned might not involve much money but goods like agricultural machinery amounted to a very large sum, and they had an alternative source of supply in America and Canada.  There was another point he would like to call attention to.  He had been informed by a person who worked in a large bonded store that America, Spain, and Holland were dumping immature spirits into this city and that this spirit was being mixed with good Irish whiskey.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS mentioned certain information he had received with reference to the cheapness of German goods.  The writer said there was no article but could be got from Germany 50 per cent. cheaper than English prices.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR DEFENCE said the idea of a general boycott of English goods was the first thing to start on.  If they got that idea throughout the country they would have thousands of people refraining from buying little articles. By adopting the schedules that Mr. O'Shiel had set out, they would be able to indicate the articles to be boycotted, <Col N="273"/> and week by week they could add articles to the list.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR FINANCE asked if the Director was in a position to put forward any scheme of Credits: without such it would be useless to talk about getting goods from foreign countries.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE replied that he recognised that difficulty, and that was why he wanted to begin on the smaller articles.  Propaganda was absolutely essential, but a general propaganda campaign in favour of Irish goods or against English manufacture passed away, whereas if they named a few articles to be boycotted they could get the people to refuse to purchase them.  He wished to begin by listing articles which disclosed their origin so as to obviate the necessity of tracing the source of supply.</P><P>He believed the exclusion of English goods would arouse an interest in Irish markets in France and other foreign countries.  French Trade Associations were taking the greatest interest, and had written several times to the Consul.  He thought the effect of excluding a few articles of English manufacture would be to arouse greater interest.  The Minister for Labour informed him that those engaged on the Belfast Trade Boycott reported a general desire that something should be done for Irish manufactures.</P><P>The Report was then put and adopted.</P>

    <Title>DEBATE ON REPORTS. - DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.</Title>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE said that his Report referred to two important matters: Land Settlement and Unemployment.  In conjunction with the Report which he submitted at last Meeting, an appendix was issued showing the operations of the Land Commission and Courts during the period May 1st to December 31st, 1920.  Close upon 50,000 acres of land had been dealt with.  Since the last Meeting his Department had held some Courts, but they could have had many more if the country would assist them.  He asked the Deputies to press the Court Registrars and other local people to do the work they were appointed to do or else clear out and let others do it.  They had now got the machinery necessary for dealing with any land trouble that might arise.  Personally he would be better pleased if no trouble arose at present, but he wanted to guard against what happened in the American War of Independence.  They should try to learn the lesson of history and prevent slackers from grabbing the land while their bravest were engaged in deadly combat with the enemy.  If the Land Department of An Dáil merely succeeded in doing that, it would have justified its existence.</P><P>The question of Unemployment would be discussed later on the Memorandum which he had submitted.  He would be happy to answer any questions raised on his last Report or the present one.</P><P>The only other matter he would like to mention was that of the Agricultural Board.  He had taken steps to get the County Councils to elect the best representatives, so that if it were possible to get control of that Board they would.  If they could develop a position in which prominent Republicans would be in effective control of the Board some very interesting things were bound to happen.  He asked Deputies to see that their local representatives were chosen at once.  The first meeting would take place in May, and a definite policy for their representatives would be formulated before that date.</P><P>The Report was put and adopted.</P>

    <Title>DEBATE ON REPORTS. - DEPARTMENT OF IRISH.</Title>
<P>P. BEASLEY (Kerry, East) said he would like to explain how the matter stood in connection with the motion for a vote of £2,000.  Last year they voted £500 to the Minister of Irish for books and literature, and the opinion was then expressed that a larger scheme would be required and consequently a larger sum of money.  There was now an urgent necessity for text books, school books, and reading matter.  He had been trying to organise Irish writers, and he found a large number of them were unable to do <Col N="274"/> much owing to the difficulty of publication. A scheme had been drawn up for the production of books and for guarantees against loss to the writers and publishers.  If this money asked for were allocated it would be money which the Dáil could expect to get back; it was more in the nature of a loan.  A large portion of it would be spent in publications urgently required, such as text books on all subjects and Irish translations of standard works.  It would be in the nature of productive money and would be of great assistance to Irish industries. The scheme was not yet in its final form.</P>
<P>The ACTING SPEAKER asked the Member for East Kerry did he now formally move the Vote.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR IRISH said that he had moved in his Report that the Ministry be empowered to allocate this sum.  He had reports from different schools to the effect that they were greatly handicapped for want of text books.  It was merely a question of finance that these books were not available.</P><P>At this point the Session adjourned for lunch.</P>
<P>After the resumption the MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS said he thought it was not advisable to vote money for a scheme when there was not a definite proposal before the House.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR IRISH said the scheme was already drafted. There was a great dearth of Irish books, and Aireacht na Gaedhilge decided four months ago to support Cumann na nUghdar.  It was owing to the urgency of the matter he was moving for the money to-day.  There were eight text books in the hands of people who were unable to publish them.  The money might not have to be put down at all.  All he wanted was to guarantee the publishers, but he could not do that unless the money was allocated.  No books would be guaranteed unless their publication had been sanctioned by Aireacht na Gaedhilge.</P><P>The Report was then adopted.</P>

<P>The PRESIDENT said that he had appointed a new Director of Propaganda to replace the Member for Pembroke who was arrested, and as the new Director was not a member of the House he would himself be directly responsible to the House for the Department.  The new Director was reorganising the whole work of the Department.  The matter of Propaganda abroad would be on a much more extensive scale, and the &ldquo;Bulletin&rdquo; would be got out in better and more extended form.</P>
<P>JOHN HAYES (Cork, West) asked if any action could be taken against provincial papers, such as the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, whose propaganda was hampering the work of the Republic and weakening their position throughout the country by advocating a policy of moderation.</P>
<P>P. BEASLEY (Kerry, East) said he was very glad the Member for West Cork had broached this subject.  The <i>Independent</i> and <i>Freeman</i> were pursuing a policy of the same nature, and the Department would try to devise some scheme for getting at such papers.  They recognised that it was largely a military question.</P>
<P>P. O'KEEFFE (Cork, North) objected to the appointment of the new Propaganda Director, and a long discussion ensued as to whether it was constitutional to appoint a Director who was not a member of the House.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT explained that the new Director was not a Member of the Ministry.  He was merely the head of a Department&mdash;a civil servant&mdash; and hence the matter did not come before the House.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) disagreed with the President's view and moved:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That the appointment of a Director of Propaganda be held over until the Constitution and Minutes of the Dáil had been scrutinised as to the regularity of the appointment.&rdquo;</P><P>There was no seconder.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) then moved &ldquo;That the Directorate of <Col N="275"/> Propaganda be abolished,&rdquo; and this motion also fell through for want of a seconder.</P>

<P>The DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES said the people of Tory Island were badly in need of a new boat.  There would be some delay in recovering the Insurance on the old boat.  He was assured, however, that the Insurance Company would have to pay.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT asked if something could be done for Gorumna and Lettermullen, where an epidemic of typhoid had broken out.  The standard of living here was very low.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS said these people refused to work the boat they got as a free gift, and the DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES agreed.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES then moved that the question of providing a new motor boat for the Tory CoOperative Fishing Society be referred to the Fisheries Committee for consideration and that a report be submitted to An Dáil.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) expressed disappointment at the Report of the Fisheries Department.  He complained that the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the West Carbery Fishing Society had not been circulated. Most of the Fishery schemes had been disastrous to the reputation of the Dáil.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT said he was at present engaged in a general stock-taking in all Departments.</P>
<P>SEAN HAYES (Cork, West) said he was a member of the Committee who inquired into the West Carbery Society.  He had supplied a copy of the Report to the Secretary for Finance.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR FINANCE said the report had been circulated to the Ministry.  He had recommended to the Ministry that all activities in connection with fisheries should cease. It was too big a problem to tackle successfully in present conditions. They would want £1,500,000 to deal with fisheries on anything like a proper scale.  The failures all arose from dishonesty on the part of the fishermen. The only thing they could hope to do at present was to help by expert advice.</P>
<P>The ACTING SPEAKER mentioned that the resolution proposed by the Director of Fisheries had not been seconded, and it accordingly fell through.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) moved the rejection of the Fisheries Report, but the motion was not seconded.</P><P>It was explained that the Director of Fisheries was ill when the report of the West Carbery Committee of Inquiry was considered, and that the failure to circulate it was an oversight.

<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) said he was opposed to the principle of making grants of this sort.  Poor Law relief could be provided for on a voluntary basis.</P>

    <Title>MINISTERIAL MOTIONS. - LAND SCHEME TO RELIEVE UNEMPLOYMENT.</Title>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE in introducing his proposal for Land Schemes to relieve unemployment, said the matter was fully discussed in his January Report.  There was a great deal of unemployment in the country at present.  He grouped it under three heads:&mdash;</P><P>(1)  Actual and prospective, due to depression in tillage.</P><P>(2)  Actual, due to enemy acts.</P><P>(3)  Prospective, due to curtailment of road and other public services.</P><P>He believed the problem of unemployment should be dealt with as a whole, that it should not be dealt with by a system of doles but should be treated on a constructive basis, so that whatever work the men were put on would bring benefit to the State.</P><P>His first suggestion was a National Appeal to the farmers to keep up last year's percentage of tillage.  He believed the farmers were patriotic enough if the situation were brought to their attention.  He thought this appeal should go out over the name of the President, and if it got wide publicity in the newspapers, by leaflets and through the County Councils the second suggestion in his Memo. might not arise.  The general unemployment looked a big problem, but if they divided it up parish by parish and county by county it was not a thing that was beyond the solution of four or five friendly farmers in each parish. The season was getting on a bit, but even yet there were six or seven weeks before they came to an end, and if farmers got to work at once the men at present unemployed could be used to great advantage.</P><P>In connection with his second suggestion, he regarded it as essential that farmers should get a guarantee that the land would be returned to them.  He believed the County Councils were the proper bodies to make all the arrangements as regards the lands to be utilised, the payment of rent and the getting of money for the carrying on of the work.  The provision of money to work the lands was a serious difficulty, and unless some of the rates could be made applicable it would be necessary to approach the banks who would be very difficult to move.</P><P>He had tried to get at the extent of the problem by ascertaining the number of unemployed.  Under heading (1) he was informed there would not be many, as the very fine Spring had encouraged farmers to till as usual. Under heading (2) he could get to information, but in districts where creameries were destroyed it would be considerable.  Under heading (3) he had in mind that the bulk of the road men would be disemployed.  If divided over the country this meant about one overseer and ten men for every parish. The most satisfactory solution would be to have the men employed by the County Councils on direct labour lines.</P><P>Recalcitrant farmers could be served with notice withdrawing the protection of the Republic.  He found that plan worked very well last Summer in disputes where one side would not submit to arbitration.  As soon as the lands were declared to be in a state off outlawry the situation cleared at once.</P><P>He formally moved the adoption of the proposals.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT seconded.  He was greaty in <Col N="278"/> favour of the scheme, and said while it would be ridiculous to spend much money on roads this year, any money spent on this scheme would be productive. He favoured the County Councils as agents for the scheme.</P>
<P>J. HAYES (Cork, West) held that the scheme was a good one, but any appeal to the farmers should be accompanied by a firm guarantee against labour upheavals.  Otherwise it would not be responded to.</P>
<P>THE SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR LABOUR said that the Minister for Agriculture, Labour representatives and himself, discussed that question. He was sure Labour would give a definite guarantee if present agreements are renewed, that there would be no attempt to force up wages next harvest.</P>
<P>J. LENNON (Carlow) pointed out in case the County Councils took up the scheme money would be required for machinery equipment and capital to start on.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE said that the Minister for Local Government had suggested that the money set aside for road restoration might be used to meet that initial expenditure.</P>
<P>J. LENNON (Carlow) contended equipment would be required for each parish.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE thought such equipment could be hired.  Even if there were no profits so long as they succeeded in creating employment, the men would not be going hungry.  There was also the possibility that an attempt might be made by the enemy to blockade the country, and in that case the more food produced the better.</P>
<P>J. LENNON (Carlow) thought they should appeal to the farmers to grow more wheat.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE said he had sent out a circular in the month of November to every County Committee of Agriculture, in which he appealed to the farmers to grow winter wheat.</P><P>The scheme was then put and adopted.</P>

    <Title>ACCEPTANCE OF STATE OF WAR.</Title>
<P>The PRESIDENT, in opening a discussion on the formal acceptance of a state of war with England, said he felt in America and since he came home that the Dáil was hardly acting fairly by the army in not publicly taking full responsibility for all its acts.  He mentioned this view to the Minister of Defence, and his criticism was that to accept war now in any more formal way than they had done, could be misrepresented as an admission that they were not carrying it on in a regular manner heretofore.  They could get over that difficulty by stating in the preamble the circumstances of the <Col N="279"/> situation.  He discussed the arguments for and against formal acceptance and said it was a very serious decision to take, and he would like the meeting to consider it carefully.  If the acceptance were agreed to they could instruct their Consuls abroad to look for belligerent rights.  His opinion was they should agree to the acceptance of a state of war.  It meant every member would take an equal responsibility.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT supported the proposal.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES said it should have been done six months ago.</P>
<P>J.N. DOLAN (Leitrim) speaking in favour of the Declaration, said it was up to the Dáil to put the matter beyond yea or nay.  It should have been done long ago.  He advised caution in the wording to show that this was not a new declaration.</P>
<P>L. MELLOWES (Galway, East and Meath, North) thought it was a question of accepting rather than declaring war.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR DEFENCE was of opinion that nothing had been lost because a declaration of this kind was not made before now. The army got a chance to show it could fight and could keep fighting in its own way.  They knew now they could make this declaration and not have to withdraw it at short notice.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) was in favour of making the Declaration but pointed out that it would have the effect of ranging all elements in England against them.  If the Coalition Government collapsed, the situation here might improve as matters stood at present.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS said he thought the Dáil should accept the army as being the Army of the Republic which came under their control in January, 1919.  It was a legacy from the men who fought in 1916, and the development of it and the way it conducted itself ever since they gave it assistance, was a credit to them.  The least the Dáil might do for it was to accept responsibility for all its acts.</P>
<P>P. BEASLEY (Kerry, East) said the question was mainly the form which the Declaration should take.  He moved:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That the Dáil approves of the President's being empowered to draw up a statement on the lines indicated verbally by him, and that this be done at whatever time was considered most opportune.&rdquo;</P>

<P>The PRESIDENT said their next business was to make provision for carrying on their work.  Their numbers would not be increasing for some time and a situation might arise if their numbers went very low.  He would like to hear their views on the appointing of Substitutes. Of course it would be irregular and wholly unconstitutional, but they would have a body to speak for the country.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR DEFENCE suggested that each member would nominate a substitute to be ratified by the local Comhairle Ceanntair.</P>
<P>P. O'KEEFFE (Cork, North) pointed out most of the best men in the Comihairli Ceanntair were on the run or in jail.</P>
<P>After considerable discussion COUNT PLUNKETT (Roscommon, North) said that the Government should be left to the Military Body when the membership of the Dáil was reduced to a certain figure.  It was usual to substitute military dictatorship in countries invaded; and instead of the House appointing substitutes, it should be left to the Volunteers as the Military Body.  They should be authorised by this House to establish a Provisional Government.</P>
<P>J. BURKE (Tipperary, Mid.) agreed with this suggestion and said if the Dáil was going to carry on it was essential that it should maintain its representative character.  If substitutes were appointed it would affect the authority of the Dáil in the eyes of the public.</P>
<P><Col N="280"/> J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) suggested they should fix the number at which the Dáil should resolve itself into a Provisional Government.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT suggested that when the number fell to five the Army should take control.</P>
