	<P>The DEPUTY SPEAKER took the chair at 9.20 a.m., and in opening the proceedings said he presumed they would follow the usual procedure and have all the Reports read first and take the debates on them afterwards. No objection was raised to this course, and he accordingly called upon the Minister for Home Affairs to present his Report.</P>

<P>The Report of the Department of Local Government was presented by the MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. Attached to his Report were statistics showing the financial position of a number of the County Councils, and the Teachtaí would have time to look through these statements before the discussion of the Report.  If any further information were required he would be pleased to give it.</P>

<P>The DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE next presented his Report, which included reports on the work of the Commission of Inquiry into the Resources and Industries of Ireland. He thought it was a mistake originally to have set up a Commission with such a wide field of inquiry, and that the fact that it had not given better results was largely due to this cause.  He did not know whether the Dáil should sanction going on with the Commission's Report on Water Power as it would require enormous expense and time to get out a really satisfactory and useful Report.</P>
<P>With regard to the Turf-Cutting Scheme mentioned in the Report of the Minister for Labour, the idea was that Local Bodies should be asked to form Committees which would tabulate particulars as to the number of labourers <Col N="283"/> unemployed, the quantity of Turbary available in the district, an estimate of the money required to get the Scheme going and of the amount that could be raised in the locality.  He had approached some members of the Irish White Cross Committee, and he thought they might be prepared to vote a sum up to £25,000 to assist in the initial stages.</P>

<P>The PRESIDENT in the course of a verbal Report dealing with the work of the Department of Publicity, said that he had asked for a written Report from the Director of Publicity but the latter was unfortunately arrested on the previous day.  The work of the Department was largely routine.  The production of the &ldquo;Bulletin&rdquo; was the regular work and arrangements had been made with their Representatives abroad to republish it in foreign countries together with any other information supplied to them from the Department.  The new Director spent most of his time since he took up duty in getting hold of the administration and arranging that the routine work would be carried out. The Staff Attache, Piaras Beaslai (Kerry, East), who was in charge of the Home Section of Propaganda, would be able to give a Report upon that side of the Department's work.</P>
<P>PIARAS BEASLAI (Kerry, East) said he would be able to answer any questions that would arise regarding the Department as he was in touch with it every day from the Home Propaganda aspect.  The scope of their work had been greatly extended.  The Military and Civil sides were brought more into touch than before, and the &ldquo;Bulletin&rdquo; was now issuing a review every week of the military operations. &ldquo;An t-Oglach,&rdquo; the official organ of the Army, would be used as a Propagandist organ, and steps were being taken to have it circulated to outside publicity institutions.  Extracts from it were being published in American papers, and he was trying to get them into the Irish, English and other daily papers also.  A number of leaflets were being prepared and printed at the present time to counter the Enemy Propaganda at home.  One of these was the copy of the interview given by the President to the American Journalists last month. Leaflets were also being issued containing contradictions of the lies published by Dublin Castle.  The Departments were in close touch with American and other foreign Press representatives as well as with the local Press, and they had arranged for a number of interviews with Pressmen.</P>

    <Title>DEBATES ON REPORTS. - HOME AFFAIRS.</Title>
<P>The debate on the Report of the Department of Home Affairs was next taken.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS formally moved the adoption of the Report.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE in seconding, said there was a good deal of doubt as to whether the deposit of £150 for each Candidate <Col N="284"/> nominated for Election was required.  He thought it would be a good thing to have the doubt removed at once.</P>
<P>P. O'KEEFFE (Cork, North) said the instructions he sent out from Sinn Fein were that the £150 would have to be deposited with every nomination. Arrangements had been made in all cases to have the required amount available.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS said that the Secretary of Sinn Fein, the Director of Elections and himself had gone very fully into the matter and every Constituency had got instructions and knew what to do.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT referred to a recent deputation sent by the Cove Urban Council to the British Admiralty on which his Department had forbidden the expenditure of Public money, and asked for an expression of opinion as to the proper procedure in dealing with people who flouted the instructions of the Dáil in this manner.</P>
<P>THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE said he heard of the matter too late to take effective steps to prevent it.  He did not think it necessary to bring a Court together to deal with the case.  The offenders were known.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT said that it was not the duty of his Department to decide what penalty should be enforced.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS replied that when the matter was reported to him it was not clear that the Deputation had then gone, and he suggested that the Department of Defence be communicated with.  That Department asked the Department of Local Government to say what punishment should be inflicted.  He thought the Department of Local Government should decide this.  There were no courts functioning in Cove.</P>
<P>R.J. MULCAHY (Clontarf) considered that a Code of Civil offences with a list of punishments should be drawn up.  The Home Affairs' Department should face this work as well as that or re-organising the Courts.  The Organisers sent out by the Belfast Boycott Department had been very successful, and there was no reason why organisers from the Department of Home Affairs should not be sent to districts where the Courts were not functioning.</P><P>The Report was then put and adopted.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="DEBATES ON REPORTS." RHead="- FOREIGN AFFAIRS">
    <Title>DEBATES ON REPORTS. - FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</Title>
<P>The PRESIDENT, in opening the debate on the Report from the Foreign Affairs' Department, said their main difficulty was adequate communications.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT asked if the Consuls were acting under the direction of the Foreign Affairs' Department, or of the Trade Department.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT replied that they were directed by the Trade Department, but he wanted to ensure coordination between the Departments. In countries where there was also a diplomatic representative the Consul should confine his activities to Trade. The Minister of Trade and Commerce had been asked to draw up a consular code, so that in Trade matters the Consul would be directly responsible to the Trade Department. Other matters coming to the notice of the Consul should be referred to the Political representative.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) referred to the appointment of an Under Secretary for the Department and thought that certain stringent rules should be laid down as to educational and other qualifications necessary for the Civil Service they were setting up.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT said that the Ministers were responsible for appointments made on their staffs.  Their difficulty was to get good men for all the posts.  As regards the Under Secretary himself, they got a man whom they considered most suitable for that particular position.  He heard <Col N="285"/> of all the chief appointments, and had seen nothing to complain of.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="DEBATES ON" RHead="REPORTS. - LABOUR">
    <Title>DEBATES ON REPORTS. - LABOUR.</Title>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR LABOUR formally proposed the adoption of the Report of the Department of Labour, and B. O'HIGGINS (Clare, West) seconded.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT complained that nothing had been done about the pooling of Contracts. He thought his Department should have been called into a Conference with the other Departments concerned to get the project going. The objection had been made that all the contracts would be given to Dublin firms, but he did not see why firms in Cork or other centres would not get their share if they were able to handle the contracts.  On the question of the Irish Industries' Campaign, he thought that purchasers should have a guarantee that had materials would not be used in the manufacture of Irish goods.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE said he had got most of the Public Bodies to consent to the Pooling scheme, but he submitted that it was practically impossible to do anything till the Councils were financially sound, and could pay on the nail.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT agreed that it would be very difficult at present, as they would have to buy in a falling market.  A good deal could be done, however, in the supply of information to public bodies as to the proper prices of various commodities, and he thought Asylums, Unions, etc., should get very full instructions from the Trade Department on the matter, and be put in touch with people who could supply them.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR LABOUR wished to put on record the very great assistance his Department had received from the Volunteers in carrying out the work of the Boycott. The necessity for such assistance would, he hoped, not arise so frequently henceforth.</P><P>The memorandum on unemployment submitted by him was a Report drawn up as a result of a Conference brought together on the invitation of the President to discuss the Irish Labour Party's Manifesto.  He thought it was absolutely necessary at the present time to do something for Irish Trade and Commerce, which was linked up with Irish Labour, and it was purely defeatism to say the proposal for pool contracts could not be taken up till the financial position was perfectly sound.  A start must be made somewhere.  The Pool Scheme would give an indication to Irish manufacturers that they would have a market for their goods when they manufactured them.  It was necessary that Irish manufacturers should know what would be required of them, and if they got reasonable assurance of support there would be a great advance in the quality of Irish manufactures.  As soon as there was a large demand prices would be reasonable and quality would improve. Irish manufacturers were willing to give as much employment as possible, provided they could sell their stuffs.</P><P>The Irish Farmers' Union had issued an appeal to all its members not to reduce the area under tillage, and only in the very last extremity to disemploy labour.  He thought that was due to the Conference between the Irish Labour Party and the Irish Farmers' Union.  The latter body had also expressed their willingness to co-operate in the Turf-Cutting Scheme, and to put up £10,000 for the purpose.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE asked every member of the Dáil to realise that they were practically recommending a system of protection for Irish Industries.  They saw how an open system of Free Trade ruined these Industries, and when native industries declined agriculture also declined, with the result that there was only one-twentieth of the wheat grown now that was produced 70 years ago.</P><P>The Report was adopted.</P>

<P><Col N="286"/> The adoption of the Report of the Department of Local Government was proposed by the MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT and seconded by J.N. DOLAN (Leitrim).</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT said there was one point to which he would like to draw attention. If it were desirable to continue the stoppage of roadwork he thought that the tillage scheme submitted by the Director of Agriculture at a previous Session to provide employment for the road men should be started next September or October when most of the local bodies would have some funds to start the scheme.</P><P>The Report was adopted.</P>

    <Title>DEBATES ON REPORTS. - TRADE AND COMMERCE.</Title>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE formally moved the adoption of the Report of that Department.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT seconded.  He asked what proportion of the citizens of the country knew of the Prohibition Orders against English goods.  He always felt that while the young men were giving up their lives for their country the women folk and their families were filling the War Chest of the enemy, and helping to keep the Army of occupation in the country. He wondered was it possible to form some organisation of women on the basis of Parish units and get them to take up seriously the question of boycotting English goods and giving preference to articles of Irish manufacture.</P>
<P>P. BEASLAI (Kerry, East) asked had anything been done about the suggestions made at last meeting regarding German goods.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR LABOUR asked if in view of the Irish surplus of butter at present in the country an Export trade could be opened up with the United States where, according to reports in the papers the Danes had now found a great market for their butter.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) referring to the Report on the Commission of Inquiry considered that a great deal of the ineffectiveness of the Commission had arisen through faulty organisation.  The Secretary appeared to have endeavoured to retain all the activities of the Commission too completely under his own control, instead of devolving a great deal of the work upon technical experts and assistant secretaries.  While the Commission were collecting a huge amount of information on numerous subjects there was no one to digest the returns, and no expert to compile satisfactory reports. The Coal Memoir, he said, was going to cost £800 to print, and he doubted if they would get any practical result from it.  It dealt purely with the geological aspect of the question.  He had submitted the Milk Report to several people, and they held that from a practical point of view it was of no value.  All this was due to the fact that skilled men were not employed to get out these reports. He objected to the form in which the accounts of the Commission's expenditure were printed.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT asked if the Director of Trade and Commerce was in charge of all the Consuls.  Did he control the American Consulate, and does he get reports from all the Consuls on their activities.</P>
<P>P. O'KEEFFE (Cork, North) moved that the Commission of Inquiry be wound up on the 1st July, 1921, and that all reports be handed over to the Director of Trade and Commerce. That all books purchased for the work of the Commission be handed over to the Secretary of the Dáil, and that a detailed report of the work done be supplied to the Dáil at its next meeting.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT said if the proposal was put in the form of a suggestion to the Ministry he would be in favour of it.  He thought they should go into the reports of the Commission and get them examined by experts before publication so that the published <Col N="287"/> reports might be of practical value.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE said he could spend some time discussing the Stud Farm Report but he considered the suggestion of the President the best solution.  The Ministry should be made responsible for the close examination of the Reports, and it should be left to their decision as to when the Commission should be wound up.</P>
<P>The DEPUTY-SPEAKER said they would take that recommendation as having the general approval of the House.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE in replying to the various queries, pointed out that in issuing Prohibition Orders great care was necessary, and consequently he had to go slowly.  He had, of course, examined a number of articles outside those already prohibited, and he would be able to issue orders more frequently in future.  He had written to Mr. Fawsitt three weeks ago for a full report as to the possibilities of a market for Irish butter in the United States.  He had not yet received an answer, but he heard the Danish venture was a failure owing to transit difficulties.  He agreed with the views expressed by the Deputy for South Monaghan regarding the Commission of Inquiry, but he thought that the position was not altogether the Secretary's fault.  The members of the Commission could not be absolved from blame, and the Dáil itself did not give proper consideration to the project when setting up this Commission.  The work done had a great propagandist value and the memoirs prepared could form the basis of further inquiries by special Commissions to be appointed at a later stage.  He considered the best course was to wind up the Commission and go into the reports afterwards.  The 50 per cent export tax on German goods which had been imposed since last meeting had destroyed any chance of trade.  German firms did not want to deal at present.  The Consul in America had done an immense amount of propaganda in regard to direct trade between Ireland and the States.  The matter had got a great deal of publicity in the Press, and the Consul was in close touch with the United States Shipping Board.  He believed that beyond propaganda their Consuls could do very little, as they had not the standing or status that Consuls of other countries had.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT repeated his query as to the publication of Prohibition Orders and the formation of an Organisation of women to help in the Boycott of English goods.  He did not place too much faith in Consuls.  It would be better to devote most of their energy to waging war on the enemy at home.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR LABOUR explained the method of working the English Boycott.  The Director of Trade and Commerce would issue the Prohibition Orders and the Boycott Committees would see they were enforced.  There would be 360 of these Committees is existence by the end of the present week. These Committees would meet at least once a week, and he intended to retain eight Organisers for the purpose of keeping them active.  The Director of Trade and Commerce would issue suitable propaganda to show the people of Ireland what their duty was as far as English manufactures were concerned, and he (the Minister for Labour) would guarantee that all Prohibition Orders and Propaganda would be put into every house in Ireland.  He was sure that by the the end of May the Assistant Minister of Local Government would be quite satisfied that anything prohibited by the Director of Trade and Commerce would be very difficult to obtain in Ireland.  As the Prohibition Orders grew their resources would grow.  He thought the women were the best workers on all the Boycott Committees.</P>
<P>B. O'HIGGINS (Clare, West) suggested the prohibition of English newspapers. There was a million pounds <Col N="288"/> spent annually on English papers and they were an important medium for advertising English goods.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE said he would not like at present to recommend this prohibition.</P><P>The Report was adopted.</P>

    <Title>DEBATES ON REPORTS. - IRISH.</Title>
<P>The adoption of the Report of the Department of Irish was proposed by the ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR IRISH and seconded by the SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE.</P>
<P>P. BEASLAI (Kerry, East) asked were there any instructions' sent to the Comhairlí Ceanntair as regards the selection of Parliamentary Candidates with a knowledge of Irish.</P>
<P>P. O'KEEFFE (Cork, North) said there were not, but they would find when the returns came in that they would have a bigger proportion of Irish speakers in the House than after the 1918 Elections.  He objected strongly to the complaint made in the Report on this point.  Very little progress could be made if they got nothing else from the Gaelic League but destructive criticism.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE asked if any further money was required for the schemes they were bringing forward.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR IRISH, in reply to the Member for North Cork, explained that he merely mentioned in his Report that a reference should have been made in the Circulars issued by Sinn Fein to the desirability of candidates possessing a knowledge of the Irish Language.  No further money was required by that Department.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT remarked that it was the business of the Department of Irish to send a recommendation to the Election Department of Sinn Fein before the issue of the Circulars.  The Department of Irish should always be on the watch for such occasions and the responsibility was on that Department.</P><P>The Report was adopted.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="DEBATES ON REPORTS." RHead="- FISHERIES">
    <Title>DEBATES ON REPORTS. - FISHERIES.</Title>
<P>The Report of the Department of Fisheries was proposed for adoption by the DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES and seconded by the SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR LABOUR.</P>
<P>J. MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) thought the Report on the West Carbery Fishing Society should not be passed over by the Dáil without some strictures on the Department.  There must have been a great lack of supervision either on the part of the Bank or the Fishery Department.  It was not a sufficient excuse to say that the management of the Society was indifferent. He complained that there was no detailed scheme put forward for the organisation of the Home Market, and asked the Department to inform them more definitely what it proposed to do.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR FINANCE explained that the Bank merely acted as the agent of the Government and was not responsible in any way for the supervision of the Society.  The position now was that the Bank had advanced £12,000, and allowing for the insurance to be recovered they would be faced with a deficit of about £7,000.  Against that there was stock which was valued in the Balance Sheet at £5,000, but it was not likely to realise that amount.  The other Fishing Societies, from the financial point of view, were working well enough. He agreed with the Deputy for South Monaghan that there was not enough expert supervision.</P>
<P>The DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES said that the man whom the Society appointed as Manager was not a desirable man and did not carry out the work on co-operative lines.  It should be borne in mind that last year was very unstable from the Fish trade point of view; all fish buyers in the South and West of Ireland lost heavily on the year's trading.  The whole question of the development of the Irish Fisheries was one that should be taken up on broad National lines.</P><P>The Report was then adopted.</P>

    <Title>DEBATES ON REPORTS. - AGRICULTURE.</Title>
<P><Col N="289"/> On the motion of the SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE, seconded by J.N. DOLAN (Leitrim), the Report of the Department of Agriculture was adopted without discussion.</P>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="DEBATES ON REPORTS." RHead="- FINANCE">
    <Title>DEBATES ON REPORTS. - FINANCE.</Title>
<P>The MINISTER FOR FINANCE formally moved the adoption of his Report. There were some points he would like to draw attention to.  One was the vote of £1,000 required for the Prisoners' Dependents' Fund; another was the issue of a new Loan here and in the United States.  There was also the appointment of a new Trustee in place of Mr. James O'Mara who, in accordance with the terms of their agreement, went out of office in June next.  Then there was the question of fixing a period of liability in connection with the Vote of £100,000 made to the Department of Local Government in January for loans to local bodies and also the fixing of a final liability in the case of the Commission of Inquiry.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE seconded the motion.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT said that the expenditure incurred in raising the Loan in the United States was heavy owing to the fact that they had to do an enormous amount of propaganda and organising work.  This was all in the nature of pioneer work and would not have to be done again.  When he went to America first the Irish organisation contained fifty or sixty thousand members, now they had a completely new organisation of over half a million members extending to every State in America.  He recommended that the question of starting a New Loan should be left over to the new Dáil to decide, and it should be one of the first questions taken up.  The new Dáil could also deal with the question of Mr. O'Mara's successor if his resignation was accepted.  His idea was that they should go out for a new Loan of twenty million dollars.  The ground work had been done, and the necessary organisation was at their disposal.  If the fight was going on they would certainly get the money.  He was anxious to have the expenditure in America formally confirmed.  He got a certain amount of discretionary power over expenditure, and when matters came up before him for sanction he dealt with them on their merits.</P><P>While in America they thought things were worse here than was actually the case.  They did things in a less formal manner because they felt the Dáil was functioning under great difficulties.  One of the things he would like to mention was the engagement of a Counsel in connection with the campaign for the recognition of the Republic in America.  When he left the United States the necessity for some one in Washington who would have charge of the Campaign for Recognition was felt to be pressing, and they appointed Frank Walsh and asked him to give his whole time. The point of view upon which the representatives in America worked was that the time was a most critical one and that if they were beaten then an accumulation of funds in the Treasury would be of no value to them.  The Organisation of the American Delegation would be put on a regular and formal basis henceforth, and definite estimates would be submitted.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR FINANCE asked for a direction that any liability in connection with the vote for £100,000 made to the Department of Local Government in January, 1921, should end completely on 31st December, 1921, and that any of the money unexpended at that date should revert to the Treasury, and that there should be no further liability in this connection unless a new vote was made.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT said he had no objection to this proposal.</P><P>Reference having been made to the accounts of the Commission of Inquiry, the Minister for Finance said that a definite Statement of Accounts should be presented.  There would not be any vote for the Commission at this Session.</P>
<P><Col N="290"/> The DEPUTY SPEAKER mentioned that the winding up of the Commission of Inquiry was being undertaken by the Ministry, and they would of course go into the financial aspect.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR FINANCE then moved that the expenditure in the United States up to 31st March, 1921, amounting to $1,466,589.43 be confirmed by the Dáil.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT gave details of the main items in this expenditure, and explained that a large proportion of it was really chargeable to World Propaganda. There was also the expenditure in connection with preparing the ground work for a new Loan.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR FINANCE also moved that the sum of $250,000 be added to the reserve in United States, America and earmarked for expenses in connection with the new Loan.  He further moved a vote of £1,000 for the Prisoners' Dependents' Fund.</P>
<P>The DEPUTY SPEAKER then put the Report involving the adoption of the following:&mdash;</P><P>(a)  Vote of £1,000 to the Irish Republican Prisoners' Dependents' Fund.</P><P>(b)  The confirmation of the expenditure in the United States for the period ended 31st March, 1921, amounting to $1,466,589.43.</P><P>(c)  The addition of a sum of $250,000 to the Special Reserve Fund in United States, this amount to be earmarked for the launching of a second Loan.</P><P>(d)  The fixing of December 31st, 1921, as the limit of the period of liability for expenditure under the vote of £100,000 made to the Department of Local Government at the January, 1921, Session for the purposes of advances to Local Bodies, and the preparation of a scheme for repayment of same.</P><P>The Report was adopted unanimously.</P>

<P>PIARAS BEASLAI (Kerry, East) referred to a complaint made to him by the Director of Propaganda that the different Departments of the Dáil were not supplying him with reports or information for publication.  He asked the Members to remedy this as his Department could give wide publicity to matters which the daily Press would not print.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT suggested that a short history of the Dáil should be compiled by the Publicity Department.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR LABOUR pointed out that a big publicity campaign would be essential for the success of the English Boycott and for the introduction of Irish materials instead of English, and thought some arrangements should be made for such a campaign.  He complained the Irish Press published in large type and in the most prominent places all communications from the enemy Headquarters. He had got an undertaking from the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, the <i>Irish Times</i>, and the <i>Independent</i> papers that they would not publish any advertisements for Belfast goods or for English goods on the Prohibited List.</P>
<P>The ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT agreed with the Minister for Labour.  The headings in the <i>Independent</i> on communications from the Castle were very objectionable.</P>
<P>PIARAS BEASLAI (Kerry, East) having assured the House that these matters were not being neglected, the debate concluded.</P>

<P>The DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE moved:&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That the Ministry be authorised to prohibit the importation from Great Britain of any classes of goods irrespective of their country of origin.&rdquo;</P><P>This motion, he explained, was supplementary to the previous Decree made by the Dáil regarding the Boycott of English goods.  He considered that they should be empowered to prevent importation through England when suitable opportunities arose.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR LABOUR seconded.  He said it was particularly important that they should have direct agents in Ireland for foreign houses instead of sub-agents of English firms.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE said he did not object to the proposal so long as it was merely authorising the Ministry to act when considered practicable.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT thought it was a very big responsibility to place on the shoulders of a few men, most of whom had not business experience.</P><P>The motion was put and carried.</P>

    <Title>PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT. - ELECTIONS.</Title>
<P>The PRESIDENT said he did not propose to submit any written statement as it would be merely a summary of the activities of the various Departments already given in their Reports.</P><P>He had an important matter, however, to bring before the House, and it was the question whether members elected at the coming elections were to be recognised as the new Dáil.  The Ministry were agreed that they should and he was sure that the House would be of the same opinion.  He thought the best procedure would be that this present body would dissolve automatically on the assembling of the new body, and that the present Ministry would resign and hand over all its powers to the new House.  He then moved formally the following motion:</P><P>1.  That the Parliamentary elections which are to take place during the present month be regarded as elections to Dáil Eireann.</P><P>2.  That all deputies duly returned at these elections be regarded as members of Dáil Eireann and allowed to take their seats on subscribing to the proposed Oath of Allegiance.</P><P>3.  That the present Dáil dissolve automatically as soon as the new body has been summoned by the President and called to order.</P><P>4.  That the Ministry remain in power until the new Dáil has met and will thereupon resign their portfolios through the President.</P>
<P>F. FAHY (Galway, South) thought it would be almost impossible to bring all the members of the new Dáil together.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT said he thought they would be able to bring all the members together for one meeting.  They could suggest to that meeting, when the Ministry had been elected and all the formalities completed, that the House appoint a special Committee, consisting of, say, twenty members, and meetings of this Committee could be arranged.  It was obvious, he said, that the whole Dáil could not meet as they had been meeting in the past. It would be a matter for discussion at the first meeting.  He thought the <Col N="292"/> proper procedure in summoning the first meeting of the new Dáil would be that the President of the Ministry or the Speaker of the old House should issue the notices.  He thought the President would be the natural person under the circumstances.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR DEFENCE considered that since it would be the President who would be in charge until the new Dáil assembled, it was he who should be responsible for bringing them together.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE asked if it were perfectly clear who were entitled to be summoned to the new Dáil.</P>
<P>The PRESIDENT replied that everyone elected to the Northern or Southern Parliament was entitled to be summoned, Unionists and all.</P><P>After further discussion the President's motion was adopted unanimously.</P>

    <Title>PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT. - GENERAL.</Title>
<P>The PRESIDENT continuing, said that the meeting of the new Dáil might be a suitable occasion for discussing whether it would be well to have a few new articles added to the Constitution, and he would be glad to have suggestions from the members.  The members had probably seen references in the press to Lord Derby's visit to Ireland.  Derby was over and he saw him.  He (the President) regarded him as a mere political scout, and he spoke to him as he would to a Press man.  Then there was the Craig interview; he had heard a number of times that Sir James Craig was anxious to meet some of them, and he had indicated that he was quite willing to meet Craig.  The interview was of no significance.</P><P>He could say that he felt they had now come to the point in which they had turned the corner.  It was only a question now of keeping up the constructive effort and keeping the country with them.  The enemy Government were afraid of the renewal of the Republican Court activities. He urged that they should use every effort to get the Courts working again. The day they got the Courts working again all over the country they had the British heaten.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS complained he got no assistance from some members of the Dáil in organising the Courts, and he impressed on them the necessity of attending to this important work.</P>
<P>The SUBSTITUTE DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE asked how they would stand with regard to the yearly estimates if the new Dáil could not meet till the end of June.</P>
<P>The MINISTER FOR FINANCE said that the fact that a new Dáil was coming into being did not affect the Estimates, which should be prepared before the end of the present month.</P>
