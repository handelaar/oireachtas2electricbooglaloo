      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, is a lucht na Dála, is dó liom go mba cheart dom i dtosach roinnt focal a rá i dtaobh obair na nAirí uile, ach tá an oiread san oibre eile le déanamh nách féidir dom dul isteach go cúramach ann anois.  Sar a gcríochnófar obair an lae iniu tabharfaidh gach Aire cuntas ar obair a Aireachta féin.  Nuair a cuireadh deire le h-obair an chéad lae bhíos ag trácht ar chúrsaí na síochána agus ós rud é go bhfuilim ag cainnt ní h-amháin leis an Dáil ach le muinntir na tíre is dó liom gur ceart dom gach ní atá agam le rá a rá as Béarla.</P>
      <P>It would be usual that the President of the Ministry should summarise here the work of the several Departments, as I more or less concentrate in myself the whole Executive responsibility.  Perhaps, to put it more definitely, I act for the Ministry as a whole.  But as the questions we have to discuss&mdash;one question in particular&mdash;are of such transcendent importance, I think it better to leave such a summary aside and leave it to be gathered from the Reports of the Ministers.</P>
      <P>The question I was speaking on when we adjourned yesterday was the question of the negotiations with Great Britain, and I am speaking to this Assembly now in English mainly because what I have to say affects not merely this Assembly and the whole of the Irish nation, but will be heard by the whole world.</P>
      <P>From reports which I have seen this morning from the British and foreign Press, there seems to be a doubt in the mind of the world as to what our attitude is towards the British proposals. There seems to be a doubt as to whether what I have said, and as to whether our letter mean acceptance or rejection.  I think there ought to be no doubt in any body's mind.  We cannot, and we will not, on behalf of this nation, accept these terms.</P>
      <P>There is an Indian proverb&mdash;I think it was an Indian who told it to me&mdash;&ldquo;Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.&rdquo;  The Irish people are not going to be fooled this time.</P>
      <P>It is said that we are offered the status of Dominion Home Rule, that Ireland is offered the status of the British Dominions. Ireland is offered no such thing.</P>
      <P>That very phrase &ldquo;Ireland is offered Dominion status&rdquo; contains two falsehoods. According to that, where is Ireland?  There is no Ireland.  There are two broken pieces of Ireland, and these two broken pieces of Ireland are offered this so-called Dominion status. It is not Dominion status.  Ireland could never&mdash;because of the geographical facts which we are supposed to ignore&mdash; in the nature of things be offered such a thing as the status of Dominion Home Rule, because that status depends upon the fact that Australia and Canada and South Africa and the rest are not neighbours of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are neighbours of Britain, and that is a geographical fact you have to <Col N="13" /> take into account.  The geographical fact is that the Almighty has placed this island beside another island.  It is in the nature of things that we, the people of Ireland, wish to be neighbourly and because we are neighbours we want to enter into the best possible relations with the other people, because it is wise. It is good for them and for us.</P>
    <P>From the geographical fact&mdash;this is fundamental&mdash;of being neighbours we want to be neighbourly; and if the people on the other side were wise they would want to be neighbourly too.  If I am living beside a neighbour it is not neighbourly, nor is it right, nor does it tend to neighbourly relations, that that neighbour should claim the right to commandeer my house.</P>
    <P>We are not between our neighbour and the world.  That neighbour can go round us, but there is no right of way needed through our house.  If they could claim a necessary right of way, there would be something in it; but we are not standing between Britain and the world.</P>
    <P>The seas are around us, and Britain can get out to the world when she wants to. We are not shutting out the seas from her.  We have no enmity to her&mdash;at least, I hope that, if this question were settled, there would be no enmity, and I believe there would be none.  The basic fact&mdash;the fundamental fact&mdash;is that we are neighbours, and if we wish to be neighbours and have neighbourly relations, each should try not to trepass on the other's property.  England claims the right to trespass on our ground, and we cannot have neighbourly relations if that is Britain's attitude.</P>
    <P>We are asked to take historical facts into account.  What are the historic facts?  I cannot give them to you in better words than in the language of the Prime Minister himself:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Centuries of brutal and often ruthless injustice, and, what is worse, centuries of insolence and insult, have driven hatred of British rule into the very marrow of the Irish race.  The long records of oppression, proscription, and expatriation have formed the greatest blot on the British fame of equity and eminence in the realm of government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one of the historical facts.  In other words, we had to bear what formed the greatest blot on the fame of England.  That is the British Prime Minister's statement, made on March 7, 1917.</P>
    <P>That is a fundamental, historical fact, and statesmen have to take these fundamental facts into account, and with them the fundamental fact of human nature.</P>
    <P>We are the real realists.  The fundamental fact that British statesmen and all statesmen must take into account is that Britain&mdash;because she did not want to act properly beside her neighbours, but wanted to trespass on her neighbour's property&mdash;has been for centuries guilty of ruthless oppression, which has engendered in the hearts of the people thus ruthlessly treated, hatred of British rule to the marrow of their bones.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we want to end these feelings and take that fundamental fact into account, the obvious thing to do is to end that rule, which is hated by the Irish people to the marrow of their bones.</P>
    <P>It is said that the relations between Ireland and Britain constitute a problem. They do.  They constitute a problem, the very problem that we have in our daily lives, where a strong and powerful and selfish person wishes to encroach upon the rights and property and freedom of a neighbour.</P>
    <P>That is the problem, the fundamental problem, that has to be settled.  And how can it be settled?  Simply on the basis of that which everyone knows to be right and just.</P>
    <P>I have laid great stress upon justice. Is it because of idealistic or foolish notions of my own that I am doing it? It is not.  Because again we come to the fundamental basis in all these matters, which is human character.  It is not in human nature, it is not in the nature of man to be content as long as injustice is being done him; and so long as injustice is being done to this nation, so long will you find Irishmen and Irishwomen ready to give up their lives to fight this injustice.</P>
    <P>Therefore, you can have neither content, happiness, nor prosperity in a nation any more than in an individual if there is that continual thorn, that thorn of injustice, prickling.  Therefore, those who really want peace, whether it be in <Col N="14" /> Ireland or in the relations between Ireland and Britain, must&mdash;if they are not to leave human nature out of account altogether in considering the solution of the problem&mdash;take human nature into account.</P>
    <P>And we claim that we are the real statesmen in this matter, and that it is we who are working for a complete and final settlement&mdash;we, who say that the relations between Ireland and Britain must be adjusted on the basis of right&mdash; that right and justice which would in itself not conflict with human conscience. You must do it in that way if you are to have a settlement that will be final or that will be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in considering the problem, as I have said, it is the fundamental human problem, the problem of the weak who have right on their side against the strong who because of their strength can afford to be unjust.  We have to try and settle that problem.  It often happens that right clashes against right, and then statesmen have to give away, sometimes one a little and sometimes the other; but in this case it is so clearly a case of right against wrong that there can be no compromise; and if it is to be a final and satisfactory settlement there can be no compromise on the side of right.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, as a separate nation that we are talking, a nation which is defending itself against the encroachment of a foreign nation.</P>
    <P>It is as such that we entered into negotiations with Britain, and if negotiations are to be continued, it is as such that we must enter into them.</P>
    <P>If it had been demanded of me that before going to negotiate with the British Prime Minister I would first of all have to renounce our independent right, I would not have gone.  If, on the other hand, seeing the claim that they are putting forward, I had said that, before I went, Britain would have to acknowledge our right absolutely, I might have been held to have been unreasonable, because then there would be no question of or necessity for negotiation.</P>
    <P>In the same way, that the people of the north of Ireland can recognise themselves if they want to, we recognise ourselves. It is on such a basis there can be negotiations.  But if negotiations can only begin when we have given up the right of this country to live its own life in its own way, there can be no negotiations at all with the north of Ireland or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>If the north of Ireland&mdash;the people of the north of Ireland&mdash;are free to regard themselves from their own point of view in going into negotiations with us, they have not to give up that point of view.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I would be willing to suggest to the Irish people to give up a good deal in order to have an Ireland that could look to the future without anticipating distracting internal problems.</P>
    <P>That is what this negotiation has been so far as I am concerned.  It has been all the time an attempt to get in touch with the people of the north of Ireland, and to tell them we have no enmity to them, because they are Irishmen living in Ireland, and that we were ready to make sacrifices we could never think of making for Britain.</P>
    <P>Time after time it has been said that if there was any right of Ireland that could be shown to conflict with any right of Britain, we were ready to meet and to adjust these matters on the basis of mutual give and take, but it is all take on the British side&mdash;and it is supposed to be all give on the Irish side&mdash;and that is an attitude which can neither commend itself to the Irish people, nor to anybody who wishes for a satisfactory and final settlement.</P>
    <P>England is a great Power.  The population of her own island is nearly fifty millions.  We have only four and a half millions.  Yet this island with fifty millions pretends that it is afraid of us, and, to carry on the pretence, it says we must stipulate that our armaments must be reduced to a size they consider necessary in their island.</P>
    <P>We are never likely to compete with Britain in armaments.  Therefore, we have no hesitation in entering into any agreement on the limitation of armaments, provided it is obvious they intend it for that good and wise purpose, and not simply for the purpose of disarming us or making us helpless.</P>
    <P>We do not mean to be helpless.  We mean to strengthen ourselves to the utmost of our power, that we may be able to resist to the utmost of our power.</P>
    <P>If it happens that we are compelled to <Col N="15" /> give way&mdash;and great causes have had to give way to force&mdash;we shall do it boldly and we shall not seek to save our faces.</P>
    <P>We may have to surrender to force, but we are not going to allow ourselves not merely to be led into the prison house, but to give our parole, in order that they will not have the trouble of providing guards for us.</P>
    <P>I have no enmity to Britain.  In all our discussions with my colleagues, I have never seen anything like enmity to Britain or the British people.  I have never seen anything but love for Ireland, and it is love for Ireland and for the whole of it, that prompts our action, and not enmity to Britain.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are near neighbours &mdash;as has been pointed out in our official <i>Bulletin</i>&mdash;would make for our cultivating proper relations with Britain, relations which would bring us more closely together for mutual interests than any other nation in the world.</P>
    <P>But there is no likelihood that we shall see combination if it is simply combination with the enemy that has despoiled us most and that would seek in the combination an opportunity of despoiling us further.</P>
    <P>Still, an association that would be consistent with our right to see that we were the judges of what was our own interests, and that we were not compelled to leave the judgment of what were our own interests or not to others&mdash;a combination of that sort would, I believe, commend itself to the majority of my colleagues.  But it should be really a combination that would accord with the description that the British themselves gave of this offered association.  Speaking of their Dominions, they described it, in terms at any rate, which amount to a free and friendly co-operation.  Free and friendly co-operation is one thing.  Forced co-operation is another.  The co-operation of the British Dominions is free, British statesmen have admitted that it is free. They have said that as a proof that it was free, they could get out if they wanted to.  They have not chosen to get out.</P>
    <P>But we are told that we must stay in whether we like it or not; that no matter how our interests are affected, no matter how much the greater power of one of the parties is allowed to interfere with the rights of the smaller, we have no means whatever of securing that our interests will be considered.</P>
    <P>We are not claiming any right to secede, because, as was pointed out in the <i>Bulletin</i>, there can never be in the case of Ireland a question of secession because there has never been a union. They talk as if there was a union.  I say that, even if there was, that union was severed here on the 21st January, 1919.</P>
    <P>We have not been able to secure that because, unfortunately, the major problem between Ireland and Britain has engendered another problem with a section of our own people.  England has not suggested&mdash;it has no right to do anything but suggest&mdash;that there should be an arrangement by which the minority of this island might have their interests safeguarded.  If that were done, we would have been ready to give them every safeguard in reason, every safeguard that any reasonable persons could say they were entitled to.  We are ready to leave this question to external arbitration, we are ready to leave the whole question between Ireland and Britain to external arbitration.  Why?  Because we are basing our claims only on right, and because we know perfectly well that Ireland's claim, pleaded before any impartial tribunal could get a verdict, but in only one direction.</P>
    <P>England's claims in Ireland are unreasonable; the claims of the minority in Ireland are unreasonable, but even though the claims of the minority are unreasonable we would be ready to consider them, and I for one would be ready to go a long way to give way to them, particularly to their sentiment, if we could get them to come with us and to consider the interests of their own country and not ally themselves with the foreigner.</P>
    <P>I think I have made clear my attitude, and the attitude of the Ministry of Dáil Éireann.  It is on that attitude we are here before you for judgment.  It is on that attitude we are before the Irish people for judgment.  I have stated it here in Public Session, so that the Irish people may judge; and I feel that as the Irish people in the past never flinched when force was brought against them to <Col N="16" /> deprive them of their just rights, that the Irish people will not flinch now because more arms have been sent for.</P>

    <P>Count Plunkett submitted the following Report on the Department of Foreign Affairs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>On his return from America, the President, having in view the importance of strengthening and increasing our representation in foreign countries, the co-ordination of the work of our Foreign Representatives and the necessity of getting these representatives in closer touch than was hitherto possible, deemed it wise to establish a separate office for the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The work of this Department had hitherto been centred in the office of the General Secretary, who had done splendid work in spite of the fact that he could only give the Department a fraction of his time.  The new office was established in February of this year, and since then a good deal has been done in the matter of co-ordinating the work of our Foreign Representatives and of keeping them closely informed on the situation at home.  Special envoys have been sent to Germany, Russia, South America, and South Africa; an accredited representative has been appointed in Germany; Press bureaux have been established in Germany, Switzerland, Spain, and Rome, and the organisation of similar bureaux in South Africa, Australia, Chile, and the Argentine is under way.  In addition, the organisation in the United States has been put on a new basis.</P>
    <P>The Foreign establishments of the Republic at present are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Paris Representative</i>&mdash;Mr. Seán T. O Ceallaigh, T.D.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rome Representative.</i>&mdash;Mr. George Gavan Duffy, T.D.</P>
    <P>
      <i>United States Representative</i>&mdash;Mr. Harry Boland, T.D.</P>
    <P>
      <i>London Representative</i>&mdash;Mr. Art O'Brien.</P>
    <P>
      <i>German Representative</i>&mdash;Mr. J. Chartres.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Russian Representative</i>&mdash;Dr. P. McCartan, T.D.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Argentine Representative</i>&mdash;Mr. Eamon Bulfin.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Chile Representative</i>&mdash;Mr. Frank W. Egan.</P>
    <P>Official Press Bureaux are working in Paris, Berlin, Rome, Madrid, Fribourg, and the United States, while active propaganda is also being done in Denmark, Canada, South Africa, Australia, and the South American Republics.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is kept in close touch with the Trade and Publicity Departments, so as to ensure that the best results will be obtained from the co-ordination of the work of our Foreign Representatives.</P>
    <P>One of the first duties of the Department was the preparation of the material accompanying the &ldquo;Address to the Representatives of Foreign Nations,&rdquo; which was adopted at the January Session of An Dáil.  This document was forwarded to our Foreign Representatives with instructions to have it translated into the different languages and delivered to each elected representative in the following countries:&mdash;France, Spain, Germany, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Bulgaria, Austria, Czecho-Slovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Switzerland, Turkey, Jugo Slavia, Belgium, Holland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Russia, Japan, China, Phillipines, the British Colonies, and all the countries on the American Continent.  A great deal of this work has already been done.  Arrangements have been made to have the address read before the United States Senate, and it is hoped that the same may be done in other countries.  Our Representatives in France, Italy, Germany, Canada, and Chile are working in this direction.</P>
    <P>Particulars of the work being done in various countries are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Argentine</i>&mdash;Through our Representative in Buenos Aires (Mr. Eamon Bulfin) steps are being taken for the issue in that country of a <i>Bulletin</i>, the material for which would be derived from the <i>Irish Bulletin</i> and other sources of propaganda.  We are at present awaiting from Mr. Bulfin an estimate of the probable cost of the proposed production.</P>
    <P>Though communication from home <Col N="17" /> with the Argentine is difficult and slow, Mr. Bulfin's reports afford great encouragement as to the support that might be expected there for the Republican cause. He emphasises, however, the urgent need that exists of educating the whole people of the Argentine&mdash;as distinct from the Irish there&mdash;to the true position of Ireland and her claim to recognition as an Independent Republic, and considers that a publication something similar to that proposed would effect enormous good in this direction as well as helping to secure a solid footing for a special mission from Ireland to the Argentine.  In the opinion of Mr. Bulfin the President of the Argentine is favourably disposed towards the Irish Republican cause, and if the United States Government recognised the Irish Republic he (Mr. Bulfin) feels sure that the Argentine Government would do likewise.  Mr. Bulfin mentions local differences and animosities resulting from a split of ten years ago as factors operating against the power of the Irish in the Argentine, but here again he believes the <i>Bulletin</i> could be put to good use in wiping out misunderstandings and working towards complete and effective reorganisation.  A number of newspapers published in the Argentine are friendly disposed towards the Irish Cause.  Mr. Ginnell, T.D., who has been sent as a special envoy on a mission to the Argentine and the other South American Republics, was present by official invitation at the Te Deum to commemorate the Independence of Peru.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Chile</i>&mdash;Mr. Frank W. Egan, our honorary Representative in Santiago reports that the elections in March to the National Congress proved favourable for the Democratic and Labour parties.  At the opening in June of the two legislative bodies the Senate held a slight Conservative majority, but in the House of Representatives the Democratic, Radical, and Labour parties combined to form a majority, and will work together. Mr. Egan hopes to get forward a declaration from this assembly, and with this end in view is working with several of the new deputies.  Plans are being laid for the formation of an Irish Association, and Mr. Egan hopes for great success, judging from the results of his appeal to all Irishmen to join the organisation known as the &ldquo;Irish Colony of Chile.&rdquo; In a report recently received from a gentleman in Santiago, genuinely sympathetic towards the Irish Cause, and a close friend of the new President, the writer states that the latter is in sympathy with the Irish Cause, and adds: &ldquo;The great point is that recognition (of the Irish Republic) by Chile would inevitably bring recognition by the Argentine and possibly Brazil as well, in addition to acting as an incentive to the United States to take the step over which they appear to be hesitating.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are making inquiries as to the feasibility of issuing a <i>Bulletin</i> in Chile on the same lines as that proposed for the Argentine.  Meanwhile a magazine, <i>The American World</i>, published twice monthly in Valparaiso, strongly advocates Irish Independence.</P>
    <P>
      <i>United States</i>&mdash;Reports from the United States continue encouraging, the Irish Cause gaining in sympathy and support there each day.  Arrangements have been made to have the &ldquo;Address to the Representatives of Foreign Nations&rdquo; (adopted at the January Session of the Dáil) read to the Senate of the United States, and distributed to every elected representative in Canada, Newfoundland, Argentine, Bolivia, and every other country on the American Continent.  The &ldquo;Address&rdquo; is also being translated into Japanese and Chinese, and the members of the Japanese and Chinese Diets will be in possession of it in due course.  Mr. Boland continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are entering into a strenuous campaign for recognition.  For the first time in the history of the Irish in America, they are alive to the situation, and are now organised intelligently, and are displaying great initiative in securing results. Whereas, up to the time the President left this country, there was but one central office for American Organisations friendly to Ireland; to-day, thanks to the efforts of our friends, we have 56 offices throughout the States.  The American Association for the recognition of the Irish Republic hopes to complete its labours ere the next year dawns, and the atmosphere round Washington is fairly friendly.  I think that we can guarantee that Ireland's case will be well ventilated during this Session in Congress.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> Copies of &ldquo;Ireland's Request for Recognition&rdquo; to the number of about 5,000 were sent to all Embassies and Legations and important personages in North and South America, Canada, South Africa, Australia, and Europe; also to all United States Congressmen and Senators, and all Members of the British House of Commons, all Members of Canadian Legislatures, all members of Relief Committees in New York and Washington, and important friends in all parts of the world.  Arrangements have also been made to have copies distributed amongst the officers of the American Association for the Recognition of the Irish Republic all over the United States.</P>
    <P>Concerning the April Convention, Mr. Boland reports :</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The greatest Convention ever held in America (A.A.R.I.R.) has come and gone, and certainly the gathering was a magnificent justification for the stand taken by the President during his stay here.  I could not adequately report the enthusiasm and spirit which animated the great gathering.  It was certainly an inspiring sight to see the delegates numbering over 5,000, representing the 48 States of the Union, each vieing with the other in their efforts to get behind the people of Ireland in their struggle ... the time for action is now. The Senate Resolutions have been introduced.  Senator La Follette has made his opening speech.  The Resolutions have now been referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the full force of public opinion must be directed towards securing the reporting out of these resolutions.  All are agreed that it can be done, and we must needs, therefore, lend our every effort to secure the full pressure of the Association behind these resolutions. The A.A.R.I.R. have set up a legislative Committee....  We have decided that during this Session of Congress at least two members of the Committee shall be on the spot here at Washington.  Each separate State will also have its Legislative Committee, and we hope to get sympathetic resolutions through many State Legislatures.  Already the following State Legislatures have passed resolutions urging President Harding to recognise our Republic :&mdash;New Jersey, Montana, Illinois, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Winconsin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Stephen O'Mara, Plenipotentiary Representative of the Trustees of Dáil Eireann has proceeded to the United States where his main duty will be to make provisions for raising a new Loan of twenty million dollars.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Italy</i>&mdash;Since May last an <i>Irish Bulletin</i> has been published in Rome containing Irish news and for propaganda purposes in general.  The visit of Archbishop Mannix to Rome did great good to our cause at the Vatican, where it was feared that English intrigue and lying propaganda would succeed in inducing the Pope to make a statement calculated to do immense harm to the Irish Republican Cause.  This danger, it would appear is now past, but is always to be guarded against as the propaganda is certain to be renewed as soon as the remarkable effect created by Archbishop Mannix's visit is thought to have worn off.  In a recent Memo., Mr. Gavan Duffy, writing relative to the then pending General Election to the Parliament of Italy, stated that the Catholic Popular Party is likely to come back less strong, but the system of Proportional Representation will secure them some show in the new House.  &ldquo;These,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;are our best friends, but there is generally a good disposition in the other parties, save perhaps among the Masons, who compose the Liberal Party now in office, and are only lukewarm at best.&rdquo;  The election has since taken place, but thus far it is not possible to estimate as to the amount of support our cause is likely to receive in the new Parliament further than to mention that it bodes well to find that the Catholic Party was returned at practically the same strength as before.</P>
    <P>Since taking up residence in Rome, Mr. Gavan Duffy has been responsible for much propaganda work.  This was badly needed, as hitherto opinion there has been very friendly but ignorant.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Spain</i>&mdash;A Press Bureau has been established in Madrid, where a <i>Bulletin</i> is being issued under the charge of Miss <Col N="19" /> O'Brien.  There are strong hopes that the results will prove highly satisfactory. Mr. Gavan Duffy reported on his recent visit to Spain that &ldquo;No country in Europe holds Ireland in such honour and affection, except Catalonia where our name stands higher still.  I visited Salamanca, and had enthusiastic reception from students of Irish College.  The College stands high in popular estimation. Better and more information is badly wanted especially to correct false wires from London.  Irish Nuns in Madrid who are very influential in high circles are all with us.  Dr. O'Doherty spent a week with me in Madrid, and we were extremely well received everywhere. Spain has a big influence in South America.  The Dominicans, who are very powerful in Spain, are very enthusiastic for Ireland.  I found people very receptive.  If we made ourselves strong in Madrid, the result would be of the utmost importance in Rome, where Spain stands very high indeed.  Many newspapers friendly towards Ireland&mdash; some absolutely pro-Irish.  We stand very high in Spain, but there is a big field open and untilled.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Germany</i>&mdash;A Press Bureau has lately been established in Berlin, where the initial work regarding the issuing of a <i>Bulletin</i> having been carried out by a talented young Dublin lady is being continued by the newly appointed envoy. There is an active pro-Irish Society in Germany.  A number of our friends in Berlin are rendering assistance in the publication of the <i>Bulletin</i> which, we have been informed, has met with an encouraging reception.  Following his recent visit to Germany, Mr. Gavan Duffy strongly emphasised the urgency and importance of real hard work on our behalf in that country.  He wrote :&mdash;&ldquo;I feel that, believing in the rise of Germany as I do, I can hardly exaggerate either the importance of this or its urgency.  I found the Germans exceedingly friendly, but the agencies are bad and knowledge scanty.  There is a certain amount of admiration here, as every where else, for the magnificent bravery of our fight, but I think the predominant factor in sustaining interest is a lively sense of our potential value to the enemies of England.  But in Germany as elsewhere, I found some scepticism as to our power of holding out or as to our persistance in no compromise against such odds&mdash;a feeling that I have had to combat and dispel everywhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Switzerland</i>&mdash;A <i>Bulletin</i> is being issued in Fribourg by a Committee, of which Father Staunton is in charge. Our friends in Switzerland are founding a pro-Irish organisation there.  Our Paris Representative (Mr. Seán T. O Ceallaigh, T.D.) considers this plan a good one and recommends that it be aided financially.  We are awaiting an estimate from him as to the proposed expenditure before taking further action.</P>
    <P>
      <i>South Africa</i>&mdash;The Irish in South Africa are organising effectively to give what support they can to the Cause of the Republic.  Two envoys recently sent to South Africa have submitted reports which, on the whole, may be regarded as encouraging.  Mr. Little states that the way has been well prepared for the Irish Mission.  An Irish Republican Association was started about six months ago, with a fortnightly journal, <i>The Republic.</i> There were ten branches of the Irish Republican Association represented at the first Annual General Meeting in Bloemfontein in February.  Since then, three new branches have been formed. The Central Council sent a deputation to General Smuts prior to his departure to England.  The Dutch papers are favourable to Ireland.  The English papers are entirely Jingo.  Mr. Little attended at Johannesburg a conference of 20 branches of the Irish Republican Association which appointed sub-committees (1) for Trade, (2) Organisation, and (3) to draft memo and arrange deputation to General Smuts.  The other envoy reports that the Republican question in South Africa is not ended and will divide the people there for many years; each side is striving to strengthen its position. All cables and wireless companies southward and eastward are in English hands and publish nothing but English propaganda. The majority of the Irish are favourable, but are followers of General Smuts.  They are mostly quite ignorant on the Irish question, but may be redeemed by the present movement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Denmark</i>&mdash;Pamphlets of a propagandist nature are being issued in Paris and <Col N="20" /> distributed through Denmark where we have a number of friends interesting themselves in the Cause of the Irish Republic.  In connection with our activities in Denmark, it is to be noted that Mr. Gerald O'Loughlin, who had been working there unofficially in the interests of Ireland, was recently called before the police authorities and ordered to cease propaganda work for Ireland.  Mr. O'Loughlin has since been trying to organise a small committee of local people to undertake the work.  Reports go to show that Denmark is almost the most pro-English country in Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Canada</i>&mdash;The Irish Self Determination League, of which Mr. Lindsay Crawford is President, is making good progress in Canada, where our friends are working hard in the way of organisation with a view to rendering effective service to the Republican Cause.  Mr. Osmond Esmonde, Republican Envoy, was recently arrested in Vancouver on a charge of &ldquo;Sedition&rdquo; and ordered to be deported. We have been officially informed through the United States that the allegation contained in the charge was faked&mdash;that Mr. Esmonde gave no undertaking on arriving at Vancouver, and that he made no speech in public.  It is also noted that the oath which Mr. Esmonde was required to take before being allowed into Australia was specially prepared, and that no other person since or before has been asked to take such an oath. This is an instance of enemy interference to prevent the true facts of our case being laid before the people of other countries.  In a letter dated April 15, Mr. Harry Boland, writing from the United States, stated that he hoped to have a Canadian Member of Parliament read the &ldquo;Address to the Representatives of Foreign Nations&rdquo; in the Canadian Congress.  The following is a copy of the letter received by Mr. Boland from the Secretary of the Canadian League for Self Determination :&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I beg to say that the National Executive of the Self Determination League of Canada for Ireland, and Newfoundland, will do everything possible to influence this country's delegates to the Imperial Conference and with that end in view we are endeavouring to bring stronger pressure there in order to create a favourable opinion towards Ireland. We sincerely appreciate the trust placed in us by President de Valera, and would request you to extend to him our sincere thanks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Russia</i>&mdash;Dr. McCartan, T.D., our envoy in Russia, arrived there in February. A report from him lately to hand states that he had an interview with the Foreign Minister, who seemed pretty well informed on the Irish question. After the interview Dr. McCartan was asked to make his request in writing and was promised speedy discussion and decision.  He was informed, however, that no action would be taken until Russia had first concluded the Trade Treaty with England.  Dr. McCartan handed in his request in writing; he states that he was assured that the Trade Treaty with England would not in any way affect the question of Russia recognising Ireland.  The Russian Foreign Office had got the impression that Ireland would compromise, and that this effected their readiness to recognise.</P>
    <P>
      <i>France</i>&mdash;Mr. Seán T. O Ceallaigh, T.D. continues to look after our interests in Paris, and has also rendered effective service in connection with Press and propaganda work in Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, and Belgium.  Recent events go to show that the Irish Cause is occupying big space in the French Press and that our position there is improving from day to day.  Our Representative, Mr. Seán T. O Ceallaigh, in a recent report, says :&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The recent turn of events at home has once again quickened the interest of the French people and Press in the future of Ireland.  Not a single day passes now without one, or more than one, of the principal papers in Paris publishing long special articles on the Irish situation and the possible outcome of the present conferences in London. There is no doubt whatsoever but that the sympathy of all elements of the population here is with us; there is no country in the world, where there is not a large Irish population, that would welcome with greater joy a conclusion to the Irish fight for independence satisfactory to the Irish people.  The numbers of <Col N="21" /> inquiries and callers here daily alone would prove this.  All shades of people and all politics are represented among those who come here looking for information or merely to express their sympathy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Australia</i>&mdash;Mr. James Donovan, Acting State Secretary, Self Determination League for Ireland of Australia, lately forwarded copies of the Constitution of that Organisation which pledges its members &ldquo;To secure organised support for the right of the people of Ireland to choose freely, without coercion or dictation from outside, their own Governmental Institutions, and their political relationship with other States and peoples.&rdquo;  Press extracts go to show that the League is gaining in support despite big opposition.  Our Cause in Australia will be considerably strengthened following the return to that country of Archbishop Mannix who rendered such excellent service in Rome and elsewhere. A special envoy of the Republic arrived in Australia in February.</P>
    <P>
      <i>London</i>&mdash;Our interests in London are looked after by Mr. Art O'Brien, who, of late, however, has been considerably hampered in his work owing to raids, arrests and deportations.  Following a recent decision of the Ministry to allocate £4,000 per annum towards our London establishment, Mr. Art O'Brien wrote stating that that amount would enable him to go ahead without the constant anxiety he had experienced up to then in relation to finances.  He had engaged a permanent manager, and was making other arrangements to enable the work of the Mission to proceed on an effective basis when the late raids interfered greatly with his activities, the newly appointed manager, Mr. C.B. Dutton, being arrested and deported to Ireland. Mr. O'Brien now states that the arrests and raids have made such a terrible mess of things that it will be a long time before he can get things straight.  Mr. F. Murphy of the London office has already been arrested and deported, after the place had been raided and correspondence, etc., carried away.  The Irish Self Determination League, of which Mr. O'Brien is Vice-President, are themselves issuing a review of a propagandist nature.  The League has been organised on a firm basis throughout Great Britain, and has been rendering good service to the Irish Republican Cause.</P>
    <P>
      <i>World Conference of Irish Race</i>&mdash;The Irish Republican Association of South Africa recently forwarded to the Irish Self Determination League of Great Britain a resolution urging the calling together of a Conference of the Irish race throughout the world at which delegates would be present from Great Britain, the United States, Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the South American countries, and Spain, Austria, and France, etc., and which would proceed to take such steps as might be deemed advisable to assist the cause of the Irish Republic. This suggestion being deemed an admirable one, is being acted upon, and it is hoped to bring off the Conference in Paris or some other centre next January.  Needless to say, a good deal of organising work will be required, but the preliminary arrangements are already well in hand.&mdash;Riobard O Breandáin, Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs.  (August 10, 1921).</P>

      <P>I merely wish to propose formally that consideration of this Report be referred to the Private Session of the Dáil.  I think the members of the Dáil and those who have listened to it must be impressed profoundly by the enormous work accomplished by this Department.  They have, I think, deserved well of Ireland, for they have revealed Ireland to the world and revealed to the world what is the right conception of affairs in Ireland. The world knows to-day that Ireland is not a mere section of England, but an historic nation determined to achieve its rights no matter what the cost may be.</P>

      <P>[Translation].</P>
      <P>The Republican Courts since the last Session have made some progress.  Owing to enemy action&mdash;death and arrest of Justices and Officials&mdash;the Courts for a time fell into abeyance in many places. They are going again, however, in almost every part of the country, and ere long it is expected that they will be re-established and in such a strong position that no effort on the part of the British forces will be able to dislodge them.  I must here pay a special tribute to a few districts which never for a day ceased to carry on their work.  I refer particularly to North and South Longford, North City of Dublin, Cork City and parts of Cork County, East Limerick, and East and West Clare.</P>
      <P>The Republican Police have been established practically throughout the entire country.  This force is certain to prove an efficient arm of the Government in the maintenance of order and in the execution of Court Orders.  The work of the Brigade Police Officers will be heavy and responsible, and I propose to make these men whole-time officials.  For this purpose I shall move for a vote.</P>
      <P>In accordance with a decision of the Ministry, a Bureau has been established under this Department for the purpose of co-ordinating Relief Work by keeping each District in touch with the different bodies having control of moneys for Relief.</P>
      <P>Steps which have been taken have had a very good effect in checking the flow of young people out of Ireland.  Emigration Agents are being made to comply with the law of the Republic.  The figures for the months of May, June, and July, whilst not absolutely satisfactory, show a decided falling-off when compared with the number of persons who left the country during the same period in former years.</P>

    <P>It is to be noted that in the Foreign amounts, set out above, the figures represent on the Receipts side the balance as at the 30th April last, and on the other side, the expenditure as from the same date. It will be remembered that the Statement submitted recently brought the Foreign accounts up to that date. It is to be observed that the balance held abroad is only an estimate, as all the accounts from the Foreign centres are not yet completed. The expenditure may exceed the amount given here, but on the other hand there will be revenue which will probably more than counterbalance it.</P>
    <P>As is known to Dáil Members, there are proposals pending connected with the general aspect of Finances in Ireland. These proposals are contained in detail in Supplementary Papers.</P>
    <P>The position of our funds I regard as satisfactory. There is a sufficient Gold Reserve. The raising of new Loans at home and abroad has been sanctioned, and the details are being attended to.</P>
    <P>The Department has operated throughout the period under review in a satisfactory manner. The arrangements made to meet the enemy attack on our funds have so far frustrated his designs.</P>
    <P>A complete audit of all Departmental Receipts and Expenditure is maintained at all times, and works well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="THE PRESIDENT THE PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>THE PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>said he did not think it right that they should allow this Report to pass without giving expression of their thanks to the people of America for their generosity in subscribing to our Funds.  It was generous, because they could not give the subscribers the same security for their bonds as other nations, which were recognised internationally, could give, but they intended that every one of these bonds would be made good by the Irish nation.</P>
      <P>They asked for a Loan of ten million dollars in America, and they had received already five and a half millions.  They got full value for the bond, and that value of five and a half million dollars was now in the Irish Treasury.</P>
      <P>If there is one man to whom more than another the Irish nation should be thankful for the success of that enterprise it was the Chairman of the American Delegation on Irish Independence, Mr. Frank P. Walsh.  He would be ungrateful if he did not say there that whilst he was in America and whilst his colleagues were in America there was never one single request that they asked of Mr. Walsh that he was not ready to accede to.  His time and his influence were at their disposal.  He put them at their disposal, because he felt that he was working in a noble cause.  It was as a champion of that noble cause and as a friend of Ireland that they welcomed him there.</P>
      <P>Also he would be ungrateful if he did not mention the person to whom most of the executive work in America fell. He was not at the present time, they regretted, a member of their Assembly. He referred to the late Member for Kilkenny, Mr. O'Meara.  The fact that their funds were what they are to-day was due to the work in America of Mr. Frank P. Walsh and Mr. O'Meara.</P>
      <P>Whilst they recognised the generosity of their friends in foreign countries, and whilst he was asking them to pass a vote of thanks to the American people and asking that Mr. Walsh should be for them in America the interpreter of their gratitude, he thought it would be wrong if they passed from these accounts without speaking of the magnificent response of their own people to the call.</P>
      <P>In Ireland it had often been said in the past that their own people when asked would contribute more, even in proportion to their means, than people abroad.  They were ready to give up their lives and their money for Ireland; and in Ireland, owing directly to the work done by the Minister of Finance, to whom all credit in Ireland was due, the amount that was asked for was oversubscribed by about one-half.  Hence he thought they could feel that they had behind them the strength of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>He was not such a cynic as to take it as an absolute test, but it was said that the best test they had of the support of the people was the amount they were ready to contribute in support of a movement.  They would regard it as a good test.</P>
      <P>The Irish people had responded to that test magnificently, and their friends in America had responded to it magnificently. He asked them to give Mr. Frank P. Walsh the duly authenticated thanks of that Assembly, to be conveyed by him to the American people, and also to give the Minister of Finance a vote of thanks, to be conveyed to the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>He was asking the nation as a whole to thank those who were pioneers, and who had enabled them to get thus far with the nation's work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins1919" hpid="MR. MICHAEL COLLINS MR. MICHAEL COLLINS">
      <NameTxt>MR. MICHAEL COLLINS</NameTxt>
      <P>seconded the vote of thanks.  He said he desired particularly to add his tribute to the work that had been done by the workers at home.  Their friends in America could subscribe their five dollars and they could carry their receipts about in their <Col N="26" /> pockets without having a gun stuck under their noses if they were found. The people of Ireland had to subscribe under those conditions, and they did subscribe and took their receipts; and they worked for the loan through many holds-up and through many nights and days.</P>
      <P>It was nearly as bad to have a loan receipt found on one as it was to be found with a gun.  That was what the people who subscribed to this loan had to stand, and he could only hope and he could only assure them that, as far as he was concerned, his part would be done in making good the promises that these bonds would be redeemed.</P>

      <P>The work of the Labour Ministry deals largely with the settlement of strikes and disputes.  It is the intention of the Labour Department of Dáil Eireann to oust the British Ministry of Labour, which has sought to act as an arbitrator for the settlement of wages in Ireland. We have seen the want of success attending the efforts of the Government institution in England, but it is our intention to set up a real Ministry of Labour in Ireland with the object of settling disputes in a manner satisfactory to both parties.</P>
      <P>Of course, arbitration will only be undertaken at the request of both parties to the dispute.  In March last a scheme for the erection of local conciliation boards was set up, and up to the present had been considered by 88 public bodies, 70 of which had already adopted it.</P>
      <P>The great problem of unemployment has been exercising our minds, and I must here acknowledge the great help that has been given to us by the Labour Party of Ireland.  They have been in the true sense of the word a Labour Party, because they have not allowed any class interest to interfere with the progress of the nation as a whole.</P>
      <P>Owing to the exigencies, a great part of our work in the Labour Ministry was in connection with the Belfast Boycott.</P>
      <P>This boycott is a weapon placed in our hands on account of the murders in Belfast of people, simply because they refused to sign away their rights to think as they though best on matters of religion and politics.</P>
      <P>The pogrom which disgraced Belfast last year needed punishment, and Dáil Eireann had decided to boycott Belfast until such times as the pogromists saw fit not to victimise people for their religious and political beliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On February 1st I took charge of the boycott, and since that time the work has gone forward well.  Twelve organisers and 400 committees were appointed and, with the possible exception of the Counties Antrim and Down, it was almost impossible for a Belfast merchant to sell a pennyworth of goods in any part of Ireland.  The work of organisation would, of course, be impossible were it not for the co-operation of the I.R.A.  The assistance of Irish Labour was also of great help to us, because wherever Labour was told not to handle Belfast goods they acceded to that request.  Some of the firms in Dublin with the biggest names saw fit to trade with Belfast, but every one of these had in the end to pay a fine of £100 to the Finance Department of Dáil Eireann and to sign an apology for having broken the boycott.  The Belfast merchants used every ruse to break the boycott, and a number of cross-channel firms had helped them.  A Black List of these was issued, with the result that managing directors asked them for God's sake to take off the boycott, professing to have great sentimental as well as business interests in Ireland.  What showed <Col N="28" /> the strength and effectiveness of the boycott was that more bankruptcies took place in Belfast during the half-year ended June 30 than at any other period within living memory.  The executive portion of the British boycott was also in charge of the Labour Department.  The piecemeal nature of the boycott has naturally had the effect of making it not so drastic as the Belfast boycott, but, as it progresses, I think it will have at least as good an effect.  The Northern Banks have also been excluded from the rest of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that in a couple of areas in North-West Connaught the Belfast boycott has not been so successful as it might be.  The Truce does not mean that the Belfast boycott is off, but only that drastic action cannot be taken at present.</P>

    <Title>INTERIM REPORT OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR.</Title>
    <P>1.  The renewed activity of the British Military Administration has interfered with the activity of this Department in common with other Departments of Dáil Eireann.  The only correspondence which is allowed to dribble through the English Postal System are the query forms giving the figures as to the price of Agricultural produce consumed as food, and the wages and hours of employees.</P>
    <P>2.  The Labour Committee were summoned to two meetings, namely, on the 9th September and on the 7th October &mdash;the latter meeting proved abortive for want of a quorum.</P>
    <P>3.  On the 23rd August the Ministry gave their approval to the proposal of the Committee to set up a National Conciliation Board for the settlement of Trade Disputes, and on the 11th September notices of the establishment of the Board appeared in the Daily Press. Simultaneously, notices were issued to Trades' Societies, Farmers' Unions, and Employers' Associations to the same effect.  Every Sinn Féin Cumann and Comhairle Ceanntair were likewise notified.</P>
    <P>4.  At the meeting of the Committee on the 9th September it was decided to collect statistics as to the comparative price of agricultural produce used for consumption as food, particulars as to burdens on the producer which have tended to increase the cost of production, and the wages and hours of employees in Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Pursuits, taking the present year with that of 1913; and accordingly, Forms were issued to all Sinn Féin Cumann and Farmers' Unions asking for the required information.  A considerable number have come to hand from different parts of the country.  When complete records are received, it is intended to schedule area groups that show an approximate level in regard to prices and conditions and consult with the various interests in these groups with a view to the promotion of a more stable condition of affairs in the employment of labour.</P>
    <P>The following summary gives the result of the activities of the National Conciliation Board to date:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i.)  <i>Pending before the Board:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dublin Bead Works Strike (wages and output).</P>

    </P>
    <P>With reference to Paragraph 4 of same, about a month ago I got back the returns; they had evidently been lost or mislaid as a result of enemy action.</P>
    <P>On the 7th July, 1920, I was appointed Secretary to the Labour Department by Madame Markievicz.  Previous to that date I have records of the successful intervention of the Minister in association with Mr. Art O'Connor, T.D. in serious disputes in the counties of Kerry, Kildare, and Meath, and I shall now give a resumé of the working of the Department from the 7/7/20 to the 26/9/20, the date on which the Countess was arrested.</P>
    <P>The balance of the month of July was taken up in securing premises, furniture, and staff for the Department, so one might say that real work did not commence until the beginning of August. In that month, having ascertained that the enemy Government contemplated establishing machinery for the purpose of dealing with the salaries and wages of public officials, the Minister for Labour circularised all the Public Authorities in Ireland suggesting a scheme for the amicable settlement of disputes that might arise between such bodies and their officials or employees.  I attach a copy of this scheme (Appendix A). Except in a few instances, those Public Authorities which pledged allegiance to Dáil Eireann adopted the scheme.</P>
    <P>In August a Conference at which the Minister for Labour, the Teachta for St. James's, Mr. Joseph McGrath, and myself attended, was held to consider the question of State Insurance, and it was unanimously agreed that Dáil Eireann could not undertake a scheme of State Insurance at that time, but it was recommended that all Approved Societies under enemy Acts should transfer their investments from Government Stocks into Irish Trustee Stocks.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of September, 1920, it was decided to open a bureau for the purpose of finding employment for men who resigned from the R.I.C. from patriotic motives.  On the 9th September, 1920, Mr. J.M., ex-R.I.C.-man, Listowel, who resigned from that force on hearing instructions issued by Col. Smith on his visit to that town, was appointed Secretary.  Unfortunately, though he worked very conscientiously, his efforts met with very little success.</P>
    <P>A bureau was also established to find work for members of the I.R.A. and Cumann na mBan who, through victimisation or other causes, had been forced to leave their employment.</P>
    <P>Miss Lily O'Brennan was placed in charge of this bureau.  In this work she was eminently successful, and succeeded in securing employment for a considerable number of applicants.</P>
    <P>During the period in review, viz., 7th July to 26th September, 1920, the Department of Labour intervened on thirty-one occasions where disputes had arisen between employers and employed. On the date of the Minister's arrest, fourteen of these cases had been settled in a satisfactory manner.  In five cases intervention of the Department was not accepted by one or other of the Parties concerned, and in the remaining cases (12) negotiations were in progress.</P>
    <P>Mr. McGrath, T.D. was appointed substitute Minister for Labour at the end of October, and he was arrested on the 2nd December.  During that period the work of the Department was carried on as usual, and the number of disputes on the date of his arrest in which the Department had intervened had risen from thirty-one to sixty.  In thirty-two of the sixty cases settlements had been reached, twenty were being dealt with, two unsuccessful conferences had taken place, and the number of unsuccessful attempts at intervention had risen from five to six.  During this period, the Convention of the Self-Determination <Col N="30" /> League of Great Britain was held in Manchester on the 27th November, and Mr. Mee was sent across with a view to getting in touch with our friends on the other side who might be able to secure employment for those ex-policemen whose bona-fides had been ascertained. He was away for one month, and during that period he received enormous promises of support&mdash;in fact, on his return he was satisfied that within a short period one hundred (100) of these men would have been &ldquo;placed&rdquo; in England.  Unfortunately, the slump in English trade and industry at that moment commenced to become more and more acute, with the result that instead of being able to find positions for any police refugees from Ireland, thousands of our own countrymen across the water lost their own jobs.</P>
    <P>From the beginning of December to the end of January the routine work of the Department was carried on as usual, and on the 20th January I submitted to the Ministry a short summary of the work of the Department, and the position on that date was as follows :&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <i>Conciliation Boards.</i>  In March last a scheme for the erection of Local Conciliation Boards was issued to all the Councils in Ireland.  Up to the present we have received notification that the scheme was considered by 88 Public Bodies; of this number 70 adopted the scheme; 5 adjourned its consideration; 13 considered it unnecessary or marked it &ldquo;Read,&rdquo; and one retained it for further reference.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Finance.</i>  The amount expended in the ordinary work of the Labour Department from 1st February, 1921 to 31st July, 1921, amounted to £150, but there are a few small items owing in respect of fees; £200 will, however, cover everything.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Unemployment.</i>  Offices have now been taken for a Bureau for the relief of Unemployment, and the co-operation of the Irish Labour Party has been promised, and I have hopes that with the new fillip given the Irish industries as a result of the British Boycott, unemployment will be considerably decreased.  This Bureau will also tend to make the Labour Department the logical arbitrator where disputes and strikes occur between employers and employees.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New Union.</i>  As a result of a dispute between the English Musicians' Union's Executive in Ireland, which is composed almost altogether of Englishmen, and some of its members, a new Irish Musicians' Union has been formed.  I have hopes that within a short time almost all Irish musicians will transfer to the Irish Musicians' Union.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Relief of Distress.</i>  I am in communication with the Organising Secretary of the White Cross in connection with the Scheme for the conservation of water-power in Donegal, Connemara, Kerry, and Arklow.  If this scheme is adopted it will mean the employment of a very considerable amount of unskilled labour, as the major portion of the work will consist in making dams.  Such a scheme would, of course, give a great impetus to the industrial revival, as, according to the reports of several technical experts, the water-power thus created would be equivalent to the using of coal at the rate of 6/- per ton.  It is an industrial maxim that industries follow cheap power, and it is not too much to expect that these areas will benefit enormously if the scheme is intelligently carried through.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Belfast Boycott.</i> Early in February of this year, the organising of the Belfast Boycott, then roughly nine months in operation, was taken over by the Ministry for Labour. Immediately the country was mapped out into ten areas and an organiser appointed to each. A central office to control operations generally was established in Dublin, and the Belfast office reorganised. The organisers carried out their work splendidly, and effective committees sprang up all over the country, each in direct touch [32] with headquarters and, where possible, in touch with neighbouring committees. Instructions were issued from G.H.Q., I.R.A., for full co-operation between local Brigades and the committees. Two clergymen were also appointed to tour the country to secure the support of the priests in the interest of the Boycott.</P>
    <P>At present there are close on four hundred Committees in existence, all, with few exceptions, working with great enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>Three of our Organisers have been arrested, one being subsequently released after a few weeks' detention. Their places were filled without delay.</P>
    <P>Owing to the heavy work devolving on the Secretaries in Cork, Limerick, and Derry, paid officials were appointed in those places. In Dublin two Organisers were employed, and a Patrol of Volunteers (on the suggestion of the O/C Dublin Brigade). Thousands of cases of dealings with Belfast were investigated, and where necessary strong action was taken. Many houses were raided, and Order Books and tainted goods taken away. Several of the leading firms in the city who were proved offending against the boycott were fined up to the extent of one hundred pounds. The fines in almost every case were promptly paid. By the aid of persons sympathetic a close watch was established on all the railway termini in the city, on the several shipping companies at the Port, and on the carters, so that at present it is practically impossible for Belfast goods to enter or pass through the city directly, undetected. The drapers' and other shop assistants have given much valuable assistance in this way.</P>
    <P>Early this year a big effort was made by the Belfast merchants to re-open trade. To this end depots were opened in many cross-Channel towns, principally Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, and London, and the goods sent over here as coming from a purely English firm. Many of the English merchants lent themselves to this. A large amount of this traffic has been detected and stopped. It may be pointed out that this course could only be adopted in the case of surplus stocks which the Pogromists are prepared to dispose of at a loss, as the expense incurred in the rounda-about process would militate against ordinary trade prices.</P>
    <P>That Belfast is feeling the turn of the screw is evident from the large number of bankruptcies that have occurred and from the knowledge that has come to us that a very big percentage of the surviving firms are only carrying on with the help of mortgages on their premises.</P>
    <P>By means of advertisments, this existence of the boycott is being kept forcibly before the public. Hundreds of thousands of leaflets and large posters have been distributed at intervals to all the Committees, and special literature supplied for local use when desired.</P>
    <P>About March of this year it was decided to publish a black list of offending firms, both English and Irish. This list also contained the dumps whence Belfast goods were being distributed under cover. This list was spread broadcast, and had the effect of bringing many of the offenders into line. A second and more comprehensive list was issued in May. Local black lists were printed at the request of the committees in several towns.</P>
    <P>A very vigorous campaign against the Belfast, Ulster, and Northern Banks was initiated in June, and an order issued and prominently displayed in Dublin and the provinces declaring notes and cheques on these Banks illegal. The principal traders in Dublin were notified not to accept these notes in payment. Lists of persons having their accounts in these Banks were procured, and these concerned notified to withdraw such without delay. Evidence has come to hand that this campaign is one of the most potent of the boycott weapons.</P>
    <P>There are some weak points in the boycott organisation. One is that owing to the difficulties of forming Committees in the Counties of Antrim, Down, and Derry, we suspect that some towns in these areas are used for distributing Belfast goods. We have discovered several isolated cases of such camouflage and stopped them. We cannot, however, always tell whether goods sent out from these towns are bona fide or camouflaged Belfast goods. Owing to this difficulty, some committees have, on their own initiative, boycotted the whole six counties, and have been urging us to do the same. We also hear that in north-west Connaught, due partly to the arrest of the two organisers sent in succession, there is some leakage of Belfast goods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" />Nor is the boycott of the Banks as complete as it should be. We are, however, hoping for an improvement in that district shortly, as we have sent out a third organiser who hopes to have committees functioning in most of the towns of Galway and Mayo before the end of the Truce.</P>
    <P>
      <i>British Boycott.</i> The Labour Department has also been doing the executive work in connection with the British boycott. Generally speaking, shopkeepers and consumers are aiding loyally by the Prohibitions issued from time to time by Dáil Eireann. The piecemeal nature of the boycott, however, militates to some extent against successful drastic action. However, with the development of the boycott a more effective execution of the boycott may soon be expected. The Belfast boycott organisation is also working the British boycott.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Boycott Finances.</i> The actual cost of running the Belfast and British boycotts between the 1st February and 31st July, 1921, amounted to £5,450. The fines recovered (and paid into the Financial Department) during that period amounted to £400.</P>
    <P>A pamphlet of 12,000 words giving the history of the 1920 and 1921 Belfast Pogroms has been prepared and will be submitted to the Publicity Department for publication.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Decree.</i> It is hereby decreed that the Minister responsible for the carrying out of the Belfast and British Boycotts is empowered to inflict fines on firms and individuals who break, evade, or seek to evade these boycotts. There shall be no appeal to any other Department against the payment of these fines.</P>

      <P>It was necessary to review the circumstances of the last three or four years when presenting the Report on Local Government before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>As the President explained yesterday, the General Election of the First Dáil in 1918 disclosed a preponderating majority for Republicanism throughout the entire country, and some inspiration appeared to have come to the British Cabinet and the British House of Commons to protect minorities in this country, and there was then introduced the Proportional Representation Act which, it was thought, would seriously affect the Republican representation in this country.</P>
      <P>The elections were delayed for some time, hoping that the Peace Conference might seriously interfere with the strong Republican feeling throughout the country, and when the first elections took place for the townships the result was that 10 cities returned majorities of Republicans, one city had a mixed Republican and Nationalist majority, and only one city in Ireland was pro-English. There were 62 townships with Republican majorities, 25 with mixed Republican and Nationalist majorities, and 24 for the pro-English party.  Immediately after the elections, these Republican Councils declared their allegiance to Dáil Eireann, agreeing to accept the direction and control of the Dáil in connection with Local Government administration.</P>
      <P>Some time after these elections, when the military activity of the Republic became pronounced, the English Government passed an Act which entitled members of the Crown forces who were injured in public to claim compensation for the loss of life or limb or private property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> This violated every fundamental principle of Local Government, and placed liabilities on local authorities for which no money had been levied, and put the English Government in a position to seize public money for Crown forces.</P>
    <P>As another sample of English propaganda in the country, a Housing Act was put into operation, and in that connection the Government had got considerable assistance from the representatives in the north-east of Ireland.  These great economists and financiers staked their reputation upon the success of the scheme.  But it was rather significant that, after a period of over two years, not one dozen cottages had been erected in any part of Ireland on the strength of that Act.  The passing of the Act was to show the Irish people in particular that the authors of it could do more for the Irish people than the Irish people could do for themselves.</P>
    <P>In the subsequent elections that took place for county, urban, and rural councils, out of 206 rural councils only 19 declared for England, and of 163 boards of Guardians 137 declared allegiance to the Republic.</P>
    <P>Shortly after these elections, at the Dáil Session of June last year, the Dáil appointed a Local Government Commission to inquire into the relations which should exist in future between local authorities and the Dáil, and during the time the Commission was sitting a further Act of the English Parliament declared inquests illegal, and declared forfeited to the Crown all monies raised by taxation by the English Government in Ireland, making these monies payable at the direction of the English Governor-General in Ireland.  The Dáil Commission's recommendations were adopted in the September Session of the Dáil, and since the 1st October, with the exception of some of the local authorities in four counties in Ireland, practically every local authority in the country had acknowledged the Dáil.  The Local Government Department has had a staff of Medical, Engineering, and Accountancy officials operating throughout the whole of the country supervising, and, in some respects, reorganising the work of local authorities, and generally achieving remarkable results in the machinery of Local Government throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Dáil will be asked in Private Session to undertake to restore to the local authorities whatever sum has been withheld during the last two years by reason of the action of the British Government when in the ordinary course of events the Irish Treasury will be free to disburse its monies in accordance with the directions of the Dáil.  Some of the difficulties which had confronted the local authorities were due to British military activity throughout the country; and some of the ablest and most energetic local representatives had lost their lives or their health or their freedom in carrying out the duties of their offices.  The first casualty was that of the late Lord Mayor of Cork, Alderman McCurtin.  Immediately previous to the elections they had lost to Dublin City one of the best-known and widely-respected and most vigorous public representative in Ireland, Alderman Tom Kelly, who, while he was in prison, was Lord Mayor-elect for the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>During the Local Government Commission, one of those who gave considerable time and attention to the affairs of that Commission was the late Lord Mayor MacSwiney of Cork. Amongst other irreparable remarkable losses which had been sustained by the Local Government Department were the Mayor of Limerick and the ex-Mayor of Limerick, Alderman O'Callaghan.  The latest loss they had to deplore was the case of Seán Wall of County Limerick. He thought that no public representatives in any part of the world ever gave their time so willingly and so unselfishly to the service of the public.  Amongst the difficulties which they had had to face were raids on their offices and public buildings, and arrests of their doctors and nurses and all classes of officials, while in one county the enemy went so far that, having arrested the Chairman of the County Council and the Secretary, they issued a proclamation making it an offence for ratepayers to pay their rates to the collector, and two ratepayers were actually fined for doing so.</P>
    <P>The constructive side had been confined almost exclusively to the abolition of the workhouse, as it was known in Ireland.  Workhouses were institutions which our friends and neighbours had <Col N="35" /> endowed us with, and at the time they were established in this country not one single public representative in north, south, east or west was courageous enough to accept them on behalf of the nation.  Smith O'Brien and O'Connell spoke against them.  O'Connell said the problem in Ireland was unemployment, and that the people of Ireland were willing to work for twopence a day. These institutions had bred a peculiar race, peculiar to themselves&mdash;people who had got no civic pride or sense of civic responsibility.  Through the public boards and public representatives a great and real attempt was now being made to wipe out of existence the workhouse as it was known, and to provide district hospitals and county homes for the aged and infirm who could not be boarded out.</P>
    <P>English financial houses had, he said, refused to lend money to public bodies in Ireland.  In the Irish capital three great public capital expenditure works were at present going on financed by Irish banking houses.  That money was raised at a time when it was thought the credit of Republicanism, and the existence of the Republic were not likely to last very long.  The Dáil would be asked to sanction the extension of the subscription which the County Councils and Boroughs contributed towards the General Council of County Councils.</P>

    <P>The improvement in the affairs of this Department recorded in our Report to An Dáil in May has been maintained since that Session.  The &ldquo;Warning&rdquo; to holders of Decrees for &ldquo;Criminal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Malicious&rdquo; Injuries, and to Solicitors acting for them, that public rates cannot be held liable for war damages, and that the Government will resist and punish any attempt to secure payment in this way, has had excellent results, and in making it possible for public bodies to resume normal relations with their Bank Treasurers has solved the difficulties that many Councils were experiencing with their rate-collectors. The destruction of the Custom House has finally eliminated the British Local Government Board as a serious factor in the situation.  The enemy Government, realising the impossibility of ever regaining control of the Local Government machine, is now more direct in its attempts to smash it.  Orders have been sent out for the arrest of all rate-collectors whose appointment has not been notified to the English Local Govern-Board and sanctioned by that body. The ratepayers are warned that such persons are not in a position to give a &ldquo;valid&rdquo; receipt, and that if they pay to them they leave themselves open to be called upon to pay again to a &ldquo;a duly authorised&rdquo; collector. These efforts at obstruction are not attended with much success.  At the moment, the position is worst in Leitrim, Monaghan, and Meath.  In Leitrim, the Northern Bank was Treasurer to the Co. Council; it has been dismissed in accordance with the boycott; the other Banks have refused to accept the Treasurership, and the rate-collectors refuse to lodge to &ldquo;unauthorised persons.&rdquo;  There is a large amount of last year's rate outstanding, but it is believed that most of this is in the hands of the collectors.  Steps are being taken to meet this crux.  In Monaghan there is about £10,000 outstanding of last year's rate due to the arrest of the rate-collector of one area and a refusal by the rate-payers (Unionist) to pay to a collector unsanctioned by the British Department.  In Meath there is little explanation of the bad state of affairs beyond the deplorable indolence of the members of the Co. Council.  For a long time they pleaded hostility and obstruction by the Secretary, but since his dismissal the Council has not shown much inclination to rise to its responsibilities.  A new Secretary <Col N="36" /> has been appointed, and one of the best of the Department's Inspectors has been put on this County&mdash;their united efforts may effect an improvement.  One of the worst results of the almost complete disappearance of the Sinn Féin Organisation is that there is no local authority or organisation to control the action or censure the inaction of those who were put forward as public representatives on Board and Councils.  The Department naturally does all in its power to stimulate these people, but, as can be understood, the pressure of local public opinion would be the most effective spur, and the absence of a political and local as distinct from a Governmental and central authority is a weakness in many counties.  The Department thought it wise to increase the number of Inspectors from 14 to 20.  In large counties like Cork, Limerick, Clare, Galway, and Mayo, there is quite sufficient work to keep an energetic man busy, and in certain other counties where difficulties are most acute it is found that mere occasional visits from our Inspectors are not productive of the best results.</P>
    <P>The question of audit of the accounts of public bodies is an urgent one and must be undertaken at the earliest moment that conditions permit. It is a fairly good sign that the public bodies themselves and their officials are eager that the Department should undertake this work, and in some places in response to urgent requests, accounts have been satisfactorily audited.  An extension of this work is a natural and necessary development of the Department's activities and has been considered in the preparation of the estimates for the next half-year.</P>

    <P>I need not read my Report, as it is already in the hands of the Deputies and deals with many matters of detail.  I have already said the first work to which attention was given by this Department was the appointment of Consuls to further Irish Trade abroad.  We first appointed Diarmuid Fawsitt, who had done excellent work as Secretary to Cork Industrial Association, work for which he was very well known.  We have also appointed Consuls in Paris, Genoa, Antwerp, and Rotterdam.  The number of Consulates established is small, but that is due to the fact that the maintenance of Consular establishments is a very costly item and to the fact that the results of Consular work come slowly. These results are built up of a thousand items each of small significance in itself, but of great importance in the aggregate.  The value of the work done by the Consuls is becoming greater day by day, and the Dáil will extend the number of Consuls when the time is opportune and when resources are available. The Consuls have given great service in putting Irish and various foreign firms in touch with one another.  I may say that firms which would be called Unionist have not been a bit shy in coming along and asking for the help of the Consuls to get in touch with markets for goods they had to sell.</P>
    <P>More than two years ago our attention was directed to the Dressed Meat Trade. We anticipated that the Drogheda project would fail, and we were of opinion that such a trade would be of great importance to this country in keeping money and employment in the country. I estimate that if the cattle which are exported fat now to England were slaughtered at home, work would be provided for 8,000 additional people without taking any account whatever of the many subsidary industries which would spring up.</P>
    <P>We were of opinion that that industry could best be developed by the formation of Co-operative Societies of farmers. We set to work, and Mr. Barton gave a great deal of attention to the matter. We succeeded in starting a project in Waterford for which a sum unprecedented in the history of the Co-operative movement was collected&mdash;a sum of almost £200,000.  The initiation of that Society was entirely due to the work we did, though of course at later stages our hand was not apparent in connection with it.  Owing to the sabotage and outrages of the enemy forces, no actual building work was undertaken, but it certainly will be started shortly; and I have no doubt that through this factory a very remarkable change will be brought about in the trade and agriculture of the country, because there is no more wasteful form of trade than the exportation of fat cattle as carried on here at present.</P>
    <P>The Boycott of English goods was considered as long ago as May, 1919, but the time was not considered ripe for that until spring of the present year.  In March last a Decree was passed authorising the Ministry to issue from time to time Orders prohibiting the importation of British goods which Irish firms could produce or for which we could get substitutes either in Ireland or in foreign countries.</P>
    <P>We have since that time issued 5 Orders which dealt with only 12 classes of goods, but I am sure you are all aware of the effect this small number of Orders dealing with such a small range of goods has already had.  Manufacturers whose goods were dealt with in those Orders were able to increase their output two or threefold, and other manufacturers whose goods were not so far dealt with also benefited.  I have spoken to manufacturers who said that immediately that the Orders were published pro-British wholesale firms whose only desire was to buy from England became afraid to buy from anyone except from Irish manufacturers.  As regards cigarettes, the manufacturers have been snowed under.  I have had to look into the question of what goods should be prohibited and in what order, and as a <Col N="38" /> consequence I have been enabled to see that by pursuing this policy of exclusion of English goods we could, within a couple of years, work a transformation that would surprise most of ourselves.  Already manufacturers in all parts of the country are extending their premises and putting in new machinery.  I certainly think, if the war is resumed, we will be able to strike a vital blow at the enemy with this policy.</P>
    <P>The work which our Consuls had undertaken at the beginning was difficult, because there were no means here of discriminating between British and other goods.  Since the issue of these Orders began and their effect became so marked, people on the Continent and in America who could not be interested in the Irish market before, immediately woke up to the importance of the new situation and of the new spirit in the country.  The other day I saw a letter from a big American Packing House, which had refused to establish a depot in Ireland some time ago, saying Ireland could be supplied well enough from their English house.  They now wrote and said they were reconsidering the matter.</P>
    <P>There is another activity which I should like to deal with; that is, the work of the Commission of Inquiry which has been going on for the past couple of years.  That Commission has done work which is of national importance, and many well-known citizens and leading business men have given a great deal of time and work to the Inquiry, but owing to the fact that it was an omnibus Commission and set out to investigate a number of different subjects simultaneously, we were a considerable time without a Report from it. However, the Reports are coming now all in a bunch.  Some time ago we had an Interim Report on Milk Production in Irish and in English; after that a Stock-Breeding Farm Report, a Coal Memoir and a volume of evidence were published. The Industrial Alcohol Report and a second volume of evidence will be out in a few days.  Four other Reports are promised for certain before the 31st October.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to the members of the Commission for the extremely arduous work done on this Commission.</P>

    <Title>TRADE DEPARTMENT.</Title>
    <P>When the Ministry was formed at the first full Session of the old Dáil, the appointments included a Minister of Industries, a position which was filled by Mr. MacNeill.  At a subsequent Session, when a discussion took place on the fact that Trade and Industrial matters were so closely inter-related that it seemed to be a case of having two Ministers for one Department, Mr. MacNeill stated that it was his intention to leave all Industrial matters to the Department of Trade, and that he had agreed to join the Ministry for political reasons.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Consuls.</i>&mdash;Before the virtual amalgamation of the two original offices, I regarded my function as being principally concerned with the promotion of direct trade with countries other than Great Britain.  At the Session of Dáil Éireann held in June, 1919, a Decree was passed authorising the expenditure of £10,000 on Consular Services during the ensuing twelve months.  A Consul had actually been appointed some time before in the person of Mr. Eamon Bulfin who was deported by the enemy to the Argentine.  On his arrival in Buenos Aires, however, Mr. Bulfin soon found himself under arrest on a charge of having evaded military service and was prevented from taking up Consular duties.</P>
    <P>The first Consul to act for us, therefore, was stationed in New York.  From the beginning it had been felt that a very good man was required for the New York Consulate, where incompetence, absolute or comparative, would not merely have failed to achieve results, but would have seriously injured the prestige <Col N="39" /> of the Republic.  It was decided that this important post should be entrusted to Mr. J.L. Fawsitt, whose record as Secretary of the Cork Industrial Development Association left no doubt as to his ability and zeal.  Mr. Fawsitt was not able to leave for America till about the middle of September. As a matter of fact nothing was lost by the delay since up to about that period the majority of the war and postwar trade restrictions imposed by the British Government were in force.  Very large numbers of commodities could only be imported under licence or in limited quantities.  About September, 1919, most of the restrictions which held up the import into Ireland of goods like, say, American boots, were dropped.  On the other hand, a great many restrictions on exports were continued for another twelve months, with the result that at a time when a very remunerative market for Irish butter, for example, could have been found on the Continent, British regulations prevented advantage being taken of it.</P>
    <P>The New York Consulate was opened just at the precise moment when the need for it became clear, when the last restrictions on the import of American goods into Ireland were abandoned, when the Moore-McCormack service was inaugurated, and when the President in the course of his campaign began to feel the need for the presence of an official having wide knowledge of Irish industrial conditions.  Mr. Fawsitt when asked to go to America agreed to do so for a period of six months.  He afterwards consented to stay a year, and last autumn at the request of the Ministry he acquiesced in a further prolongation of his term of office.  His resignation has now been accepted from the 18th inst. after practically two years' service.  During the period that has elapsed since its establishment, the New York Consulate has been a most active centre of commercial and industrial propaganda.  Every possible step has been taken to put Irish and American buyers and sellers in touch with each other, to impress upon American firms the business importance of the new spirit in Ireland and the necessity of direct representation in this country, to lay before the Shipping Board and Shipowners all the arguments in favour of a continued and improved direct service between Ireland and America.</P>
    <P>Without enumerating a multitude of details, each perhaps of small consequence in itself, it is difficult to give an a lequate idea of the efforts made by the Consulate.  A random selection from the matters dealt with may give some idea of the variety of its work:&mdash;Allegations by Irish Seamen that they had been refused work by officers on Moore-McCormack vessels because of their nationality were taken up and brought directly to the notice of the principals; powers of attorney for production in Republican Courts validated by the Consul; the practice of listing for statistical purposes as &ldquo;British&rdquo; imports of lace, etc., coming from Ireland by parcels post was challenged, and an undertaking secured from the Secretary of the United States Treasury that all such imports would in future be listed as &ldquo;Irish&rdquo;; cured fish from Ireland alleged to have arrived in America in a damaged condition was inspected by the Consul, found to be all right, and the importer obliged to pay in full; the Irish Industrial Development Association (Incorporated) was informed by the Consulate of the attempt on the part of a certain group of Irishmen to register the Irish National Trade Mark in America for their own fraudulent purposes, and were able to prevent such registration; members of the Ways and Means Committee, Washington, approached as far back as 15th February last with arguments against proposed import duty on cured mackerel and herrings; United States Shipping Board and United States Mail Steamship Company induced to agree that the vessels of the latter should call at Cobh both ways; legal assistance offered to Jim Larkin at his trial; information in regard to the Belfast pogroms and to the Belfast boycott supplied to all papers in the States. Scores of matters similar to these, together with the everyday business of supplying information to Irish and American firms have thrown an increasing volume of work upon the Consulate, with the result that it has now a staff of nine persons.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the American Consulate was opened, Count Gerald O'Kelly was sent to Switzerland with a view to doing trade work, and at the same time conducting a political propaganda.  He <Col N="40" /> found, however, from the Swiss Police authorities, that any political propaganda would result in his finding himself across the frontier.  For some time he continued to do such trade work as was possible, but this was not considered sufficient in itself to justify his retention in Switzerland.  He was accordingly directed at the beginning of the present year to transfer to Antwerp, where he has since been occupied with trade matters solely.</P>
    <P>In August 1919, Mr. Domhnall Hales, who resided in Genoa, was appointed a part-time Consul.  In view of the lack of direct communications and to the fact that Italy, like Ireland, is not highly industrialised, he has had to work on somewhat barren soil so far as trade is concerned.  Nevertheless, the interest which he has succeeded in arousing in many Italian business men in regard to the possibilities of trade with Ireland will eventually bear fruit.  In the sphere of political propaganda the work done by Mr. Hales has been simply stupendous. It seems as if every paper in Italy made a feature of regular articles from his pen.</P>
    <P>At the same time as Mr. Hales was appointed at Genoa, Mr. L.H. Kerney was appointed a part-time officer in Paris.  In May, 1920, however, on the representation of the National Envoy in France, Mr. Kerney was made a fulltime Consul, and during the past year the work and usefulness of the Paris Consulate has continued to increase.</P>
    <P>About three months ago, a Consul was appointed to Rotterdam, but owing to the difficulty of getting a passport he has not yet been able to take up duty &mdash;surreptitious entry into Holland would probably only lead to trouble with the Dutch police.</P>
    <P>We have now three Consulates on the Continent and a fourth about to be opened.  This may seem a small number, but in view of the costliness of a Consular Service and of the fact that results can be secured only very slowly and gradually.  I do not think that for a Government situated as we are a rapid expansion would be justified.  A Consul must be rather highly paid if he is to live as befits his office, yet with the greatest efforts on his part there may for a long time be little or nothing to show for the expenditure incurred and the labour done.  Our Consuls, who would perhaps be better styled &ldquo;Trade Commissioners&rdquo; since, owing to the non-recognition of the Republic, they have not the status or rights of regular Consuls, cannot themselves take steps to promote trade.  They are, as it were, national publicity agents.  It is not sufficient for them to see commercial opportunities; they must show the opportunities to two sets of business men and persuade them to act.  And business men are not free from conservatism.  In addition there are many real difficulties to be overcome when it is a question of directing trade into new channels.  The consequence is, that while the well-directed zeal of a Consul, like a skilfully drawn and frequently shown advertisement, is sure ultimately to bring results, such results, in the main, will only come slowly.  In a struggle like ours, therefore, in which immediate results are so important, the wholesale establishment of Consulates would not represent a judicious expenditure.  Pending the recognition of the Republic, I would not recommend the opening of more than, say, a couple of additional Consulates, including one in Germany.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dressed Meat Trade.</i>&mdash;In May, 1919, the attention of this Department was directed to the immense importance to the country of developing an extensive Dressed Meat Export Trade, and to the danger involved in the establishment of a factory such as that at Drogheda, which it was generally believed at the time was meant to fail in the first instance and to fall eventually into the hands of the American Meat Trust.  In a leaflet prepared and circulated by this Department in July, 1919, it was pointed out that the substitution of a dressed meat trade for the present fat cattle trade would provide employment for no less than 8,000 people in merely killing the beasts and dealing with the bye-products in the simplest way.  In addition, fattening, and consequently tillage, would be encouraged and the present serious losses to farmers occasioned by the deterioration of beasts in transit would be avoided. Moreover, centralised slaughter on a large scale would certainly lead to the establishment of numerous subsidiary industries and ultimately a great tanning industry.</P>
    <P>We were strongly of opinion that the industry could be both successful and nationally safe only if run by co-operative <Col N="41" /> societies of farmers.  After many conferences with the I.A.O.S., Farmers' Union, and considerable propaganda, a meeting of the representatives of the Co-operative Creameries, etc., and Farmers' Union was, during my absence in jail, called by Mr. Barton to be held in Waterford on November 13th, 1919.  The meeting enthusiastically took up the project and appointed an organising committee. For a year afterwards a member of the staff of the Trade Department was almost wholly occupied in assisting the committee.  By November, 1920, thousands of farmers and others in the counties of Waterford, Cork, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Carlow, Queen's County, etc., had become members of the society, and almost £200,000 share capital had been subscribed.  The society secured an ideal site in Waterford on the river front, with excellent rail facilities.  Plans for the factory were prepared, and the society was practically ready to place contracts for building and the installation of plant when the British campaign of sabotage and incendiarism became widespread. The directors decided, and in view of the fate of so many creameries I think wisely decided, to postpone any attempt to commence operations until more peaceful conditions should prevail.  The programme of the society includes the provision of very extensive cold storage accommodation for butter, cheese, etc., and it is in view of this fact that about forty creameries have invested from £1,000 to £250 in shares in the society. I believe that the completion of these cold stores will at once lead to a new organisation of the butter trade in a large part of the south under which the sale and export of butter will be done, not by individual creameries, but by a federation able to grade and brand it with a brand which will give the same guarantee as that of the Danes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industries.</i>&mdash;At the time when this Department was established, the postwar industrial boom was in full swing and prices were rising rapidly.  In the circumstances, I felt it would not be proper to carry on any propaganda in favour of preferential purchasing of Irish-made goods, since, in most lines, manufacturers had more orders than they could deal with, and propaganda, in so far as it might have been effective, would only have been an incitement to profiteering. There was at that juncture a great deal of enthusiasm in favour of the establishment of new industries, frequently on a co-operative basis.  Many of the projects came under my notice through the promoters coming forward with proposals that the Dáil should lend or give them sums ranging downwards from £3,000,000, which was asked for by one gentleman who previously held a fairly important position in a Belfast shipyard, and who submitted elaborate plans for the development of a great dockyard in the neighbourhood of Alexandra Basin. As the Cabinet had decided that no loans for industrial or commercial purposes could be granted, we had only to turn away the horde of applicants, most of whom had no use for advice or other assistance.</P>
    <P>There were many schemes, however, in which we were able to procure useful information for the promoters.  Quite a number of projects for the establishment of, say, woollen weaving and spinning factories were abandoned because there appeared to be no chance of getting machinery within any reasonable time. Many schemes were submitted to the Trade Department which we felt bound to discourage.  These included, for instance, certain mining projects, and such things as the proposed sugar factory at Arklow.  In the latter case the Department went very carefully into the matter and procured for the local Committee the services of a French expert, who visited the district, examined the soil, inspected the site and buildings, i.e., Kynoch's Explosive Factory, and reported decisively against the project. His opinion was that with sufficient Capital to surmount the initial difficulties there was no reason why a sugar industry should not be established in Ireland, but that Arklow was about the most unfavourable location that could be chosen.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exclusion of British Goods:</i>&mdash;The policy of excluding specified classes of British goods, alternative supplies being available, was suggested as far back as June, 1919, in the first Report presented to Dáil Éireann from the Trade Department. So long, however, as the various controls and trade restrictions were in force, and so long as prices were rising and there was at least an apparent scarcity of supplies, it remained impossible <Col N="42" /> to contemplate putting such a policy into execution.  Futhermore, it is true that trade follows the flag.  Until the army of the Republic was able to destroy the governmental machinery of the enemy in large parts of the country and give his military forces as much military work as they could handle, it was obviously too soon for us to do much in the way of issuing Trade Decrees.  By the summer of last year, the military situation justified legislation for the protection of Irish industries and discouragement of British trade here.  Trade conditions, however, were not such as would have permitted the inauguration of a boycott policy.  I prepared, therefore, an alternative scheme which provided for the scheduling of such Irish goods as were produced in sufficient quantities, and were sold at prices which an expert advisory committee would certify as being not more than 5 per cent. higher than similar quality foreign goods. It would have been obligatory on every shopkeeper under pain of fines, etc., to stock all the scheduled classes of goods appertaining to his own particular trade, and in certain cases in which a sufficient variety was produced in Ireland to stock scheduled goods only.  The draft Decree embodying this scheme was adopted in principle by Dáil Éireann at its Session in September, 1920, and referred to a Committee for amendment.  The slump, however, came on immediately, and the scheme became unworkable owing to the impossibility in a rapidly falling market of keeping up-to-date a schedule which would have guaranteed the public against being mulcted.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of 1920, the atrocities of the British forces produced a feeling in many quarters that at all costs we ought to declare a complete trade boycott against England.  After going into the matter carefully and consulting representative men in various lines of business I felt bound to report at the January meeting of the Dáil that such a proposal was for the time being impracticable. At the next Session of the Dáil held in March last, it was decided to proceed with the policy of partial and progressive exclusion of British goods, and it was agreed that the machinery already in existence for the Belfast boycott should be used for the purpose of enforcement. A Decree was passed authorising the Ministry to issue Orders prohibiting the importation of British makes of any class of goods.  A subsequent Decree was passed in May, 1920, authorising the Ministry to prohibit the importation of goods through England, irrespective of their country of origin.  No Order has been issued under the latter Decree, but under the former Decree five Orders have been issued as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>No. 1.  March 23rd, 1921.</P>
    <P>Agricultural Machinery.</P>
    <P>Binders.</P>
    <P>Mowing Machines.</P>
    <P>Horse Rakes.</P>
    <P>Swathe Turners.</P>
    <P>Hay trolleys (Rick Shifters).</P>
    <P>Harrows.</P>
    <P>Ploughs.</P>
    <P>Corn Drills.</P>
    <P>Root Cutters.</P>
    <P>No. 2.  April 14th, 1921.</P>
    <P>Biscuits.</P>
    <P>Boot Polishes.</P>
    <P>Soap.</P>
    <P>No. 3.  May 5th, 1921.</P>
    <P>Margarine.</P>
    <P>No. 4.  May 18th, 1921.</P>
    <P>Pictorial Calendars.</P>
    <P>No. 5.  June 1st, 1921.</P>
    <P>Preserves (Jams, Marmalade, etc.).</P>
    <P>Medicated Wines.</P>
    <P>Proprietary Ointments.</P>
    <P>Other Orders awaited sanction when the Truce was arranged.  The issue of the Prohibition Orders produced an immediate effect.  Manufacturers of Boot Polishes and Soaps interviewed within a month of the date on which No. 2 Order came into effect stated that their output had increased from 30 per cent. in the least case to 150 per cent. in the highest.  Within the same period after the coming into effect of No. 3 Order, margarine manufacturers had all benefited, although it was the season of the year when butter becomes cheap, and the consumption of margarine normally falls off.  Not merely were the manufacturers of goods similar to those mentioned in the orders assisted by this policy, but almost all manufacturers of articles of constant consumption.  An Irish Starch Firm found itself receiving <Col N="43" /> orders from wholesalers who never took its product before.  A Cutlery Firm, from being quite slack, found itself with orders to keep it going for twelve months.  Cigarette makers, outside Belfast, were overwhelmed with orders, and have now in Cork, Dublin, and Dundalk trebled the number of their machines.  As a result of No. 5 Order, which does not become operative until September 21st, 1921, one jam-making firm has quadrupled the number of its boilers.</P>
    <P>Although only a comparatively small range of commodities has yet been dealt with in the Prohibition Orders, sufficient has been done to show that, steadily pursued for a couple of years, a policy of progressively excluding British goods would work a complete industrial transformation. It would, moreover, make the work of the Consuls ten times easier and ten times more fruitful.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Commission of Inquiry.</i>&mdash;At the beginning of the present year the Department of Trade was made responsible by the Ministry for supervising the work of the Commission of Inquiry, and at the March Session of the Dáil that decision was re-affirmed.  At the May Session it was promised on behalf of the Ministry that the work of the Commission would be brought to a speedy close.  After various conferences with delegations from the Commission and with its Standing Committee, I recommended that the date fixed should be October 31st, by which time the following Reports, already in an advanced stage of preparation, will be completed :&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Report on Sea Fisheries.</P>
    <P>(b)  Report on Milk Products.</P>
    <P>(c)  Peat Report.</P>
    <P>(d)  Coal Report.</P>
    <P>The Commission has stated that its closing down at the end of October will probably leave the following Reports uncompleted, viz. :&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Meat Report.</P>
    <P>(b)  Report on Water Power.</P>
    <P>(c)  Report on the Supply of Milk to Urban Areas.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that the date mentioned should be adhered to, and if at the end of the intervening period it is found that any of the last mentioned Reports are within measurable distance of completion, the Ministry could consider whether special arrangements might not be made for completing them.</P>
    <P>The Commission first met in the Mansion House on September 19th, 1919, so that by the end of October it will have been more than two years at work.  Up to date it has expended, in conducting its investigations and preparing (but not printing) its Reports, a sum of about £6,000.  The Reports already published include an <i>ad interim</i> Report on Milk Production in Irish and in English, a Stock-breeding Farms Report, the Coal Memoir, a Volume of Evidence.  The Industrial Alcohol Report and a second Volume of Evidence will be out in a few days.  Four other Reports are promised for certain before 31st October.  I think that the Commission has done its work as well and as cheaply as could have been expected. The fact that it was an omnibus Commission and set out to investigate a number of different subjects simultaneously meant that a considerable time elapsed before any of its Reports was ready.  But we have now several coming out almost together.  A great deal of valuable information has been assembled and collated, and ground has been cleared for specialised commissions which may sit in future to prepare detailed schemes for immediate Governmental action.  Probably as much work in the way of general investigation has now been done as it is desirable to do at present, and in any case the members of the Commission who have, without fee or reward, given a great amount of time to its service, could not fairly be asked to continue indefinitely.  Some members have attended not less than two or three meetings of the Commission or its Committees every week since it was established, in addition to considering memoranda of evidence at home.  The zeal with which they done the work which the Ministry asked them to do should not go uncommended.</P>

    <P>Tá beirt dár n-ochtar timthiridhe fé ghlasaibh.  Gabhadh timthire Iarthair Chorcaighe fá thrí sul ar cuireadh i mbuan-ghéibheann é san Earrach.

Is beag nár mhairbh lucht an airm Ghallda an timthire seo is iad ag <Col N="45" /> á ghabháil.

I ndeireadh na scríbe chaitheadar isteach i loch é, agus choimeádadar ann é go dtí go raibh sé beagnách báidhte.

    <P>There is little to add now to the detailed Report recently submitted to the President.</P>
    <P>As explained in our Third Report, this Department has been concerned very largely with the promotion in the schools of the Dáil's Scheme of Education since the scheme was approved. We have taken counsel with most of the Bishops in the Irish-speaking areas where the hierarchy wield most influence in educational matters, and, with two exceptions, they have promised their active co-operation in the revival of Irish.  As evidence of this, it has been made the rule in at least three dioceses &mdash;those of Tuam, Kerry, and Waterford&mdash;to appoint no teachers henceforward who have not satisfactory certificates for the teaching of Irish.  The determination to abide by this rule was made abundantly clear in Kerry recently.  At any rate, our scheme is already in operation in many of the schools, and there is a marked improvement in the attitude of others, judging by our Organisers' reports.  The children, too, have taken the liveliest interest in the competitions for the silver medals.  What militates most against efficient teaching in the rural schools is the unsatisfactory attendance of the pupils; organisers and teachers complain of the irregular attendance, and the Dáil must find a remedy for it.</P>
    <P>It will be a matter for the Dáil also to convince the people of the Irish-speaking areas that henceforward those who know Irish will have equal opportunities to obtain appointments with those who know English.  Until this is established, English will have an enhanced value and Irish will be relatively neglected.  Those in the Irish-speaking areas have long felt that poverty and destitution follow the use of Irish.  This feeling must be dispelled, and no better means of dispelling it could be adopted than the giving preference to speakers of Irish when appointments are being made, provided they are suitable in other respects. From the Dáil itself the initiative of good example in this respect would most naturally come; though it is realised that others besides Irish speakers have been giving their lives and their substance for Irish liberty, and they, of course are entitled to due recognition. Much advantage can be conferred on Irish through every Department of the Dáil, through the new Courts, and through every other institution under the auspices of the national Parliament. Moreover, the Church alone could restore and perpetuate the national language if only it so willed.</P>
    <P>How the public boards can advance the interests of our native speech has been explained through the Department of Local Government, and some of the fruits are already visible.  Public Boards have been urged to choose Irish speakers as Chairmen of the various Councils in the Irish-speaking areas and elsewhere, as far as feasible, and to have persons with a working-knowledge of Irish on their staffs so that the public might transact their business through the medium of the vernacular.  This advice is being followed extensively. They have also been counselled to have cheques, addresses, titles, and the like written and printed in Irish, minutes and accounts kept, and correspondence conducted in Irish, advertisements and announcements published in Irish, and preference given to newspapers in sympathy with Irish and accustomed to report Irish speakers at the Public Boards.  And, in spite of the disturbed state of recent times, the use of Irish in all these spheres is extending visibly.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the third Report submitted by us, this is the present position of our Department.  Two of our eight Organisers are in prison.  The Organiser for West Cork was thrice arrested before his final incarceration in the spring.  The Organiser for Kerry was later arrested and has not been since released.  Still later, the Organiser for Mayo was seized and imprisoned, but released after three months.  This Organiser had a narrow escape with his life from the Army of Occupation.  On the occasion of his arrest they compelled him to come on his kness and repeat fulsome praise of King George; they pressed fire-arms against his head and lips, and murderously assaulted him. They stuffed his mouth and throat with <Col N="48" /> bog almost to the point of suffocation, and finally threw him into a lake where they left him till he was all but drowned.  Thence they bore him off to a prison cell where they left him lying, wet and cold, and exhausted from thirst and hunger.  A serious attack of illness resulted, and before he had quite recovered he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for an alleged seditious speech before the Mayo County Council.  All Irish speakers are treated similarly, as seized, by the Army of Occupation.  I had details of numberless such cases of cruelty, as of arrests, burnings, destruction of Irish name plates, and similar acts of aggression, but the account disappeared at the time of my arrest and has not since been restored to me.</P>
    <P>The parish, district, and County Committees established at the outset have not been able to meet for some time, except in a few places in the Deise, and the inter-family competitions which we had arranged will have to be abandoned this year owing to the impracticability of holding Feiseanna. But the school competitions for the silver medals have been very successful; and managers and teachers have co-operated heartily in the turning competitions to the utmost advantage. The silver cup competitions in the intermediate schools, now completed, did not attract so many entries as we anticipated.  But our Inspectors visited them all, as far as feasible; and in spite of serious obstacles in the way of the examinations, we have reports of the state of the language in most of them. Very many Intermediate teachers have been imprisoned, with effects which will be obvious.</P>
    <P>In deference to widespread complaints concerning the certificates given in the Colleges of Irish, we summoned a conference of the representatives of the leading Colleges on Whit Monday, and, following a full and frank discussion of the matter, a decision was reached which, in the general opinion, will prove an adequate remedy.  This Conference will re-assemble as may be deemed desirable.</P>
    <P>As has been repeatedly pointed out, a lack of suitable texts is felt in connection with every grade of education. In this connection it may be said that practically every available writer of Irish is now at work to remedy this want.  The results of their labours are reaching us speedily, and the matter has now assumed a distinctly favourable aspect.</P>
    <P>Last year we recommended to the Dáil the establishment of a number of scholarships, value £50 each, for the benefit of native Irish-speaking boys anxious to attend a course of training to qualify them as teachers or organisers in the primary schools.  To our surprise there were no candidates from Tir Chonnail or the Deise; a County Galway student, we regret, died in the course of the year; and a County Cork student, for reasons incidental to the national struggle, was obliged to abandon his training and return home.  But we are satisfied that the scheme is worthy of development; and we have accordingly offered fifty scholarships, value £30 each, this year:</P>
    <P>24 for boys from the Irish-speaking area.</P>
    <P>16 for girls from the Irish-speaking area.</P>
    <P>6 for boys from the Anglicised area.</P>
    <P>4 for girls from the Anglicised area.</P>
    <P>These fifty scholarships represent an outlay of £1,500.  The entrance examinations are in progress to-day.  The successful students will go first to a Preparatory School and later to a Training College.  Had the times been less disturbed, we contemplated the establishment of a Preparatory School under the auspices of the Dáil; but as things stand, it is thought better to defer the project.  We also promised a subsidy equal to last year's to the school of organising conducted by the Gaelic League; but the state of the times obliged the League to abandon its school this season.</P>
    <P>All questions concerning education in general submitted to the Dáil were referred to this Department, and more than one County Council has asked us to prepare a scheme of National Education, in all its grades, for the whole country.  This is a big undertaking in face of the transition now in progress, but we are not neglecting it.  In the past six months, an experienced Committee has been investigating the state of Primary Education, and has now issued what promises to be a satisfactory scheme for the primary schools.  The <Col N="49" /> Dáil will be well advised in bearing constantly in mind that the alien estimate for Primary Education in Ireland this year exceeds £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>We also summoned a conference in the beginning of August to discuss the position of Intermediate Education and lay down a suitable programme.  This conference made appropriate recommendations to ensure the status of Irish in the Secondary School Programme for 1921&mdash;2, and appointed a Commission to enquire into the defects of the existing secondary system and suggest a suitable programme as in the case of primary Education.</P>
    <P>We are altogether dissatisfied with the status of Irish in the National University, and not without good reason. The proposals we made in this connection last year have been almost entirely disregarded, more particularly in Dublin.  The governing bodies of the Cork and Galway Colleges have, however, promised to arrange for evening lectures in Irish.  The remedy lies with the Senate; unless applied, the Senate itself must receive attention.  The head of the State will soon be personally at the head of the National University. By that time, the existing primary and secondary systems will have been dealt with by the Committees referred to, and the occasion may be favourable for a similar Commission on University Education.</P>
    <P>The County Councils are in a position to utilise their Scholarships for the Gaelicising and nationalising of the University.  We have not urged these Councils to apply any of their funds to Education in the circumstances which have recently confronted them, and the corresponding difficulty of providing money for other essential services.  For the same reason our demands on the Dáil last year were as moderate as possible, and even the money voted us has not been all expended.  It is a great advantage and a great financial saving that the Gaelic League is co-operating actively in the work which is our main concern.  As in our own case, the League has suffered grievously through the attentions of the Army of Occupation. But the people's interest in the language has not lessened on that account: quite the contrary.  Since the establishment of the Ministry of Irish I have addressed great hostings in Omeath, Dundalk, Ardee, Drogheda, Cavan, Wicklow, Newbridge, Maryborough, New Ross, Cork, Tralee, Roscommon and elsewhere, and I am glad to be able to report that the language is advancing everywhere. When we are again free to urge and advise our people to do their duty by their mother tongue, prompt and satisfactory results may be safely anticipated.</P>

      <P>submitted the following Report:</P>
      <P>A Full Report of the working of the Fisheries Department prepared for presentation before the first Session of the Second Parliament of the Republic, fell into enemy hands.  Some records used in its compilation were destroyed to avoid a like fate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, a Fisheries Committee was formed in the early summer of 1919, mainly composed of Deputies from the maritime counties.  Its functions were confined to discussions concerning transit and markets.  The need of a fixed policy was apparent.  In August same year an enquiry on a small scale was held at Howth.  Thereat were gathered local and migratory fishermen, and local and migratory fish buyers.  The view expressed by all was that the fishing industry was threatened with a period of distress which would seriously affect the people of Ireland.  The Irish Seas alone of the Northern European waters had been constantly fished during war time.  The North Sea and English Channel and other waters were practically untouched.  In the latter area there was not alone the numbers <Col N="50" /> of fish uncaught but also the natural increase, with the result that billions of fish had accumulated in the unfished waters of the war area.  The prices obtained by Irish fishermen during the years of conflict could not be maintained when the English, Scotch, Dutch, Belgian, French, German and other fishermen resumed operations on seas filled with fish.</P>
    <P>The transit from Ireland to the &ldquo;Freshing&rdquo; markets in England was of the poorest description.  There were no fish trains as in other countries, and boxes of fish sent to Dublin or foreign markets received little care or attention.</P>
    <P>The condition in which Irish fish reached the foreign markets caused buyers to place it in the lowest grade. Delay in transit had much to do with this, but the manner in which the fish was packed was, and is, the main cause. The fish was sent forward by a number of buyers, and there was no attempt made to ensure a standard quality.</P>
    <P>Irish pickled mackerel has been placed in a very low grade on the New York market as a result of this haphazard system.  It became plainly apparent to all the members of the Fisheries Committee who actively participated in the work that&mdash;setting aside the great need of modern boats and gear, of proper fishing piers and landing stages&mdash;the urgent need presenting itself was the thorough organisation of the fishermen all around the coast; and the policy of organisation to achieve the greatest success would be the formation of Co-Operative Fishing Societies, with the ultimate aim of establishing an All Ireland Federation of the Fishing Societies, and thereby controlling every detail connected with the industry.</P>
    <P>In October same year, a meeting of the Fisheries Committee&mdash;summoned to consider the appointment of an Inspector of Fisheries&mdash;was raided by enemy forces and a number of the members captured.  At a subsequent meeting a number of applicants for Organiserships were interviewed, and none found with the proper qualifications for the position.  A Report was sent from this meeting suggesting the formation of a Department of Fisheries to carry out the organisation of Irish fishermen on co-operative lines.  The Ministry, to whom the report was submitted, decided to establish a Department of Fisheries, and appointed Seán Etchingham as Director.</P>
    <P>It was arranged to engage four organisers.  A difficulty presented itself in obtaining the services of men with a knowledge of the work in hand, and also competent in the Irish language. The four engaged were Muiris O Cathain, Dingle, Micheál O Murchadha, Dublin, Seamas Mac Fuinis, Dublin, and R.F. King, Enniscorthy.  The latter operated from Fair Head to Wexford Harbour; O Sullivan from Wexford Harbour to Mizen Head; O Cathain from Mizen Head to Erris Head, and Mac Fuinis from Erris Head to Fair Head.</P>
    <P>Early in January, 1920, a visit to Arran Islands where the Rev. M. Farragher, P.P., had established a co-operative fishing society, was arranged for, and here Pat Ridge, the Manager of the Society, gave the organisers all the information in his possession.  Micheál O Murchadha resigned after a few weeks, and his place was filled by Eoghan O Sullivan, Dingle.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Committee having charge of a fund to help the people of Gorumna asked the assistance of the Department in the purchase of a motor-boat.  This was given, and, after much investigation, a motor-boat&mdash;&ldquo;The Little Flower&rdquo;&mdash;was bought, and under the direction of R.F. King safely delivered at Gorumna.  Ald. Cosgrave, Hon. Sec. Dublin Committee, lent valuable aid.</P>
    <P>The policy followed in forming societies was that they be duly registered at Plunkett House, and that the organisers of the latter institutions be made aware of the progress made. Fishing Societies were formed at Baltimore (West Carbery), Ring, Dingle (West Kerry), Gorumna, Kincasslagh, Tory, Courtown, Wicklow, while the organisers visited many other fishing centres including Fethard, Dungarvan, Dunmore, Arklow, Howth, Balbriggan, Clogher Head, Tulins Bay, Killybegs, Burtonport, Magherearty, Dunfanaghy, Downings Bay, etc.  The most important of these was the West Carbery Society, and next to it the West Kerry.  The former is considered the key of the &ldquo;freshing&rdquo; Mackerel fishing.  Added to the good sized fleet of local boats, the <Col N="51" /> port is visited by migratory fishermen from almost all the Irish fishing centres and many foreigners.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of transit and the lack of ice were main causes contributory to the unsatisfactory conditions existing. The best boats in the local fishing fleet entered the Society, and the steam hawler &ldquo;Tayside&rdquo; was purchased to be used as a carrier between the fishing port and the Welsh Coast.  This boat did not arrive in time to assist in the spring mackerel fishing of 1920, during which time the new Society was in active operation, and the ordinary rail and sea transit had to be utilized.  Losses were sustained, and bad management is attributed the cause; but it is worthy of note that almost every buyer engaged in the business in the spring mackerel fishing off Baltimore in 1920 lost money. Bad prices, loss of consignments through delay in transit, and the slump in the English markets, were the main causes.  The &ldquo;Tayside&rdquo; was subsequently used as a cargo boat trading between south of Ireland and English ports, and eventually she was lost at sea.  But the insurance was recovered. The conditions existing since that period are instrumental in preventing co-operative effort in this and other areas.</P>
    <P>The West Kerry Society, the pickled mackerel area, could not, owing to want of finance, start operations on a proper scale.  Hereat the entire Dingle peninsula with its numerous fishing centres, was organised in the Society.  Curing sheds were erected by voluntary effort, and a large building purchased at Dingle.  The question of finance engaged the attention of the Fishery Committee of the Ministry and also a sub-committee of the Industrial Commission, but the amount required&mdash; between £16,000 and £20,000&mdash;was found a barrier impossible to surmount.  The matter had to be postponed.</P>
    <P>An Dáil arranged that loans repayable within a term of years at a fixed rate of interest be given to Fishery Societies on a joint and general security of the members.</P>
    <P>State assistance will always be necessary to maintain the fishing industry on a proper basis, and, in a measure, State Control is essential.  The example of Norway in this particular is, perhaps, the best for Ireland to follow.  The organisation of the fishermen into Co-Operative Societies is the first step.  The establishment of a Federation of Fishing Societies, the second.  This Federation should manage the entire business, and should establish a national brand&mdash;a guarantee of quality and quantity. It should introduce new methods of handling and cure, and by this means raise the standard of quality and place Irish caught fish in the forefront of the world's food supplies.  Up to the present, conditions prevented the carrying out of such a programme.  Even the motor boat provided for the fishermen of Tory was destroyed by the enemy forces.</P>
    <P>Fishing conditions all over the world are now in a bad state.  The loss of the Russian pickled herring market is a blow to herring fishing off Donegal, Howth, and other centres.  The Scotch fishermen were never as hard hit as within the last six months, over 16,000 of them being idle.</P>
    <P>Ireland as a whole does not support her fishing industry.  The quantity of fish consumed by the people being the smallest in proportion to the population of any sea-washed country in the world.</P>
    <P>However, circumstances prevented a thorough extension of the organisation, and all the organisers, with the exception of R.F. King, were dispensed with.</P>
    <P>The work of the Department was then directed to the organisation of existing home markets, and an attempt to establish new markets in Irish centres.  The complaint of salesmen and buyers in the Dublin Fish Market of the manner in which &ldquo;bottoms&rdquo; or trawl fish were sent up for sale was investigated, and the conditions found to be even worse than reported.  To meet the situation, a pamphlet has been prepared giving directions in cleaning and gutting the fish, also how to grade and pack.  The organiser is paying visits to the different trawling areas, and the pamphlets are being sent to people who will interest themselves in instructing the fishermen.</P>
    <P>Owing to the increased cost of transit none but high priced fish can be sent to the Dublin market, and the necessity for establishing local markets for dealing with the cheaper, but none the less valuable food will be recognised.</P>
    <P>A circular letter to the Public Boards urging the importance of supporting the fishing industry met with cordial, and in many cases enthusiastic, approval.  In <Col N="52" /> any scheme devised to develop the fishing industry, the practical support of our Public Bodies will be found a valuable aid.</P>
    <P>The conditions existing at Dingle owing to various causes were reported, and the organiser visited Dingle to investigate.  It was found that the prices paid the fishermen were so low that it was impossible for them to continue the work.  The buyers explain this by showing that owing to the cutting off of railway facilities, and the slump on the American market, it was impossible for them to buy.  It is worthy of note that the fishermen of Dingle were instrumental in saving the people from starvation when the enemy forces blockaded the place by holding up the approaches on the land side. The fishermen carried foodstuffs from other ports into the Dingle area.</P>
    <P>The inland fisheries of Ireland were the most prosperous of the present year owing to the scarcity of salmon on the Scotch and English rivers.  Poaching, and destruction of immature fish by pests, are the destroying agents the people of Ireland should put down. The inland fishermen, in common with the men engaged in the sea fisheries, are all anxious to be organised, and, given anything like normal conditions, this necessary work would soon be completed.</P>
    <P>A bitter fishery dispute in the Dingle area between mackerel fishermen and trawlers was referred to the Department, and, acting for it, the Rev. M. Farragher, P.P. conducted an enquiry. His decision, which satisfied all parties, will form a precedent for the future.</P>
    <P>A dispute in the inland fishing area at Killarney is now being considered, and if agreed to, an enquiry will be conducted.</P>

      <P>This Report which I prepared for the Dáil is a very lengthy one, and as the Deputies must be rather wearied of listening to Reports, considering that I am a little wearied myself, I shall try to earn their gratitude by being as brief as possible.</P>
      <P>There are a few matters which I would like to point out.  I shall pass by the time when Mr. Barton was in charge, when he put together a scheme for the acquisition and distribution of land and the provision of a Loan Fund for that purpose.  I endeavoured after his arrest to carry on that work.</P>
      <P>I come right down to the moment.</P>
      <P>The question of tillage, and everything that goes along with tillage, is giving us a great deal of uneasiness lately.  Owing to the dry season the crops will be rather short.  Wheat seems to be going out of cultivation altogether in Ireland.  Potatoes and oats are also scarce.  Tillage that received a certain stimulus during the war is going back into grass, and unless the members of this Assembly look very closely into the question, in a few years time I am afraid this country will be nothing else but a wilderness on which cattle will be browsing.</P>
      <P>Another point to which I would like to call attention is the number of men unemployed because of no work on the land.  It will be your duty, particularly the duty of the Deputies from the country, who know this question and the extent of it, to look very closely into it when we meet in Private Session.</P>
      <P>There is just one other matter.  Agriculture in Education as well as in everything else seems to be put into a subordinate place.  I do not think that is right or fair.  Without Agriculture there would not be much use of our adjourning now.  We would have no food to face, and I am sure in future this Dáil will see that a far larger amount of attention is given to Irish Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I do not at this time wish to keep the attention of the Deputies, but I would like to point out to them that Agriculture is one of the greatest industries of any country in the world, because on agricultural industry depends the food and the sustenance of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> Some time last year, I drafted a Bill for extra production of corn in this country, because, at the time, I foresaw we were in for a very long and arduous struggle with the enemy. Unfortunately, I was taken off to prison before the Session came on, and the Bill was not brought forward.  You all remember how a few years ago, during the Great War, when the English nation was in stress and crying out that they were actually starving, and when Lloyd George actually sent out signals of distress, he passed a Bill for compulsory tillage so that he would help to win the war.  As I thought we were in for a very prolonged war, I thought that the Irish farmers should at least give assistance by, if not voluntary, then compulsory attention to more tillage, so that we could carry on the war to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>Since then, I find that a Bill was being prepared and will be brought forward here applying to the whole of Ireland. There are parts of the country which do not need this measure.  In almost all the south of Ireland the requisite number of acres of land is being tilled, but other parts of the country need looking after.</P>
    <P>It is very hard, I am sure, to ask a farmer or to compel him to do anything during the present or past year; because, not alone were the houses, the furniture, and barns burned by the enemy, but the food was ruthlessly destroyed, and that by men who were sent over here by the British Premier who, a few years ago, was calling out to Irish farmers to save him from starvation.  I do not wish to delay you any longer, but I hope that as this is so important a subject it will get proper attention.  It needs a good deal of legislation.  I would like it to go forth that we intend to place Agriculture on a lasting foundation, and I appeal to the farmers not to wait for compulsion, but to produce as much food as they can to enable us to win this war.</P>

      <P>Mr. President and Deputies,</P>
      <P>I have the honour to present to you this brief survey of the work done by the Department of Agriculture from April, 1919, to the present date.  In this survey I have attempted nothing more than a short and cursory outline of the history of the Department since its inception.  I give little detail here of its struggles, its attempts, and its achievements in the face of many grave and formidable obstacles; some of these matters will be recorded more minutely in a comprehensive Report which, at the moment, is being prepared.  However, every outstanding event and performance of the Department will be found duly set down in this synopsis.</P>

        <i>Nomination of the Ministers or Directors and the Establishment of the Ministers and Directorates.</i>&mdash;The First Session of the First Dáil was held on the 21st January, 1919, while a great number of the Deputies were in British prisons, but it was not until the following April when the majority of the imprisoned Deputies were released that the President was elected and the Ministers and Directors nominated by him in accordance with his constitutional powers.</P>
      <P>On 1st April, 1919, the Deputy for East Clare and East Mayo, Mr. Eamon de Valera, was elected President of the Dáil, and next day he nominated 7 Ministers and 2 Directors, one of the latter being Commandant R.C. Barton, the Deputy for West Wicklow, who was made Director or Minister of Agriculture.</P>

    <P Just="Center">PART II.</P>
    <P>Administration of Commandant Barton, T.D.</P>
    <P>CHAPTER I.Land Aquisition Schemes. Commandant Barton's administration extended over ten months, and was terminated by his unfortunate arrest by the enemy at a time when he had just got the Department well under way. He devoted most of his energy to devising a Land Settlement Scheme and setting up of a Loan Fund in connection with same. The Decree (1919) authorising the Scheme declared that:</P>
    <P>The provision of Land for the agricultural population now deprived thereof is decreed, and a Loan Fund under the authority of the Dáil may be established to aid this purpose.</P>
    <P>Later the Draft Scheme was submitted to the August Session, and it was finally presented and adopted in its amended form at the October Session of the same year. The scheme and its operations has now extended over the entire country. Within the brief span of its existence it has made remarkable headway, and has become firmly rooted in the life of the nation. It has proved its worth and need, and will be a lasting monument to the ability, courage, and imagination of Commandant Barton.</P>
    <P>CHAPTER II.Forestry.A Decree of the 18th June, 1919, made November 1st National Arbor Day, and authorised the appointment of a National Inspector of Forestry. A sum of £1,000 was voted to be appropriated for the purposes of the present year. The result of this Decree was that a Committee on Forestry was formed by Commandant Barton early in July, 1919. This Committee held many meetings during the summer, and towards the end of that August it appointed Mr. W.L. Cole, Inspector of Forestry. Mr. Cole's appointment was in due course sanctioned by the Ministry, and he proceeded to organise the country and carry out arrangements for the successful celebration of Arbor Day.</P>
    <P>In June, 1920, Mr. Cole reported in connection with the organisation of Arbor Day, 1919, as follows:</P>
    <P>My work began towards the end of last August. Some ten weeks only were available to circularise the whole country, get all the Cumainn to work, stir up the County and Urban Councils, write to all educational institutions in rural districts, to each School Manager and all Clergymen in ditto, to Societies interested in Forestry, and to call forth and reply to endless queries and problems that arose in individual instances. The main result is that in practically every case the work was got in hand, and, as nearly as we can reckon, some 250,000 to 300,000 trees were planted.</P>
    <P>Considering the shortage of time and the harassing circumstances which prevailed at that period, this, it will be admitted, was a praiseworthy achievement, especially when it is recollected that the entire organisation was done on the small net outlay of £70. Mr. Cole also distributed throughout the country some 50,000 leaflets of an informative and educational nature, and arranged for lantern lectures on the subject.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cole only undertook the office of Forestry Inspector up to Arbor Day, 1919, at the express wish of Mr. Barton. Business affairs and personal responsibilities prevented him from continuing this important work.</P>
    <P>CHAPTER III.Labour Disputes bearing on Agricultural Affairs.The Department of Agriculture has occasion to get in touch with the Department of Labour frequently regarding disputes between employers and employees, which arise out of, or have a bearing on, Agricultural affairs. In the early days of the Dáil, before the work of the various Departments became well defined, a Labour Committee was set up by the Ministry with Alderman Tom Kelly, then substitute Minister of Labour, as Chairman. Commandant Barton and myself were members of this Committee. During Commandant Barton's regime only one grave dispute of an agricultural nature came before us. This was the dispute in Co. Kildare between the farmers who were members of the Irish Farmers' Union and the farm labourers who were members of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> The disagreement between these parties arose on points affecting wages, hours, and conditions of employment.  It was important, as it was the first of its kind ever tackled by us, and as it appeared to be rapidly assuming a serious character.  The Committee failed to get the Co. Kildare members of the Farmers' Union to come before a Conciliation Board which had been recently set up; and I was deputed by the Ministry to enquire into the matter personally and endeavour to settle it. My efforts, coupled with those of the Deputy for North Kildare (Mr. Buckley), were fortunately successful, and a menace which at the time threatened to spread was happily ended.</P>
    <P>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;<i>Food, Produce, Stock, and Agricultural Industries.</i>&mdash;In the fall of 1919, the Agricultural Committee which Commandant Barton formed to watch the various phases of agriculture until the Department became properly staffed, advised the Minister to issue a warning through the Irish Press on the subject of Food Scarcity.  The warning was duly issued and was printed by a large number of provincial papers.  It had the effect of causing farmers to retain for themselves a larger than normal proportion of their produce for home consumption.</P>
    <P>About the same time, the Acting-President (Mr. Arthur Griffith, T.D.), at the request of the Minister of Trade and Commerce (Mr. Ernest Blythe, T.D.), then under arrest, instructed Commandant Barton to take over the work of the Department of Trade and Commerce in connection with the Dressed Meat &amp; Packing Industry, towards which the Ministry had voted £200.  The development of this most important project engaged a good deal of the Minister's time prior to his arrest.  A circular was issued pointing out of the manifold advantages of the scheme, and calling attention to the remarkable fact that every year we export from this country 800,000 fat and store cattle and 650,000 sheep and lambs at a value of £21,000,000.  &ldquo;By purchasing in Ireland,&rdquo; states the circular, &ldquo;£21,000,000 worth of raw material the English promote an almost unending chain of industries subsidiary to that of dressing the meat and preparing it for consumption.&rdquo;  In another pamphlet issued by the Department of Trade and Commerce, the history of the famous Wexford Co-Operative Dressed Meat Factory was briefly traced.  This factory commenced in 1912 with a paid-up capital of only £1,500.  &ldquo;By September of that year,&rdquo; says the pamphlet, &ldquo;9,000 had been applied for and £7,000 paid up.  At present the capital of this Society is £18,500, held by 2,900 shareholders.  The growth of this Society's business is very clearly shown by the fact that its sales have risen from £34,000 in 1912, and £67,000 in 1913 to £235,000 in 1919, and actually £250,000 in the first six months of 1919.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>About the same time, the Minister of Industries (Professor McNeill, T.D.), issued a Departmental Report in which he drew attention to the grave danger of a Meat Trust on American lines springing up in this country with the levers of control in the hands of British absentee directors, which, if left unchallenged, would ultimately kill all national and local endeavour on those lines.</P>
    <P>Later, in order to push forward this Dressed Meat project, brimful of such vast possibilities, and to wreck at the birth of the industry anything in the nature of a foreign capitalistic monopoly, the Minister of Trade and Commerce became busy on a Co-Operative Dressed Meat Factory for Waterford. This scheme was going ahead very successfully till the destruction of creameries and industrial concerns by the British forces last year made its postponement advisable.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PART III.</P>
    <P>Administration of Art O'Connor, T.D.</P>
    <P>CHAPTER I.&mdash;<i>My Appointment as Minister-Substitute.</i>&mdash;After the arrest of Commandant Barton, there was an interregnum for three months in agricultural affairs.  Although I undertook, at the request of the Ministry, a mission to Kerry in the early February of 1920, it was not until the 15th of the following April that I was officially invested with Commandant Barton's office in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>CHAPTER II.&mdash;<i>The Land Trouble in the South and West.</i></P>
    <P>Section 1.&mdash;<i>The Trouble in the County Kerry.</i>&mdash;It is necessary for me to go back some months prior to my appointment <Col N="56" /> in order to trace accurately from its very first moments the great Land trouble which broke out and raged with such vehemence over the south and west last year.  During the winter and early spring of the season 1919-20, trouble arose between labourers and farmers in several parts of the country; but in the Co. Kerry the trouble shortly became serious and showed signs of developing along very ugly lines.</P>
    <P>I was deputed by the Ministry to proceed to the Co. Kerry and investigate the matter first hand.  I found a grave state of affairs prevailing especially in the northern part of the county.  A dispute had arisen over the demand of the labourers for additional land, and hence it was not really a wage but a land trouble.  This demand had not been made in just the nicest way, and, as a result, the farmers absolutely refused to entertain it.  Feeling rapidly grew so bitter that both sides resorted to boycotting, the sending of threatening letters, the burning of houses and crops, and other forms of lawlessness. The commotion showed all the symptoms of finally taking the form of a civil war of a kind which would have undoubtedly spread to the calmer parts of the country, and probably in the ultimate, from small beginnings, involve the Government itself in general ruin. Farmers would shoot into labourers' houses one night, and the next night the labourers would resort to reprisals of a similar nature.  There was no loss of life, although there were a number of persons wounded by gunshot.</P>
    <P>I interviewed the representatives of the farmers and the labourers, to both of whom I talked very straight on their duty to the State; fortunately, each side vied in its loyalty to the Republic, and the situation became perceptibly easier before I left.</P>
    <P>Having seen the leading public men of the infected areas, I returned to town and presented a Report, dated 21st February, 1920, to the Minister of Labour, in which I came to the following conclusions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  That the shootings and burnings will cease when the root causes are removed.</P>
    <P>(2)  That land not wages is the root of the evil.</P>
    <P>(3)  That the question can only be approached through a conference of farmers and workers.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the Dáil Minister of Labour is the proper authority to convene this conference, as both sides are overwhelmingly Republican. Even amidst all the trouble up to £6,000 has been actually subscribed to the Loan.  Farmers and workers are all doing their share.</P>
    <P>(5)  That the Dáil must be ready to facilitate the farmers and workers in the provision of someone analogous to a Land Commissioner, or a Labourers Act Inspector.</P>
    <P>(6)  That the Loan Fund can help very much in the transfer of some of the smaller as well as the larger parcels of land.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the discussion of my Report, an informal conference was held on March 8th on the initiative of the Minister of Labour, to discuss the feasibility of Labour Unions taking some active part in the acquisition, management and control of Co-Operative farms to be worked by labourers.  The net result of this conference and other interchanges between the Dáil and both sides was that this serious turmoil was checked.  The Manifesto appealing to the patriotism of all parties to stop their strife which appeared over the names of the Deputies for the county a little later, finally calmed the trouble, and thus a danger to the State was fortunately removed.</P>
    <P>Section 2.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Land Trouble in Connacht.</i>&mdash; Shortly after I took up duty in the Department, the Land trouble in the west became very acute, and reports revealing an alarming state of affairs there flowed daily into my office. Presently large numbers of terrified landowners came up to the city for the purpose of seeking interviews with responsible Republican officials, and beseeching the Dáil for aid and protection. It is a curious anomaly that those aggrieved landholders, mostly persons with strong British sympathies, and hence opposed to the Republic, were actually the first section of the community to advocate strongly the setting up of a Judiciary responsible to An Dáil.  Matters became so grave that the Ministry requested me to go to Connacht <Col N="57" /> and study the trouble on the spot with the object of finding some way of allaying it, or, at least, of checking it, even temporarily.  I set out for the west early in May, and spent some days travelling through the affected areas and collecting all the information I possibly could.  I visited the towns and vicinities of Ballinasloe, Loughrea, and Galway in the Co. Galway; Claremorris, Ballinrobe, the Neale, and Cong in the counties Mayo and Roscommon.  I met representatives of every class and section of the people&mdash;priests, professional men, I.R.A. officers, landholders and claimants&mdash;and was able to form a pretty clear idea of the nature and extent of the trouble.  For the Land War of 1920 was no ordinary outbreak.  In other years, as the spring came, those who had no land in these so-called Congested Areas cast longing eyes on the lands of those who had, and attempted to grasp them by cattle-driving and other forms of &ldquo;gentle&rdquo; pressure but as the spring advanced and their desires remained unsatisfied, they sank back into the slough of despond, perhaps to await such an opportunity as this.</P>
    <P>This spring, however, the land war broke out with a virulence and a presage of danger which made the worst of previous years seem positively tame.  It is hard to determine why this should be so. It may have been that economic stress had gone past straining point; thousands of young men had been forced to remain in Ireland during the European War, who in ordinary circumstances would have gone to enrich other countries because there was no living for them in their own; and if in their dire need they swarmed on to the land as their only hope we may condemn, but we can at least understand them.  But while this may have been the cause, it certainly was not in the main the only one.  The cause was as much mental as physical. Power, actual and moral, was passing from the British authorities in Ireland into the hands of the Government of the Republic, but in those days it was in a state of flight and had not yet taken definite rest in its new home.</P>
    <P>The British were either so frightened or paralysed or unable to read the sign of the times that they suddenly ceased to perform the ordinary civil functions of administering law and keeping order.  The Dáil itself seemed overwhelmed by the suddenness with which the responsibility of Government had been thrust upon it, and for a little while it seemed to shrink from its duty as one shrinks from the fulfilment of an unexpected joy.  During the winter of 1919 in Ireland, Government seemed to stand stock-still. Over Leinster and the greater portion of Munster order was kept though there was no one to enforce it.  Each side was, as it were, taking a long breath for the struggle for mastery which was bound to come.  Only in the west, in Clare and parts of Kerry was the land war producing such a storm as would ultimately rouse the Dáil from its lethargy like an angry mother to punish an unruly child.  The majority of the people, though they drank deeply of the draught of freedom, kept their heads, but in the west they were hungry &mdash;hungry for land&mdash;and easily intoxicated with the wine which they drank to the dregs, they confused license with liberty, they knew the British forces were powerless to restrain them, they hoped and perhaps thought that their own Government would condone a confiscation to right a confiscation of other days; that even if it objected, it too would be powerless to touch them till they had gained their ends.  Big ranch and little farm were invaded indiscriminately&mdash;the small farms with so much frequency as to indicate the adoption of a policy of a line of least resistance, till no holder felt his title or possession safe.</P>
    <P>It was at this moment that Society with one accord turned to the Arbitration Courts to save it from anarchy. Where Courts had been established, as I shall describe later, they immediately got to grips with the menace; in other places they sprang up spontaneously and rapidly, and strove to halt the mad onrush of the revolution.  Sometimes they were trampled upon and their decisions scouted, but in general they were applauded and by degrees won universal respect for the speed with which they dealt with troublesome cases.</P>
    <P>But the enemies of the ordinary Sinn Féin Arbitration Courts did not take long to see their weakness.  The decisions given might be splendid, but where was the machinery to carry them out?  Sinn Féin was a political organisation with a strong influence through public opinion, but it was after all only a sectional organisation, and its enemies <Col N="58" /> and those who were anxious to repudiate the Courts could make a good case for refusing to enter these Courts or be bound by their decisions.  In places where Sinn Féin was strong and representative of the militant as well as the pacific side of the movement no difficulties were experienced, for by an excess of authority, people who refused to obey decisions were summarily dealt with as enemies to good order and peace.  It was in such an atmosphere as this, which would have proved intolerable after a time, as much from the failure to have decisions carried out as perhaps to have unjust and severe decisions issued, that the Dáil stepped in, and I found myself in the west invested with almost plenary powers to grapple with the problem.</P>
    <P>On the 13th May, 1920, I went to Ballinasloe and attended the East Galway Comhairle Ceanntair of Sinn Féin, where Father Malachi Brennan presided, and I addressed the delegates on the general principles underlying our attitude towards the Land Movement.  We discussed the Constitution of Arbitration Courts and decided on one provisionally for the constituency, to operate until the Dáil had definitely decided on a National Scheme.  Kevin O'Shiel, B.L., joined me here and helped in the drafting of Rules of Procedure and Pleadings for Courts.  Later, on the 19th May, I went to Galway to attend a conference specially convened to consider the formation of Arbitration Courts.  I had no responsibility for the calling of this conference, which concerned another Department, but I availed of the presence of a very representative gathering from all County Galway and other counties in Connacht to enunciate the only definite land policy, which had heretofore been agreed upon by the Dáil in the hope of steadying the agitation. Working along the lines laid down by Commandant Barton in his Land Scheme of October, 1919, I stated to the delegates, <i>inter alia</i>, that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;under the British Land Purchase Act the dominant idea was to fix the occupying tenant on the land. Under this scheme the dominant idea was to fix the non-occupying people on untenanted land.  This was where the schemes differed. The British Land Purchase Acts would have ensured that the farmers and their sons remained in the country.  We were trying to ensure that the farmers' sons, the workers, and other people would have an opportunity of getting on the land, and would not have to go to America.  In our schemes three classes were catered for.  First there was the uneconomic holder.  We proposed to give him an addition of land to bring his holding up to an economic holding&mdash;something he could live out of.  In the second place, we proposed to get land for the landless people; and in the third place, we proposed to make land available for the small tradesmen living in a rural area, with knowledge of agricultural operations, whose trade or business does not provide him with a sufficient means for a decent livelihood.  The central authority in Dublin any more than any other body in the community was not in favour of anything in the nature of confiscation or expropriation, and if it was necessary and desirable that the people who did not possess land should come into the possession of land&mdash;and it was very desirable&mdash;the people must come into it by the proper mode.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 21st May, 1920, I presented a Report of my Connacht mission to the Ministry, in the course of which I outlined the situation in the west as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Generally speaking, the recent land trouble tended in Mayo and West Galway to a struggle on the part of uneconomic holders to gain possession of some of the lands in their immediate vicinity, which in many cases were little larger in extent than the claimant's own.  In Roscommon and East Galway the struggle was rather for the division of large holdings which might be termed ranches.  In Mayo and West Galway there is a heavy demand for land, and little to go round&mdash;even including the undivided holdings in the hands of the Congested Districts Board.  In Roscommon and East Galway there is a good deal of land to go round, i.e., untenanted lands in the hands of the Congested Districts Board, <Col N="59" /> and other large grazing ranches. Many unjust acts undoubtedly have been done in the name of Sinn Féin, but the situation is rapidly changing. &lsquo;Out of evil cometh good.&rsquo; Recent happenings have proved that the majority of the people readily turned to organised Republican opinion to save society from a complete collapse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With the establishment of the Courts by the Dáil and their successful functioning under this Department this sinister menace to the peace of Connacht and of Ireland was removed.</P>
    <P>CHAPTER III.&mdash;<i>The Land Settlement Commission and Its Courts.</i>&mdash;Prior to 1920, there would appear to have been some semi-official Republican Courts in existence.  These were more or less of a military nature, usually functioning in private, and gradually came to be known as Sinn Féin Arbitration Courts.  Such Courts were no new idea in Irish rural life; they were a feature of the Land League days; they formed a prominent plank in the original platform of the Sinn Féin Policy as erected by Mr. Arthur Griffith, and it was natural that they should be seized upon and adapted to fill the need of Justice as the English Courts became unpopular, but it is doubtful if their greatest upholder or founder foresaw how clearly their extension would shake English power in Ireland to its very foundation.  They began in Clare and Galway about the same time in the summer of 1919, and gradually spread to other parts of the west as the need demanded.  At first their operations were small and they received little publicity or attention, except in their immediate neighbourhood, till the great wave of land hunger which swept over the west in the spring of 1920 gave them and the Republic at once the greatest test and opportunity. To have coped with the ordinary methods of disorder would have been a remarkable achievement for those young inexperienced Courts, composed as they were of busy men who had their everyday business to attend to and small opportunity for studying the niceties of legal proceedings, but to have withstood so bravely and partially stemmed the avalanche of the Land War of Spring 1920, was something of which a well-seasoned judiciary might be justly proud.</P>
    <P>However, in spite of the efficient working of the Sinn Féin Courts and the general success of their decisions, the issue was too momentous and too grave to be dealt with by any but a National Authority, in which not merely the litigants would have confidence, but which would have power to enforce its decrees. I received striking manifestations of this in my experience derived from the first public sitting of any Court directly under the Dáil, held at Ballinrobe on the 17th May, 1920.</P>
    <P>As the first case heard at that Court may be properly described as the cornerstone of our Judiciary, it will be excusable to give the circumstances connected with it in some detail.  It concerned a farm of land of a little over one hundred acres held jointly by two men named Hyland and Murphy with large families, on to which a crowd of uneconomic holders possessing miserable holdings, some of them as low as £2 Poor Law Valuation, had swarmed.  The farm was situated in the parish of Kilmaine. The bitter feelings between the parties had so permeated the whole neighbourhood that it was felt that a local Arbitration Court could not give the case an unprejudiced hearing, with the result that Fr. Martin Healy, P.P., on behalf of the owner, and Mr. Maguire, Solicitor, for the claimants, importuned Mr. Griffith, then Acting President, to send someone with authority from the Dáil to deal with the case.  I was specially commissioned to do so, but not having legal training I got Kevin O'Shiel, B.L., to assist.  The time and the occasion seemed to me so opportune to bring the administration of Justice out of the cellars and to give both friend and foe an example of Republican Justice delivering its judgment in the full light of day that I decided to hold a Court in public.  Events more than justified my action.  The enemy had received his first public challenge in the domain which he considered sacrosanct.  In a few days public Courts were being held all over the country, and the Republic was making its first great constructive advance, and the outposts of the enemy were being correspondingly driven in.</P>
    <P>At the opening of the case, the Solicitor acting for the owners became unnerved at the nature of the Submission <Col N="60" /> Form (which not he but his clients were obliged to sign) and refused to compromise himself by appearing.  However, the Rev. Martin Healy, P.P. acted quite successfully as advocate in his stead.  The Submission Form was as follows, and is similar to all the submission Forms used in purely Arbitration Courts prior to the setting up of the directly authoritative Courts of the Land Settlement Commission:&mdash;</P>

    <P>In the case of Hyland and Murphy we decided against the claimants chiefly because the holding was barely sufficient for the maintenance of the two joint owners and their large families, and because adjoining Hyland's holding there was an undivided ranch of 700 acres in the hands of the Congested Districts Board, towards which the the Claimants should have turned their gaze.  The claimants were very indignant at this decision, and, assisted by the promptings of the enemy forces they defied the Order of the Court and continued to remain in possession and enjoy the use of the disputed lands.  Furthermore, they went throughout the fairs boasting of their contumacy and waxing eloquent on the futility of the Dáil's authority.  But the Republic had a longer arm than they had given her credit for and one night about a fortnight after the issue of the judgment, the captain of the local company of the I.R.A. descended upon them with a squad of his men&mdash;sons of very poor farmers like themselves&mdash;arrested four of them, and brought them off to that very effective Republican prison&mdash;an &ldquo;unknown destination.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This killed the resistance, and the prisoners were very glad to get back to their homes somewhat later, chastened and wiser men.</P>
    <P>This case is of supreme importance as it established confidence in the rigid impartiality of the Courts and showed the determination of the I.R.A. to carry out the decisions.  But it also showed the necessity of setting up a Judiciary under Dáil control to deal with such cases, as well as the creation of an executive arm to automatically carry out a Court's decree.</P>
    <P>With a view to achieving this I obtained authority from the Ministry to summon a representative conference of Connacht delegates to meet me in Dublin and discuss the question from every angle.  This conference met on the 29th May, 1920.  It consisted of Connacht Deputies, I.R.A. Commandants, Sinn Féin Representatives, and the Deputies for West Clare and North Longford.  The Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Defence were also in attendance.</P>
    <P>I summed up the result of this conference in a Report to the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Conference achieved its main purpose by showing the necessity for a forward land policy; it showed further the suspicion, which was general, of all section attempts at land settlement not under the authority of An Dáil, and the absolute necessity for co-ordination between the work of the Courts and the machinery to carry out the Decrees.  In speech and letter at the Conference four out of every five delegates made it clear that passivity or attempt to drive the land movement under would not be merely futile but dangerous and unjust to the young men whom circumstances of the war had compelled to remain in Ireland, and who now more than ever, from patriotic reasons, desired to remain if they <Col N="61" /> could get a living in their own country.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Conference and many discussions I have had with people from different parts of the country, as well as my own observations, I have come to the conclusion that the land question must be tackled by us not in any halfhearted dilettante manner, but with a desire to solve it where so many others have signally failed.  The circumstances of the present hour &mdash;though much against us in the creation of machinery&mdash;favour us as previous generations were not favoured.  Power and control are passing from the British Government in land as well as in everything else all over the country, and we should be worse than fools if we let the opportunity pass of righting the wrongs of ages.  We must tackle the Land Question as a national proposition, and though we may be able to deal with only a small portion of the problem before we are able to function freely, yet the skeleton we create and proceed to cloth with flesh and life must be properly designed and proportioned from the very commencement, so that no needless amputations or graftings will be necessary later on. To this end I suggest the setting up immediately of a Republican Land Commission under the authority of the Dáil ... The majority of the Commissioners should certainly have a legal training with a good knowledge of the intricacies of Land Tenures of the country, but the root idea in their selection should be the getting of men who, through their knowledge of the country, sympathy for a permanent land settlement, and absolute integrity, would help to solve the problem quickly and well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In order to consolidate and direct the entire policy of Land Settlement along a broad national avenue, and thus prepare the way for the establishment of the Land Settlement Commission, I obtained sanction from the Ministry to relieve the Local Arbitration Courts of the burdens of Court work in so far as their cases affected land and henceforth to work the whole system of Land Tribunals through properly trained legal men commissioned by me, and the Department of Defence looked after the execution of Decrees till Republican Police became definitely established, though the necessity to call in the strong arm of the law was very seldom necessary.  Everyone was eager to obey the decree of the People's Courts, and he who might have been tempted to do otherwise soon found that it was wiser for him to change his tactics, as, apart from any other consideration, public opinion was wholly against him.</P>
    <P>The enormous pressure of work on the Department, the amount of correspondence that daily arrived needing prompt personal attention and the drafting and preparing of Decrees for the establishment of the Land Settlement Commission for submission to the Dáil, kept me tied up in Dublin during the summer.</P>
    <P>From all parts of the country, especially from the west and south, Registrars of District Courts sent in long lists of land cases that urgently awaited hearing, and eagerly clamoured for sittings of Dáil Land Courts presided over by myself, or some representative of the Dáil.  As there was at that time no machinery devised by law to meet and deal with this great accumulation of work, it became necessary to make some temporary arrangement.  With the sanction of the Ministry, I issued a Warrant to Kevin O'Shiel as a Special Commissioner authorising him &ldquo;to arbitrate on all matters relating to disputes about land within the purview of this Ministry&rdquo;; and he went throughout the country hearing and determining cases.</P>
    <P>During the months of May, June and July, and part of August, he was engaged practically every week in holding Land Courts in the troubled areas. He sat in Ballinasloe, Claremorris, Ballyhaunis, Roscommon, Castlerea, Mullingar, Castlepollard, Birr, Portlaoghaise, Tullamore, Granard, Longford, Manorhamilton, and ocassionally in Dublin.  An idea of the extent of the work is seen from some of his Reports to me.  It was impossible for him to stay long enough in one centre to dispose of the entire list, the most he could do being to hear the more urgent cases and adjourn the rest until he had attended to equally urgent cases elsewhere.  However, with one or two exceptions, he was <Col N="62" /> never less than two days in any town. He was twice in Roscommon, the first time for a week, and the second time for a fortnight.  The conditions prevailing there during the sitting of the Court he describes as surpassing the public interest displayed in the Assize Court of the British system in the period of its heyday. The hotels were packed with counsel, solicitors, land valuers, and litigants, whilst the streets of the town swarmed with hundreds of witnesses.</P>
    <P>Every single solicitor in the county, despite politics, and many from neighbouring counties, appeared professionally at some time or another during the sitting.  The Court was crowded with the general public who took the greatest interest in the proceedings; and from the very start the People's Courts were everywhere enthusiastically welcomed by all classes of the community, and their awards were, with a few exceptions, loyally accepted and carried out.  In Roscommon alone 69 cases were dealt with involving 11,575 acres.  This was a considerable achievement when it is remembered that nearly all those cases were of an important nature involving grave considerations of title and descent.</P>
    <P>But the Courts showed a tendency to become too popular for a designing class who laid claim to their neighbours' property on vexatious and frivolous grounds, so that some curbing legislation was found necessary, and the Decree of the 29th June, 1920, was planned and put forward by the Minister of Home Affairs.  Claims &ldquo;to farms and holdings which are being used and worked by the occupier as dairy, agricultural residential holdings, such claims being based on the assertion that the claimants or their ancestors were formerly in occupation of the property&rdquo; were henceforth stopped from all judicial consideration unless the claimant could produce a written licence from the Minister of Home Affairs.</P>
    <P>At this time, and until the beginning of the reign of terror in last October, the Sittings were held in public, generally taking place in the Town Hall of the various centres, or in a large Public Hall where the former were lacking. The power and prestige of the British authority were then as now at so low an ebb that these legitimate Courts were actually allowed to carry on their pressing business without any interference from the British Constabulary.  An exception to this rule, however, occurred at Mullingar, where armed constabulary and soldiers in full war equipment, accompanied by a tank and some armoured cars, to &ldquo;make assurance doubly sure&rdquo; no doubt, descended upon the County Hall and interrupted the proceedings in so violent a fashion that the Commissioner was obliged to adjourn.  Yet that very evening the Court resumed its work in the town and carried out its prescribed business without a litigant, a witness, or a lawyer refusing to attend.</P>
    <P>These Courts proved beyond all manner of doubt that axiom which we so frequently asserted, and which the enemy as frequently denied, namely, that given an authority based on the impregnable foundation of the consent of the governed, no people in the world are more law-abiding or more peaceable or more impatient with the lawless than the people of this Republic.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Formation of the Land Settlement Commission.</i>&mdash;The more I studied the land question the more I became convinced of the absolute necessity for the early erection of the solid and permanent machinery for dealing with it &mdash;the Land Settlement Commission&mdash; which had been projected in my Report to the Dáil in June, 1920.  Special Commissioners acting under special warrants did useful work in allaying the trouble when it was at its height, but for settling it some constructive institution with large judicial and inquisitional powers was badly needed.</P>
    <P>At the Session of An Dáil above referred to I presented for first reading a draft of the Bill for the Establishment of the Land Settlement Commission, embodying in more detail the view set forth in my Report.  In addition, the important developments of the Land Courts with full judicial powers, not mere Arbitration Tribunals, are shown in the following clauses in this draft:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Clause 3 stated</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that on and after the appointed day, to be a day to be later determined by a Ministerial Order, all claims affecting the ownership, occupation, or user of lands automatically pass under the jurisdiction <Col N="63" /> of the Land Commission and its Courts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Clause 5 stated</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That all claims to land to be filed with the local Registrar of the Land Commission Courts.  That pending the examination of and decision of these claims, acts of aggression against the persons in possession of or enjoyment of the lands, or against persons working on the lands, or against the lands claimed, will seriously prejudice the further consideration of the claims.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And in order to make sure that no possible miscarriage of justice might have been unwittingly committed by the popular Courts in existence prior to the Dáil Courts, I inserted a sub-section to Clause 5, which ordered&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That all judgments affecting the ownership, occupation, or use of lands pronounced by popularly created Courts since January 31, 1919, shall be forthwith lodged with the local Registrars of the Land Courts.  The Commission may confirm said judgments, or order a rehearing of the issues before its own Courts as it may think fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Bill was read a second time at the August, 1920, Session of An Dáil, and on the 17th September, 1920, in its finally amended state was passed by An Dáil.  This Decree consisted of twelve main clauses, with several subsections. It provides for the constitution of a Land Commission to consist of one legal Commissioner and two lay Commissioners, to be appointed by the President of Dáil Éireann in consultation with the Minister of Agriculture. The legal Commissioner and every successor in his office must be a person who at the date of his appointment is a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than three years' standing.  In the event of the death, resignation, or incapacity of any of the Commissioners, the President of the Dáil, in consultation with the Minister of Agriculture, has power to fill the vacancy.</P>
    <P>Clause (2) refers to the incorporation of the Commission under the name of the Land Settlement Commission, and that all the Courts of Justice of the Republic will take notice of its Corporate Seal.  Clause (3) deals with the Sub-Commissions that may be erected; Clauses (4) and (5) with the Salaries of Commissioners; Clause (6) and part of Clause (7) with Appeals to the Court of Appeal of the Commission and to the Supreme Court of Appeal of the Republic.  The greater part of Clause (7) refers to the Commissioners' powers over the acquiring, holding, allocating, leasing, alienating, etc., of the land, whilst Clause (8) gives it power to make rules for carrying the Decree into effect. Clause (9) deals with the appearance of parties before the Commission; Clause (10) makes it impossible for a Commissioner to be a Deputy of the Dáil, and the last two Clauses deal with the Annual Reports and Accounts of the Commission.</P>
    <P>Having got the Decree finally passed through the Dáil, I immediately proceeded to get the Commission established and functioning as soon as possible.  In a very short time I had it created in part, and at present the headquarters staff consists of three Commissioners. It has also a Secretary and a Chief Registrar. In the country this work is supplemented by the services of several competent valuers, available when required, and the Registrars are the same in every case as the Registrars of the District Court under the Department of Home Affairs.</P>
    <P>Since its inception, it has been busily engaged in carrying out the work for which it was created.  From September onwards Courts have been held and lands valued and divided under its ægis in many parts of the country.  And this, it must not be forgotten, in spite of deliberate and well-planned terrorism on the part of the enemy to paralyse this important administrative wing of our Government.</P>
    <P>A Session was held in Templemore a few days after its sacking and pillage. Again, in the town of Loughrea in the month of October, a Court sitting was held whilst armed British forces flowed through the streets in a futile attempt to suppress the tribunal&mdash;which they could not find.  The Commissioners also visited Carlow, Sligo, Leitrim, Offaly, Tipperary, Clare, and other parts of the south during the blackest days of the past winter.  Many Courts were held in Dublin, too, where Orders and judgments were made which were always loyally obeyed.</P>
    <P>Early in the year I was able to present <Col N="64" /> to the Ministry a complete Con titution of the Court of the Land Settlement Commission, with accompanying Rules and Regulations governing practice, pleading and procedure, and also specimen forms.  This Court is divided into three main divisions, viz. :&mdash;the Division of First Instance, the Division of Emergency, and the Division of Appeal. The Division of First Instance is further divided into two equal and concurrent Courts&mdash;the Court of General Sessions which sits throughout the year in the city of Dublin, and the various Courts of District Sessions which sit in every District Court area at specified times during the year.  Courts of this Division are, as their name implies, purely Courts of First Instance.  Cases are heard fully in them <i>ab initio</i>, and all the evidence thoroughly sifted, when judgments are given on the merits.</P>
    <P>The Court of the Division of Emergency has power to sit every day of the week in the city of Dublin.  It is presided over by one judicial Commissioner who hears and issues Orders in matters brought before him on Motions of Notice. It is an Emergency Jurisdiction and is meant for adjusting&mdash;temporarily at least&mdash;urgent matters in cases which may appear not to be listed in either of the other Divisions.  The Division of Appeal needs no explanation, save to mention that Appeals can come before it from either of the other Divisions. Where the Court of this Division thinks proper, there is machinery provided for sending a case on to the Supreme Court of Judicature of the Republic.</P>
    <P>I think I can safely claim now that the Land Settlement Commission and its Courts are solidly established and are working continuously and smoothly at the task of solving the insistent and troublesome land question.  Let it not be inferred from this that the Land Settlement Commission has gone forth seeking trouble.  The task was forced on it by the attempted land revolution of last year, and I cannot do better than restate the policy which has guided the Commission as enunciated in my Report to the Dáil at the meeting in January last, as follows :&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...I hold now as I held and stated last June that operating for ownership of land on cash basis at the present time is a mistake and is a policy which should be discouraged from a national point of view.  Lords of the soil are trading upon sentiment and the land hunger of the people.  They fear a change. They are delighted to get an opportunity to clear out of the country with their pockets well lined with Irish money.</P>
    <P>General use of land under a guarantee of security from the State is what should be aimed at for the moment, as the creation of a lot of new tenures as in the present circumstances may tie the hands of a future Government when one is able to function freely and to have the best schemes of land policy and settlement knocked into shape under fair open criticism.  Further, if the buying up of supposed interests in the soil continues at the present rate, money for industrial purposes, which should be run in close association with the land, will be very difficult to obtain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have prepared returns of the operations of the land Courts (both of the Land Settlement Commission and of this Department prior to the creation of the Commission) from May, 1920, till June 30, 1921.  These returns give summaries not merely for the whole country but for each individual county under headings which are readily understandable. They will be found as Appendices (A) and (B) at the end of this Report.</P>
    <P>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;<i>Forestry.</i>&mdash;Although I favour and have always favoured an active State policy with regard to Forestry, the conditions last year were such that I was compelled to follow a cautious path in this matter.  To attempt reafforestation in a state of war is as fruitless as setting a tent in the teeth of a gale, and it became my endeavour to conserve existing woods rather than create new ones.</P>
    <P>In the best of times I do not put much &ldquo;suim&rdquo; in an Arbor Day celebration. The most one can hope to achieve in practice from an Arbor Day such as was successfully held in 1919 is the planting of a few hundred thousand trees in isolation; if they resist the ravages of vermin and storm they may in time add to the beauty of the landscape, temper <Col N="65" /> the climate, and improve the nature of the soil, but such a movement, though it may direct the attention of our people to the scandalous condition of the country as regards forests, will not increase its area under woods by one per cent. in a generation.  There is only one solvent for our low percentage of Forests&mdash;financing and direction and control by a free governing State.</P>
    <P>While waiting and working patiently for its advent I am not blind to the necessity for some preparations &ldquo;i gcóir an lae&rdquo;&mdash;ní lá na gaoite lá na scolb. Foresters and men trained on proper lines are the first essential in any national scheme of afforestation, and unfortunately Ireland does not seem to possess many, if any of them.  So in June, 1920, I applied to the Dáil for a vote of £30,000 to be availed of when necessary to purchase an estate and residence on it suitable for a central Forestry Station and School; I did not succeed in obtaining the vote, as the proposal was considered somewhat premature, though all were in sympathy. Last autumn I did not even attempt to gain the limited benefit derivable from an Arbor Day, because two great difficulties made it almost impossible. Young trees were not available to any extent, and a suitable Inspector of Forestry could not be obtained.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to observe the interest the country takes in reafforestation and the preserving of existing woods and forests.  I have had letters from Sinn Féin Clubs for information on the planting of waste lands; from Co. Councils complaining of the excessive felling of timber and asking for restrictions on felling or at least on export.  It has been difficult without legislation to deal with this latter type of case. Special need often called forth action which I felt was a straining on my jurisdiction. For instance, last year when I received an accredited statement that a timber merchant who had made sad havoc with a beautiful wood at Maam without replanting a single tree, was continuing his vandalism on the shores of Lough Mask, I sent him an Order &ldquo;not to cut down or permit, or cause to be cut down any of the trees in the wood known as Kilbride Wood near the shores of Lough Mask, unless and until the District Court for the area gave him permission.  In other cases I threw the responsibility on the Co. Committees of Agriculture to impose the check or take the responsibility of advising me when complaints were made; fortunately for the survival of many woods in various parts of the country during the past year restraint on their cutting was imposed by our Army authorities for military reasons, but though public policy may demand such restraint, the Dáil must issue a decree to allow this legally to be done unless under Army Order.  Viewing this question broadly, it is obvious that the following considerations must get due consideration:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Contracts effected prior to issue of a Decree of the Dáil cannot be interfered with without compensation. Will the Dáil compensate?</P>
    <P>(2)  After due notice by Decree or otherwise, prohibitive action might be taken in cases where woods are to be cut wholesale, for example, cutting of trees on areas in excess of 1 acre unless sanctioned by the authority of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>(3)  Cutting in itself should not be considered a crime if the trees are matured and their cutting will not be a serious damage to a District in beauty, soil, or otherwise.</P>
    <P>(4)  Replanting is difficult to enforce, and in many cases it would be unjust to use compulsion on the owner of a cleared area unless a definite percentage of the money required could be supplied by the State.</P>
    <P>(5)  All of above could be well assisted by propaganda in the public Press, discussion at Public Boards and Councils, and creation of general interest in what should be all the people's concern.</P>
    <P>During and since the European War, timber merchants and land jobbers have been felling and exporting timber to England to such an extent that whole areas in Wicklow and Kerry and other parts of the country have been literally cleared of the standing timber, and, bad as Ireland's case was, it has probably suffered more in the past five or six years than in the fifty years of its previous history, and it will take generations to restore the balance of the damage done.</P>
    <P>This is the burden of a most incisive report of the Leix and Ossory Comhairle</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> Ceanntair of Sinn Féin; also of a constructive resolution from the Cork Corporation Food Emergency Committee which I received last year.  Intelligent thought in the country is aware of the disease; it will assist in the remedy.</P>
    <P>Within their limited powers, up to the present many Co. Councils have done splendid service for Forestry.  Councils can levy a penny rate for the systematic culture and preservation of timber; this provides for acquisition of land, creation of nurseries, planting, fencing, etc. Under this scheme the county which is most deserving of imitation and emulation is Kildare, which, with its whole-time forester and wood rangers has over 360 acres of woods and plantations under its control, not to mention the hundreds of shelter belts it has made available round farmsteads, and the nurseries it has created for the cultivation of young trees.  Other counties should at least seriously consider the starting of nurseries, even if they cannot find a generous landowner, as in Kildare, to give its woods a start.</P>
    <P>At this Meeting application is being made for a Decree to enable the felling of timber to be dealt with in a methodised manner in the future.</P>
    <P>CHAPTER V.&mdash;<i>Labour Disputes Bearing on Agricultural Matters.</i>&mdash;The Department of Agriculture has frequently been called upon to settle disputes of an agrarian nature between employers and employees.  During my term of office I have had to enquire into, and adjust many such disputes.  I give herewith some details of my work in this connection.</P>
    <P>(1)  <i>County Carlow Agricultural Wages Dispute.</i>&mdash;Last August a dispute which promised to be serious broke out between the farmers and the farm workers of the Co. Carlow.  A number of prominent local Republicans did what they could to settle the trouble in the national interests but, unfortunately, did not succeed.  Subsequently they applied to this Department to interfere before it was too late.  After some vicissitudes and abortive meetings on the part of the antagonists, I at length succeeded in arranging a Conference which was attended by representatives of the Co. Carlow Association of the Farmers' Union and by the Carlow Branch of the Transport and General Workers' Union.  Fr. Killian, C.C. presided at this Conference, and when it broke down I had to arbitrate along with him on the points at issue.  We issued the following award, which I quote in full as it sets out, on the face of it, the history and subject matter of the dispute, and shows the usual form in which such awards are made.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whereas a Conference convened by the Minister of Agriculture of Dáil Éireann was held at Carlow Town Hall on Wednesday, 10th August, 1920, between representatives of the Farmers' Union and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union of Co. Carlow.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And whereas said Conference agreed unanimously to the Presidency of the Rev. John Killian, C.C.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And whereas said Conference discussed an application for increase of Wages from the I.T. &amp; G.W.U. based upon the letter dated 27th April, 1920, from Secretary of I.T. &amp; G.W.U. to E.H. Broughan, Esq., Ballybromhill, Fenagh, Co. Carlow, as follows :&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(1)  For men over 18 years a weekly wage of 45/-</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(2)  For boys under 18 years a weekly wage of 35/-.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(3)  For all a 50-hour week, time and a half overtime and double payment for Sunday work.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(4)  Perquisites to remain as per Agricultural Wages Board Order of 19th April, 1920.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(5)  For men over 18 years a Harvest Bonus of 80/-, and for boys under 18 a Harvest Bonus of 60/-, to be payable on or before 1st November, 1920.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And whereas said Conference failed to agree upon any of the above-mentioned points (1) to (5) inclusive.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And whereas further said Conference unanimously agreed to submit to the arbitration of Arthur O'Connor, T.D., and the Rev. John Killian, C.C., all questions touching said points (1) to (5) inclusive and further the duration of this Award.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And whereas the said Arthur O'Connor, T.D. and the said Rev. J. Killian, C.C., have duly sat in judgment on the aforesaid matters in the dispute.  Now it is hereby <Col N="67" /> decided and determined and our signature affixed herewith witness, that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  For men over 18 years of age wage shall be 36/6 per week.</P>
    <P>(2)  For boys from 16 to 18 years of age wage shall be 22/- per week.</P>
    <P>(3)(a)  Week shall consist of six working days of 9 hours each as and from this date to October 31, 1920 inclusive, and it shall consist of six working days of 8½ hours each as and from November 1, 1920, to February 28, 1921, inclusive.</P>
    <P>(b)  Overtime to be calculated at one and a half times the ordinary rate.</P>
    <P>(c)  Sunday Rate:&mdash;Men over 18 years of age to receive payment for Sunday work at the rate of 1/2 per hour; minimum payment for Sunday work to be 2/-.  Boys from 16 to 18 years of age to receive payment for Sunday work at rate of 9d. per hour, minimum payment for Sunday work to be 1/-.</P>
    <P>(4)  Perquisites which may be reckoned as payment of wages in lieu of payment in cash for the purpose of this award shall be valued as follows:&mdash;(Here followed Schedule of Perquisites which represented an average increase of 20 per cent. on the Agricultural Wages Board Scale.</P>
    <P>(5)  Harvest Bonus shall be as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Men over 18 years of age £3.</P>
    <P>(b)  Boys 16 to 18 years of age £2 to be payable before November 1, 1920.</P>
    <P>(c)  This Award to be binding on all members of the Farmers' Union and the I.T. &amp; G.W.U. in Co. Carlow and operative within the said County of Carlow as and from this date until the 28th day of February, 1921, inclusive.</P>
    <P>Published this 18th day of August, 1920, as our Award.</P>
    <P>(Signed),</P>

    <P>John Killian, C.C.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Presiding Arbitrators.</i>
    </P>
    <P>This Award appears to have given general satisfaction.  A local priest writing to me about it says: &ldquo;There is general satisfaction and relief over Award.  A very few on either side dissatisfied. Our Bishop commends it strongly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(2)  <i>The I.T. &amp; G.W.U. and Lazarian Guild Dispute.</i>&mdash;My next incursion into the realm of trouble in Agricultural Labour was also in Carlow at Kildavin in November, 1920, and had to do with a most unusual class of dispute, viz., a dispute between two labour organisations which hit and hampered the farmers while it lasted.  The dispute concerned a very few men, yet, as the principle involved was important, it is worth recording.  I went to Kildavin and met representatives of the Farmers' Union, the I.T. &amp; G.W.U., and Lazarian Guild in Conference.  The Secretary of the Farmers' Union complained that although they had no quarrel with their workers, yet they probably suffered more in the hostilities between the rival labour organisations than if they had been taking part in the contest themselves. They were sniped at by both sides.  Feeling was very bitter between the two organisations, as the whole controversy seemed to centre round the status of big as opposed to little unions. The I.T. &amp; G.W.U. wished to gobble up the Lazarian Guild, and the latter refused to be assimilated.  The matter was much more for a Trades' Congress than a Governmental authority, unless in so far as restraint on freedom of action was attempted on a group of workers who wished to live their own life in their own way.  Being without guidance of any general legislation by the Dáil on such an issue, I was compelled to offer advice rather than attempt a solution.  Apparently the advice tendered was well accepted as I have heard nothing of the matter since.</P>
    <P>(3)  <i>The Curragh Stable-Lads' Dispute.</i>&mdash;The Arbitration on the above dispute though not held directly under the authority of the Department is also worthy of record as an index of the readiness with which arbitration was accepted last year before the reign of terror as a solvent for all grave difficulties. In the June of 1920, a dispute arose between the trainers and the stable-lads at the Curragh just a few days before the Irish Derby Meeting.  It was essential to settle it, and to settle it speedily.  After some preliminaries, the Kildare Co. Council eventually succeeded <Col N="68" /> in getting both sides to submit their case to an Arbitration Court made up of four arbitrators and presided over by me. The Court met in the Kildare Courthouse on the 15th July, and on the same evening issued an Award which gave general satisfaction; there has been peace on the Curragh since.</P>
    <P>(4)  <i>Other Disputes.</i>&mdash;During the past winter and spring agricultural disputes were few.  In Carlow, threats of a break between the I.T. &amp; G.W.U. and the Farmers' Union arose many times but they have succeeded in carrying on together so far; in Cork, some trouble actually did occur in the Liberties, but the Cork Sinn Féin Executive, with which I was in contact, handled the situation very well and set up a special Arbitration Board (<i>ad hoc</i>) to deal with the disputes which had arisen, and eased some difficulties in the County as well.  Most of the leading counties in which paid labour is prevalent, such as Dublin and Kildare, managed to arrive at agreements covering the coming year on the same terms as the old without hostilities.  About a month ago a strike and lock-out actually came to a head in Co. Wicklow, but on intervention from this Department it was settled by C.M. Byrne, T.D., before there was time for crops to suffer much damage. Three weeks back, a strike was threatened in Co. Meath, but was suspended on the intervention of our Ministry of Labour, and a representative from this Department arbitrated on the matters in dispute.</P>
    <P>As far as I can learn there are no farm disputes existing at present.</P>
    <P>(5)  <i>General Conditions of Agricultural Labour.</i>&mdash;The conditions and development of that section of labour which comes within my province have caused me considerable anxiety.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the big farmers to the little farmers, and of farm-workers to all farmers in general, is frequently one which requires the most careful and delicate handling from those in control of affairs.</P>
    <P>In the Departmental Report which I presented to the January, 1921 Session of the last Dáil I went very fully into some aspects of this thorny question which must be tackled sooner or later.</P>
    <P>I herewith reproduce those parts of my Report dealing with the matter. The question is just as acute to-day as at the time the January Report was written.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;<i>Unemployment.</i>&mdash;There is another matter connected with the land which I regard as of very pressing importance. Unemployment is becoming a menace to England, and it is a certainty that Ireland will be caught in the backwash of it, too.  Already signs are pointing to extensive unemployment here from two main causes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The prices obtainable for farm produce are on the down grade, costs of production are remaining stationary, farmers are gradually dropping tillage and allowing the lands to run into grass.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The acts of the enemy in destroying creameries and other rural industries are driving people out of work.  The inevitable tendency of unemployed is to flock to the towns where, with stagnation in building and other engineering trades and destruction of plants by enemy acts, the number of unemployed is already considerable.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This problem of unemployment can be tackled in Ireland with greater hopes of success than in England if it is done now.  In England the outlets for fresh developments are practically nil owing to its highly organised industrial condition and dense population.  In Ireland we have the land which could at least support unemployed and save them from being a burden on the community and a menace to the well-being of the State.  The chief difficulty is to know how to give the unemployed access to the land.  Vested interests, of course, will make this hard.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Compulsory Tillage.&mdash;There are two main lines of approach open to us, either to deal with this matter of land access on a compulsory basis or a voluntary one.  I favour the voluntary one, appealing to the patriotic sense of the individual affected, as the majority of our people have a loathing for compulsion, and compulsion creates a necessity for control which would be very difficult to exercise in our present circumstances. And here I may observe that were it not for the arrest of the Teachta for East Cork, this subject would have been debated in any event if I had not decided <Col N="69" /> to bring it forward, as he has tabled a private member's Bill for Compulsory Tillage.</P>
    <P>Of course, if it is the sense of the Dáil that compulsion in some shape or form must be used, I shall endeavour to overcome the difficulties if it is my duty to carry a scheme through.</P>
    <P>Whether a scheme for increased tillage to utilise men who would otherwise be employed is to be carried out on a compulsory or voluntary basis, there are many points of policy on which I would like to have the opinions of An Dáil. Whether cultivation on tillage farms should be extended or the undeveloped ranch lands be brought under the plough?  Probably the extension of cultivation on good tillage farms would give the most satisfactory results, though the national conscience would feel easier if the ranch lands were invaded, and it seems to me that a sharp line of division will need to be struck between the farmer who has done, is doing, and intends to do his duty by the State in working his land, and the man who, by keeping large tracts of land out of cultivation, is a menace to the whole community. Voluntary operations with the farmer and the equivalent of compulsion with the other would seem to be the most suitable line.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Further difficulties, of course, will arise as to whether the unemployed are to be taken on as additional hands by a tillage farmer under definite guarantee of fair return for his crop and security against labour upheavals, or whether a farmer should set aside a certain amount of ground upon his farm at a fair rent which the unemployed could work to the best of their ability individually or in co-operative groups without interference or without responsibility to the farmer who gives the land.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All these seem matters of detail, yet they must of necessity dovetail one into the other to make a scheme for the use of land which would help to solve the problem of unemployment, and they will be difficult to arrange if farmers and workers approach them with a suspicion that, under the pressure of a serious national crisis, advantage is being taken to make them swallow economic doctrines and create systems which they do not like.  But some such scheme, in my opinion, is necessary to rid us of the spectre of unemployment, and if the best elements in the State who take an interest in the land are rallied to its support, it can surely tide us past this danger.</P>
    <P>If An Dáil believe that some such steps as suggested above should be taken to deal with unemployment, I would respectfully suggest that it arms the Ministry with the power to have same brought into effect with the force of a Decree.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>CHAPTER VI.&mdash;<i>Food Produce, Stock, Agricultural Education and Industries, and General Matters.</i>&mdash;I desire to bring this Survey of Work Done to an end by recording as briefly as possible the work achieved under the above headings.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Food Produce, etc.</i>&mdash;Last winter a deputation of the Farmers' Union waited on the Vice President, the Minister of Labour, the Minister for Trade and Industries, and myself.  They stated that they were agreed that a sufficiency of such food-stuffs as bacon, butter, etc., should be retained in the country for the use of the people; they objected, however to the principle that labour organisations should fix the proportion to be retained, but were willing to agree to any decisions come to by a tribunal set up by An Dáil.  On this offer being communicated to the representatives of labour, they also expressed their willingness to accept the directions of such a tribunal.</P>
    <P>In October last Mr. David Kent, T.D. filed on the Agenda of the Dáil a Bill for the increased production of food-stuffs to be called the &ldquo;Corn Production Decree, 1921.&rdquo;  This proposed Decree sought to make it compulsory for all persons holding arable land to put as much of the land under cultivation &ldquo;as will ensure a sufficient supply of food for the people of this country, to be classed as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  All persons holding less than 50 statute acres shall put 10 per cent. under cultivation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  All persons holding 50 statute acres or less than 100 shall put 15 per cent. under cultivation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)  All persons holding 100 statute acres or over shall put 20 per cent. under cultivation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bill made provision, also, for the infliction of certain penalties.  Those not complying with the terms of the <Col N="70" /> Decree, and who held under 200 acres of land to be fined £25 for every 50 acres they possessed, whilst persons holding more than 200 acres were to be fined £100, &ldquo;and in addition £100 for every hundred acres over and above 200 acres.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Kent's unfortunate arrest by the enemy prevented the many interesting points in this Bill from being discussed.</P>
    <P>Last November I sent a Circular to every Co. Council in the country <i>re</i> conservation of potato supplies and the growing of wheat.  These Councils gave the matter wide publicity with perhaps good effect as regards the potatoes, but certainly not as regards wheat.  Everything favoured the planting of wheat last winter except in areas where the war was very intense; yet, reports which I have recently received reveal the fact that the quantity of wheat grown shows a still further decline.  There is one element of consolation about the matter at the moment, it can hardly be much worse, and with a little propaganda it may readily improve.  The quantity of wheat grown in Ireland is about sufficient to supply the population for 10 weeks, a state of affairs which would be tolerated in no other agricultural country in the world.  It is contended that wheat does not mature properly and that it does not pay, but national security in this important stable food must rise above &ldquo;the high quality&rdquo; and &ldquo;present worth.&rdquo;  The open nature of the spring favoured farming, with the result that considerably more land was put under the plough than might have been expected, and although oats in acreage and yield, and due to drought, will fall considerably below last year, potatoes are expected to give a fair acreage and return.  The long spell of drought has seriously prejudiced the turnip crop, but mangolds will yield well.  I have recently obtained a fair general survey of the crop conditions and prospects from practically every county, and I hope to be in a position to give more explicit information on the subject on the day of the Meeting.</P>
    <P>In order to guard against possible loss in the potato crop through blight, I issued a warning in the Press <i>re</i> spraying on the 30/6/'21, and since it became evident that the hay crop would be very poor, and that there would be no hope of it being supplemented by straw for winter feeding, I issued Notices and Circulars to the County Committees of Agriculture <i>re</i> catch crops for spring forage, and I am glad to report that the movement is being well taken up in the country.  The circulars issued in connection with the above will be found in the appendices.</P>
    <P>As a natural corollary to the decline of tillage consequent unemployment, and scarcity of human food other than meat, the grazing system generally comes in for a large measure of condemnation from the people and the people's Councils. I have had many such resolutions during the past year, and feeling is becoming so insistent and irritated by the large amount of the country which is being allowed to run into a wilderness of grass that the Dáil will probably be forced to legislate on the matter without delay.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stock, etc.</i>&mdash;The milk supply of the country should naturally fall under the heading of food, but I have purposely put the subject here to enable it to be associated with the Dairy Stock from which it has its origin.</P>
    <P>Last year, in the month of May, the Commission of Inquiry into the Resources and Industries of Ireland issued its first Report&mdash;an interim one&mdash;on Milk Production.  This Report disclosed a very unsatisfactory condition of the milk industry, due largely to inferior types of dairy cattle, and recommended in general terms the acquisition or leasing of certain suitable farms for the improvement of dairy herds.  The Report was considered by the Ministry, who referred it back to the Commission with widened terms of reference to enable a more detailed Report and recommendation to be made.  This Report has been received by the Ministry, and circumstances arising out of the war have alone prevented its recommendations from being brought before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The health of a nation's stock must, after the health of its people, be a prime <Col N="71" /> consideration.  Animals, like human beings, are subject to sickness and diseas. As some diseases are of a particularly virulent and contagious nature, every Government must take adequate measures to prevent or cure these diseases, not only for its own sake, but as a safeguard for the health of other States if it engages in a live stock export trade.  Hence it is that the enemy Government which imposed its rule on this country in other days from time to time devised measures for ensuring that Irish live stock would have a clean bill of health.  Amongst such measures was sheep-dipping for scab, and isolation and slaughter for &ldquo;foot and mouth.&rdquo;  One would fancy from the behaviour of some individuals and public bodies since the enemy administration was overthrown that such regulations were penal survivals which should be got rid of as soon as possible by all good Republicans.  They are nothing of the sort.  Sheep dipping, for example, if properly carried out is the sheep owners' and the country's protection against scab and other diseases, and public bodies which on the false plea of economy are dropping their sheep dipping schemes and dispensing with their equipment and inspectors are guilty of a grave dereliction of duty.  Specious arguments have been used against these regulations, but they bear no weight&mdash; good wine is not altered by the shape of the bottle in which it is stored.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agricultural Industries, Education, and General Matters.</i>&mdash;For obvious reasons, very little of a constructive nature has been done in the matter of agricultural industries.  While the enemy enjoyed the flare of a creamery on the midnight sky, new factories of any description would merely have presented him with an additional opportunity for his fiendish work.</P>
    <P>The national poet of England seemed to have had a prophetic vision of his country's agents here and elsewhere:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds</P>
    <P>Make ill deeds done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That a building served a distinctly national purpose in Ireland was sufficient to decree it to destruction; consequently the Dressed Meat Factory project in Waterford still remains in its embryonic state, and agricultural industry has receded instead of advanced through the destruction of its creameries and farm buildings.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education.</i>&mdash;Education in agriculture is more a joke than a reality in a country which is predominantly agricultural, and which, failing another deluge or earth movement, must remain so.  It does seem surprising to see every encouragement given to the best brains in the country to follow careers apart from agriculture, and in cases where young men are attracted towards the land and are anxious to specialise in theoretical and applied agriculture the facilities accorded them are not to be compared with those enjoyed by intending doctors, lawyers, or engineers.</P>
    <P>Education for agriculture, instead of being the centre of our system, is just barely tolerated; and the only ray of hope I can see is the Scholarship Programme projected by some of the go-ahead Co. Councils which are determined to give agriculture its pride of place.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Matters.</i>&mdash;There are other aspects of the Department's activities which cannot be published now, but enough, I hope, has been written to show that the Department has not been unmindful of the responsibilities with which the Dáil has entrusted it.</P>
    <P>I return my sincere thanks to Mr. O'Shiel, B.L. who kindly arranged the materials for this survey and put it in draft; he also wrote the first part, but I have altered it so much that he may with difficulty recognise his own work; I commend the staff for their loyal devotion to duty at all times.  I also wish to acknowledge the spirit of union and co-operation which existed between all Departments of the State, and which alone made our continuance possible, particulary during the reign of terror. Other countries may, perhaps, have had more gorgeous revolutions; none has had more unified service than ours.</P>

    <P>NOTE.&mdash;The above &ldquo;Total No. of Cases dealt with&rdquo; may include some which are given as &ldquo;ones in which Decisions were Pending&rdquo; on 31st December, 1920, as the actual Court work would be finished but examination of titles and valuations might remain to be settled.</P>
    <P>The sums given under the heading &ldquo;Purchase Prices fixed&rdquo; represent in some cases all the interests to which the lands were subject prior to purchase, in others only the tenant interest with a continuing charge on the lands.  It is obviously impossible to give this detail in a general Return so that no sure data as to price per acre of land can be deduced from above.  Accurate data of all cases dealt with can be obtained on application by any Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Department of Dáil Éireann begs to direct the attention of farmers and plotholders to the great necessity of having their potatoes sprayed in good time. Blight was very prevalent last year and lightened the yield in thousands of acres in Connacht and Munster. Spraying is the great preventative of blight, and proves its value in good returns on the crops.</P>
    <P>Virulent attacks of the disease are almost certain to follow a break in the present fine weather.</P>
    <P>Advice on the proper mixtures, means and times for spraying, can be obtained through the various Committees of Agriculture in the country.</P>
    <P>Spray early and, if possible, spray twice.</P>

    <P>Small-leaved Dwarf Rape should not be bought, nor Spring Vetches</P>
    <P>Sow Hardy Green Starters and Rape immediately, but not after 15th August. The earlier they are sown the earlier they are fit for use.</P>
    <P>Sow Rye and Vetches during August and early in September in succession in order that the crop will not get too hard and strong in spring. As the crops come in in the order in which they are numbered above, it is recommended that some of each be sown, and a succession of Rye and Vetches.</P>
    <P>Sow per Irish rood from 4 to 16lbs. of Hardy Green Starters, and the same quantity of Giant Broad-leaved Rape, or a mixture of 4 stone of Giant Essex Rye and 3 stone Winter Vetches. All to be sown broadcast.</P>
    <P>Sow in any place where turnips or mangolds failed, or in a stubble, or after the oats crop. Rye and Vetches can be sown after digging out a piece of potatoes.</P>
    <P>If sown in stubble, apply, per rood, at time of sowing, some farmyard manure, or about 2 cwt. of superphosphates; and early in March shake about 3 or 4 stone of nitrate of soda per rood on all these crops in any ground.</P>

    <P>The Secretary,</P>

    <P>A chara,</P>
    <P>I send herewith copy of a notice which has been issued to the public Press from this Department re the necessity for the planting of Catch Crops to augment the supply of fodder which will be available next winter and spring. It is perfectly obvious that owing to the shortage of hay and the shortness of straw that there will be a scarcity if the winter is hard and a large quantity of stock has to be carried over to the spring.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if you would bring this announcement to the notice of the members of your Committee, who, in the majority of cases, are leading agriculturists in your county, so that in this way concentrated effort can be made.</P>

    <P>29th July, 1921.</P>
    <P>The Nation's Forage Supplies.</P>
    <P>That there is a serious shortage of forage crops in the country this year is now certain. The hay crop is one of the lightest on record, and the straw yield of the grain crops is much below the average.</P>
    <P>Farmers throughout the country are urged to prepare immediately to meet this shortage in their winter and spring stock foods.</P>
    <P>Catch crops suitable to the locality should be sown on every farm during the months of August and September after the early potato or grain crops have been saved.</P>
    <P>Full information regarding the crops to be sown and the methods of cultivation can be obtained through the County Committees of Agriculture, from whom assistance and advice should be sought without delay. A shortage of forage food supplies results either in starvation or enforced sale of stock in the early spring and consequent glut of the markets and heavy fall in values. The secret of success is preparedness.</P>
    <P>Food Supply.</P>
    <P>DAIL ÉIREANN.</P>
    <P>AIREACHT TALAMHUIDHEACHTA.</P>
    <P>(Agricultural Department).</P>
    <P>16th November, 1920.</P>
    <P>A chara,</P>
    <P>While the general situation at the moment as regards Food Supply is not one to cause alarm, yet it is best to make provision against a possible shortage owing to the failure of potatoes in a few areas. Further, there is a need for an extension of wheat culture if we are to become less dependent on foreign supply; this need can best be met by each farmer putting a small percentage of his land under wheat as a national duty if other considerations fail to impress him.</P>
    <P>To further this it is suggested that your Committee meet as soon as possible, with your instructors in agriculture and horticulture in attendance, and that the following points get wide publicity and attention in your area.</P>
    <P>General DirectionsPotatoes.</P>
    <P>(1) Potatoes to be raised and stored as soon as possible. This should be nearing completion in most counties, but there are many large stocks still visible in the fields.</P>
    <P>(2) Owing to prevalence of disease, pits should be turned earlier than usual for sorting, etc.</P>
    <P>(3) No potatoes fit for human consumption should be fed to pigs. If the waste in this direction continues as at present there will be undoubted shortage. More use should be made of meal and palm nut cake for fattening pigs, and cooked swedes might in part replace potatoes.</P>
    <P>(4) Farmers should be strongly advised as to the desirability of securing seed potatoes as soon as possible for planting next spring.</P>
    <P>(5) In addition to above, Instructors should be in a position to advise farmers more particularly as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) Where stocks of potatoes for consumption and seed are available in their counties.</P>
    <P>(b) The benefits to be derived from boxing seed.</P>
    <P>(c) How average yield as noted in course of visits from place to place compares with last season, and, as soon as possible, report to Committees on average yield for county.</P>
    <P>Wheat.</P>
    <P>(1) Instructors should advise farmers as to suitable varieties for late autumn or winter sowing, and for spring sowing.</P>
    <P>(a) For winter sowing, Yeomen, Victor, Wilhelmina, and Square Head are useful varieties, and owing to the openness of the season winter sowing is still quite in good time.</P>
    <P>(b) For spring sowing Red Marvel, White Marvel, are best for the early spring period, and Red Fife for light land and late spring sowing.</P>
    <P>(2)</P>
    <P>(a)  Indifferent farmers should not be allowed to shelve their responsibilities by the plea that their land is unsuitable for wheat; each type of land has its affinity in wheat, <Col N="76" /> which a little intelligent inquiry can discover.</P>
    <P>(b)  And neither should good nor bad farmers be put off planting by the idea that milling difficulties are insurmountable.  Flour producing plants of a <i>tried</i> type can be produced at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>(3)  All wheat seeds should be dressed with copper sulphate solution as a preventative against smut and bunt.</P>

      <P>It falls to me to present this Report in place of Desmond Fitzgerald who is in prison. I have been only carrying on his work &mdash;work ably conducted by him, and, before his time, by Riobárd O Braonáin under the Sinn Féin organisation.</P>
      <P>As explained in the Report, the Publicity Department of Dáil Éireann originated in the Propaganda Department of Sinn Féin, and grew out of it, and was substituted by the Dáil Éireann Department early in 1919, the first Director being Laurence Ginnell.  In June, 1919, Mr. D. Fitzgerald took charge of the Department.  Several pamphlets were published, and a considerable advance made in the efficiency of the Department.  The <i>Irish Bulletin</i> is now received by about 900 newspapers and specially selected individuals.</P>
      <P>The general work of the Publicity Department is of great variety, and could be very broadly alluded to.  One of its sub-departments has been referred to by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is keeping in touch with our representatives abroad.  The <i>Irish Bulletin</i> is circulated to them, and somewhat smaller editions are produced in foreign countries.  The success of Publicity abroad depends, of course, mainly upon the good efforts made by our representatives there, and has resulted in the considerable interest now paid to Irish affairs all over the world.</P>
      <P>Quite recently, an analysis of some foreign papers produced interesting results.  In one batch 117 papers were taken.  They came from practically every nation in Europe.  Only 8 of these could be definitely described as hostile to Ireland.  Forty-eight could be described as definitely in favour of Ireland, and the remainder, about 60, were neutral, but gave great emphasis to Irish news, and, on the whole, acted fairly.  The work also includes the collection and publication of statistics in connection with the war, and the publication and distribution of pamphlets; and also efforts to induce Irish authors to produce poems and ballads of national interest while representing the culture of Ireland.</P>
