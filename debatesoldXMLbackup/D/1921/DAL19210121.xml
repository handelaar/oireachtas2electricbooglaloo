    <Title>STATEMENT OF DEPUTY SPEAKER.</Title>
<P>The DEPUTY SPEAKER in an opening statement said he was sorry to say that the President found it necessary to alter his plans at the last moment, and he had been informed just then that the President could not be present.  The President arrived at that decision in consultation with the Ministers of Finance and Defence.  They had reason to fear it would be dangerous to come here, that certain Members of the Dáil would be well known and there was serious danger of their being followed and tracked.</P><P>The President would make arrangements to see any of the Members whom he had not already met, and when they had read the reports which had been circulated they could discuss with him any points in which they were particularly interested.  The Secretary would arrange for any of them wishing to see the President this evening or tomorrow. They had the majority of the available Members present.  He suggested that the reports should be read, but before doing this he would ask the Secretary to the Ministry, who was in close touch with the President, to convey to the meeting the message he had received from the President.</P>
<P>The SECRETARY stated he got word late the previous night that the President would not be able to be present and that he did not think it advisable to hold the meeting.  It was a verbal message and he was directed to take a list of the Members present who had not yet seen the President and to make arrangements for each one to interview him.</P>
<P>The CHAIRMAN remarked that he thought the meeting was fixed for that day because it happened to be the anniversary of the first meeting of the Dáil two years ago.  It was for the meeting to decide whether the reports were to be read or what they thought was the best thing to do.  He was at their disposal. As no one offered any suggestions he asked that the reports be read.</P>
<P>LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City) said there was no use in reading these reports.</P>

    <Title>READING OF REPORTS.</Title>
<P>As no further objection was offered the reading of the reports was then proceeded with.  The MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS read the report of his Department. The ASSOCIATE SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS presented the report of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="ADJOURNMENT." RHead="">
    <Title>ADJOURNMENT.</Title>
<P>At this stage a number of Members pointed out that it was a waste of time <Col N="237"/> to read the reports as there was no opportunity for satisfactory discussion in the absence of responsible Ministers. Other members thought it would be wrong to adjourn without discussing the present position of affairs in Ireland and coming to a decision regarding the general policy to be adopted.</P>
<P>Mr. J. MACDONAGH (Tipperary; Nth.) said that a further Session should be arranged for within the next few days, when responsible Ministers could be present.</P>
<P>Mr. F. FAHY (Galway, South) asked for definite information on the present situation.  He wanted the opinion of the Minister of Defence on the state of affairs in Galway, Tipperary, and other parts of the country.  Were the Volunteers being cowed and what chance was there of holding out for another year? He also wished to know what exactly had happened in America.  He had heard some people blame the President for his actions there.  Information was also required as to the proposals regarding Income Tax and other sources of revenue which had been mentioned at a previous Session.</P>
<P>SEAN MACENTEE (Monaghan, South) said the question of Local Government was becoming very serious and proposed that as the Minister for Local Government was in attendance, his report should be proceeded with.</P>
<P>M.P. COLIVET (Limerick City) seconded.</P>
<P>The proposal was defeated, and after further discussion the following resolution was unanimously adopted on the motion of LIAM DE ROISTE (Cork City), seconded by R.M. SWEETMAN (Wexford, North):&mdash;</P><P>&ldquo;That this Session of Dáil now adjourn owing to its inability to discuss adequately important questions of policy in the unavoidable absence of responsible Ministers, and that we request the President to have a statement ready to be submitted to the Dáil so that definite decisions on policy can be come to by the Dáil.  A meeting of the Dáil to be held, if possible, at once.&rdquo;</P><P>The Session thereupon adjourned.</P>
