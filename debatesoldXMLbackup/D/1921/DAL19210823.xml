      <P>as promised at previous meeting presented the draft reply which the Ministry proposed to send to the British government.  As the reply would not be despatched till to-morrow he asked the Deputies, if questioned by the pressmen, to reply that they were not at liberty to disclose what occurred at a private session.  He read the reply which was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>24 Lughnasa, 1921.</P>
      <P>Do Dháithí Uasal Leód Seóirse,</P>
      <P>10, Sráid Downing,</P>
      <P>i Lonndain.</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>An tuairim do bhí agam roimh ré agus mé ag tabhairt freagra ort an 10adh lá de Lughnasa tá deimhniughadh déanta air anois.  Leagas tairsgint bhur Riaghaltais-sa os comhair Dála Éireann, agus dheineadar a dhiúltadh d'aon ghuth.</P>
      <P>Ba léir ó nbhur litir an 13adh lá de Lughnasa gur mhian libh go n-admhuighmís nár mhór ceart na hÉireann do bheith ar lár ar mhaithe le cúrsaibh cosanta Sacsan do réir mar shaoil sí féin, toisc a chomhgaraighe is bhí Éire do Shacsaibh; agus nár mhór d'Éirinn géilleadh do'n smacht iasachta anois toisc a fhaid agus a dhícheallaighe is do bhítheas a d'iarraidh Éire do chur fé'n smacht soin 'san am atá imighthe.</P>
      <P>Ní féidir liom a chreideamhaint gur mheas bhur Riaghaltas feidhm do bhaint as neart airm gan scál a chuirfeadh ar neamhnidh macántacht na náisiún is a chuirfeadh críoch le síothcháin an domhain. Má théigheann ceart saoirse an náisiúin bhig ar cheal chomh luath is chuireann comhursa neartmhar dúil 'san tír i gcomhair airm no pé buntáiste eile bheadh le baint as, sin deireadh le saoirse.  Ní fhéadfadh náisiún beag súil do beith aici le neamh-spleadhchas iomshlán feasta. D'fhéadfaidhe Tír fo Thuinn is Danmharc do chur fé smacht na Gearmáine, Flondras fé smacht na Gearmáine no na Frainnce, an Portaingéal fé smacht na Spáinne. Náisiúin dár ceangladh d'impireachtaibh le neart fóiréigin, má chaillid a neamhspleadhchas dá dheascaibh, níl aithbreith na saoirse i ndán dóibh feasta.  Maidir le hÉirinn má luadhtar go bhfuil sí ag scaradh le páirtidheacht nár ghlac sí riamh leis, no le dílse nár gheall sí riamh, níl ann acht bréag ó bhonn; mar a chéile, éagcóir ó bhonn bheith ag éileamh a neamhspleadhchas do chur fé chois ar mhaithe le cosaint Sacsan.  Ní féidir linne .i. teachtaidhe an náisiúin, géilleadh do cheachtar aca.</P>
      <P>Ní thréigfimíd-na onóir ár dtíre ná an ceart a tugadh dúinn le cosaint; agus má dheineann Sacsa adhbhar cogaidh de sin, is truagh linn é.  Is léir dúinn cad é ár gcúram ar son na mbeo, agus ní lugha ár dtuigsint 'san nidh is dual dúinn agus 'san chomaoin atá orainn ag ár mairbh chródha.  Ní rabhamair ar lorg troda, is nílmíd ar lorg troda; acht má chuirtear an comhrac orainn caithfimíd sinn féin do chosaint agus déanfaimíd san.  Agus ciaca eirgheochaidh linn no ná eirgheochaidh, beimíd deimhnighthe ná molfaidh aon dream fear ná ban de theachtaibh Éireann do'n náisiún an ceart is dual di do scaoileadh uaithe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is mór is mian linn deireadh do chur leis an achrann so idir Éirinn agus Sacsaibh. Má tá ceaptha ag bhur Riaghaltas-sa a toil dimirt orainn le neart fó&lsquo;réigin agus <Col N="43" /> coingheallacha do leagadh amach roimh ré a bhainfeadh dínn ár staid dúthchais is a dhéanfadh adhbhar magaidh de'n socrughadh so ar siubhal eadrainn, sibh-se bheidh ciontach le buaine an achrainn.</P>
    <P>Do réir na gnáth-chomhairle úd gur toil an phobuil is bun le Riaghaltas, is féidir síothcháin do dhéanamh feasta, agus síothcháin go mbeidh ceart is onóir ann do chách is go mbeidh cneastacht is buanmhuinnteardhas mar thoradh air.  Is toil le Dáil Éireann teachtaidhe do thoghadh chun a leithéid de shíothcháin do dhéanamh; agus lán-chomhacht do thabhairt dóibh chun a chur i bhfeidhm i nbhur dteannta-sa, má ghéilleann bhur Riaghaltas do'n ghnáthchomhairle seo luaidhte.</P>

    <P>(Síghnithe) EAMON DE VALERA.</P>
    <P>(Official Translation)</P>
    <P>Mansion House, Dublin,</P>
    <P>August 24th, 1921.</P>
    <P>The Right Hon. David Lloyd George,</P>
    <P>10, Downing Street,</P>
    <P>Whitehall, London.</P>
    <P>Sir,</P>
    <P>The anticipatory judgment I gave in my reply of August 10th has been confirmed. I laid the proposals of your Government before Dáil Éireann, and, by an unanimous vote, it has rejected them.</P>
    <P>From your letter of August 13th it was clear that the principle we were asked to accept was that the &ldquo;geographical propinquity&rdquo; of Ireland to Britain imposed the condition of the subordination of Ireland's right to Britain's strategic interests as she conceives them, and that the very length and persistence of the efforts made in the past to compel Ireland's acquiesence in a foreign domination imposed the condition of acceptance of that domination now.</P>
    <P>We cannot believe that your Government intend to commit itself to a principle of sheer militarism destructive of international morality and fatal to the world's peace.  If a small nation's right to independence is forfeit when a more powerful neighbour covets its territory for the military or other advantages it is supposed to confer, there is an end to liberty.  No longer can any small nation claim a right to a separate sovereign existence.  Holland and Denmark can be made subservient to Germany, Belgium to Germany or to France, Portugal to Spain.  If nations that have been forcibly annexed to empires lose thereby their title to independence, there can be for them no rebirth to freedom.  In Ireland's case, to speak of her seceding from a partnership she has not accepted, or from an allegiance which she has not undertaken to render, is fundamentally false, just as the claim to subordinate her independence to British strategy is fundamentally unjust.  To neither can we, as the representatives of the Nation, lend countenance.</P>
    <P>If our refusal to betray our nation's honour and the trust that has been reposed in us is to be made an issue of war by Great Britain, we deplore it.  We are as conscious of our responsibilities to the living as we are mindful of principle or of our obligations to the heroic dead.  We have not sought war, nor do we seek war, but if war be made upon us we must defend ourselves and shall do so, confident that whether our defence be successful or unsuccessful no body of representative Irishmen or Irishwomen will ever propose to the nation the surrender of its birthright.</P>
    <P>We long to end the conflict between Britain and Ireland.  If your Government be determined to impose its will upon us by force and, antecedent to negotiation, to insist upon conditions that involve a surrender of our whole national position and make negotiation a mockery, the responsibility for the continuance of the conflict rests upon you.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the broad guiding principle of government by the consent of the governed, peace can be secured&mdash;a peace that will be just and honourable to all, and fruitful of concord and enduring amity.  To negotiate such a peace.  Dáil Éireann is ready to appoint its representatives, and, if your Government accepts the principle proposed, to invest them with plenary powers to meet and arrange with you for its application in detail.</P>
    <P>I am, Sir,</P>
    <P>Faithfully yours,</P>
    <P>(Signed) EAMON DE VALERA.</P>
    <P>They could see, he continued, that their vote of yesterday of approval of the <Col N="44" /> rejection of the terms was interpreted in a very definite manner and they were implicated in the reply to that extent and also in appointment of plenipotentiaries on the basis of &ldquo;government by consent of the governed&rdquo;.  That phrase would clear them from the challenge that they were trying to impose their will upon Ulster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMcCartan" hpid="DR. MACCARTAN DR. MACCARTAN">
      <NameTxt>DR. MACCARTAN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked did the President suggest there was something implied in the phrase &ldquo;government by consent of the governed&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>replied there was not, only it could be read into it that it had reference to Ulster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamFPStockle" hpid="PROFESSOR STOCKLEY PROFESSOR STOCKLEY">
      <NameTxt>PROFESSOR STOCKLEY</NameTxt>
      <P>pointed out several small nations had been mentioned in the statement by name and it occurred to him that as so much had been made of Serbia would it be well to suggest the case of Serbia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>was afraid it would make the reply too cumbersome.  It was only a detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPColivet" hpid="M.P. COLLIVET M.P. COLLIVET">
      <NameTxt>M.P. COLLIVET</NameTxt>
      <P>suggested the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; should be inserted before the phrase &ldquo;consent of the governed&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>pointed out the phrase &ldquo;government by consent of the governed&rdquo; was a world wide historic phrase and did not require qualification.  He asked did any Deputy object to the phrase rejecting the proposals or the phrase &ldquo;government by consent of the governed&rdquo;.  And there being no objection, he explained it would be regarded everywhere as a triangular problem.  They had to negotiate with Ulster on the one hand and Britain on the other.  It was his intention to get off the reply to-morrow and to have a public session on Friday when he supposed he would be called upon to give an analysis of the proposals.</P>

      <P>said four written questions were put to him and he would now answer them as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Was any attaché appointed to the armies of Turkey or Egypt?  No.</P>
      <P>(2)  Could not some officers be sent to Russia to be trained?  Yes, but no necessity for it now.</P>
      <P>(3)  What efforts were made to establish contact with Russia?  That is a question for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>(4)  How many service rifles in Ireland are under the control of I.R.A. and the average number of rounds?  It was plain he could not answer that question.</P>
      <P>(5)  Was the destruction of enemy property in England organized?  Tá.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="SPEAKER SPEAKER">
      <NameTxt>SPEAKER</NameTxt>
      <P>said the next business was the discussion of the report of Fisheries Department.</P>
      <P>(Speaker here vacated the Chair and it was taken by the Deputy Speaker (S. Ó Ceallaigh).)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanEtchingham" hpid="DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES, S. ETCHINGHAM, T.D. DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES, S. ETCHINGHAM, T.D.">
      <NameTxt>DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES, S. ETCHINGHAM, T.D.</NameTxt>
      <P>, said for several reasons the activities of the Department were turned to the organization of home and foreign markets and he appealed to the Deputies to give all the help they could in the different areas suitable.  They were at present concentrating on the Dublin market which could deal with 100% more than it was dealing with at present, but it would not take anything but high-class fish as it would not pay to send anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had a letter from Clonmel to-day which showed that fish sent from Liverpool at 2 p.m. on Thursday reaches there at 9 a.m. on Friday whilst fish sent from Howth by the first morning train did not reach till 9 p.m. on Friday night.  He had the same complaint from Dingle. They could not do anything at present except to get the public boards to interest themselves to compel the railways to improve transit facilities.  It was absolutely necessary to organize the home market if they wanted to develop the fishing industry.  The foreign markets were at present very bad.  He had with him reports <Col N="45" /> showing the decrease in the prices in Scotland, England and Wales.  Mackerel fishing was a failure this year.  America was threatening to put a high increase on the duty on imported mackerel&mdash;5½ dollars&mdash;or an increase of 3½ dollars on the present tax.  That would mean Ireland could not export cured mackerel to U.S.A.  However, Mr. F.P. Walsh was interesting himself in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPColivet" hpid="M.P. COLLIVET M.P. COLLIVET">
      <NameTxt>M.P. COLLIVET</NameTxt>
      <P>proposed the adoption of the report.  He would like to know if the Director took up the matter of transit direct with the railway companies.  He had no grievance if he did not make an attempt to remedy the trouble.  He suggested that big business firms, shareholders and large traffic-dealers should be approached to bring pressure on the railways to give improved transit facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHayes1919" hpid="SEÁN HAYES SEÁN HAYES">
      <NameTxt>SEÁN HAYES</NameTxt>
      <P>seconded the adoption of the report.  He noticed they got no information about those co-operative societies which had been financially assisted by the Dáil.  He would like to hear how they had progressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicOMaille" hpid="P. Ó MÁILLE P. Ó MÁILLE">
      <NameTxt>P. Ó MÁILLE</NameTxt>
      <P>said he would like to find out if their Government had sent any communication to the American government on the proposed increased tax to be imposed on mackerel.</P>

      <NameTxt>DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND COMMERCE, E. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>, replied that he had communicated and had been working on the matter for the past four months. Mr. F.P. Walsh had promised he would do his best in the matter when he returned home to the U.S.A.</P>

      <NameTxt>DEPUTY TOMÁS MAC DONNCHADHA (Tipperary)</NameTxt>
      <P>¹ said a lot of poor people put money into the Dangan Co-operative Society and they had heard nothing about it ever since.  They had lost all confidence in the Dáil.  They had built their own ice factory in Cahirciveen, but it was impossible to have any development in the industry without help from the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>DEPUTY S. O'MAHONY (Fermanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>suggested the Director would get the sanction of the Dáil to send three or four men abroad to Lowestoft or Yarmouth where they would get a perfect knowledge of grading fish.  Technical knowledge was absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>He would not agree with the Director that co-operative fishing would ever be a success.  His experience was that it was only individual enterprise that made fishing a success.</P>
      <P>They got no report from the various fishery societies established on the Irish coast.  He had heard nothing about the inquiry ordered into the affairs of the West Carbery Society.</P>
      <P>Railway transit was a serious matter, but no successful development would be carried out unless the organizers knew their work and did it well.  In America they would only handle certain well-known brands.  The home market would be unlimited if properly developed.  It was said Irish people did not eat fish.  The difficulty was it could not be secured.</P>

      <NameTxt>DEPUTY J.J. WALSH</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>DEPUTY L. DE RÓISTE (Cork City)</NameTxt>
      <P>said the question of branding in connection with the export of cured mackerel was only one side of the problem.  The question of marketing was perhaps of more importance. What happened during the war was that the Americans were willing to buy any sort of fish and there was no grading done.  The old method in operation was that the curers graded the fish according to size and catch and they sent the fish on consignment to buyers in America.  They received a certain advance as soon as the fish was shipped at Liverpool, but they never knew how much they would eventually get for their produce.  The buyers might have been honest men but his impression was that the buyer made the most profit out of the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> He suggested (1) that mackerel curers should get instructions on grading (2) that there should be a national brand and (3) that instead of sending the fish consigned it should be insisted upon that an outright sale was made.  It was also of importance that they should have a representative in America to take charge of their interests.  If such improvements were not made the export trade would be killed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMacBride" hpid="MR. JOS. MCBRIDE (Mayo) MR. JOS. MCBRIDE (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>MR. JOS. MCBRIDE (Mayo)</NameTxt>
      <P>thought the Ministry had been unjust with the railway companies.  He saw fish vans attached to the mail train with only one or two boxes in them and he was not surprised that the railway companies did not continue the service.  When he went home lately he met a man from Achill who told him the whole coast was full of French fishermen lifting up free fish.  The people round were calmly looking on while the foreigner caught the fish.  The Minister, he was afraid, would have to make the natives catch the fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanEtchingham" hpid="DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES Sean Etchingham">
      <NameTxt>DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES</NameTxt>
      <P>replied that the reason he suggested public boards should take the question of transit facilities up was that they had some influence at present with traders and shareholders.  He was glad to hear from the Deputy for Mayo (Mr. McBride) that fish vans were provided.  He knew lines where there was a refusal to do so.  With regard to the question as to the state of the societies, there was a dual report presented on the West Carbery Society and was discussed at the last meeting of the Dáil and disposed of.  He told Deputy Thos. Ó Donnchadha that he would supply him with the full figures for Dingle.  The whole peninsula was thoroughly organized; there was a building obtained for a curing house and sheds erected by voluntary labour. The commission of inquiry met at Dingle and went into the whole question and the result was they found it would take from £16,000 to £20,000 to work the industry there: that was the impediment.  That amount of money could not be put up at the time.  The local people could only find £1,000 and the Dáil could not provide the balance.  It would be a good investment if the fish came in but fish did not come when you wanted them and it might be a bad speculation.</P>
      <P>They knew about ice being wanted in Cahirciveen but that was a matter of finance.  With regard to W. Carbery, the district was a very good mackerel area and some of the best fishermen in the country were there but the society was started at the worst possible time.  No buyer he knew made money that season, in fact 2 or 3 of them went bankrupt.</P>
      <P>If the House desired it the bank would proceed against the society for the amount due, a matter of about £6,000.  They had given security on their boats.  He would not advocate doing so.  There was stock there estimated at £5,000 but it was not worth that sum.  The fishermen thought they could start again if conditions were normal, but there was no work proceeding there now.  The men were most anxious to develop the co-operative system.  Mr. O'Mahony objected to co-operation but it was a policy sanctioned by the Dáil.  They could not have a national brand unless the men were organised and they could not have them organised without having co-operation and the men linked up by co-operative societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOMahoney" hpid="MR. O'MAHONY MR. O'MAHONY">
      <NameTxt>MR. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>remarked in Norway there was no co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanEtchingham" hpid="DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES Sean Etchingham">
      <NameTxt>DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES</NameTxt>
      <P>continued and said he thoroughly agreed with Mr. O'Mahony that Norway was the place to send their men for training.  Fishing there was under state control and they had a grip of most of the foreign markets.</P>
      <P>The standard of Irish fish was the very lowest instead of being the highest.  The policy of societies was the only policy he would advocate and the only one they could work.  The matter of markets was only a temporary measure to meet the present position because they could not function openly and work societies.  The fishing industry was one of the most important they had and would require state aid.  They would want to put millions into it, and they were not able to do that. Then they did not get the best men.  It was necessary these organisers should have a knowledge of Irish: they had that, but they would want to know something about fish as well and boats.  They did their best and three of them had been dispensed with because work could not proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He agreed with Mr. O'Mahony that they should send men abroad for training but he disagreed with him as to co-operation.  If <Col N="47" /> Mr. O'Mahony could put forward any better scheme that would organise the men and give them the best return for their work he would consider it.</P>
    <P>The small estimate applied for this half-year was only to work the markets.  Re inland fisheries he had been trying to get the police to stop poaching.  Salmon fishing was a success this year because they had no fish in the English or Scottish rivers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="F. FAHY F. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>F. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>asked what was the nett loss suffered by the Dáil owing to the Department's activities in promoting these co-operative societies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanEtchingham" hpid="DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES Sean Etchingham">
      <NameTxt>DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES</NameTxt>
      <P>replied he would have the figures for the Dáil to-morrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="DEPUTY SPEAKER DEPUTY SPEAKER">
      <NameTxt>DEPUTY SPEAKER</NameTxt>
      <P>said before he put the report to the Dáil for adoption he would say one word with reference to an observation which dropped from the Minister of Fisheries.  He said it because he was afraid the remark might be interpreted that a qualification of Irish for an organiser of fisheries might seem to spell inefficiency.  When these appointments were being made 2 years ago all candidates were sent to him to see if they were qualified in Irish.  He was glad to say that at no time did he recommend a man who was not qualified in the duties required of him because he had Irish.  On one occasion two candidates, who were passed as qualified, were sent to him for examination re Irish.  They were both fully qualified in Irish but he recommended that he considered one of them unsuitable for the position and it turned out afterwards that that man was not successful, but he was taken on because of the great dearth of candidates.  He was afraid the Director of Fisheries unwittingly put his reference to the qualifications in Irish in such a way that it could be interpreted by the Dáil in this manner&mdash;a man having qualifications in Irish was more likely not to be the best man for the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanEtchingham" hpid="DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES Sean Etchingham">
      <NameTxt>DIRECTOR OF FISHERIES</NameTxt>
      <P>explained there was nothing further from his mind than to suggest such a thing.  He dared say he could not have got better men at the time.  He would be the very last man to sneer at the language.</P>

      <P>, said before the Dáil took the report from Agriculture he wanted to make a report to the Dáil upon the National Land Bank.  They noticed that a smoke screen had been drawn over the bank and he desired to clear it now for the members of the Dáil.  It had been referred to in the agricultural report as a &ldquo;Loan Fund&rdquo;.  The Dáil had never officially recognised the Land Bank and it was not the policy of the Ministry to officially recognised it at present.</P>
      <P>The National Land Bank was registered in December 1919, in accordance with a scheme carefully worked out by a committee acting under the direction of the Dáil to give effect to the Decree of June 18th, 1919,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the provision of land for the agricultural population now deprived thereof is decreed and a Loan Fund under the authority of the Dáil may be established to aid this purpose&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The first object in view was to facilitate the transfer of untenanted land to landless men and uneconomic holders and thus to prevent emigration and rural congestion.</P>
      <P>Under the Land Acquisition Scheme a sum of £203,000 was transferred by the Minister of Finance to the bank, and with this forty groups of what were once landless men and uneconomic holders have been organised [into] farming societies with joint and several liabilities for the loans advanced.</P>
      <P>The membership of these societies is approximately 850 and the area they own and occupy covers 15,750 acres.  For the purpose of this land the bank has advanced up to June the 30th last the sum of £316,590 and a further sum of approximately £27,000 (the exact amount is subject to adjustment on closing) will in due course be paid over to complete the negotiation already entered into in respect of six estates in which the legal formalities have not been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against these advances the bank holds cash security deposits lodged with it by the members of the 40 land societies amounting to eighty three thousand, eight hundred and thirteen pounds (£83,813) equal to 26.4% of the purchase price in addition to first mortgages on the whole of the land all of which was very <Col N="48" /> carefully valued before purchase was sanctioned.</P>
    <P>The amount of land dealt with is very small in comparison to the needs of the country and represents a fraction of the applications made to the bank, but it is sufficient to prove that the principle upon which the Land Acquisition Scheme is based meets the requirements of the people, is fundamentally sound and can be expanded to form the land settlement policy of the future.</P>
    <P>The farms purchased are distributed throughout the centre of Ireland from east to west in those districts where the greatest area of untenanted land remains.</P>
    <P>The societies are located as follows:&mdash;¹</P>
    <P>1. This list accounts for 35 societies, not 40 as mentioned in the statement.</P>

    <P>In practically all cases the purchasers are well satisfied and payments due to the bank are being punctually met.</P>
    <P>The bank and its land operations has worked harmoniously with the Land Commission courts and those who were concerned over the land agitation which sprang up in the Spring of 1920 will agree that the concerted efforts of the two authorities probably averted an outbreak of violence which might have had very serious national consequences.</P>
    <P>For the immediate future the land purchase operations of the bank, owing to the exhaustion of the funds allotted by the Dáil for its purpose, must necessarily be governed by the amount of money which the bank can in future obtain from its branches in the country.</P>
    <P>In addition to financing the Land Acquisition Scheme it was found desirable to attempt to establish a financial centre for Ireland which, while providing the usual banking facilities, would invest Irish capital in Irish enterprises instead of placing it at the disposal of the commercial interests of foreign countries.</P>
    <P>Steady and continuous progress is being made in the banking department as will be seen from the balance sheet of June 30th, 1921, now before you.</P>
    <P>Branches were opened at the beginning of the year in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Athlone, Ennis and Enniscorthy and a sub-office in Rush transacting business on one day in the week.</P>
    <P>The Directors, finding that the premises in Leeson Street were too small and inconveniently situated for the rapidly expanding business of the bank, decided to purchase a site for a new head office in Dame Street.  The structure purchased required alterations and additions.  Owing to building strikes and other causes these new premises will not be available for a few weeks.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of urging all members of the Dáil to secure that a large share of the country's capital at present deposited in these banks which are compelled to look to London for guidance in their financial and economic policy shall be transferred to your own bank, which is giving practical expression to the financial and economic policy of the national government and whose object is to encourage the growth of the population and the industries that shall support it.</P>

      <P>asked had the directors of the Land Bank considered the question of foreign exchanges at all. So far as trading with America was concerned the Bank of England was the bank that gave the best terms.  In the case of the other banks which operated, most of them worked through a branch in <Col N="49" /> London or some American bank in London and it was desirable they should have in this country some bank or institution that would represent an American bank in a sense and so cut away altogether from the hold which even yet some of the institutions in London had in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertChildersBarton" hpid="MR. BARTON MR. BARTON">
      <NameTxt>MR. BARTON</NameTxt>
      <P>replied that this matter had been considered and was at present under the consideration of the Minister of Finance and the directors of the bank.  He would like to state a few more details with regard to branches and the support the Land Bank had received.  The way the directors had been misled by some important personages in the districts where they wanted branches of the bank established was nothing less than scandalous.  When application was made an inspector would be sent down; he was impressed with the stories of the enormous sums of money waiting to be invested, deposits, private accounts and public accounts.  One branch had opened with all these prospects and after six months it had 25 current accounts.  But he would not have pity for the directors if they had not been misled by promises to be snowed under by money.  He was not talking so much about depositors but the current accounts he was finding fault with.  He thought it was due to the fact that the public men who wanted them to open failed to put in their own accounts.  This happened all over the country.  In Dublin he had to go round and do the tout himself.</P>
      <P>He had hoped and still hoped that the members of the Dáil would in future remember that they were bound both financially and patriotically to the bank and that they should endeavour to secure that a larger number of accounts would be transferred to this bank.</P>
      <P>The Deputy Minister would put the report and he wished here to pay tribute to the work done during his absence.  He apologised for his absence and at the same time he felicitated the Dáil for the Deputy who took his place, and he thought his own absence was a blessing to the Dáil, though in disguise to himself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidRiceKent" hpid="DEPUTY D. KENT DEPUTY D. KENT">
      <NameTxt>DEPUTY D. KENT</NameTxt>
      <P>seconded.  He said the report was a very valuable one and took some time to get over.  As far as he saw there was a lot of matter in it which would require legislation.  For instance, it might be advisable to pass in this session of the Dáil a Bill for the compulsory tillage of land to tide over the difficulties they would have to face in the coming year. They had also matters dealing with agricultural labour disputes and several other important phases in agriculture. Some people were advocating in many districts that by giving the labourer 4 or 5 acres of land and a cow it might settle the question of unemployment.  He did not believe that.  Any small quantity of land given to a labourer would not make him any better off than he was at present. They should give something substantial. If they found large estates on the market they would be worth buying and giving to those who had no land.  That would be one way out of it.</P>
      <P>If they decided to have compulsory tillage of land they should also set up a wages tribunal which would determine the wages of the labourer, not for one part of the year but for the whole year, because no farmer would till any great quantity of his land if he was afraid of being confronted with serious labour troubles.  He saw in his own districts one of the finest harvests left for 3 or 4 weeks to rot over strikes.  That should be avoided and they should get some machinery to deal with it. Instead of labourers and farmers coming together on the 25th March it should be at the 1st of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were three different classes of agriculturists in Ireland.  One class who held a quantity of land suitable for tillage.  Another who held some of the richest land in the country which was unsuited for tillage and which would be really a waste to till.  Some members he understood seemed to know very little about what quantity or quality of land should be put under cultivation.  Under the English Compulsory Tillage Act all parts of Ireland were equally subject to compulsory tillage, but they would find that on the rich lands of Limerick the crops <Col N="50" /> were not worth harvesting&mdash;and that in the richest lands in the world.  The third class of agriculturists were those who lived in the Liberties and their hours of work and rates of wages should be set in a different line than the other classes. Therefore in the formation of the Wages Tribunal Board he would suggest that labour appoint one man from the Liberties and one man from the country, that the farmers appoint one representative from the Liberties and one representative from the country, and that the Dáil itself should appoint an independent chairman.  This board could determine the hours of work, fair wages and land fit for tillage or not.</P>
    <P>These were subjects which required a great deal of attention.  He would give all the assistance he could if the Minister proposed to legislate.  To do it now would only be panicky as they had not the necessary time at their disposal.</P>

      <P>asked if labourers had acquired any lands under the scheme.  He knew that the Deputy for W. Wicklow (R. Barton) was anxious that the labourers should be provided for.  He was at a conference with the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Agriculture at which men from Liberty Hall attended but nothing came of it.  What they were urging was that the security of the union and the selection of the very best men was the best means for making land available for workers through the Land Bank Scheme.  He did not know how that scheme had developed.  He differed from the Deputy for W. [<i>recte</i> E.] Cork (D. Kent) when he said that labourers could not cultivate land.</P>

      <P>said he regretted that he misunderstood the Deputy for W. [<i>recte</i> E.] Cork. Agricultural industry depended upon good-fellowship between farmers and labourers and there should be some national policy that when the land was being tilled or the harvest reaped there could be no strikes. The agricultural labourer deserved to be uplifted.  He should live at least in frugal comfort.  He would like to get a reply as to whether any labourers had secured land under the Department scheme or would it be possible to get trade unions to give security for purchase and to select the best men.</P>

      <NameTxt>THE SUBSTITUTE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE, ART Ó CONCHUBHAIR</NameTxt>
      <P>, said he was afraid the same regrettable state of affairs was going to be manifest in the new Dáil as had been in the old&mdash;that they were not going to have any criticism or any suggestions for the improvement of their policy.  As he had found those of them who were compelled to sit upon high stools here in Dublin could not know the minds of the people in the country, they had to try and assimilate things as best they could, and the opinions they had to act upon might not be very correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy for West [<i>recte East</i>] Cork said there are two or three points in agriculture in Ireland at the moment which <Col N="51" /> would take a couple of days discussion in this Assembly.  One was the question of unemployment and another the question of tillage both of which were so closely co-related that they could not be discussed apart.</P>
    <P>In order to be able to guide this Assembly in the matter of food he had prepared a sort of tabulated return of the state of food in the country.  He got in contact with the best informed people in the counties and to the best of his ability he had made an advanced report of what the food situation was likely to be and, let him be believed, if the war was resumed the food question would be an important one.  If there was going to be peace he would say they would be all right.  He would state in a few words the food position and the quantity of land tilled.</P>
    <P>Of wheat there was a probable production of 40,000 tons.  The normal production was 60,000 tons, while the total consumption was 700,000 tons; so they would be absolutely depending on imports for over 600,000 tons.  Merely to take the one question of wheat the position was very serious. Potatoes would not be so bad.  Oats were down considerably; but in regard to oats and potatoes they would have to take immediate steps to prevent over-export if there was going to be war.  A great quantity of oats was exported every year and also a great quantity of potatoes and in addition the major portion of both oats and potatoes was fed to animals.  If they were going to be driven into the position of an economic blockade and left to stew in their own juice they would want to take steps to protect what supply they had. That was why they would like Deputies to give serious attention to the tillage question. There were 100,000 men idle at the present moment in various parts of the country and these should not be flung into the cities if work could be provided for them in the country.  Some people deceive themselves about the morality of interfering with land in private ownership.  The nation had the first right to the land and it was his luck to fall across an unique document that was written in 1914 when England was being threatened with the same position as they were threatened now. Its author was the Bishop of Ross and he could not do better than re-quote a passage&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Campbell suggested more than once that it was the duty of the occupier of the land to produce food, and to till the land.  Now, on that point, you will pardon me for a short half-theological, half-legal disquisition.  The word ownership has a very vague meaning in the minds of most men.  Ownership is of a great many kinds.  It may be absolute and complete, as ownership in something that you make with your own hands, and which you are at liberty to use or to destroy just as you please.  That is absolute ownership.  But most ownership is limited by conditions, and you are not free to destroy or abuse; you are bound to use.  There are certain things in which there may be no ownership; there are other things in which there may only be a very modified ownership.  It is quite clear that we cannot get ownership in the air we breathe or in the sunshine. When we come to the question of land, clearly there can be no absolute ownership in land.  A man is not free to use or abuse his land, he is bound to use it.  He may not destroy his land for that land was given by God for the subsistence of the people of the nation.  That does not mean that every individual is to have a piece of this land; that system would not work.  But it means that those who occupy the land are bound to use that land, in the first place for their own benefit, and in the next place for the benefit of the nation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact remained that the great proportion of the land was not being used for the benefit of the nation.</P>
    <P>He might say he was not in favour of compulsion.  He saw the difficulties and he would prefer some other method of bringing the farmers to a proper appreciation of their duties and responsibilities, but he would say if it was found necessary for the sake of their people to bring forward a measure of compulsion he would support it.  They could reach a straining point and he thought they were gradually reaching it.  He did not think it necessary to go any deeper into this matter as he was merely elaborating upon some points in his report.  He would be glad if every Teachta would think seriously upon the questions of tillage and unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy for East Cork (D. Kent) had made reference to some types of land suitable and unsuitable for tillage.  He was convinced from his experience of some of <Col N="52" /> the best land in Ireland that the amount of land in N. Kildare or Meath that would not benefit by tillage was actually not worth talking about.  The only reason why that land was not being tilled was that it was able to produce a certain amount of beef. That was a wrong policy for them to rely upon.  Ireland's consideration should be their first consideration.  Land produced less beef per acre than any other kind of food.  In his opinion the bulk of Ireland was of such a nature that it could be improved by a touch of the plough and could be made to produce more food.  He was in thorough agreement with the Deputy for E. Cork (D. Kent) when he said that labour agreements should be made to cover a long period.  Great permanent damage could be done to a harvest by even a 48 hours strike and it was absolutely essential that both farmers and workers should recognise the point that the agreements should be made to last over a period when the crop might be lost.  That was the difficulty.  The men's leaders would say not to take away their best weapon, that they must strike when they could hit hardest.  The farmer would say the same thing.  He was in thorough agreement with the Deputy who said the farmer and the worker must be brought to see that they were absolutely as necessary for one another as the handle of the shovel was for the head.</P>
    <P>It was useless for anyone here in the city to try and set up a standard that would apply to the whole country.  The various members could help by trying to get the conciliation boards which were set up by the Department of Labour to consider various conditions of agricultural labour on the farms.</P>
    <P>Another point which had been causing a lot of uneasiness and trouble was the question of tree-cutting.  There was hardly a day that he had not an application from someone who had bought a wood and was prevented from cutting it by the &ldquo;hardhearted&rdquo; Volunteers.  There were two or three points involved and he had tried to indicate them as briefly as possible in his report.  He might say that while the war was on the only authority that could say whether a wood could be cut or not was the competent military authority of the district.  For peace conditions the Dáil should formulate some policy in advance. It was not fair to let a timber merchant make a contract with some firm in England say in which he had got to supply beech for spindles and when he went to cut down the woods he had bought the local people prevented him.  If the Dáil made its policy in advance then the merchant went into business with his eyes open.  He would be thankful if the Deputies who took an interest in forestry would forward suggestions to Mr. Barton or himself on these points so that if necessary legislation could be passed before the Dáil adjourned.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed.</P>
    <P>House adjourned until 3.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>Dáil reassembled at 3.50 p.m.</P>

      <P>, said he was in charge of the Department since last February when Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald was arrested.</P>
      <P>There was frequent application for the &ldquo;Irish Bulletin&rdquo; but they had to make it understood that the circulation was very small owing to the difficulty of production and the risks.  It was mainly designed for circulation outside Ireland to influence opinion in England, America and other foreign countries.  It was very difficult to get as wide a circulation for it inside Ireland as they should like to.</P>
      <P>The only other point he would like to refer to was the close connection between his Department and the Foreign Affairs Department.  The &ldquo;Irish Bulletin&rdquo; was sent to all their representatives abroad who supplied foreign journals or had smaller editions reproduced in connection with propaganda.</P>
      <P>He also wished to say that he hoped that the existing difficulty was appreciated, that of fighting against control of the cables and thereby of the immediate news of all events in Ireland, which they did not possess and which was possessed by the enemy.  They could not provide immediate daily news of what was going on.  That went abroad from the enemy in a way that was hard to correct.  To judge fairly of the work done by the Publicity Department it was necessary to bear that fundamental difference in mind.</P>

      <P>said he had pleasure in proposing adoption of <Col N="53" /> report.  He thought it was due to the Publicity Department to have a voice from abroad pay tribute to it.  Those who were abroad knew better than any of the Deputies the great difficulties the Department had to contend with.  The &ldquo;Irish Bulletin&rdquo; started as a matter of no importance and the English Press tried to make it a matter of no importance by boycotting it, but it had dealt so fairly and truthfully with the matters in review that to-day even the enemy papers quoted it readily.  It was of course mainly due to the &ldquo;Irish Bulletin&rdquo; that foreign opinion to-day did not accept agency telegrams as being gospel.  As the Director had stated the main difficulty in getting facts known abroad lay in the existence of the octopus of the big foreign agency called by different names but all run by big Jew firms in London which had complete control of the first news wires in respect to Irish affairs as they appeared on the continent.  He had been given to understand that by no means was it possible to tap those poisonous wires at the source. That was one place where the enemy was in a point of vantage where they could not dislodge him.  To give them one example of the difficulties the Publicity Department had to deal with, when the jury brought in their verdict after the murder of Lord Mayor MacCurtain the principal paper in Denmark purported to give the result of the inquest as follows:&mdash;that a sworn jury of Irishmen have gone into the case and they unanimously agreed that Lord Mayor MacCurtain was murdered by a section of extremists who were also sworn to murder Lloyd George and other leading British statesmen.  That result appeared in the leading papers in Denmark and that was the kind of thing they had to fight.  A good deal of it was malicious and a good deal was put in rather against the grain by men who received subsidies from British sources.</P>
      <P>He would like more of their work should be done in London.  He thought it should be possible to obtain within an hour of despatch a copy of the principal cables sent abroad; it was a very small ring of cables that mattered.  If the Director had that in hands at once he would be in a better position to know what was the very lie he had got to contradict.  He thought if that line could be further probed it would be an improvement to the service.  He had great pleasure in proposing the adoption of the report and he thought it was one of the best Departments that they had and the Directors deserved the highest praise.</P>

The Deputies who were released from Ballykinlar had prepared a statement for publicity and furnished it to the Department which had not yet appeared.  That was unfortunate because their fellow-prisoners whom they had left behind would think they had forgotten all about them.  The camp conditions required very severe comment as the conditions were anything but satisfactory.  The food was atrocious, the water supply most inadequate and that defect could not be rectified.

      <P>, said he wished to thank the member for S. Dublin (Gavan Duffy) for the tribute he paid to the work of the Department, which was greatly assisted by their representatives abroad.</P>
      <P>He would like to say that every day for the past two years these cables had been going round the world but notwithstanding this their position in the world was steadily improving.  They had met that difficulty in every possible way.  He had used every possible channel and judging by the results these other channels were not as ineffective as one would think.</P>
      <P>Last year he proposed starting a bureau in London but certain difficulties cropped up.</P>
      <P>He complained of the difficulty of getting news from parts of Ireland.  He circularised all the Teachtaí and members of the public boards for information as to arrests, etc. He only got two replies.</P>
      <P>The Ballykinlar men did certainly make a report and that report was in to-day's &ldquo;Bulletin&rdquo;.  If the Teachtaí would send in their prepared reports to him with a minimum delay he might possibly be able to do something.  Another thing more important is the correctness of statements.  For instance one man stated that the huts in Rath Camp were made for 25 men but they have printed on them &ldquo;Capacity 30 men&rdquo;.  Any information should be correct and should stand investigation afterwards. Information was no good unless detailed and accurate.</P>

      <P>said they had found this proposal necessary from experience.  The point about &ldquo;President of the Republic&rdquo; was very important.  Though the office had been accepted it had never been constitutionally created.  As a matter of fact the <Col N="55" /> President was President not of the Republic but of the Ministry of Dáil Eireann.  He was not talking so much to that point as to the question of the Cabinet.  The old Cabinet representing 11 Departments was altogether too large.  He believed even in peace times work could be best done by an executive body of small numbers.  He was anxious to secure an executive called a Cabinet consisting of the President and six Secretaries of State, those four that are mentioned on the paper, and two others, Local Government and a Secretary responsible for Economic Affairs whose work would be to combine Agriculture, Trade, Fisheries and Labour Departments and be answerable to the Cabinet for their responsibilities.  They would need outside that executive separate heads for Agriculture, Publicity, Trade and so on, who would be extra-Cabinet Ministers.</P>

      <P>said he wished to enter a protest against the dual position of the President under this change: he would be President of the Republic and Prime Minister as well.  No member of the Dáil pretended he was elected to elect a President of the Republic.  It was a dangerous precedent to establish that your President of the Republic should also be President of the Ministry and one it might be very hard to change.  He suggested to the mover of the motion he would attain his object by leaving things as they were. The making of this alteration would probably advertise the fact that they had a President of the Republic when they had not.  He asked the Minister for Defence to withdraw so much of his motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>said he was fully alive to the point that this was the original Constitution of this body and therefore bringing in a question which affected the constitution of the country.  Why the matter came up now was that the title had been referred to when formal documents had to be signed; when he had to state when and where and how he was made President he found that no such officer had been created. If they could turn it round stating &ldquo;the President who was, until a Constitution be brought up, to act as President of the Republic.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>said he did not think that necessary at all.  Under present conditions they were all one body here.  When the Republic was recognised they certainly would have two bodies in the Dáil.  That being so and seeing that they were supposed to have a President and according to this thing which passed as a Constitution but in reality was not a Constitution they had not a President, he was merely trying to improve this Constitution. When the Republic was recognised they would draw up a regular Constitution.  From what he saw under the powers given to them they were entitled to elect a President.</P>

There was no time for the necessary consideration to be given to it.  The fact that the Minister for Defence was trying to rectify an error in it was to his credit.  The Constitution was only provisional and this proposed amendment was also only provisional and would not constitute a precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>THE PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>
      <P>The next items on the agenda are the election of President and the formation of a new Ministry.  Now we were anxious to have those elections in public rather than in private and I think on the whole it was better it should be so. The nominees could be consulted in advance.  The advantage lies now in publicity and I think we should leave to the public session the work of election.  I therefore take this opportunity of making a statement to the Dáil which I could not make in public.  I believe that it is likely that I would again be nominated for Presidency at the public session on Friday. I have explained to you definitely my position which is always this that I have one allegiance only to the people of Ireland and that is to do the best we can for the people of Ireland as we conceive it.  If you propose me I want you all to understand that you propose me understanding that that will be my attitude; that any questions that we have to discuss that I will discuss them from the point of view absolutely of what I consider the people of Ireland want and what I consider is best from their point of view.</P>
      <P>I would take office therefore only on that understanding to bring our proposal before you constitutionally and as one who was ready to stand on a principle of the Cabinet on the policy brought forward and to fall on it also.</P>
      <P>I would not like therefore that anyone should propose me for election as President who would think I had my mind definitely made up on any situation that may arise.  I keep myself free to consider each question as it arises.  I never bind myself in any other way.  I do not think it possible for anyone to do so if in advance he binds himself to one point of view.  I therefore want you to know that, as I think this is the proper place to say it to you.  In office up to the present I have done my best on that understanding and it is on that understanding I will continue.</P>
      <P>The only thing that would be possible then, if you would wish in any way to discuss the matter I have raised I am willing that it should be discussed.  But if you have no desire to go any further in the matter, and the question of election in private, I think it would be better to have it in public.  Of course if the President is elected in public it is right he should nominate the Ministers in public and that they should be ratified in public.</P>
      <P>The only other business is the Ministerial motions.  So the only thing, if you don't wish to pursue the matter I have raised in connection with motion for election of President, I would propose the adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>THE MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS</NameTxt>
      <P>said he would like to draw attention to the fact that he intended to bring in two important motions.  One in connection with the decentralization proposal made a few days ago.  It would not exactly be a ministerial proposal but it would be from the sub-committee of the whole House.  There could be a general discussion on it and they could see if it could be improved.</P>
      <P>The second motion was more or less in the nature of a Defence of the Realm Act and it would be for the House to decide whether it would be necessary or not.  He thought it well to give the House notice of these.  They could not be discussed before Thursday and the draft proposals would be in their hand to-morrow if they called here at 3.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>said in view of the President's statement and in view of the statements made here yesterday he should confess it seemed something like a bombshell to the members from the North.  He thought it desirable that the House should have an opportunity of presenting its views to the Ministry upon the situation and its obligations.  They all realised the extremely difficult position, but he was perfectly certain it was desirable they should know how they stood as members of the Dáil.  It would be better to have as frank and as free a discussion as they could upon the general situation at a very early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="THE PRESIDENT THE PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>THE PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know it would serve any particular good purpose. Everybody understands the situation.  It is a question of what recommendations we would have to make to this House as Ministers.  Of course it is possible we may have to make no recommendations but the one.  But what I want to be understood in my own regard was that I shall act as <Col N="58" /> President simply as the head of a government of any country would act.</P>
      <P>That I would act as head of an established government would act and that I can act in no other way.  I cannot accept the responsibilities of the office if it is not understood that I can act as the head of any government in any country would act.  Those who have the fortunes of the country in their hands for the moment have taken certain obligations on themselves to look after the public interests to the best of their ability.  If their view at any particular moment does not commend itself to the House they are turned out of office and a new Ministry appointed.  You can do that without going to the country. You are fortunate in that respect.  You can put in another Ministry who would take responsibility for the obligations you want to put on them.  You will have to have a Ministry that fully believes absolutely that the policy which it commends is the policy which it thinks best for the nation it represents.  It is impossible to fulfil duty properly if they were not themselves fully convinced that the line of action they were taking is the best line of action.  That will be and must be.</P>
      <P>In other words I am no longer to be looked on as a party leader.  I am representing the nation and I shall represent the whole nation if I am elected to office and I shall not be bound by any section whatever of the nation.  I shall act for the best interests of the nation and our proposals will be properly put before you.  You will have your right to turn down these proposals if they do not suit you and to put in another Ministry to carry out your obligations.</P>
      <P>I am only doing that in case the present moment brings up anything of the kind. But I am doing it because I think it is right and I want to look into the future as far as I can.  I am not looking into the immediate future, but the future may develop things and it may be necessary for us as the government of the country to make proposals which may not possibly commend themselves to the whole House. In critical times a position may arise in which we may not be unanimous and I want it understood if this House devolves the position of President on me my attitude will be that of the head of any government in a country who will have to do the best for the country.</P>

      <P>pointed out that any division at present would be disastrous to the country.  The President said in the event of negotiations materialising and in the event of certain proposals put forward by his Cabinet he said this House could turn out the Ministry.</P>
      <P>He feared in the present situation such an action would be capable of grave misrepresentation. He asked the President today to give him an opportunity of mentioning one matter which was agitating the minds of some of the members. Ordinary members like himself were entitled to form their own opinions, and on that point he always felt satisfied he was here to express his opinions.</P>
      <P>He asked the President did he understand him to say yesterday that in the event of peace negotiations that he (the President), and he supposed he was talking for the collective opinion of the Cabinet, is prepared to consider such a proposal as would amount to a voting out of any county or part of a province of this country from the free state.  There were diverse opinions regarding the interpretation of the President's answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="THE PRESIDENT THE PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>THE PRESIDENT:</NameTxt>
      <P>What I should like to answer to all such questions is this, that I do not feel myself bound not to consider anything.  I feel myself open to consider everything that comes the way and it is that I do not want to be fettered in any way and I will not accept this office if you fetter me in any way whatever.  Further than that I will not consider anything.  I will take the situation as anyone who is appointed to do&mdash;see what is the best and then come to you with the best recommendations we can make.</P>
      <P>Now I know quite well what an awkward thing it would be to turn out a Ministry at such a time.  I realise that, but there is no other way in which we can handle the situation.  Some of us are quite ready to be sacrificed if this has to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept office except on the understanding that no road is barred, that we shall be free to consider every method. For example, the question of voting out of counties or provinces.  That would be a way, if that came up, a way in which a certain result could be obtained.  I would be ready to consider that.  We should be able to give our reasons.  If we are not able to stand on these proposals by the reasons we give, then turn us out.  But we must be <Col N="59" /> free to consider and above suspicion to deal with every situation that arises.</P>
    <P>Now as regards plenipotentiaries if Lloyd George's reply is not going to mean a termination of the Truce, and that they say we are ready to meet you, I will ask you to appoint plenipotentiaries for negotiating peace.</P>
    <P>I prefer to say this in private&mdash;I do not want and will not be a member of the particular body that would negotiate peace.  I do not [want] to be one of the plenipotentiaries.  The one chief reason I had in going myself to these preliminary negotiations I saw it gave me a definite opportunity to bring Ireland's case before the world.</P>
    <P>I can stay at home where I will be more valuable and it will be quite evident to the public the reason I do not want to be one of them is that the duties at home require my attention.  If negotiations take place and if I can have my way in that respect, it will be that others, members of this House, would be the body who would be deputed by this House to negotiate peace. That is the position before you, that you will have plenipotentiaries appointed and they would go as plenipotentiaries on the basis of a certain principle to negotiate peace.  They would come back, be in touch with the Cabinet and their proposals would be brought before this House finally.  The Minister [<i>recte</i> Ministry] then would have a policy and the Ministry would take a definite attitude before the House in respect to them.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that whenever there are negotiations, unless you are able to dictate terms you will have differences.  Therefore it is obvious you will have sharp differences. The policy of the Ministry will be that which they consider would be best for the country.  The Ministry itself may not be able to agree and in such a case the majority would rule.  Those who would disagree with me would resign.  But I am looking at the worst possible thing that could happen, that if the plenipotentiaries go to negotiate a treaty or a peace, seeing that we are not in the position that we can dictate the terms, we will, therefore, have proposals brought back which cannot satisfy everybody, and will not, and my position is that when such a time comes I will be in a position, having discussed the matter with the Cabinet, to come forward with such proposals as we think wise and right.  It will be then for you either to accept the recommendations of the Ministry or reject them. If you reject them you then elect a new Ministry.  You would then be creating a definite active opposition.</P>
    <P>I anticipate there will be differences of opinion in that case and I anticipate there is a possibility of non-agreement.  Therefore I want you to understand I have not my mind made up as to anything.  I have kept my mind in a fluid state as long as I am in a responsible position to the country and it is only on that basis that I can accept office.</P>
    <P>I propose now we adjourn till Thursday. The Ministry have a certain amount of work to do.  We will have to finish all the private matter on Thursday.</P>

      <P>said it should meet to-morrow and make arrangements for the public session on Friday.  Before the House adjourned he said he would like to explain that the statements he had to make like this created a lot of misgivings, but he was simply taking ordinary precautions and he wanted to indicate that in voting for him they were voting for a person who is going to act as the head of a government fully established and fully recognised would act and in no sense whatever as a party leader.</P>
      <P>Motion for adjournment till Thursday at 11 a.m. then put and carried.</P>
