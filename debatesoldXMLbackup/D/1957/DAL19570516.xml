      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>During the recent election, one of the most notable statements made repeatedly by Fianna Fáil spokesmen was that they had a plan to beat the crisis.  This was repeated from many platforms in many parts of the country.  The electorate were led to believe that if Fianna Fáil were returned, some proposals would be introduced which would not only solve the crisis but lead to an expansion in trade and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> Since this Government was elected, many speeches have been made by Ministers referring to the need for greater production.  The need for greater production has been emphasised on numerous occasions by different Governments, but the present Government appear to labour under the illusion that, provided they talk sufficiently often about the need for increased production, that, in itself, will act as a solution to the problem and will act as a sufficient incentive.  We have to recognise that talk is no substitute for an incentive or for a policy that will produce results.</P>
    <P>It has become fashionable to speak in disparaging terms to the effect that agricultural production has not increased sufficiently.  In fact, some people go so far as to say that any increase that has occurred has been negligible and that the position is static.  It is well for a moment to reflect on what has been accomplished. It is no harm to examine briefly the position as it existed in 1948 and the expansion in agricultural production that has taken place since.</P>
    <P>In 1948, prior to the introduction of the land reclamation scheme, prior to the negotiation of the trade agreement with Britain in that year, the position in this country was that the total value of agricultural exports amounted to about £23,000,000 and that in that year, and for some years previously, butter was rationed.  Deputies will remember that at one period in that year and in the previous year the ration was as low as two ounces per head per week.  The total income derived from our agricultural surplus amounted to £23,000,000.  Since then, a very dramatic change has taken place.  The numbers of live stock at that time were the lowest since statistics were first recorded.  As a result of measures taken by the Government of that time, the calf mortality rate has been reduced considerably from an average annual death rate of 80,000 to something over 10,000.  That substantial improvement was effected by better veterinary services and better application of modern veterinary science to diseases affecting young calves such as fluke, white scour, and <Col N="1413" /> so on.  The results of that improvement were to make available for export a substantial average annual increase in the number of calves reared and brought to maturity.</P>
    <P>It does not require much examination to see what an improvement that has made.  The export figures for last year&mdash;which were not quite as high as those for the previous year&mdash;and particularly the trade figures for the first three months of this year indicate that the policy that was put into operation achieved considerable success.  Not alone did we have the largest exportable surplus of cattle probably in our history but, in addition, we had a record production of milk and butter. When we talk of increased production and increased efficiency remember that there is no advantage in producing something which we cannot sell.  After we supply the home market, the only place where we can sell our exportable surplus is abroad, wherever we can get a market for it.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate, I listened to Deputies on the Government Benches claim that what they have done in the alteration of the levies in respect of motor cars, and so forth, will provide increased employment. No one disputes that it may give some improvement to the motor assembly trade but does any Deputy opposite believe that we in this country can provide a permanent exportable surplus of motor cars?  We are selling secondhand cars to limited markets and maybe occasionally new ones but, by and large, it is obvious that we cannot develop a permanent trade that will prove of any serious value to the community in the export of cars.</P>
    <P>What is the effect of this Budget on one exportable commodity which we have?  The abolition of the butter subsidy must have serious repercussions on the dairying industry.  We now have an exportable surplus of butter.  We have the largest output of milk since statistics were first compiled. In recent years we have been eating more butter than ever before but, after we supply the home demand, we have to sell our surplus some place and, unless we can export it, the inevitable <Col N="1414" /> result of the proposals in the Budget will mean that farmers will go into some other line of production.</P>
    <P>Similarly, this year, we have more than enough wheat from home sources. I do not think the most ardent advocate of the &ldquo;grow more wheat&rdquo; policy would expect us in present world conditions to sell wheat abroad.  The Minister for Finance said that not alone have we a carry over from last year's production into this cereal year but that if we did not sell what he described as the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; wheat for animal feeding stuffs we would have a carry over into the next cereal year not alone from this year but from the 1956 harvest.  That position has been reached at a time when the United States has a two-year surplus supply of wheat.  There is also a large surplus in Canada.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that we cannot sell abroad any surplus supplies of wheat which we may have.  We are left, therefore, in the main with live stock and live-stock products.  The figures of trade returns published recently indicate that for the last three quarters of last year and for the first quarter of this year we were exporting increased numbers of cattle.  Probably the most significant feature of last year's return was that our shipments to countries other than Britain and the Six Counties rose substantially.  They rose from a value of £5.5 million in 1955 to £11.2 million in 1956, primarily due to increased shipments of cattle to France, The Netherlands, Germany, and other continental countries.  The numbers of cattle shipped to countries other than Britain or the Six Counties increased from 8,710 head in 1951 to 68,196 head in 1956&mdash;and that compares with average annual shipments of 21,900 head in the five years 1951 to 1955.  These figures are on page 12 of the Trade Statistics for the year ended December, 1956.  That shows what was accomplished not alone in the expansion in the numbers of live stock available for export but in the successful negotiation of trade agreements with those continental countries.  Last year, for the first time, we secured a substantial foothold in the continental market.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for Ministers to <Col N="1415" /> lecture the farmers about increased production without indicating where the commodities which the farmers will produce can or are likely to be sold.  One of the permanent features of economics is that, once a policy is put in motion, it takes some time to change it or that if a set of circumstances develops and it is in the wrong direction it may take time to arrest it.  The policy of the inter-Party Government substantially increased agricultural production.  It may be&mdash;and we freely acknowledge it&mdash;that it is not sufficient but there is not the slightest use in this country's producing a surplus of a commodity if, after providing for the home market, we cannot export the surplus.</P>
    <P>This Budget places an increasing burden on the farming community as well as on urban dwellers.  If we are to sell butter, milk or milk products profitably abroad, we must facilitate the farmers to produce at the lowest possible cost.  The imposts on petrol and diesel oil must affect in so far as they affect the cost of transport and the cost of distribution&mdash;which is an element in the cost of production&mdash;the cost and the price at which the farmer will be enabled to sell his commodities.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious from recent trade figures and from the quantity of butter and milk and wheat produced that, unless we can walk these commodities off the land in the form of live stock, we shall not be able to sell abroad at a profit, and in so far as this Budget will increase the cost of production of these commodities, it will affect the cost at which the farmer will be enabled to sell these products at a profit.  The result of the measures that were taken, the achievements of the policy that was put into operation, have been quite considerable.  In 1947, the net output of agriculture was £99.3 million; in 1955 it had increased to £111.8 million.  I have listened here to Ministers decrying the fact that we had not increased production to a greater extent, that we had not expanded output from the land.  Comparing the position as it was prior to the introduction of the land reclamation scheme, prior to the negotiation of a number of trade agreements, and in particular <Col N="1416" /> the agreement of 1948, that was the position.  We had butter rationed; we had a heavy death rate in the number of calves each year.  An equivalent number of calves has since been made available for export.  We had a position in which, with the exception of live stock, we had no exportable surplus of any commodity.</P>
    <P>Since the initiation of the land reclamation scheme, we have succeeded, not alone in expanding substantially our exports of cattle, but we have been able to secure for the first time since before the war an exportable surplus of butter.  I do not know what effect the decision to abolish the butter subsidy will have on butter production.  It is certain it will have a dramatic effect on the work of the Milk Costings Commission.  It is obvious, and I believe an understatement to say, that not alone is there no hope of any increase in the price of milk paid by the creameries, but the difficulty will be to keep the price at the existing level.  That is a very different situation from the picture painted by Deputies opposite when they pressed the previous Government to furnish the Report of the Milk Costings Commission.  I do not think anybody would hazard a guess at the value of the report at the present time. The abolition of the butter subsidy must have a serious effect on the possibility of exporting either milk or milk products at a profit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M. P. Murphy Mr. M. P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Milk Costings Commission Report will not be needed at all now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it will not be needed.  Wheat is in the same position as butter.  We have had in recent years&mdash;and it is obvious on the present price that we will have this year again&mdash;sufficient wheat to meet our own requirements, and not alone sufficient to meet our own requirements, but if we have anything like a reasonable year the grist will have to be again on such a basis that the quantity of imported wheat will be either one-third or less of the total grist.  That, in itself, is an embarrassment to any Minister for Finance because he may be faced with the problem which the <Col N="1417" /> Minister has this year of providing money from the Exchequer for the conversion of the unmillable wheat into animal feeding stuffs.</P>
      <P>We initiated last year a policy which provided a guaranteed price for feeding barley because we believed that if we were to export either pigs or bacon, we had to produce adequate supplies of feeding stuffs at home, and we had to produce a sufficient quantity of these commodities to enable us to export bacon and pork produced from homegrown feeding stuffs.  The measures taken by the previous Government succeeded in increasing substantially the acreage of feeding barley, but has the position been reached in which, when we have a surplus of butter, a surplus of milk and a surplus of wheat, the only effect is that it causes embarrassment to the Minister for Finance and to the Exchequer?</P>
      <P>Every hundredweight of butter we export at the present time involves a charge on the Exchequer, a substantial subsidy, and the position has now been reached in which the cost of an exportable surplus of butter must be borne&mdash; or some portion of the cost&mdash;by the Exchequer.  In the same way the position has been reached in which, because we have such a large yield of home-grown wheat, it is an embarrassment to the Minister for Finance and to the Exchequer.  That poses this question: if we are to export, is it not obvious that we must export where we can get a market, not merely where we can compete on equal terms or on favourable terms with our competitors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was once fashionable for Fianna Fáil to decry the value of our live-stock trade.  I listened here yesterday to Deputies on the opposite benches expressing satisfaction at the abolition of the levies on car parts, because it meant some increased employment in the industries.  We are all glad to see an improvement in that regard, but in so far as this country is concerned, the only thing of any substantial value, the only commodities that we have that can make a substantial contribution either to our whole balance of trade or to the maintenance of our economy, is an exportable surplus of agricultural goods, either live stock or these other <Col N="1418" /> commodities to which I have referred. The significant fact is that, with the exception of cattle and bacon and whatever butter we export abroad&mdash;but there again the value of it is impaired by the fact that it has to be subsidised by the Exchequer&mdash;we have nothing to export.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember&mdash;I think it was in the 1954 Report of the Central Bank&mdash;the phrase about the bullock again saving the day for the Irish economy.  It is obvious from recent trade figures that this year we shall have to look again to the value of our live-stock exports for any worthwhile contribution to balancing our trade and to providing the wherewithal to purchase the goods we need.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was announcing his Budget proposals he referred to the fact that steps were being taken to make the maximum economies possible and one announcement, in addition to others, which he made was that it was proposed to start with administration. There is general acceptance of the views expressed that there is some scope for a reduction in administrative costs and there is general acceptance of the view that the administrative machine has grown too large.  Here again it is well to reflect that it was under Fianna Fáil that this great increase took place.</P>
    <P>I have round figures here given in reply to a question answered this week. In 1932, there were 21,700 civil servants; in 1939 that had grown to 24,000; in 1949, it had grown to 29,100; in 1952, it was 31,600 and this year it is 31,600.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there has been a substantial growth in the cost of the administrative <Col N="1419" /> machine but the bulk of that growth took place during Fianna Fáil's term of office.</P>
      <P>I listen here with interest to Fianna Fáil Deputies who say that they have a plan and a policy to beat the crisis. It is not as though this crisis arose only last year.  We recognised that last year was a particularly difficult year, that measures had to be taken which could not be expected to increase the popularity of the Government, measures which we recognised at the time would not be popular, measures which would effect an improvement in the position of our economy and which did substantially effect an improvement but which inevitably caused some difficulties, possibly some hardship, to certain sections.  When Deputies refer to the fact that those measures did cause either disabilities or hardships to any section of the community, let them remember that the proposals enshrined in this Budget will cause not only difficulties but hardships.</P>
      <P>In framing our proposals we endeavoured to see that the steps taken impacted where the influence would be felt least and that the burdens imposed would affect those best able to bear them.  The feature of this Budget is that it affects equally those better able to bear it and those least able to bear it.</P>
      <P>When the decision was taken to remove the food subsidies it was taken on the basis of the recommendation in the Capital Investment Advisory Committee's Report but it is well to remember what was recommended in that report.  On page 7, the committee said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The subsidy on flour and wheatenmeal, the estimated cost of which in the current financial year is £6.4 million, should be abolished. This is not a proposal for the relief of the Exchequer.  Its aim is to maintain the capital programme at a higher level than would otherwise be possible.  We believe that recognition of this fact might go some way towards making the proposal generally acceptable to the community.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> What has happened in this Budget? The subsidy has been abolished, not for capital purposes, but for the relief of the Exchequer and the effect is that the cost of production, because the cost of distribution will be increased, will be raised on producers, manufacturers, farmers and business people and the burden will be borne by all alike and will be borne equally by those least able to bear it.</P>
    <P>Last year, when the previous Government introduced a proposal to increase the value of the weekly allowance to social assistance recipients, for an unemployed man who was married and had one child, the increase was 11/&ndash; a week.  At that time the then Opposition said that they were glad that that had been done but that it was not sufficient.  That was 11/&ndash; a week.  The only increased burden that had to be borne at that time was an increase in respect of petrol and cigarettes and that was described as being sufficient to warrant an increase in wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>This year, the only recompense for a substantial increase in the price of bread and in the price of butter is 1/&ndash; a week.  I do not think that those who supported that proposal recognised that, not alone was the 5d. per lb. subsidy that had been provided by the previous Government in order to reduce the price of butter from 4/2 to 3/9 being abolished, but that, in addition, the production subsidy that was being paid to creameries was being abolished.</P>
    <P>The moment the price increased there was some surprise expressed that butter was selling, not at 4/2 but at 4/4, but it is quite obvious now that, not alone is the 5d. a lb. that had been provided in respect of the subsidy of £2,000,000 a year which was made available from the autumn of 1954 being abolished but that, in addition, the consumer is obliged to bear the production subsidy of approximately 2d. a lb. and that, in fact, the increase in the price of butter has not been the anticipated 5d. but has been 7d.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of bread, the increase has been greater than was anticipated and greater than was forecast <Col N="1421" /> by the Flour and Bread Committee when it made its report last year. Deputies who opened the newspaper this morning saw what the price of bread will be.</P>
    <P>Deputies, last year, expressed the view, from these benches, that the increase that had been imposed, not on essential foodstuffs, not on essential commodities, but on cigarettes and, in respect of those affected by it, on petrol, would warrant a claim for increased wages or salaries.  If that was so in respect of less essential commodities, if an increase last year, in respect of social welfare recipients, in the case of an unemployed man with one dependent, of 11/&ndash; a week was inadequate&mdash;</P>

      <P>They said they would not abolish the subsidies, and, within two months, the same thing had taken place.  Human nature being what is is, people generally do not like being asked to bear a burden for the benefit of others who probably can better afford to bear it and therefore is it reasonable to expect people to bear such a burden?  The proposal in this Budget is to provide 1/&ndash; a week in respect of all social assistance recipients and 4/6 in respect of children's allowances.  That situation compares, I think&mdash;to put it no stronger&mdash;unfavourably with the position as it existed under the Budget last year.</P>
      <P>Of course, nobody recognises the serious consequences of these decisions better than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  When he spoke here the other day, he referred to the letter that had been sent to him from the Committee of the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation.  He urged them and trade unions generally to consider and to recognise that there were great risks involved in looking for higher wages and salaries.  We all recognise that.  In 1955, the wage and salary increases granted were more than were necessary to meet the increase in the cost of living.  That was recognised freely by economists, but of course the Party opposite did not give us credit at the time for that and the effects of these increases were felt in increased costs of production, in substantially increased imports and in a drain on the balance of payments. Remember, however, that that was to meet an entirely different situation from that which will result from this Budget, in which the prices of two essential commodities have been raised substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that the Government's approach to the trade unions on this occasion is vastly different from the approach made in 1947.  On that <Col N="1424" /> occasion, the trade unions were told that if they did not accept the proposal enshrined in the supplementary Budget, it would be enforced by legislation. In fact, instructions were given to draft a Bill for that purpose.  Now the Minister's approach, based on the experience of that time, is entirely different.  If he has not learned wisdom, he has learned caution and the value of an approach of sweet reasonableness.  It is an entirely different approach and I think that is a good thing.  I do not think that any Government has the right, when it is elected, to dictate to the people.  All Governments and all members of the Dáil are the servants of the people and not their masters.  It is our responsibility to point out what we believe to be in the national interest and to see, where necessary, that it is accepted.  To try to dictate to one section of the community and not to others is not in the national interest or in the public interest.  The real weakness in the proposals of this Budget, however, are the dangers of instability. I said earlier that once an economic policy is put in motion and once economic trends manifest themselves, it is difficult to arrest them and their consequences may not be felt for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>If the effect of this Budget is to raise the cost of production and to increase the charges that will have to be borne by manufacturers and producers, then unless we can substantially increase output and improve efficiency, it will not be sufficient for Deputies to talk for long periods on the need for increased production and greater efficiency.  That is one of the delusions under which some Deputies labour, in that they think it is the solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>There is not in this Budget a single proposal designed to increase employment here; there is not a single proposal designed to stem the tide of emigration.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke here the other day, he used a cautionary word. He referred to abnormal emigration. Deputies will note the caution and will note that, with the responsibility now imposed on him, with the transition <Col N="1425" /> from this side of the House to the other, it is easy to speak with caution and with reserve.  It is easy to speak with a certain diffidence that was absent during the election when Deputies sought the support of the people for a policy which was not announced to them and which, in fact, has no relation to the proposals announced some months ago&mdash;the plan for full employment.</P>
    <P>This Government is, with few exceptions, the same Government as had, during its very lengthy period of office before, the highest rate of emigration in the history of the country.  We hope they can do better on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I invite Deputy Galvin to explain to the people of Cork why he did not tell them during the election what butter would cost if Fianna Fáil were elected and what bread would cost if Fianna Fáil were elected.

It may be that they hope, because they have a bigger majority on this occasion, that they will get away with it this time.  People's memories may be short but I do not think they are that short.  I believe that in time they will recognise that the results, the achievements and the occasionally somewhat unappreciated benefits which flowed from the policy of the previous Government were not too bad at all.</P>

      <P>I want the Deputies opposite to explain why they are proposing to increase the price of wheat. Will the difficulty again not be to maintain it?  Is it not a fact that the problem will be to maintain the price of these two commodities?  If we are to maintain and expand our trade the only basis on which we can do it is the policy implemented in the programme of increased production as formulated by the inter-Party Government.  On many occasions the phrase is used &ldquo;one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough&rdquo;.  Sometimes that phrase has been derided.  It is easy for the Minister for Lands, from the detachment of an urban dweller, to lecture farmers about increased production, about more efficient methods and about new approaches; but it was the last Government that succeeded in reducing the mortality rate of calves, in providing an increased number of live stock for export and in securing for the first time a worthwhile hold on the continental markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> The figures I have quoted here of the shipments to the Continent indicate what was accomplished last year.  Not alone are they dramatic but they indicate the value of the trade agreements that were negotiated and the value of the exportable surpluses of live stock produced here.  Where in this Budget is there a proposal &ldquo;to beat the crisis&rdquo;?  The other slogan used was &ldquo;Let us get cracking&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>You are cracking down on the people now.  They are bearing the burden of increased prices for bread and butter, increased charges for petrol and oil and increased health charges.  Some Deputies, when they were canvassing during the election, did not tell the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall mention beer. All these commodities that have been increased in price have been increased without the authority of a mandate from the electorate.  When they voted for Fianna Fáil they were not told about this.  In fact, the contrary was the case.  Their indignation so welled up that repeated denials were made that these burdens would be imposed and that these charges would have to be borne by the public if Fianna Fáil were elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrary to the recommendations in the Capital Investment Advisory Committee Report, the money that is being saved on the food subsidies is being used to balance the Budget and not to any appreciable extent for capital purposes.  The position that has now arisen will take time to develop.  We are not in a position at this stage to say what the full consequences of the Budget may be.  However, looking at past experience and looking at the situation that developed in 1952, when there was a Fianna Fáil Budget, and in subsequent years, Deputies will remember no doubt the wage and salary demands that accrued, the increases that had to be met, the demands put in, not alone by civil servants, but by the Garda, the Army, the teachers and so on.  Every category <Col N="1429" /> of private employer in the community was obliged to meet increases in wages and salaries to meet the increased burden that had been imposed in that year by the partial reduction of food subsidies.</P>
    <P>On this occasion, the increase in the cost of essential foodstuffs has been substantially more severe and, at the same time, there are substantially increased burdens in respect of transport, in respect of petrol and diesel oil.  The full repercussions, the full results, of these decisions will not be felt and may not be seen for six or 12 months.  The effects on the cost of production, on the cost of transport, on the carriage of produce by farmers, on the carriage of industrial goods, will be felt after some time in the cost of the commodities for the distribution of which such transport is necessary. Distribution and transport are always vital elements in the cost of production.</P>
    <P>What is the use of Ministers talking and lecturing about increased production, increased efficiency, if a deliberate Government decision imposes burdens which will have to be borne by all sections?  Whatever else this Budget does, it distributes those burdens equally among the rich and poor.  Even the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in his broadcast talk on the Budget, admitted that the allowance in respect of social assistance recipients was entirely inadequate to meet the added burden that has been imposed by the proposals enshrined in this Budget.</P>
    <P>We believe that the programme and the policy implemented by the previous Government provided for a substantial expansion in trade, a substantial expansion in exportable surplus of live stock, a substantial increase in employment in industry.  These improvements were secured after very great difficulty, after a period in which it looked as though instability might occur.  We had achieved a position in which reasonably stable conditions obtained, stability which had been secured only by hard work, by the application of a policy that endeavoured to secure that the burdens were imposed <Col N="1430" /> on the people best able to bear them.</P>
    <P>The policy of the present Government has jeopardised&mdash;I will not put it any stronger&mdash;that stability.  It is not reasonable or fair to expect that a policy which jeopardised that position will provide any worthwhile expansion in employment or any worthwhile expansion in our economy.  Such expansion would flow only from a policy which would enable those people in the community who produce at a profit to sell all the commodities they produce. When appeals are made for greater production, when appeals are made to the people to work harder and to produce more, these appeals should be accompanied by a plan for the disposal of the increased production.</P>
    <P>Last year&mdash;as we will probably have this year if the weather continues favourable&mdash;we had the greatest quantity of milk ever produced.  We have a substantial surplus of wheat.  Through the land reclamation scheme, the lime subsidy scheme and the provision abroad of markets for our surplus, we are able to produce certain commodities at competitive prices.  We can produce them as good as, if not better than, those of some of our competitors. We are told from the opposite benches that it is desirable to import motor car parts.  That policy will probably result in a small increase in employment, but it will never enable us to produce goods we can sell at a profit in competition elsewhere.  We all know that the motor car assembly industry here is a high cost industry, that the costs of assembly cannot compare favourably with those in Britain and other countries.</P>
    <P>However, in the case of agricultural production, in the case of the commodities we have here available&mdash;the basic raw materials, the wealth in the land, the skill and the know-how to exploit it&mdash;the Government are failing. Is it reasonable for Ministers to lecture farmers about increasing their production, about increasing their efficiency, when the only commodities we can sell competitively abroad are now so taxed that we must seek an outlet in some other form for our milk, that milk must be processed in some form other than <Col N="1431" /> butter.  How can farmers produce efficiently more goods in the face of the increased transport charges imposed by this Budget?</P>
    <P>There is not the slightest chance of this country, except to a limited extent and probably for a limited period, selling a commodity like motor cars abroad.  In recent years, we have had a secondhand car trade with Spain and a temporary chance of selling cars in Britain because of the anxiety there to export a large proportion of the entire production.  The emphasis is in the wrong direction.  The emphasis is now on the aspects of our economy which will not produce any worthwhile increase in employment and which will not enable us to sell abroad an exportable surplus, either to provide us with the capital goods we need or the consumer goods we do not at present produce.</P>
    <P>I believe that because the Party opposite have so bemused themselves with talk about policy for beating the crisis that they think talk is a substitute for a policy for production. There is not in any part of this Budget the slightest indication of a policy, a plan or programme which will solve our difficulties.  In fact, looking at their past record, it is obvious there is not available the semblance of a policy that will solve our problem.  It has been said that people get the Government they deserve.  I have no doubt our people deserve a better Government than they have at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Speakers on the opposite side are adepts at dodging the issue.  The purpose of the annual Budget is mainly&mdash;primarily, at any rate&mdash;to see that proper provision is made, by revenue, to meet anticipated expenditure.  In other words, we have the anticipated State expenditure for the year before us and we have to consider what means are to be taken so as to provide the revenue to meet that expenditure.  If we do not make proper provision and if, as we had last year, we have a deficit in our current account, the only ways of meeting that deficit are by borrowing, which means <Col N="1432" /> going into debt, or by using up savings from the past.</P>
      <P>As I have said on many occasions on which we have been dealing with these accounts, the position in regard to the State differs very little&mdash;in this matter, anyhow&mdash;from the position of a family looking forward to its year's expenditure and to the means by which that expenditure is to be met.  If earnings, or revenue or income&mdash;whatever term you like to use&mdash;are not sufficient to meet outgoings, a position will arise for the ordinary family in which it will run into debt or use up whatever savings have been accumulated.</P>
      <P>As a community, we have been using up national savings for a number of years at a very great rate and we have now come to the point at which we cannot afford to go on using them at that rate, but we must make provision from our annual earnings for our current expenses and not merely that, but we must also make provision from our earnings for the necessary capital for further development.</P>
      <P>This Budget is introduced, as every Budget is introduced, in order that Deputies may consider the matter as a whole.  The expenditure of the State for its various purposes has to be met; the revenue to meet it has to be obtained by taxation.  The yearly outgoings must be met by taxation.  Everybody knows that taxation is burdensome. Everybody who smokes cigarettes dislikes having to pay more for them as a result of taxation.  Everybody who drinks a bottle of stout&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The man who drinks objects to having to pay more for it because of taxation.  The person who has to pay perhaps up to one-third of his income in taxation objects very strongly to taxation.  He wonders why, out of every pound he earns, he must <Col N="1433" /> pay about one-third of it, roughly speaking, to the State in taxation.  Of course it is burdensome.  Why does he do it?  Why do citizens of a State submit to taxation?  Why do they bear these burdens?  They bear them because they are able to live individually better lives by living in a community by means of their compactness and co-operation as a community.</P>
      <P>If taxation provides them with a police force, then the police force saves them from being attacked by some bully, and sees that such a bully, if he exists, is punished, and sees that the individual's property is looked after. That is one of the reasons why the individual pays taxation&mdash;so that he will have the protection of a police force and will not have to go about with a gun in his pocket to defend himself from the bully.  Instead, he is being defended by the force of the community, the police force, which is maintained by the community.  He pays taxes in order that such a force may be maintained.</P>
      <P>Again, some force from outside or some group in the community may desire to build a private army and those who have force behind them may try to become the real government in the community.  The ordinary citizen is prepared to pay for an army for domestic reasons, apart from defending the State against outside attack.  He is prepared to pay for the upkeep of an army because that army is his defence against some private group of individuals forming themselves into a private army and taking control of the whole community and making slaves of the other citizens.  A citizen pays taxes for that purpose and he also pays rates and so on.  For instance, he pays taxes for the roads in order to have means of communication.  He also pays rates in order that he may have a water supply and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These taxes and the burdens which individual members of the community undertake to bear are undertaken so that the members of the community may have the value of the community's services.  One can go through the Book of Estimates and see what the various services are.  It would take a separate speech to analyse them and consider <Col N="1434" /> the various services which the citizens get for the taxes they pay.  When these services are demanded, the question naturally arises of what the cost will be, and whether the advantage to be gained is worth the cost or the burden to be borne.  These are the general principles behind taxation, and the undertaking by the individual of burdens which will give to organs of the community the necessary money to supply such services.</P>
    <P>When the Dáil considers the Estimates, what it is considering is how the services which are rendered by the State, the organised community, to the individual are to be paid for, and what burdens have to be put on the individual in order that these services may be maintained.  We have a Book of Estimates here of £102,000,000 for the current Supply Services for the present year, and the money to provide these services has to be secured.  Deputy Costello suggested that the previous Government had, at one time, decided that those services would not exceed £96,500,000 for the present year.  We did not print the Book of Estimates; these are Estimates of expenditure that were produced by the previous Government and they had the usual time that is given before the Book of Estimates is printed to consider any possible reductions in them.  It is not our Book of Estimates; these are Estimates of the expenditure which was anticipated by the previous Government as expenditure necessary to supply the services to be rendered in accordance with that Book.</P>
    <P>Our task here is to see how the revenue to meet that expenditure is to be obtained.  That is the task of the Minister for Finance&mdash;to bring forward proposals by which the revenue necessary to meet the expenditure may be found, and those who are speaking on the opposite side of the House are, of course, dodging the issue.  They are talking about burdens.  I could talk for hours about the burdens on certain sections of the community caused by the imposition of taxation.  I could talk for a long time on the hardships that are caused by the various imposts either on the individual or on the organised sections of the community, but there is no use talking about those <Col N="1435" /> burdens.  We cannot have it both ways.  I have often quoted the Irish proverb: &ldquo;Is milis an t-ól; is searbh an t-íoc&rdquo; (The drink is pleasant; the paying is bitter).  It is very pleasant for the individual to get all those services. It is not so pleasant when he has to put his hand in his pocket to pay for them by way of taxation, but, as I say, he cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance came to face this task, he found, after various adjustments, that there was a sum of £8,000,000 by which the anticipated revenue would be short of anticipated expenditure.  The magnitude of that sum can be realised when you consider that when all the additional taxes which are referred to and about which there has been a great deal of talk, are put together, they make only £2.9 million, that they would not go half-way to meet that £8,000,000, and that if we added another 2d., for instance, to the cost of cigarettes we would not get in anything like the amount&mdash;about £1,000,000&mdash;we are likely to get from the additional tax of 2d. imposed by the Budget; we would probably get in only two-thirds of that amount for another 2d.</P>
    <P>Therefore the extent to which you can impose extra taxation on the usual taxable commodities is strictly limited. We all know that it is a pity to put a further tax on petrol, but if you were to double the amount that was put on, you can clearly see you would increase the burden tremendously and you would not get double the amount estimated in the Budget.  We have reached a point at which there is a strict limit to the amount which we can hope to obtain from taxation on the commodities which are ordinarily available for effective taxation&mdash;effective in the sense that they will give a return commensurate with the expense of collection.</P>
    <P>Will Deputies on the opposite side address themselves to the task which the Minister for Finance had to face in bridging that gap of £8,000,000?  When we had to bridge a gap of £15,000,000 in 1952, they tried to dodge that by saying there was no such gap, that we were looking for £10,000,000 more than <Col N="1436" /> was required.  When it was shown at once that the allegation was absurd, they still maintained that it was true. Even when the year's accounts were there to prove it was false, and the year's accounts showed not merely that there was no surplus but that there was, in fact, a deficit of £2,000,000, they still had the audacity and pretence to maintain that £10,000,000 additional taxation had been imposed which was not required.</P>
    <P>Will they tell us how this gap of £8,000,000 could be bridged this year? Two ways are always available for bridging gaps like that.  One way is to bring down your expenditure and the other is to increase revenue or income. Will they tell us what items could be reduced?  We have looked through the various items of expenditure in the time at our disposal, bearing in mind the hardships and the complete change of policy which reductions would involve and the extent to which they would make any appreciable advance in bridging the gap.</P>
    <P>The gap of £8,000,000 is a very big one to bridge in this country in present circumstances.  One of the biggest items of expenditure is food subsidies. There is a good deal of talk about them now as there was before when we had to deal with a similar problem left to us in 1952.  I know the arguments for and against food subsidies, but I never approached the question on those lines at all.  I had no intention in 1952, nor had I the intention on this occasion of interfering with the food subsidies unless budgetary difficulties required it.</P>
    <P>The Deputies on the opposite benches knew full well what the position is.  They say they took a decision in regard to subsidies.  I see no record of any such decision.  I see no record of a decision that under no circumstances, such as the circumstances of this Budget, would they interfere with them.  I admit that there would be a good tug-of-war in regard to this issue, as there always will be when there is an important question to be decided within a Coalition Government, but they did not, as far as I know, ever publish a decision that they did not <Col N="1437" /> intend, in their term of office or if they were again in power, to interfere with the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>If they did not intend to abolish food subsidies, will they tell us how they expected to produce this £8,000,000? Deputy Costello, when he was speaking here, said they left a clean sheet.  That is audacity comparable with their audacity in accusing us of taxing for a surplus of £10,000,000 in 1952.  It is true the State is not bankrupt, thank God.  The State was able to meet its expenditure of the past year, but how did it meet it?  I would like to know the reaction of shareholders in a company in which the board of directors would claim they had a clean sheet in a year in which they had a deficit of practically £6,000,000 on the year's trading.  The previous Government failed to meet current expenditure by some £6,000,000.</P>
    <P>What was that money paid for?  The Guards and the teachers had to be paid.  Various expenses of State had to be met during the year.  They were met, but how?  They were not met from the revenue.  They were met by realising some of the past savings of the State, of the community as a whole, and by going into further debt.  Is that denied?  These expenses had to be met by the realisation of existing assets and by the incurring of further debts.  Is that a clean sheet?  These debts were passed on.  Admittedly the proceeds of the Prize Bonds issue were also passed on but the Opposition speakers did not tell you that £3,000,000 had to be paid from these proceeds in the first month of this financial year to meet the short term debts that had been incurred in order to finance the operations of the previous year.</P>
    <P>The previous Government had not a clean sheet on last year's financial operations.  The unfortunate thing has been that for a number of years past there has not been a clean sheet on these operations.  For a number of years, current revenue has not met current expenditure, and the result has been an encroachment upon the savings of the past.  The first thing necessary to put this nation right, to give confidence <Col N="1438" /> to the people, is to see that our yearly outgoings are met by our yearly income.  We have to do that.  Nobody will trust us at home or abroad if we do not do that.  We are told, of course, that we are all agreed upon balancing the Budget but when the necessary steps are taken to balance the Budget we are attacked, as if we were the people who had brought about the deficit.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that we are at a critical stage in our country's progress and if we are going to save this nation and maintain its independence we will have to give up the dodging of issues. We will have to face them.  I have been listening to the speeches made by speakers on the opposite benches.  I know what would be said if I had made those speeches.  I know what was said when I was sitting over there and they were over here.  We have got to give up that.  We have a serious situation to face in this country.  We believe that we can get through these difficulties just as we got through difficulties in the past.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Budget is to lay the true foundation for future progress, for employment and for increased production, by balancing the current expenses by current revenue.</P>

      <P>People will trust us and have confidence in us if we face these problems and deal with them in a realistic way.  If anything was really <Col N="1439" /> wrong in 1952-53, it was that we had a deficit of £2,000,000&mdash;not a surplus of £10,000,000 as the Opposition had forecast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello reminded me of the daring young man on the flying trapeze who swung through the air with the greatest of ease.  Whenever he wanted to balance the current Budget he took the money from the capital account, and when he wanted to balance the capital account he took it from the current account.  Let us, deal with these two things separately. I am dealing at the moment with the current account, which determines the level of taxation and I say that to bridge the deficit of £8,000,000 we had to fall back on the subsidies, not because of any doctrinaire consideration. I know the economic arguments against subsidies and I also know some reasons why we introduced them originally.  I dislike very much violent changes, if they can be avoided but we had, nevertheless, to fall back on the subsidies.  The total cost of the subsidies for the present year was about £9.6 million.  For the part of this financial year in which abolition of the subsidies would be effective, the saving would amount to about £7,000,000.  We were anxious now, as we were anxious in 1952, to do our best to lighten the burden on the sections of the community that were least able to bear it and certain compensatory allowances were introduced. The effect of these was to reduce the net savings that could be got from the abolition of the subsidies to £5,000,000. We could have saved £2,000,000 more if we did not give those compensatory allowances to the weaker sections of the community.  The Minister for Finance might, of course, have tried to get some of the £5,000,000 by additional taxation.  Those who are talking on these lines have taken very great care not to say what extra taxes they propose or what articles should bear the extra taxation and how much would be realised.  We went into that matter very closely and satisfied ourselves that the whole of that £5,000,000 was required in order to bridge the gap but it was £3,000,000 short of the amount required and the additional <Col N="1440" /> taxes on tobacco, on stout and on petrol were the only additional taxes that seemed to us to be capable of bringing in £3,000,000.  That is how we balanced the Budget, by saving a net £5,000,000 on the abolition of the subsidies, and by obtaining £3,000,000 from additional taxation.</P>
    <P>Will those who are speaking and attacking this Budget from the opposite benches give us, and not pretend as Deputy Costello did pretend that he was giving, some alternative solutions to the problem?  We would be very glad indeed if we had some of the wizards whom Deputy Costello used to boast he had in his Party, the wizards of finance that had £10,000,000 or £20,000,000 knocking about for any Minister for Finance that knew where to look for them.  We did not pretend to have such wizards but we did make an honest attempt to try to bridge that gap and do it in the way in which the burden on the community would be least.</P>
    <P>The balancing of the Budget, then, is the first objective.  I have outlined our proposals.  Let those who think they are able to give better ones, give them; but, for goodness' sake, let them not pretend they are solving the problem by talking about the hardships that are imposed.  Of course, there are hardships imposed.  There are inevitably hardships imposed whenever one has to cut expenditure or whenever one has to work harder in order to equate income and outgoings.  These are the methods by which the private individual balances income and expenditure. So, likewise, there are two methods by which the State balances income and expenditure; the private individual must reduce spending and increase earnings and the State, likewise, must reduce expenditure and increase revenue.</P>
    <P>Let those who attack this Budget tell us plainly how this £8,000,000 gap can be bridged, other than by the proposals the Minister has put before the House. Let there be no half-way; let them tell us how the whole £8,000,000 can be got and not just how a certain amount can be got.  In the background of the Budget, of course, one has always to consider the incidence of taxation and <Col N="1441" /> one has to do one's best, against that background, to balance the Budget. There is no use in talking about the burden imposed, unless those who cavil are prepared to show an alternative way of raising the money.  Every Government and every Minister for Finance must consider the incidence of taxation when dealing with his Budget proposals.  He must examine the way in which the incidence of taxation will affect the various sections of the community and he must do his utmost to ensure that the interests of the community as a whole are served and that the burden is spread equitably.</P>
    <P>The main purpose behind our Budget, apart from laying an assured foundation for future progress, is to try to induce conditions which will lead to increased employment and production, which will give greater opportunities to our people for earning a livelihood and, through increased production, provide at least the same standard of living coupled with the opportunity to save. Does this Budget serve that main purpose?  I say that it does.</P>
    <P>The essential task of the Budget is the filling of the gap that exists and one cannot, therefore, put aside £250,000 for any purpose without looking at it twice.  A quarter of a million pounds have been put aside to provide for an investigation of possible markets abroad and to improve our marketing methods, and thus enable us to solve the problems about which Deputy Cosgrave has been talking.  We can improve production here, but, as he said&mdash;and it was the only sensible thing I heard from him&mdash;there is no use in increasing production unless there is a market to absorb that production, a market which will take that increased production at remunerative prices, at prices which will give a fair return for the labour and the expense involved.  This Government, anxious to meet that situation and solve that problem, have put aside in this Budget £250,000 for that purpose.</P>
    <P>There are also inducements for investment. We are anxious to get more money, if possible, invested in private enterprise here.  We believe, and the last Government had the same belief apparently, judging by their professions, <Col N="1442" /> that we should depend as far as possible on private enterprise and, as time goes on, we should lean more and more towards private enterprise, towards getting Irish capital invested in private enterprise here so that industry can expand and produce more for consumption at home and for export abroad.  One should not forget that when one is producing goods for the home market one is, to that extent, helping to balance the external payments position; because, if you produce at home, be it motor cars or anything else that one would otherwise have to import, you are meeting the needs of the community, and helping to cut down on imports.  Therefore, when one is considering the export and import position one must not forget that there are two ways of helping to balance the account.</P>
    <P>There is the export side and there is the import side.  If we are able to supply our needs with home produced goods, then, to that extent, we lessen the necessity for exports.  I am one of those who agree that it is better to balance at a high rather than at a low level; if we can do that, we can provide a better standard of living for all our people.  But, however it is done, the external payments account must be balanced.  We have to keep our eye on that very closely and we have, therefore, not merely to try to increase our exports but, at the same time, to ensure as far as possible that we substitute home produced goods for imports.</P>
    <P>Now, producing goods at home reduces the necessity for importing.  It certainly reduces the necessity for importing consumable goods.  Increased exports, such as agricultural exports, give one the means of paying for the things one must import either in the form of raw material or otherwise.</P>
    <P>This Budget is aimed, on the one hand, at keeping down imports, while, at the same time, helping, on the other hand, to increase exports.  It aims at providing employment at home and a decent standard of living for our people.  It is no use our deluding ourselves into thinking we are an empire. We have not 3,000,000 square miles of territory with many natural resources, <Col N="1443" /> like the United States of America, and it will be very difficult indeed for us here to achieve standards for our people comparable to the standards that they have in the United States with all their vast resources.  We are situated between two rich countries which, because of the wealth they have accumulated, their natural resources and their industrial organisation have attained very high standards of living. These are the countries with which we have the closest contact and they serve to set a headline for us.  But we have none of their vast resources and it will be extremely difficult for us, with limited territory and a relatively small population&mdash;to say nothing of Partition&mdash;to emulate their standards. Indeed, it will require great effort on our part to maintain our present standards. We can do it only by working intelligently.  We shall certainly have to work harder.</P>
    <P>We must use science and any knowledge that science can give us and we must realise that we are in a competitive world.  We must not forget that life is a struggle.  It is a constant struggle and if we sit back and think that we can drift along, we will have the standard to which drift will bring us; but if we realise that we are as intelligent as the people of other nations, that, man for man and woman for woman, our people are as good as any on the earth and are as capable as other people of intelligent cooperation and intelligent work we can be confident that we can supply ourselves with the fundamental necessities of life.  We cannot have everything other countries have but we can provide ourselves with the essentials here.</P>
    <P>It was in that spirit we approached our national position many years ago. I remember when the same arguments were used in 1917 and 1918 as are used by some people now, that a small country like ours cannot exist alone and so on.  We had to face these before and we faced them, and we believe to-day, as strongly as we believed then, that we can have a decent and a full life and a good standard of living in this country, provided we make a reasonable effort to attain it.  We cannot have it if everybody thinks they <Col N="1444" /> will be happy by doing nothing.  They cannot be.  We have got to make up our minds that, because of our size, it will require a somewhat greater effort and more intelligent work on our part to achieve a reasonable standard of living than is, perhaps, required in other countries.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot of talk about unity. The one place I can see where unity can be achieved is in the nation's council, here in this Dáil.  We can have the right unity here, the unity which will make for progress, the unity which will mean that each and every one of us, upon whatever benches he may sit, will try to do his part in order to improve the condition of the people of the country and advance the status of our nation.  I think we can have unity and it is on the secure foundation of the Budget that we can build.</P>
    <P>I hope the year that is to come will show, as the year 1953 showed, that when we did face the fundamental task of settling the national accounts, when we did that boldly and when the people understood what we had done, we will have in the coming year fruits to show exactly like those we had to show in 1953.  If an attempt is made, by people who do not understand the fundamental problem, to stir up all sorts of friction and difficulties, the task will be made much harder.</P>
    <P>With regard to some of the speeches that have been made, I cannot find fault with their being made because it is very difficult to show what might happen without having people say that you wish it to happen, but it is very important that the country should face up to the situation and that every section of the community should realise that the changes effected by the Budget are for the benefit of the community as a whole and, therefore, for the benefit of every section of the community, that every section of the community will gain by increased employment. If companies, for example, increase their profits, they will be able to put those increased profits into the expansion of their industries and thus increase output and employment in those industries.</P>
    <P>As I grow older, I have realised more fully than I did many years ago, that <Col N="1445" /> a wealthy person&mdash;I knew, of course, he could not take his wealth with him to the grave&mdash;could not enjoy his present wealth without giving employment. If he drinks a glass of whiskey he gives revenue to the State and helps to provide an income for the maltsters and the growers of barley, and so on. Practically everything he does helps other people to obtain a livelihood. The amount an individual can consume or the material goods he can enjoy is strictly limited so that his envy of those who happen to have more money than he has is very foolish.  If wealthy people put their money in the bank, it is used by the banks to give advances to others.  If in the old days they had gold and put it away like a miser, I suppose in that way they would have it and the miser's enjoyment of it, but they would have it without, as it were, sharing it.</P>
    <P>If company profits increase, then these profits will be used for expansion or put to some other use for the benefit of the community as a whole. In this country individual savings, private savings, compare favourably, at least in some years, with the savings of individual people in other countries. Where we are falling short is that the savings of industrial and other companies are relatively less than in other countries and thus we have a shortage.</P>
    <P>It would take a very long time to go into the details of all the points which have been raised by the Opposition. The Minister for Finance will be able to deal with some of the individual items.  I have tried to bring before the Dáil the essential task which faces us at the moment, the task of seeing how the expenditure for the coming year is to be met by revenue.  I have asked the Opposition not to dodge that issue but to face it.  If they have proposals let us have them.  We have to confess &mdash;and we have gone into the matter very carefully&mdash;that we cannot find better proposals in the interest of the community as a whole than the proposals in the Budget.</P>
    <P>We should like, of course, to have no deficit to meet; and to have services provided without imposing hardships on anybody; but we are not wizards. <Col N="1446" /> We cannot do these things.  Therefore, we have brought before the Dáil the only practical means there are of balancing this Budget.  I said that it was sheer necessity which compelled us to take the steps which we took, but as I listened to a few of the speeches here, and saw some accounts of those in the Press made on occasions when I was not present, I became convinced that nobody here is able to improve upon them and still balance the Budget.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the members of the Dáil to realise that we are in a serious position in the country.  I do not want to pretend for one moment that the position cannot be rectified, if we make the proper effort.  Fortunately, we are neither on the rocks nor at the last penny of our resources, but we are in a position in which we can take no chances.  If we deal properly with this position then the hopes we have behind this Budget can be realised. It is our hope that it will increase commercial and industrial activity and that it will finally enable us to deal with our agricultural problems, which are the most serious.  I am very far from pretending that there are not serious problems in connection with our agricultural industry.  Deputy Cosgrave spoke about butter; that is one of them.  However, we believe all of these problems can be dealt with on the basis of the programme which has been indicated through the proposals in the Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few comments which I should like to make on this Budget with some particular reference to the background leading up to it.  It would be unrealistic not to admit that the position of affairs in which the country finds itself to-day is the result of the improvident practices followed by successive Governments, particularly since the war, and of a policy that seemed to be encouraged more by political exigencies than by sound economics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall refer to a few statistics which, so far as I am aware, were not adverted to in this House during the past three days.  In spite of the efforts of successive Governments during the <Col N="1447" /> past 30 odd years, we had the dismal record during the fiscal year just ended of having fewer people in this country than ever before in our long history.  Irrespective of remarks or statistics quoted from either side of the House, we had in fact during the past 12 months or two years the highest rate of emigration since the famine years and, during the past two years, we must also have had the near-highest number of unemployed ever.  It would be wrong to blame any particular Government for that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>When this State was set up more than 30 years ago a number of amenities had to be provided within the meagre resources of the State and at the expense of more productive employment for our financial resources. I refer to housing, hospitals, roads, schools and such like amenities.  These had to be provided and credit for their provision must go to past Governments. Unfortunately, in the provision of these amenities, we neglected to set aside sufficient capital from our resources to invest in agriculture, in particular, over the past 20 or 25 years to ensure an expanding economy.</P>
    <P>In the past six years, despite every effort, there was a net reduction of 73,000 persons in employment.  That was due mainly to the huge decline in the number of people employed in agriculture.  During the same period, we ran successive deficits in our balance of payments which, at the end of 1956, amounted to £163,000,000. Whether statisticians agree with me or not, according to rational accountancy practices we have in fact run Budget deficits in every one of the past six or seven years.  It is obvious that we cannot continue with an economic rake's progress without coming to a day of reckoning and, judging from the figures which the Minister for Finance presented to this House on Budget day, it is obvious that the day of reckoning has arrived.</P>
    <P>What is sad&mdash;and it is my greatest criticism of this Budget&mdash;is that the weaker section of the community is being called on to bear the heaviest share of the load.  I do not believe the <Col N="1448" /> Irish people would object, as they never objected in the past, to sharing a burden or a difficulty.  Our history is a sufficient indication of the qualities of our people when they realise they are up against it.  Our survival as a nation would never have become a reality if we had not had these qualities in the past.</P>
    <P>If you call on the people to make a sacrifice one of the prerequisites to ensure that they will make the sacrifice is that it is borne equitably and particularly that the lightest share of the burden falls on the lightest shoulders. I have no doctrinaire views on the question of food subsidies.  In normal circumstances, I consider them a wasteful means of giving out social services.  I believe that, in normal circumstances, in ensuring a stable price level for bread, flour and butter, the money could be put to better use if it were given directly to the recipients concerned.  I am certain that if there had not been a change of Government the food subsidies would inevitably have been withdrawn&mdash;perhaps in stages, as suggested by certain Fine Gael speakers.  Inevitably, however, some Government or other would have had to face the fact that, with our present system of national housekeeping, we could not afford to spend £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 a year on subsidising food.</P>
    <P>My quarrel with the Minister for Finance in his withdrawal of the food subsidies is that he has not made fair compensatory payments to people in the lower income groups to offset the effect of the withdrawal.  I have in mind in particular what I might describe as the least fortunate class in the whole community&mdash;those who at present draw unemployment assistance or what is more commonly known as the &ldquo;dole.&rdquo; Even up to the introduction of this Budget, these people enjoyed the magnificent income of 38/&ndash; per week, irrespective of the size of the family.  They are the one class which the previous Government completely neglected to include when giving increases some months ago. Nobody will agree that 38/&ndash; per week for a man with a wife and five, six or seven children is adequate to keep <Col N="1449" /> even body and soul together.  Were it not that the local authorities have to supplement that 38/&ndash; out of their own funds a large number of people in every county to-day would be at the near-starvation level.  I appeal to the Minister to increase the provisions in that respect.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister when he was introducing his Budget that it is a &ldquo;back-to-work&rdquo; Budget, and that the sacrifices he is asking the community to bear are being sought to ensure that sufficient capital will be available to invest in agricultural and industrial undertakings to provide employment, by some means or other, under the substantial capital Budget of over £40,000,000 which the Government envisages spending during the current fiscal year.  If that is the case, it should mean, logically, that the amount required for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance would be less.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that that figure should not be reduced <i>pro rata</i> with the reduction in the numbers drawing unemployment benefit or assistance, but that at the earliest opportunity, the figure for unemployment assistance should be brought up, at least to the level of unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I do not see why there should be any difference between the two classes of assistance because a person drawing on stamps, as it is commonly described, or unemployment assistance must still draw sufficient to keep him at least in frugal comfort during this period of unemployment.  I should like to address a particular appeal to the Minister to consider that point.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the withdrawal of the subsidies will cause considerable hardship and disruption. I do not know if the Taoiseach's appeal to the wage earners to refrain from industrial unrest will be heeded. It is very hard to expect persons in the lower income group to refrain from seeking wage increases to offset the withdrawal of the subsidies and unless the Government itself takes the necessary steps to increase the meagre provision of a shilling per head per week, I think we are bound to have industrial <Col N="1450" /> unrest, even assuming that the community as a whole realises that the country is in a difficult position and is prepared to play its part in getting the country out of that position.</P>
    <P>I subscribe completely to the theory that the basis of prosperity and national development and the expansion of the economy, must be a sound fiscal policy.  I think one of the reasons, as I pointed out a few minutes ago, that we find ourselves in the present deplorable position is because successive Governments, for one reason or another, did not have a sound fiscal policy.</P>
    <P>The need to get the country back on a sound fiscal policy now will cause a good deal of hardship and I think it is the first duty of the Government to ensure that the weaker sections of the community are not called on to bear that burden.  In the Budget framed by the Minister for Finance the weaker sections will suffer most.  I voted with the Government for the imposition of duties on tobacco and beer because I believe if you must raise money the first things to tax are luxuries and non-essentials.  I voted against the Government on the question of the imposition of taxes on petrol and diesel oil.  In the first instance, I think it is too much to ask the ordinary motorist or private haulier to bear an additional burden of 6d. a gallon on petrol.  I think it is quite inequitable that the private section of the passenger car or the motor truck industry should be asked to bear this completely, while the national transport system is completely excluded although it is competing with the private section of the truck industry.</P>
    <P>One thing lacking here at the moment, and which the Government must restore, is confidence in the Government.  I think that the huge increase in emigration, particularly among the younger and more vigorous sections of the population in recent years, is indicative of that lack of confidence. I sat in this House yesterday afternoon and heard Deputy Dillon say that nobody need leave the country.  I could not possibly subscribe to that theory.  People do not leave their homeland just because they feel <Col N="1451" /> like wandering, although there will always be a certain section who want to travel abroad because they are of the adventurous type.  The big bulk of the people are leaving because they cannot find decent employment at home.  They go because there are better opportunities abroad, in England, in the U.S. or elsewhere.  They lack confidence in the future of their own country.  I think what I say in this regard would be supported by most people in public life in Ireland to-day. It is tragic to meet young men with families&mdash;they come to every T.D. or public man&mdash;seeking work of any kind so that they can stay at home, and yet finding that they have to leave their wives and families and go abroad.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am the only one in this House who regrets it, but I am sorry that the Minister has decided to discontinue the Irish News Agency.  I know it is losing quite a substantial amount of money but I feel that with this Agency we had an opportunity of breaking through what is known as the paper wall and getting the Irish point of view recognised abroad.  I believe there is great necessity for Irish propaganda and publicity abroad.  Recently I spent a few weeks in the U.S., and while it would be unwise&mdash;and I would not attempt it&mdash;to give a complete opinion after such a short time, I feel there is no doubt but that there is a tremendous need for more publicity and propaganda, not only among Americans of pure American descent, but also among Irish-Americans of the second and third generation.  I think the News Agency offered one medium for promoting our views abroad and for collecting the views of other countries, and for seeing that Irish news and views were disseminated particularly in the U.S.  That does not happen at the present time.  As a matter of fact, Irish news items in the American papers, when they do appear, are to a large degree distorted, and very much in our disfavour.</P>
    <P>The question of the substantial increase in the price of flour has been mentioned.  I think it is quite wrong that the price of flour should be lower than the price of pig feed which has <Col N="1452" /> been the position up to now.  There is no doubt that, due to that fact, a big amount of flour is being fed to animals.</P>

      <P>The cost of administration in this country, considering the size of it, must be one of the highest, if not the highest in the world, and it is a disappointment to me, and I am sure to most members of the House, to have heard the Minister for Finance say that, out of a Civil Service expenditure of £17,000,000 a year, he anticipates a saving of only £250,000.  In any business where the overheads are too high and where the business is running at a deficit, one of the first things to be attacked is the cost of overheads, and I would suggest to the Minister that a more energetic attack should be made on this dead hand that is impeding the country's progress and development. Seventeen million pounds for a tiny country of less than 2,000,000 people seems to me to be completely out of proportion.</P>

      <P>The success of the prize bonds scheme is a tribute to the previous Minister for Finance and, in spite of what has been said from this side of the House, I should like to join in the tributes paid to him for getting that scheme going.  I do not know whether or not it is a great compliment to us as a people that, for the purpose of investment, money cannot be raised through National Loans, but that when it comes to gambling on the future of the country, the effort is an unqualified success.  Perhaps that is indicative of the position in which the country finds itself at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to raise capital for investment in the country, it can be raised <Col N="1453" /> from only two sources.  One is our own resources, by savings, either voluntary or through taxation; the other is the savings of some other country.  Everybody in this House would prefer that the capital requirements for investment, in agriculture particularly, and in industry should come from our own savings, but that would necessitate such a reduction in our standard of living that it would not work.  I feel that we will have to offer inducements, even more attractive inducements than the Minister envisages in his Budget, to get outside capital invested in this country.  I would direct the Minister's attention to the possibility of outside capital, particularly American capital, being invested here.  The return must be attractive and very attractive, but if we do want to attract foreign capital quickly, that is one of the likely ways of getting it&mdash;that and tourism.</P>
    <P>Tourism, at long last, has been placed on a business-like and hopeful basis.  I should like to pay a tribute to the board of directors of An Bord Fáilte for the efforts they are making and have made since their appointment in recent years to expand the tourist industry.  I have no doubt that there will be a very substantial increase in the number of tourists coming to this country, particularly from the United States, this year and in subsequent years.  That, again, is one sure way of increasing the national income quickly.</P>
    <P>The Government were elected to put the people back to work.  That was the cry on which they went to the country. The Budget which they have produced will cause a good deal of hardship. The Government owe it to the weaker sections to make better provision than they have made in the Budget to lighten the burden caused by the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  If the Government are to succeed in their efforts to put people back to work, they must attack the problem with more energy and certainly more seriously than has been the case so far.</P>
    <P>Capital investment of itself will not secure employment.  The country needs more than that.  It needs leadership, in the first place; it needs a <Col N="1454" /> sound policy; above all, it needs amongst the electorate a firm belief and confidence that the people who are leading it know where they are going. If the present Government can apply these qualities, everybody in the House will, I am sure, give them support but if they fail in the effort, they will have deserved any criticism the House can give them, from whatever quarter it may come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M. P. Murphy Mr. M. P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of the glossy statements made by the Taoiseach and other members of the Government regarding this Budget, it must be asserted that the Budget was introduced with callous disregard of the general position of the people.  It is all right for the Taoiseach to make statements here regarding the necessity for such a Budget and to imply that he and his Ministers are honest and straightforward with the people and that there was no alternative to this Budget or to the increased taxation and the removal of the subsidies, but, if the Taoiseach and the people behind him are as honest and straightforward as that, why did they not during the month of February and up to 5th March indicate clearly to the people that these measures would be essential?</P>
      <P>I dislike the Government Party claiming a monopoly of honesty in political affairs because I believe they are not honest and were not honest with the people during the recent election campaign.  I feel sure that, if the people had known that Fianna Fáil's remedy for the problems of the country was to impose these numerous burdens that have been imposed in the Budget, Fianna Fáil would not now be the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the inter-Party Government were to adopt such measures, they would have had no difficulty in solving their problems.  If the inter-Party Government had told the housewife that she would have to pay more than 2/6 extra for a stone of flour, that she would have to pay more than 3d. extra for the loaf of bread and if they had told the owner of a hackney car, a taxi or a private lorry that he would have to <Col N="1455" /> pay 6d. a gallon more for petrol, with a view to getting a further £1,000,000 from him in the current year, it would have been very easy for them to solve their problems, but the likelihood is that, in the natural dispensation, money will not be available to meet this heavy taxation.</P>
    <P>Last year, when the Budget was exceptionally light and the impositions extremely moderate in comparison with the present Budget, it was alleged by Fianna Fáil critics, from their leader down, that the commodities they have now taxed could not bear further taxation.  That was clearly set out by the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party and by Fianna Fáil Ministers and backbenchers in the debate on last year's Budget.</P>
    <P>I do not blame all Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;only a few&mdash;for inflicting this Budget on the Irish nation.  I know that many of them are as disappointed and as disgruntled as I am or as any other Deputy on this side of the House is.  They had no say in it.  I am well aware of that.  This Budget could be brought in only through the system of Government that now obtains&mdash;a dictatorial system of Government.  If, say, the inter-Party Government were to suggest the introduction of that type of Budget, they could not succeed in doing so because the elected representatives supporting the inter-Party Government in its two terms of office had a say in what legislation should be enacted.  There was no question of disclosing Budget secrets or any other State secrets, but every Deputy supporting the inter-Party Government had a right to express his or her personal views to the Cabinet and to offer opinions as to what he or she thought was reasonable.</P>
    <P>The same position, of course, does not obtain in the case of the Fianna Fáil Government.  It does not matter what the scores of Deputies from the country may think.  What matters is what the leader of the Party thinks and possibly what a few others think. That is the reason that we have this infliction on the people in the current year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> It is all very well to appeal to trade unionists or to lower income groups of workers, to farmers, industrialists and everyone else to take no notice of this. &ldquo;Pay up and look merry&rdquo; is more or less the theme of the Taoiseach's speech&mdash;&ldquo;Do not take any notice; do not look for any increases in incomes to offset these burdens; reduce your standard of living, because it is too high&rdquo;.  The Leader of the House made that point very clear in his speech a short while ago.  I cannot see why the wife of the ordinary worker is not entitled to some increased remuneration to offset paying more than 2/6 a stone for flour and to offset the other increases imposed by the Budget.  A few years ago, when small increases were imposed Fianna Fáil incited the people to seek increases, both here in the Parliament and in the local authorities in the country.</P>
    <P>I would like the members of the Government to put themselves in the position of the thousand and one families throughout the country composed of six or seven members and living on incomes of £3, £4 or £5 a week.  How are they to get the money to pay the extra prices for these essential foodstuffs?  Hardship is going to be imposed on them and they have no alternative but to seek increases. Where is that going to lead to?  I cannot see that this Budget is going to bear any fruit one way or the other.</P>
    <P>We have an increase of 7d. per pound in the price of butter.  Let us examine the position minutely.  Ministers in this Government and in previous Governments have asked the people to increase agricultural production and have said that, by increasing agricultural production, all our difficulties will be solved.  The position, whether we like it or not, is that we are producing much more butter than we need. The previous Government thought it advisable, having regard to that fact, along with a number of other factors, to subsidise the home-produced butter with a view to increasing consumption at home and thus saving the expense of subsidising it to dispose of the surplus. It must be taken into account of course that it is a very sound food and a very <Col N="1457" /> nourishing one for families with lower incomes who need it most.</P>
    <P>I am assuming that, due to the subsidy given to butter by the inter-Party Government, we did consume more butter in this country than would otherwise have been the case.  Now where do we find ourselves?  We have the position that Fianna Fáil has increased the price from 3/9 to 4/4 a lb., that is, 7d. a lb. increase.  What will the result be?  I am offering my personal opinion that the result will be, as it is bound to be, a reduction in the consumption of butter and a much greater exportable surplus.  The figures available to me for the export of butter show that it costs the taxpayers 1/8 per lb. for every extra lb. of butter we produced to sell in England or in any other country.  The result is that for the 1 lb. of butter we sell to England, we will have to pay as much by way of subsidy on it as we would have to pay on 4 lb. of butter which we use at home.</P>
    <P>Whilst listening to the last speaker, I made some small calculations regarding that matter.  On the basis that our exportable surplus of butter will be 1/8 per lb., it means that every 12 lb. of butter we export will cost us £1. If we are to export, say, 12,000,000 lb. of butter, it will mean that we will have to subsidise it, at present figures, to the extent of £1,000,000, and 12,000,000 lb. of butter represents 4 lb. of butter per head of population. On my calculation, as a result of this imposition the overall consumption of butter will be reduced by an average or at least 4 lb. per head, per year. That means an additional imposition in taxation of £1,000,000 and, in my opinion, the general reduction will be much more than 4 lb. per head as a result of the price of butter going beyond that which the ordinary people can afford.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why we have not got some more definite explanation about increased agricultural production and I could not understand the previous Minister for Agriculture either in this regard.  We have an exportable surplus of milk and milk products but <Col N="1458" /> we cannot find a market for them. Everyone knows that so far as increased agricultural production in other lines is concerned, the same position applies.  The farmer who has 14 or 15 pigs fattened and ready for a fair has the one hope that at the time he sells them, the supply will be down, because then the demand increases and the price increases.  If he is unfortunate enough to have the pigs for sale when the supply exceeds demand, he knows very well that he will not make any profit.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Agriculture did help in that regard, so far as pigs are concerned, by assuring farmers, or pig producers, of a minimum price of £11 15s. per cwt.  Of course, that is the price that is now paid when pigs are in plentiful supply, but, when they are not, it is exceeded by an average of £2 per head.  So far as the production of pigs is concerned, there is an element of gambling involved. One has to gamble as regards supply and demand.</P>
    <P>During the election campaign, Fianna Fáil speakers, in West Cork at any rate, made use of propaganda which gulled some innocent people regarding the poultry position.  I am particularly interested in that industry because it was of great consequence in West Cork and provided self employment for many womenfolk.  That, unfortunately, has now disappeared.  The position is, as the Minister for Agriculture intimated to the Dáil fairly recently, that we have no market at present for poultry products.  England, our main market for eggs, has more eggs than it requires.  The same applies to turkeys.  Because of the importance of the poultry industry, I believe it is incumbent on the Minister for Agriculture to state from time to time his policies in regard to that industry.  At present, there is a tendency on the part of many people to get out of eggs and poultry altogether.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  I made a brief reference to it previously&mdash;the tax on petrol and diesel oil.  I am not in agreement with that tax.  It is all right for some Fianna Fáil Deputies to <Col N="1459" /> say that petrol is mainly used by joyriders and holiday makers.  That is completely false.  I can visualise the difficulties of hackney owners, of farmers with tractors and small trucks, of small business people with lorries and vans, trying to meet this extra imposition.  If the Government need money, I do not see why they should obtain it from these already overtaxed items.  Of course, they are handy items and the tax is easily collectable.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot from Deputy Lemass and others during the Budget debate last year on the question of an increase on cigarettes.  Now the old men's plug tobacco has been increased by 5d.  That was not told to them during the election campaign.  Neither were the cigarette smokers told about the increase that has gone on the price of cigarettes.  The previous speaker mentioned that these were luxuries.  I believe it is out of place to describe those items as luxuries to-day.  For many of our people, they are their main relaxation&mdash;a drink in the evening after work and a smoke discussing their problems with their neighbours.  I do not regard these commodities as luxuries.  That is what the people got from Fianna Fáil before.  They should have been wiser on 5th March.  If they had been, they would not have these burdens to bear at present.</P>
    <P>Another item is this question of the availability of money for employment. I know it is a very vexed question.  I know there is not much justification for making money available except for productive work and economic schemes. I know very well that money has always been in short supply in this country and is likely to be in the future.  I know it is difficult to arrange matters so that full employment will be available for all, even despite the fact that we have a small population.  What I am worried about are the large sums of money made available by the State for non-productive purposes without any return whatever.  Unfortunately, because of the present set-up, these moneys must be paid.  I am referring to unemployment benefit and so on.  I believe the majority of our people do not want unemployment benefit or <Col N="1460" /> unemployment assistance or any other type of benefit; what they want is work.</P>
    <P>I have in mind the rural parts of the country where the average wage is about £5 5s. per week.  At present, every man who has been in insurable employment, who has a wife and at least two children, and who is now unemployed, receives £3 1s. from the State.  That money is going dead. That man has to remain idle in order to draw that money.  If he does any work, it is a criminal offence to draw the money and he is liable to be indicted for it.</P>
    <P>Could we devise some system whereby this money, paid by the Department of Social Welfare for this most unproductive purpose, could be supplemented by money from other State Departments?  Instead of giving a man £3 1s. per week for doing nothing, give him an extra £2 4s. or £2 9s. a week more and get him to do some productive work.  The result would be that, for the expenditure of an extra £2 10s. per week in rural districts, we would have a full week's work from a worker instead of having the situation in which he has to degrade himself by going along and signing forms to obtain assistance which most of our workers do not like.</P>
    <P>I was hopeful that the previous Government would make better efforts to solve that problem by having some co-ordination between the Department of Social Welfare and other State Departments employing people.  If we had more co-operation, there is a world of useful productive work to be done throughout the country.  There are roads to be improved, rivers to be cleaned, drainage schemes to be put into operation and other schemes such as afforestation, etc.  I appeal to the present Government and I appeal to the Minister who happens to be present.  I know Deputy Lynch is a sensible man and he understands the problem reasonably well.</P>
    <P>I appeal to him to try and endeavour, in his capacity as a member of the Government, to achieve some co-ordination between the moneys made available from, say, the Special Employment Schemes Office and other sources <Col N="1461" /> and that provided by the Department of Social Welfare, in order to avoid having to make money available in a manner which everybody in the country, including the recipients, dislikes. I have made that statement previously and I reiterate it to-day.  I have taken a special interest in it. Many of the people who helped to put me here and who are in receipt of this money dislike having to receive it. They would prefer to have another couple of pounds and be put into productive employment.</P>
    <P>We had a campaign by the Party now in Government that general hospital and mental hospital services should be provided free of charge.  The previous Government brought in legislation, which apparently did not measure up to the requirements of Fianna Fáil because it included charges for certain items.  However, the position now is that the present Government proposes, along with the other impositions placed on the people by this Budget, to make them chargeable for fees where hitherto they paid nothing.  In some instances, specialist services are now to be charged for. Under the inter-Party Government legislation these services were free. Hospital charges have been increased by 4/&ndash; a day, from 6/&ndash; to 10/&ndash;.  I think that the money spent on the Milk Costings Commission set up by Fianna Fáil when previously in office is money that has gone completely down the drain.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want again to voice my indignation at the proposals in this Budget which imposed such sudden burdens on so many people.  The people who will be hit hardest are those in the lower income groups&mdash;people in self-employment, small farmers and small businessmen.  I cannot believe that these proposals will have the effect of bridging the gap in our economy since they will give rise to strife, insecurity and instability.  The difficulties we already had will, I believe, be multiplied by this savage Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is rather easy for members of the Government to be upset by references from this side of the House as to what they said this time 12 months.  On that occasion <Col N="1463" /> we had the present Tánaiste saying that there was not a Deputy supporting the Government at that time who did not owe his seat to the repeated pledges he had made to his constituents that he would endeavour to reduce the cost of living.  On that occasion I think the Tánaiste used the words: &ldquo;What a pack of phoneys you have proved to be&rdquo;.  He was also at pains to speak of the taxation which was imposed at the time.  He spoke of dearer matches, dearer lemonade for the children.  I wonder if the Tánaiste, in his capacity as an Opposition Deputy at that time, ever thought it would be the turn of the Opposition to speak of dearer bread and butter for the children?</P>
      <P>On the same occasion Deputy MacEntee, when speaking on the Budget, said that an effective Budget was one based on a reduction of expenditure, a reduction in taxation, and he contrasted that with the record of the previous Fianna Fáil Government in keeping prices stable.  Surely that is in strange contrast with what has now happened in this Budget.  I think we may be pardoned if one this side of the House we refer to what was then stated from this side of the House and what now comes from the opposite side of the House.</P>
      <P>There was reference at that time also to bank deposits and to rumours which were alleged to have been afloat that the Government might make demands on the banks.  In the meantime, of course, by the operation of the inter-Party policy, and particularly in the past year, the figures show that deposits have gone up, that investments have increased, that external assets have expanded.</P>

      <P>That there has been an improvement in the balance of payments. In the light of these facts I suppose it would be taken as unfair if, at this stage, we drew attention to the suggestion of the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement that, if public support should be insufficient, recourse to the banks might be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> In his Budget statement, the Minister also referred to agriculture.  I think everybody in the House will agree that it is to agriculture in all its phases we must continue to look for expansion in our economy which will enable us to produce the standard of living of which we hear so much.  In that connection, I wonder what the effects of the removal of the subsidies on bread and butter will do.  I speak on behalf of a dairying constituency, so naturally I wish to speak about butter and milk.  If the price which creameries will now have to pay for their milk is dependent upon the sales of their butter, I wonder how the small creameries in County Limerick will be able to compete with the larger creameries.  They will have, of necessity, to sell their butter stocks. How will they get on in the ensuing situation as a result of what I believe will be a diminution in the consumption of butter here at home?</P>
    <P>Surely it must follow that if the price of butter increases, as it has, by 7d. a lb., the average household, at the present level of income, must reduce their consumption of that commodity. This will create a problem for the dairying industry at a time when they have old problems to contend with.  In the past year, instead of an increase in the number of milch cattle you had a reduction from 11 per cent. to 13 per cent. in production in the first few months of this year.  At this juncture, when the dairy farmers were expecting an increase in the price of their milk, the position now is that the support has been taken away with the subsidies. That will immediately mean that where a dairy farmer intended expanding he will now have to review his proposed expenditure in that respect.  This is not just a single industry: it is a basic industry on which many others depend and from which many others spring.  Where ordinary industrial concerns have a measure of protection by the imposition of tariffs, in this case the subsidy was a production subsidy as well as being a support or a cushion for the consuming public.</P>
    <P>We learned yesterday that our production of wheat evidently is now reaching the stage when it will become <Col N="1465" /> rather an embarrassment to the economy of the country.  It would seem at this stage as if what Fianna Fáil said when in opposition is now the opposite, when they are at the other side of the House.  Last year, a Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches complained of the complacency of a Minister who said he would be prepared to face his constituents on the latest Budget.  I wonder how many of the Ministers or Deputies on the opposite side of the House now would, with the same complacency, face the electorate?</P>
    <P>On that occasion, too, Deputy Corry, I think, shed a lot of tears about the old age pensioners' tobacco.  He also was very upset about the private hauliers; he said the Government last year was putting them out of business. I am sure he will agree that, equally so on this occasion, the same arguments can be used.  It is hard to understand what arguments can be used at the present time for removing an import duty on non-essential and luxury goods such as had been applied in the levies, while at the same time increasing the cost of living by removing subsidies and increasing the price of essential commodities.</P>
    <P>There has been an appeal for savings.  Savings are very desirable and very necessary, but how can the ordinary wage earner afford to save, if the essentials which he needs for everyday consumption are increasing in price?  Similarly, how can those who have money to spare be induced to spare it, if at the same time what may only be classed as luxuries become freely available through the removal of those levies?</P>
    <P>We have a transition period in the dairying industry at the moment.  It would need time to readjust itself to what is now about to become its biggest problem, that is, how the milk may best be disposed of at a profit to the farmer and without embarrassment to the finances of the country.  When farmers are faced as well with the problems of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, the improvement of cow byres, the installation of water, and so on, surely it was the wrong time to bring the dairying industry into the <Col N="1466" /> state of uncertainty which I feel will be bound to occur in the circumstances of the present Budget?</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the increase in the cost of living by the removal of those two supports, and by the imposition of the petrol tax.  That tax is bound to have another effect, as Deputy Russell said&mdash;in regard to tourism.  You have in this particular year two increases&mdash;the increase in food prices and the increase in transport charges.  The transport charges will, I suppose, increase the cost of materials which are moved.  In that respect, particularly in rural areas, there are very many people who depend on private transport of the lorry type or who are hackney owners who depend for a living on it.  Times have been lean enough, but this further impost will not make them any easier for them.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to what the Taoiseach had to say in regard to the general Budget problems and I was struck by the philosophy which he expressed of the happiness that is to be obtained in sharing one's money. We all realise that people cannot take money with them but I am afraid that not too many people like to allow other people to spend their own money for them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave in his speech expressed as emphatically as he could the value which the Fianna Fáil Deputies seemed to set on repetition. It is very evident since this debate began the enormous value which the members of the Opposition set on repetition.  Every speech to which I have listened from the beginning was not only repetition of other Deputies but repetition of many things which I have heard from the same Deputies 20 years ago in this House.  I listened, for instance, to the first speech made here in this debate by Deputy Norton and I would say that I could have repeated that speech ten years ago having heard him make practically the same speech many times during the period I have been a member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> He began by saying how surprised the people would be when they read the papers the morning after the Budget statement had been made and what a shock the people would get when they read the terms of that Budget.  I do not know where Deputy Norton had been living for the fortnight before the Budget was introduced, but it is common knowledge that every ordinary citizen, for a fortnight before the Budget, anticipated almost accurately what was made known to us on Budget day.</P>
    <P>Take the tobacco increase.  The only thing the people wondered about was would the Minister leave it at the 2d. or make it more.  As to the increase in the price of petrol, they wondered would it be as much as 6d. In relation to the food subsidies all citizens, both those represented by the Deputies opposite and the Deputies on these benches, having seen what was stated in the Book of Estimates, anticipated the absolute necessity on the part of the Government to take drastic steps this time in order that our Budget might be balanced.  For him to express the feeling that the people would be surprised, that they would be shocked, was the greatest bit of hypocrisy to which I have listened since I became a member of this House very many years ago.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach was elected, Deputy Norton asked a question of him as to whether he intended to abandon the food subsidies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton expressed surprise that he was not answered that they did or did not intend to abandon them.  This was the day the Taoiseach was elected.  The Deputy knows that the Book of Estimates was not issued before the general election.  It was published after the general election.  When the former Tánaiste asked that question he was well aware of the financial position and he knew positively that any Government succeeding the outgoing <Col N="1468" /> Government would have to take drastic steps if they were to provide a balance at the end of this year. There is no doubt that what was in Deputy Norton's mind when asking that question was what he was going to say when the Budget was introduced a fortnight later.</P>
      <P>As I have said before, Deputy Norton is in this House quite a long time.  He has made the same speech here after every Budget: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil never did anything right in this country.&rdquo; I do not know what Deputy Norton did right while he has been a member of the House.  Maybe the only right thing he did was to throw in his allegiance with the Party to which he should belong when he joined Fine Gael during the period of the Coalition.  Deputy Norton was one of the men who spoke about pledges, and we have been hearing a good deal about pledges during the last few days.  He was the man who gave an undertaking he would join no Government except a Labour Government but, of course, he forgot that pledge, and several other Deputies forgot the pledges they made, too.  I do not want to weary the House with further talk about Deputy Norton.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick is the Leader of what is called the Clann na Talmhan Party.  There is no such thing as the Clann na Talmhan Party so far as this House is concerned.  He is perhaps the Leader of three people here.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy M. J. O'Higgins entertaining us the night before last and yesterday morning. I have heard that speech before. It was the same old speech again.  He referred to the announcements of the Fianna Fáil Party, the very effective announcements, that put Fine Gael on that side of the House.  He quoted up to June of last year.  He did not go any further.  It was in June of last year that the writing was on the wall for Fine Gael and the inter-Party Government. It was at that time they should have given the country a chance by retiring and allowing a Government that was capable to take over the affairs of the country.  It was at that time that the mess became so  <Col N="1470" />huge. All they could do was struggle along, notwithstanding all that the people said about them and notwithstanding the results of the by-elections.</P>
      <P>Then came the second break-up similar to the one which put them out of office previously.  What Deputy O'Higgins said has no concern with the people of Ireland.  They pay no heed to anything he says.  If I am talking in this strain on the Budget it is because this was the trend of the speeches made by practically all the speakers on the benches opposite with, perhaps, the exception of Deputy Cosgrave. Nobody attempted to deal with the Budget.  They were mainly concerned with the Deputies on this side of the House, with the personalities and characters of Ministers.  Very little was said about the Budget in any of their statements, and my excuse to the House for speaking in these terms is simply that I follow the bad example given by other Deputies.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Dillon for a long time.  He even told us about his ancestors.  He referred to John Dillon. When Deputy James Dillon was, perhaps, a youngster, I was a follower of John Redmond, before John Redmond, in my opinion, caused a split in this country.</P>

      <P>What I was going to say about Deputy Dillon perhaps I may have the opportunity of saying elsewhere.  I regard the persons mentioned as national figures.  The people who speak of them should have certain rights to do so and should deserve to speak of them.  I shall leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I listened also to Deputy Corish last night.  The main burden of his speech was the small reliefs which this Budget provides for people enjoying unemployment assistance, the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and also the small relief in family allowances. I think he was quite surprised when I reminded him of the fact that all these services were provided by Fianna Fáil.  I would like to remind Deputy Corish, who was Minister for Social Welfare, that the social welfare services of that description handed over to us in 1932 were unemployment assistance and old age pensions.  They had been handed over to this State by the British when they left in 1922.  Any social services, over and above these two, that we have in this country to-day for the benefit of the underpaid sections of the community, are due entirely to the Fianna Fáil Party.  In the main they were carried through this House when Fianna Fáil had an absolute majority over all Parties and when they had no need for a push from the Labour Party which Deputy Corish represents.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish mentioned the great loyalty of Fianna Fáil members.  He said that, like little sheep, we would follow the Taoiseach into the lobby regardless of what the Taoiseach asked us to vote for.  Before Deputy Corish was born we were following that same leader and, on the front benches of this House, there are still people who followed him with guns on their shoulders.  If we do follow de Valera we are conscious of the fact that he never led us astray and that when we follow him we will be following in the right direction.  We resent very much the suggestion of Deputy Corish that our leader, the Taoiseach, would expect us to follow him blindly anywhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned Deputy Cosgrave's taking exception to the repetition which Fianna Fáil speakers, according to him, have indulged in and I said, too, that I thought his speech was the most constructive speech we had had from the Opposition Benches during this debate.  At the same time, it was, in my opinion, full of errors.  When reading the list of increases in the Civil Service over the past 20 years or so, he said that all these increases occurred during the period in which Fianna Fáil was in office.  I asked him if the list he was giving was a list of permanent officials and he told me, in reply, that it contained both permanent and temporary civil servants.  The odd thing is that, while these temporary civil servants, numbering more than 5,000, we were told last night by Deputy Corry, were appointed during the emergency to deal with rationing and various other matters, all 5,000 were made permanent by the inter-Party Government.  Therefore, instead of Fianna Fáil being responsible for the increase which did take place in the Civil Service, at least 5,000 were appointed, possibly in one block, by the inter-Party Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> Deputy M. P. Murphy, I thought, was another Opposition speaker who dealt fairly with the Budget.  He dealt with it in a better fashion than most of the other Opposition Deputies who have spoken here so far.  He, of course, wanted to know why we did not tell the people in February that we were going to remove the food subsidies and tax tobacco and beer.  I heard many speakers say that we promised the people that we would not do these things, though the complaint was levelled against us by another Deputy that we went before the people looking for a blank cheque.  According to one section of the Opposition, we were making no promises and, according to another section, we were making all manner of promises.  The Opposition, of course, has always had the unhappy habit of wanting things both ways.</P>
    <P>How could we in February, without any knowledge of the position of the country's finances, tell the people that we would or would not either increase or decrease taxation?  We could not do that.  We might say to the people that it was not our intention to do that, but that was the most that we could say.  We might say to them that, if we found there was something in the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo;, we would give reliefs, but we did not know what was in the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo;.  I listened to the present Minister for Finance speaking in Carrick-on-Suir on 3rd March, two days before the election, at a public meeting.  He said then that he would not promise any reliefs in taxation; neither could he, except by guessing, say that there would be any increases; these things would have to be dealt with when the finances of the country had been examined.</P>
    <P>In view of these statements, why is it we must be asked now why we did not tell the people in February that we were going to remove the food subsidies and increase taxation?  Deputy M. P. Murphy said that it was incumbent on the Minister for Agriculture to adumbrate State policy in relation to poultry and to make statements of policy in this matter from time to time. It was a great pity that he did not make that recommendation to Deputy Dillon early last year, when he was <Col N="1474" /> Minister for Agriculture, before the people started to go in for the production of turkeys on a large scale.  I mention turkeys because the Deputy mentioned them.  If Deputy Dillon had his eye on the market, he must have known early last year that it was going to be tremendously difficult to sell the birds produced last year.  If Deputy Dillon had warned producers last year that the market would not be there for them, I venture to say that thousands of our people would not have found themselves in the mess in which they were when they had to sell their birds at a price lower than the cost of raising them.</P>
    <P>We stand over the changes we have made in this Budget and, when the time comes, we will face the people with confidence&mdash;the confidence that we have always had in them.  It has been my experience in a long public life that the failure of the Parties opposite is due entirely to their underestimating the people's intelligence. We have gone to the people under the most severe circumstances.  We have told them the actual position, as we saw it, and the sufferings they were going to endure because of actions we proposed to take, and they have never let us down.  Since 1932, we have been the greatest single Party in this House and to-day, having been in existence since 1926, this Party is at the peak of its strength, and all that, because we have confidence in the people and because the people have confidence in the leadership which Fianna Fáil gives to the Irish nation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken rather startled me in his opening remarks by saying that the Budget which he was going to defend was a Budget which the people expected and, he rather suggested, eagerly awaited.  I wonder whether his colleagues in the Government Party, listening to him, felt the same difficulty as I felt in restraining a gasp at the audacity of the Deputy in suggesting that, since the last general election and since the new Government took office on 20th March, the people accepted that the new Government had their authority to <Col N="1475" /> bring in a Budget of this kind.  That, in my opinion, is an insult to the intelligence of this House.</P>
      <P>The same Deputy said that many of the speeches made on this side of the House contained repetition.  Had he remained, he would have had the embarrassing experience of hearing me repeat, in a different fashion, many of the things that have already been said.  I assert that the present Government have no authority or mandate from the people to bring in this kind of Budget.  More particularly, they allowed the people to vote for Fianna Fáil candidates in every constituency in the country in the belief that all these candidates were pledged to retain food subsidies until such time as the cost of food&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;until such time as the cost of food fell.  I wonder do Deputies on the other side who were elected recently remember the important planning speeches made on their behalf in the last 12 or 18 months.  I have here a specimen, printed in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 14th March, 1956, under the heading &ldquo;Lemass Analyses National Economy.&rdquo; It is a very intensively thought out speech and a comprehensive survey of all the things a Fianna Fáil Government would do, if elected to office.  Here is what the then Deputy Lemass pledged on behalf of Fianna Fáil in relation to food subsidies. He says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Food subsidies must be accepted as likely to remain a permanent feature in the Estimates unless a very steep fall in the cost of living should take place and that is not very likely, to put it mildly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he goes on to give a personal view of his own:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like to express the personal viewpoint which I hold strongly that the maximum advantage can be obtained by concentrating all the money which can be voted for food <Col N="1477" /> subsidies on flour and bread prices alone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mind you, it is important in the interests of democracy here that these things should not be just shrugged aside.  There is a pledge, given by the deputy-leader of the Fianna Fáil Party to the people of this country some 12 months before the general election, to the effect that their Party was committed to maintaining food subsidies as a permanent feature in our Finance Estimates until such time as the cost of living fell steeply.  Deputy Lemass said that, to put it mildly, that did not appear likely.</P>
    <P>Our people can stand a lot, but I have yet to hear that they justify anything approaching false pretences.  If the then Deputy Lemass did not believe what he then said, then he was pretending something falsely to himself and falsely to the people.  Unfortunately, the miserable story does not end there.  Unfortunately that speech by the Minister was not the end of the false pretences of the Fianna Fáil Party.  During the general election we, representing the then Government, had to face &mdash;and we did not shirk it&mdash;criticism and opposition because of the things we had to do and because of the economic and financial problems which faced the country and which were common to all political Parties. We were faced by the Fianna Fáil Party who had their slogan: &ldquo;We can beat the crisis; vote Fianna Fáil; let's get cracking.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During their speeches coming up to the eve of the poll, the leaders of Fianna Fáil started complaining about blood-curdling stories that Coalition speakers, as they called it, were telling. I have here a very fine account in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 1st March this year of a speech by the Minister for Justice, then Deputy Traynor.  In this speech, the Minister for Justice complained of the suggestion made by the then Tánaiste that a Fianna Fáil Government, if elected, would take as its first action the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  That was a blood-curdling story, the Minister told his audience, spread in order to deceive them.</P>
    <P>Is it fair for me to suggest that those who listened to the then Deputy <Col N="1478" /> Traynor making that speech came away satisfied in their own minds that what Deputy Norton had said was untrue and that Deputy Traynor and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party were pledged to maintain existing food subsidies?  Of course, the story does not even end there.  The Tánaiste who we have known from his speeches during the past two years was determined on behalf of Fianna Fáil to maintain food subsidies spoke just a few days before the people voted in Waterford.  It has been referred to already, but there is no harm in referring to it again.  He said, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 1st March, 1957:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some Coalition leaders are threatening the country with all sorts of unpleasant things if Fianna Fáil becomes the Government, compulsory tillage&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>we have not had that yet&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;wage control&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that has not yet taken place&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;cuts in Civil Service salaries&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>not yet&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;higher food prices and a lot more besides.  A Fianna Fáil Government does not intend to do any of these things because we do not believe in them.  How definite can we make our denial of these stupid allegations? They are falsehoods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How, in any democracy, can any Deputy sitting over there who has any sense of honour or personal dignity continue to support, as the Deputy Leader of the Government, a man who gave that clear pledge to the people and who, having been elected to office, very quickly and very definitely supported a Budget which increased the price of bread by 5d. a 2-lb. loaf, which put up the price of butter by 7d. to 4/4 a lb. and who did all that despite his pledge on behalf of his Party that none of these things would be done and that to suggest otherwise was to state a falsehood?  Who told the falsehood? Is it not now as clear as daylight that the blood-curdling stories we told the people in the last General Election were unfortunately only too accurate and that those Deputies sitting on the <Col N="1479" /> other side of the House who called our allegations falsehoods were themselves indulging in a false pretence on the people of the country?</P>
    <P>Of course, it does not end there, as we all know.  On the very same day, the Taoiseach, as Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, also gave a pledge that a Fianna Fáil Government would not increase the price of bread.  His speech at Belmullet was reported in the Press on the 1st March, 1957.  It is noteworthy that at least three leaders of Fianna Fáil, coming up to the eve of poll, should, each of them, make the same kind of speech about the same subject, that is, food subsidies.</P>

      <P>One leader and two aides-de-camp.  They made a speech about the same subject, each of them intending to convince the people that they need have no fears about the abolition of food subsidies if they supported Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>It is deplorable that it should have to be said in this country, where we should not only value but honour our democratic institutions, that we now have in office a Government that, within three or four weeks of assuming office, has discredited its name, besmirched its reputation and acted quite contrary to the pledges it gave to the people.  I suppose that, having secured a majority in this House, the hard-headed political bosses of Fianna Fáil feel they can get away with anything. Maybe they can and maybe they cannot.  However, so far as Fine Gael is concerned, it is our duty and our concern here, as long as we are in this House, to stand for and to defend democratic principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fundamental, if we are to retain decency in Government, that each political Party facing the people must be prepared to do so with clean hands and must be prepared to put its policy before the people rather than to get the people's support by pretences of different kinds and then, when in office, do something quite contrary to the impression created when the people went to vote.  I do not know whether or not the Fianna Fáil Party would have won the last General Election if <Col N="1480" /> they had said to the people of Cork, whom Deputy Galvin represents, and to the people of Dublin and to the people elsewhere throughout the country who unfortunately have to depend largely on bread and butter: &ldquo;A vote for Galvin means that you will pay 1/2d, instead of 9¼d. for your 2-lb. loaf.  A vote for Galvin means that, instead of 3/9d., you will pay 4/4d. a lb. for butter.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Leaving aside the miserable election campaign indulged in by the Government Party, leaving aside whether or not they have <Col N="1481" /> authority to introduce this Budget, leaving aside all that and faced, as we are, with the unpalatable fact that the Budget contains this very revolutionary proposal in present circumstances that there should be a complete abolition of food subsidies, I should like to discuss the merits of that proposal.  We all know, I think, the economic arguments that from time to time have been advanced against food subsidies.  It has been pointed out that food subsidies are a subsidy towards consumption and that, to that extent, they are not a healthy form of expenditure for the State.  These considerations, like many other economic proposals, are all right, provided they are seen both by the speaker and the listener in the same light, but I think Deputies will appreciate that food subsidies which have existed here for ten years, despite a previous abortive attempt by Fianna Fáil, have long ago ceased to be merely a way of making food cheaper for the people.</P>
      <P>We could have cheap bread without difficulty by importing cheap foreign wheat; we could have cheap butter quite easily by importing cheap New Zealand butter; and therefore these subsidies were not given merely for the purpose of providing a cheap loaf or cheap butter for the people.  They were given for another and an important purpose, in order to encourage production.  They were production subsidies aimed at increasing production from the land.  Food subsidies were part of an effort to encourage the growing of native wheat and to increase milk production.  They were essential for the purpose of encouraging production even on lines in respect of which we could not economically meet competition.  They had that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The food subsidies also represented a subsidy towards the maintenance of a particular wage level.  No one can doubt the fact that when those charged with responsibility negotiate a wage structure, an important element in the discussions is the cost-of-living index, and the cost of living plays an integral part in the entire wage structure of the State.  There-fore, any expenditure by the central <Col N="1482" /> Government which helps to keep down the cost of living is an expenditure which helps to keep wage levels lower than they might otherwise be. It therefore follows that the subsidisation of food plays not only an important part in increasing production, but also in maintaining wages at a particular level, and to that extent, enables us, or should enable us, to export goods we might not otherwise export.</P>
    <P>I mention this because there are as many arguments from an economic point of view in favour of food subsidies as are often advanced against them.  Whether they are to be regarded as a temporary expedient or a more permanent feature of our economy as Deputy Lemass, as he then was, seemed to regard them, the fact remains that, at a time when the country needs an expansion of exports, it is scarcely appropriate that a prop to production, cushioning it in respect of wages and other kinds of costs, should be suddenly removed.  It appears, to my mind, that the time is not auspicious for a step of that kind. I know that the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement expressed the hope that the removal of the food subsidies would not result in an increase in the level of wages.  I wonder whether the Minister made that statement with his tongue in his check.  It is very like the case of the man who lays a fuse to a keg of gunpowder and then expresses the hope that it will not explode.  I wonder what kind of muddled thinking could have permitted this action to have been taken.</P>
    <P>During the past two and a half years, the Government had many difficulties to face, not the least of them being the effect on our economy of a dramatic increase in wages.  We were, and we are, well aware that such an occurrence can have quite disastrous effects on the economy, but, in the past 12 or 18 months, we had reached a position of stability so far as wage levels were concerned.  Employers and employees recognised that an unprovoked wage increase could, in present circumstances, have a very disastrous effect. Certainly, the Government now must have had the same advice as we had; <Col N="1483" /> the facts must have been as apparent to them as to us.  Nevertheless, in a most capricious and irresponsible manner, the Government has taken this action which is bound to have the effect of destroying the stability so dearly won in the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>If there is a further increase in wages, it must be conceded that the economic arguments in favour of the abolition of food subsidies will have disappeared and, indeed, our later position may be considerably worse, and the national economy may be faced with many new and quite terrifying problems; but if that takes place, the responsibility rests entirely on the Government who brought this situation about, contrary to their pledges, without a mandate and, I believe, contrary to the national interests.</P>
    <P>May I just mention one or two other facets of this Budget?  I hope Fianna Fáil Deputies will realise that the Budget does not end merely in making the poor person in Dublin pay 5d. more for the 2-lb. loaf and 7d. more for the lb. of butter, or the farmer's wife in my constituency pay 32/&ndash; more for the sack of flour&mdash;it does not end there, because the effect of this Budget will permeate right through the financial structure of the State.  The cost of all local authority institutions will increase substantially this year.  The rates which people will have to pay for their maintenance will increase.  In every sphere of activity, as a result of this Budget, taxation, direct or indirect, will be heavier.  Again, if rates increase this year, how will Fianna Fáil Deputies explain the position?</P>
    <P>Rates have been increasing over quite a number of years.  Last year was the first time that a position of stability seemed to have been reached. In the rate for this financial year, many local authorities were able to report that the corner had been turned and, for the first time in many counties, this year, rates were reduced. Again, that position has been thrown aside and we will have a further increase in local taxation.</P>
    <P>All these things flow from a Budget <Col N="1484" /> which I feel cannot represent the considered opinion of men of ability concerned for the national interest.  It is a simple thing to say, if there is a gap of £5,000,000, that that can be found by spending £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 less on the subsidisation of food. Might it not have been worth the Government's while and more in the national interest to have considered alternative methods in order to get the country out of its present difficulties?</P>
    <P>The Government took over on 20th March without a penny piece of debt. They took over, and were fortunate to be able to take over, with the premium bond scheme initiated and in a position to obtain some £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 of small savings in a short space of weeks.  They had no urgent or critical financial crisis facing them. All that needed to be done was a bit of intelligent planning and the introduction of a tonic Budget to get the country out of its temporary financial difficulties.  The balance of trade problem had been eased, if not solved, by the actions taken by the previous Government. A savings campaign had been initiated and money was coming in and was available to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Of course, the import levies were pinching some toes.  It was inevitable that import levies on luxury articles must cause dissatisfaction to some people, but they were temporary and they were aimed at getting the country over a hump.  They yielded last year close on £5,000,000, which, in fact, was the money needed for current purposes in this financial year.</P>
    <P>The Government might have thought of retaining food subsidies, certainly for another year, or reducing them gradually and using the revenue from these levies for current purposes.  That, at least, was an expedient that might have been considered.  There is nothing wrong in it because these levies represent the yield of taxation on imported luxury articles.  Instead of that, the Government proceeded to slash the levies.  The levies disappear from high-powered motor cars because those interested in the motor car industry were opposed to the levies.  The levies disappear from television sets because, <Col N="1485" /> again, those interested in selling television sets to the Irish people were against the levies.  To all these sectional interests, the Government yields and reduces the levies, which this year are estimated to yield only some £2,500,000, about half the yield last year.</P>
    <P>Again, it seems to me that action of that kind was scarcely in the public interest, if it was done by a Government that intended to make up the leeway by taxing the food of the people.  How can a Fianna Fáil Deputy having any regard for his own conscience explain the action of a Government who remove taxation from television sets and high-powered vehicles, umbrellas and all the rest of it and impose taxation on bread, make the loaf dearer in order, amongst other things, to enable Irish wheat to be sold for animal feed?  Do Deputies realise that in this Budget statement there is shown a loss of £150,000 on the sale of Irish wheat for pig meal and feeding for greyhounds, which loss is covered, amongst other things, of course, by increasing the 2-lb. loaf from 9¼d. to 1/2?  That appears to me to be the economics of a lunatic asylum&mdash;to subsidise, by charging more for bread, the sale of native wheat for animal feed.</P>
    <P>All these considerations are matters for individual Fianna Fáil Deputies and their individual or communal conscience.  It is our concern, on this side of the House, and in this Party particularly, to defend the people, in so far as we can, against burdens which we regard as unjust and against a breach of faith by the Government Party, and we will continue to do that.</P>
    <P>I know that, in the Budget, tardy and grudging recognition is given to the fact that dearer food may mean want may mean suffering, for many families and, accordingly, some compensation is given to recipients of social assistance.  It was my task as Minister for Health in the previous Government to make some decisions which I knew to be hard decisions and which I might have liked to have been otherwise.</P>
    <P>I had on many occasions, sometimes at the insistence of Fianna Fáil <Col N="1486" /> Deputies, to say to recipients of tuberculosis allowances that our financial circumstances could not permit an increase in the payments they received.  Again, on discussions on Health Estimates, I had to say to Deputies here that the disablement allowance of £1 per week, for the person incapable of working, was as far as we could go in present financial circumstances.  The people in receipt of these allowances were either sick or were odd lots on the labour market, unfortunate people who, by reason of illness or infirmity, were forced to depend on assistance from the State. Like all the rest of us, however, they have to eat and they have formed the habit of eating bread and butter.  Like all the rest of us, these people will now pay more for their bread and more for their butter, but they are not to be compensated.  A person who has tuberculosis or who has any other infectious disease and requires good food and building up is not to be compensated in the slightest for the fact that he now has to pay more for bread and butter, and accordingly can buy less bread and less butter.</P>
    <P>May I express the hope to the Government that, irrespective of whether they had authority from the people to introduce this Budget, and irrespective of whether it is a sound or an unsound thing to abolish food subsidies, they will provide some form of real compensation to those who are really in need?  I am glad that recipients of the old age pension, the widows' noncontributory pensions and recipients of unemployment assistance are getting some slight increase, but it is not enough by any means.  It is tragic that the sick and the disabled should be entirely excluded.  I do hope that the Government, even at this late hour, will reconsider that aspect of this appalling budgetary proposal and will at least take some steps to cushion the less fortunate sections of the community from the effects of this drastic step.</P>
    <P>I think it would be wrong for me as a former Minister for Health to conclude what I have to say on this debate without referring to the proposal in the Budget, which was confirmed <Col N="1487" /> yesterday by its circulation, to increase charges under the Health Act. The Health Act, in its passage through this House and in its acceptance by the people outside, was a highly controversial measure.  I never concealed my views with regard to it.  I always felt that fundamentally its philosophy was at fault.  I always felt that it was inclined to encourage our people not to rely on their own efforts when they could.</P>

For the first time, insured workers and others had to pay a hospital contribution of 6/&ndash; a day.  That is scarcely 12 months old and there were many insured workers that I knew to my cost who were surprised to learn that, under the Health Act, they had to pay a charge of two guineas per week.  Many of them made the case to me that that charge was too severe in certain circumstances.  It is now proposed under this Budget that, instead of a charge of 6/&ndash; per day, each insured person will pay 10/&ndash; per day.  I wonder how do Fianna Fáil Deputies make that fresh charge conform with their slogan of a few years ago: &ldquo;Should wealth mean health?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, it does not stop there.  The provision in the Health Act for free specialist services to all eligible persons is now thrown overboard and it is proposed to impose, for the first time in this State, a charge for the specialist services on those in respect of whom the State has a duty.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>The conditions for the grant of an allowance are prescribed in Section 44 of the Health Act, 1947, as amended by Section 36 of the Health Act, 1953. Under these conditions an allowance is payable to a person who:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Briseadh an gníomhaire atá i gceist ar an 19ú Márta, 1957, ar an gcúis go ndearna sé go feasach sárú mór ar théarmaí a litreach ceapacháin sa mhéid</P>
      <P>(1)  go raibh sé ina aon-stiúrthóir ar ghnólucht Dooley Burton &amp; Co., agus mar sin nárbh fhéidir dó aire lánaimsearach a thabhairt dá phost mar ghníomhaire:</P>
      <P>(2)  gur dhíol sé earraí i gceantar díola gníomhaire eile; agus</P>
      <P>(3)  gur shocraigh sé le siopadóirí áirithe, gan cead d'fháil roimhré ó bhainisteoir Ghaeltarra Éireann agus gan a chur in iúl dó sin gur shocraigh sé amhlaidh, go bhfaighdís lacáiste 25% ar earraí áirithe cniotála, rud ba dhíobhálach don trádáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>D'Fhéach an tAire a chuaigh romham ar na nithe sin mar mhí-iompar i <Col N="1492" /> bpáirt an ghníomhaire agus dá réir sin rinne sé an ceapachán d'fhorceannadh láithreach faoi fhorála míre 8 den litir cheapacháin gan a chur in iúl don ghníomhaire cad iad na nithe áirithe ar fhéach sé (an tAire) orthu mar mhíiompar.</P>
    <P>Do scrúdaíos na cúiseanna a bhí curtha síos ag an Aire leis an ngníomhaire a bhriseadh.  Tháinigeas ar an tuairim nach bhféadfaí seasamh ar na cúiseanna sin agus dá réir sin nár chóir é a bhriseadh mar gheall orthu.  Thugas ordú, dá bhrí sin, é a chur ar ais ina phost.  Fuaireas amach ná raibh an gníomhaire, fé mar adúradh, ina aon-stiúrthóir ar an ngnólucht Dooley Burton &amp; Co. ar an 19ú Márta, 1957, toisc gur toghadh stiúrthóir breise ar Bhord na cuideachtan ar an 10ú Nollaig, 1956, agus, fé mar a d'insíos don Teachta sa bhfreagra a thugas ar an 8ú Bealtaine, táim sásta nach gcuireann an bhaint atá ag an ngníomhaire leis an ngnólucht aon bhac air an t-am iomlán is gá a thabhairt dá dhualgais mar ghníomhaire.  Fuaireas amach, freisin, ná raibh tuairisc ar aon chás ina ndearna an gníomhaire féin earraí a dhíol i gceantar gníomhaire eile.  Tá tuairisc ann, ámh, ar chás amháin, a bhfuil leor-fhianaise leis, inar dhíol an gnólucht Dooley Burton &amp; Co. bréidín le miondíoltóir i gContae Dhún na nGall.  Is i mí Márta, 1953, a tharla an díol sin agus, nuair a tugadh ar aird é, chuir Gaeltarra Éireann in iúl don chuideachta gur sárú díolacháin den tsórt sin ar na coinníollacha faoinar soláthraíodh bréidín don ghnólucht agus nár cheart a leithéid a dhéanamh feasta.  Chomh fada agus is eol dom Roinn-se, níor tharla aon díola den tsórt sin ó shin.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh lascainí a thabhairt, is amhlaidh atá an scéal, fé mar a mhíníos cheana don Teachta sna freagraí ar cheisteanna roimhe seo, nach bhfuil aon údarás ag na gníomhairí atá ar fostú ag Gaeltarra Éireann aon lascainí speisialta a shocrú le trádálaithe mar gur gnó don bhainistíocht amháin é sin.  Rinne an gníomhaire, ámh, ceist i dtaobh lascainí speisialta a phlé le trádálaithe áirithe i leith earraí áirithe a cheannaigh na trádálaithe sin.  Níor sháraigh sé sin litir cheapachán an <Col N="1493" /> ghníomhaire mar ní raibh éinní sa litir i gcoinne a leithéid sin.  Aon lascainí speisialta a tugadh i gceantar an ghníomhaire atá i gceist, cheadaigh an bhainistíocht iad sarar lamháladh creidiúnas ina leith.</P>
    <P>Táthar tar éis an gníomhaire d'athcheapadh ar na téarmaí agus na coinníollacha céanna a bhain lena sheancheapadh ach amháin gur laghdaíodh ráta an choimisiúin ar dhíolacháin lasmuigh de Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath ó 6¼% go 5½%.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few things to say in connection with this motion. First of all, I should like to point out that any criticism I may have to offer of this appointment is not in a personal sense.  I have the greatest respect for Senator Moylan as a soldier.  I have the greatest respect for his record in helping, in times gone by, to achieve the limited political freedom that obtains in this part of Ireland to-day.</P>
      <P>You, Sir, as Ceann Comhairle, will appreciate the fact that a motion in my name on the Order Paper deals with the Seanad and calls upon this House to abolish it.  The present appointment is being made from the Seanad.  I should like to get this very clear.  It seems extraordinary to me that at a time when Fianna Fáil's strength is at its greatest, at a time when they have more Deputies in this House than ever before, the Taoiseach finds it impossible to select from that huge number of successful candidates a suitable man for ministerial post as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Nobody in this House talks more about democracy and about the rights of the people than the present Taoiseach. Only to-day in the course of his address on the Budget, he treated us to a lecture in this House on the dangers of a private army, on the rights of the people and how they should be protected.  He pointed out that this House was elected for the protection of the people.  We find that one of the very first acts of the Taoiseach, who talks so much about democracy, was to flout the will of the people.</P>
      <P>The people of the constituency in Cork knew Senator Moylan.  He had been a member of this House for a considerable number of years.  The people in that constituency knew his ability, knew his record, knew how close he was to the Taoiseach.  They knew all those things and we all accept the fact that the people are the bosses.  The people decided calmly, through the secrecy of the ballot box, that they did not want Seán Moylan as a member of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Taoiseach, the man who preaches about the rights of the <Col N="1501" /> people, flouted their decision and, within a week of the people's decision rejecting Seán Moylan, the Taoiseach announced he would use the privilege, for which he had made provision in the Constitution, to bring in Seán Moylan over the people's heads.  Some Deputies in the House may consider it desirable that the Taoiseach should have the right to bring into the Government individuals who have not gone before the people, to bring in individuals who had not offered themselves at the hustings.  Those Deputies are entitled to their view.  Perhaps the idea originally was that we would have somebody in the country with the ability of Einstein, somebody who would be able to produce gold out of a hat.  Anyhow, it was considered that if such a provision were left in the Constitution the Taoiseach could bring in an individual but it was thought that such a privilege would be exercised only on the basis that the individual would be one of the world's outstanding men.</P>
    <P>I am not here to say anything in a personal sense in criticism of Deputy Moylan.  His record in this House is, to my mind, on a par with the records of the majority of Deputies.  He has had, over the years, ministerial experience in various Departments.  For a considerable period he was Minister for Lands and also in charge of forestry.</P>
    <P>When I went for election for the first time one of the points on which I fought my campaign was the terrible neglect of forestry.  The man who is now to be brought in as Minister for Agriculture was in charge of forestry for a considerable number of years. Having given a great deal of consideration to the matter I say there are other people inside the Fianna Fáil Party in the House who are capable of doing a reasonable job in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Department of Lands could be looked upon by many as the most important Department in the State.  All Deputies in this House are agreed that if the necessary production does not come from the land our economy will suffer greatly.  Over the past 30 years the Department of Lands, as such, in <Col N="1502" /> the hands of people like Senator Moylan, cannot be said to have been a success.  In fact, so unsuccessful has the policy of Senator Moylan as Minister for Lands proved that Deputy Childers, his successor, has now pointed out that the Land Commission is a waste of time, that the policy of the Land Commission over the years was misdirected.</P>
    <P>We have now brought into the Department of Agriculture the man who was responsible for that policy and who is replaced in the Department of Lands by Deputy Childers.  Will the position arise in four or five years that another Fianna Fáil bright spark like Deputy Childers will say: &ldquo;I am afraid Senator Moylan made a &lsquo;hames&rsquo; of the Department of Agriculture as he did when he was in charge of forestry.&rdquo; Fianna Fáil have 78 Deputies in this House&mdash;78 loyal supporters of the Leader, the Chief.  Out of these 78 there are quite a number of Deputies from the Province of Connaught, the neglected province.  So far the Taoiseach has not appointed a single Minister from that province.  I am sure there are Deputies in the Opposition who would say: &ldquo;Well, if this appointment was to bring in a Connaught man from a province so far neglected it would not be too bad.&rdquo; But no, despite the fact that this province has stood loyally by the Taoiseach, it has been spurned, and a man who has been rejected by the people is being brought in to take charge of what is known as the most important Department in the State.</P>
    <P>Is there the slightest semblance of democratic procedure in the motion that the Taoiseach has moved to-day? The individual concerned, Senator Moylan as he now is, went before the people and he was rejected.  What was the next move?  Did he even take the chance of going before the electorate for the Seanad?  Oh no.  Surely if the Taoiseach considers that the Seanad is such an upright body, such an important body and that the men elected to it should be elected by democratic procedure, he should have decided that Mr. Moylan would go before the Seanad and contest his seat in the same way as the other 180 or 190 Seanad candidates.  That did not happen. <Col N="1503" /> In other words, having been rejected by the people first, it was then decided it would be unwise to allow this man to go forward and contest even the Seanad election.</P>
    <P>When I look towards the Fianna Fáil Benches I see a number of new faces there and a number of Deputies for whom I have a great personal respect. I see a number of Deputies that I believe have a great personal ability but I believe at the same time that, as they are now, they are rigorously tied down and the ability they have is being prevented from blossoming. Surely the Taoiseach had an opportunity at this stage of taking from the younger ranks a man who would have the energy, the youth and enthusiasm to spark a new policy in agriculture and bring new life to that most important Department?  Surely the Taoiseach has more respect for his 78 Deputies than to pass them all by and to take in one individual who has already been rejected?</P>
    <P>However, seeing that he has not&mdash;I presume this House will agree to his decision&mdash;as far as I am personally concerned, I am opposing it completely on the grounds that the action is undemocratic coming from a man who preaches democracy to the people day and night.  I oppose this as vehemently as I can and I shall ask for a division in the hope that there will be at least five Deputies in the House who will also oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to speak on this motion but I cannot let the occasion pass without making some comment on the disgusting remarks made by the previous speaker.  Deputy McQuillan spoke of democracy or the lack of democracy in the decision of the Taoiseach, but it would be well if the Deputy remembered that the method by which Senator Moylan was chosen for this Ministry was put before the Irish people and approved in the Constitution which was passed by the Irish people in a democratic manner.  That is the method which Deputy McQuillan now chooses to criticise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a younger member of the House, <Col N="1504" /> I am very glad and very pleased that Senator Moylan will occupy the Ministry for Agriculture not, as Deputy McQuillan says, because he is a soldier but because of his record here.  If any Deputy troubles to read the debates down through the years he will see the tremendous success which Senator Moylan achieved in various Departments notwithstanding the strong castigation to which we have listened from Deputy McQuillan.  In the Ministry of Education, Senator Moylan was one of the most brilliant and goahead Ministers this country has ever known and if he brings the same energy and enthusiasm to agriculture as he did to the other posts he occupied, then the future of the agricultural community and the nation as a whole is assured.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan chose to criticise the Taoiseach because of the Taoiseach's interpretation of democracy. It is a pity that the advice of the Taoiseach was not taken down through the years by the Irish people, because then we might not find ourselves in the terrible mess in which we are at the present time.  Deputy McQuillan refers to the fact that out of 78 Fianna Fáil Deputies we could not find one to occupy the most important Ministry.  I think, personally, that is the greatest compliment that any man could get and it shows the confidence that the Taoiseach has in Senator Moylan.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan talks about youth and enthusiasm.  The same Deputy would be the first to crib here in order to hit the headlines again if a young man were given that post.  His plea then would be &ldquo;the youth and inexperience&rdquo; of the man appointed to the most important Department. Deputy McQuillan has an answer for every occasion to suit his own purpose, to show that he is aloof and can support one project or suggestion to-day, and go the other way to-morrow.  The people in Deputy McQuillan's constituency do not appear to agree with that&mdash;at least proportionately, they are losing faith&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in that attitude I do not know who, if anyone, will <Col N="1505" /> speak on the Opposition side, but I wonder, if the present Opposition had by some means been elected again as the Government what they would have done or how they would have exercised their authority if Deputy Sweetman had not gained those very valuable and precious 28 votes in Kildare and if the former Deputy Tom Harris&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better keep to the motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is purely hypothetical but I should like to say that if the Deputy or any other Deputy had gone to the library and taken the trouble to read the debates which took place when the terms and provisions of the Constitution were being debated in this House it would be found that the very thing that has happened here to-day was debated then <i>ad nauseam</i>&mdash;the fact that a Minister of State could be defeated.  I think it happened in the case of a former Minister of State and it could happen again. After all it must be realised that a Minister of State or a person who was a Minister of State, may, through pressure of business and pressure of the duties of his office, lose touch with his constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the human aspect of it because the uninitiated voters may say: &ldquo;So-and-so is a former Minister: he is safe.&rdquo; He is not safe; he is weaker.  In the democratic system under which we operate these factors have been taken into account and such a contingency as has arisen was catered for.  The contingency has been dealt with by the action of the Taoiseach and such action demonstrates in no uncertain manner that the democratic provisions of the Constitution approved by the people in 1937 have been carried out.  Deputy McQuillan chose to use the word &ldquo;misdirected&rdquo;.  He went into the history of Senator Moylan during his term of office in the Ministry of Lands, which I, for one, thought was a most successful time in that Department.  He further suggests that Deputy Childers, the Minister for Lands, has stated that all that happened in the past was completely worthless.  Such, of course, is typical <Col N="1506" /> of Deputy McQuillan's usual exaggeration. The Minister for Lands made no such statement.  He made some constructive statements and suggestions as to how the Land Commission might be improved.  There is an old maxim of which Deputy McQuillan should be aware: &ldquo;Let us learn from the wisdom of age and be cheered by the sallies of youth.&rdquo; Deputy McQuillan remembers that there was an occasion when he, too, was misdirected, and he saw the light eventually.</P>
    <P>In his long time in this House Deputy McQuillan never advocated that the changing of the section of the Constitution by which this House has the power to nominate two members of the Seanad to be members of the Government should be referred to the people by means of a referendum.  He comes in here now spouting about it for the first time and criticising the action of the Taoiseach.  Any logical and far seeing person, anyone who, as I stated earlier, has gone to the trouble of reading the debates when these provisions were being formulated can easily see his criticisms are ill-founded.</P>
    <P>Another criticism made by Deputy McQuillan was that there is no Minister for Connaught.  Surely the members of the Cabinet are not chosen on the basis of a residence qualification, so many to the different provinces.  They are chosen on their ability and I presume that every area of the country need not have representation in the Cabinet.  It would be well if Deputy McQuillan bore in mind that the representatives in this House from Connaught are quite the most energetic members of the Fianna Fáil Party and I am glad to say that I have observed at our Party meetings that these members are the ones who give us the benefit of their long experience and knowledge and are the most constructive in their criticisms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand how the question of democracy which has been raised by Deputy McQuillan comes into this matter.  As has been pointed out already, what has been done was provided for in the Constitution. A democracy is, I take it, a system of Government in which you <Col N="1507" /> have certain basic laws and other laws which have to conform to it.  The basic law here provides for a Seanad.  It also provides that in the formation of the Seanad, the Taoiseach can make a certain number of nominations and that not more than two members of the Seanad can be chosen to be members of the Government.</P>
      <P>The pros and cons of that were fully discussed at the time the Constitution was passing through the House.  In fact, there was a committee set up to consider questions of that sort and they recommended certain nominations. I do not know whether they dealt precisely with the fact that members of the Seanad may be members of the Government&mdash;I do not think they did&mdash;but at any rate it is in the Constitution. Surely nobody can say we are flouting democracy if the fundamental law which was passed by the people is the law which determines my action in this case.</P>
      <P>There may be a question which would naturally occur to anybody: would it be possible for a Senator to perform the functions that are necessary in this House as Minister for Agriculture?  By the Constitution, a Senator, when he is a Minister, is entitled to sit in this House, to speak in the House, in fact, to do everything in the House that any member of this House can do except vote.  The only time that the position of a Senator who is a member of the Government will differ from that of a member of this House is in the matter of going up the stairs to vote.  His duties may require him also to be in another place, but that is often the case with Ministers. They have had to go to attend the Seanad in dealing with Bills, and so on, while they are members of the Dáil, and a provision had to be made to make that possible.  There are two or three Ministries which are excluded by the Constitution from being held by members of the Seanad, the positions of Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible there is something to be said for an important Ministry being held by a member of this House. I will not deny that at all.  I would <Col N="1508" /> have been better pleased if this important Ministry was held by a member of the Dáil.  It is true there is quite a number of Deputies in the House, members of our Party, who could have been selected as Minister for Agriculture.  I am sure quite a number of them would have proved themselves successful Ministers for Agriculture, but the task ahead of the Taoiseach in a case like this is to pick out the best person at his disposal in any way.  Of course, his opinion can be wrong but, as it is laid down, it is his opinion that counts if the Dáil agrees and does not turn down his nomination in the matter.</P>
    <P>My own opinion in relation to all those who were available to me in any way to serve as Minister for Agriculture was that in our present circumstances the person most likely to serve the country best in that capacity was Mr. Moylan, now Senator Moylan. Availing of the powers given to the Taoiseach, I deliberately nominated him as a Senator for that reason.  The suggestion that he was rejected by the people is not true, really.  I am perfectly certain that, if there had been a rule that when a person was appointed a Minister, he would have to go down to his constituency and be put up before them to be confirmed in his appointment, Senator Moylan would get an overwhelming vote of the people in his constituency.</P>

That is what happened in this case.  I am perfectly certain that, with Sean Moylan's record, if he had played a selfish game, he would have headed the poll.</P>

I am taking the responsibility for nominating Seán Moylan as a member of the Government, and, as a member of the Government, to be Minister for Agriculture. I have only one anxiety and that is that he will over-work and kill himself as Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>It will be a very difficult task.  The whole of our future depends upon how agriculture is treated during the next five years.  In choosing Mr. Moylan, I choose him with the same confidence with which I chose him as Minister for Education and with the same belief in his ability to bring other people along with him. One of the things we need is the whole-hearted co-operation of the agricultural community, and, if there is one man in Ireland who can get that, it is Seán Moylan.  The criticism of the nomination on the grounds of principle is not soundly based.  I say, on the question of personality, I for one believe the Dáil would do well in agreeing to the nomination.</P>

      <P>Before I reported progress, I was referring to the provision in the Budget whereby increased charges for Health Act services are provided.  I do not intend to deal with them in any detail now, as an opportunity to do so will occur later, but I should like to remind the House that the Fianna Fáil Party, which introduced the Health Act some years ago and paraded it as a measure under which people could derive the benefit, that no longer would health depend upon wealth, is now the Party that is proceeding to reverse engines and change policy on that measure.  I will leave it to the imagination of the Minister for Finance and the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party as to what their attitude might have been if I, or any other member of the previous Government, introduced a proposal of this kind.</P>
      <P>There is one other aspect to be considered. This Budget, in my opinion, is the wrong approach in present circumstances.  The country needed, in face of present difficulties and problems, a Budget which would have been a tonic to the people.  Instead of that, a big dose from the bottle of black medicine has been doled out to them. This is a Budget of austerity, austerity of a kind that we have never before experienced.  It is bound to have a depressing effect on business and on industry; it is bound to have a harmful effect on the savings drive that was initiated last year and which was beginning to make considerable progress. It is a Budget which will mean that less business will be done, a Budget which will mean that less can be saved by the people and, generally speaking, a Budget not suited to the present difficulties facing the country. It is particularly unsuited when it is introduced by a Party who only three or four weeks ago paraded themselves as the Party capable of beating the crisis, as the Party that exhorted: &ldquo;Let's get cracking&rdquo;, as the Party that told the women voters: &ldquo;Get your husbands back to work by voting Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> In this Budget, no plan emerges for dealing with unemployment.  In this Budget, there is no dynamic approach such as we were led to believe would be made whereby, certainly or assuredly, the problem of unemployment would be dealt with.  Instead, we have in a worse form the same kind of Budget as the Fianna Fáil Government introduced in 1952.  We can remember that the 1952 Budget created a very serious unemployment problem in the 12 or 18 months that followed it, a problem which led to unemployment figures in 1953 of over 90,000.  There-fore, when a Government such as the present Government are elected, with tasks to perform, not the least of which is to put an end to unemployment, one cannot help feeling that this Budget is not designed to that end.</P>
    <P>The concept and the philosophy behind this Budget is a faulty concept and a faulty philosophy.  It is not suited to the present problems which face the country and that is a stricture that can be applied to this Budget in a discussion on its merits.  But, even if this Budget represented a proper approach to this country's financial and economic difficulties as of the present moment, I assert, with feeling, that the present Government have no right or authority to bring it in.  The present Government pledged itself, when it was seeking support, to maintain food subsidies until such time as there had been a steep fall in the cost of living.  It made those pledges 12 months ago.  Government supporters repeated them four or five days before the people went to the poll and it is only when the election is over and Fianna Fáil has secured quite a surprising victory, that they feel themselves strong enough here, whatever about their own consciences, to disregard just = "right"&gt;in a quite startling manner the pledges they gave so freely only three or four short weeks ago.</P>
    <P>Now, that will have its effect on the respect in which the people hold this Dáil and those who compose it.  I have no doubt that, in the ordinary working of democracy, the political Party that has played such a trick on the people will, in due course, get its <Col N="1512" /> deserts.  So far as we in Fine Gael are concerned, whether the life of this Government is long or short, we will continue here in the Dáil to fight the battle on behalf of the people, to cushion them against injustice from the Government or anyone else; but I hope that neither here nor outside, no matter what the gain may be, will we ever be as guilty as Fianna Fáil have been in making false promises and indulging in false pretences in order to gain a temporary electoral victory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard all the speeches made in the course of this debate. I have heard some of them and I have read excerpts in the newspapers of many others.  By and large, there has been a reasonably sensible approach and a reasonably constructive criticism.  In introducing a Budget of this nature, the present Government did not think for a moment that it was going to meet with the acclaim of the people as a whole.  I use the word &ldquo;acclaim&rdquo; advisedly, inasmuch as I feel that, even though there are hardships, there is a large measure of approval of the action of the Government.  There permeated many of the speeches of the Opposition a sensible approach and a mild form of approval, to say the least of it, of the removal of the food subsidies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello, not only in his contribution here but in his radio address outside, speaking for himself and, I presume, for the Fine Gael Party, seemed to accept that the subsidies would have to go sooner or later.  He did suggest&mdash;and this is as far as he did go&mdash;that were he given the task of framing this Budget or a Minister under him, an examination of the food subsidies would have had to be undertaken and that, very likely, if I interpret him correctly, there would have had to be a considerable reduction in food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I came into the House, the food subsidies had been introduced, in the supplementary Budget of 1947.  At that time, I remember reading the very sharp and severe criticism by Deputy Norton on the introduction of the food <Col N="1513" /> subsidies.  His criticism almost amounted to a vehement denunciation of them.  It was accepted then that the subsidies were introduced as a temporary measure only, in order to curb what appeared to be a very sudden rise in prices, following which there were likely to be such demands for increased wages as would result in a serious inflationary position.</P>
    <P>I think it is a fair statement to say that the subsidies were then&mdash;apart from the denunciation of Deputy Norton&mdash;accepted as something necessary for the moment, but only as a temporary measure.  Accordingly, it was accepted that the subsidies must be reduced and ultimately abolished in the interests of the country.  I am speaking of subsidies as a social measure, as a means of trying to equate among the different sections of the community the impact of sudden increases in prices or of even gentle increases. I think it is the opinion that the subsidies operated unfairly from the point of view of the taxpayer and of those whom they were designed to assist.</P>
    <P>There can be no contention that subsidies should not be in existence for people who do not need them&mdash;for people with big incomes and other means of support.  They were fundamentally meant to assist people who would feel acutely the rise in prices.  It was found, no doubt after very mature consideration, that a system whereby only those who really needed food subsidies would benefit by them and that those who did not need them would not was very difficult to design and it was decided to make the subsidies of general application.</P>
    <P>Had I spoken yesterday, I would have, at the outset, commented on Deputy Costello's assertion in his opening remarks that the Budget was not concerned in any detail with one penny piece of debt left behind by the inter-Party Government.  I note that a leading article in one of the daily papers this morning takes up that point.  Deputy Costello went on to say that his Government left office with everything paid and provided for.  I do not know with what degree of sincerity <Col N="1514" /> Deputy Costello made that assertion.  I usually value what he says as being considered and as being as accurate as he finds it possible to make any contribution.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputy Costello to examine that statement <i>vis-à-vis</i> the position as the incoming Government found it.  There was almost £6,000,000 short in revenue in the financial year that has just closed.  There was an increase of some £5,000,000 in the general Supply Services Estimate. There was £1,500,000 increased provision for the Central Fund.  We admit there was some compensation, but the net deficit in revenue was some £9,000,000.  In the light of that deficit, I find it difficult to understand why Deputy Costello made the assertion he made.</P>
    <P>I should also like Opposition Deputies to contemplate for a moment the undertaking given on their behalf by the then Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce to the bakers when they, at his behest, awarded increases in wages to their operatives. They did this on his undertaking that they would not suffer any loss in the long run&mdash;that the increases in wages would be made up if they were prepared not to increase the price of bread.  If that meant anything, it was a firm undertaking by the then Tánaiste on behalf of the Government to make up the bakers' losses.</P>
    <P>The present Government accepted Deputy Norton's undertaking to the bakers as a pledge by a Government to be honoured by whatever Government was in power as a continuing obligation.  Unfortunately, in the financial circumstances, we found it impossible to recoup in full what was due to the bakers under that undertaking. As a result of that undertaking and in fulfilment of Deputy Norton's promise to the bakers, the present Government had to find £250,000 which was not in any way provided for in the Estimates prepared by the outgoing Government before they left office.</P>
    <P>There was also the question of the arbitration award to secondary teachers announced on 19th January by the outgoing Government and which involved in the current year the payment <Col N="1515" /> of a sum of £500,000.  That sum was made up of £250,000 to cover arrears, a non-recurring commitment, and a similar amount to cover the increased cost of living.  In the light of these items, it is difficult, I repeat, to understand how Deputy Costello can claim that the Budget was not concerned in any detail with a penny piece of debt left by the inter-Party Government, that they left office with all debts paid and provided for.</P>
    <P>There were commitments and obligations facing this Government when they took office.  One of the decisions that had to be taken related to an increase in premiums on motor car insurance, an increase amounting to some 20 per cent., involving, I should say, on the average motorist an annual increase in outgoings in respect of car maintenance of from £3 to £5.  That claim by the insurance companies was examined by the Advisory Body some 12 months ago, but the outgoing Minister for Industry and Commerce had not taken a decision on it.  It had been kept there without any decision being made on it, possibly without any examination, by the outgoing Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been criticised wrongly for permitting the increase which was recommended to Deputy Norton.  I do not know the figures in relation to premiums paid by motorists compared with the actual payments made in respect of accidents and the commitments arising out of them but I do know, in the case of one small insurance company, that their entire profit in all branches of insurance&mdash; workmen's compensation, fire, theft, public liability&mdash;was more than eaten up by what they lost on payment of claims on motor policies.  I do not know whether or not that was of general application but I assume the Prices Advisory Body had regard to such factors when they advised Deputy Norton, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, that a 20 per cent. increase was justified.  That was one of the other obligations which the outgoing Government failed to face up to.</P>
    <P>Then there was the report of the <Col N="1516" /> Capital Investment Committee&mdash;also set up by the former Government. That report was available to the members of the outgoing Government.  I have no doubt but that some, if not all, of them were well aware of its contents.  The three leaders of the Opposition Parties have, since the Budget, been criticising Fianna Fáil to the effect that during the course of the general election campaign we did not make specific reference to the question of the retention or the abolition of food subsidies.  I suggest it was the duty, in honour, of the members of the outgoing Government&mdash;who, again, knew the contents of the report of the Capital Investment Committee in relation to food subsidies&mdash;to inform the people that, having regard to the present financial situation, such a report was made by a responsible committee set up by them.</P>
    <P>It was not for Fianna Fáil to anticipate nor could it be held that we were in a position to anticipate what the finances of the year would be like at its close at the end of March.  The outgoing Government must have had a good idea of them from their advisers.  Fianna Fáil could not have been in a position to anticipate that some £9,000,000 would have to be found in the current year to at least attempt to balance the Budget.</P>
    <P>I am convinced the outgoing Government knew the recommendation of the Capital Investment Committee in relation to the abolition of the food subsidies.  I am fortified in this by the speech made here&mdash;entirely out of tone, I suggest&mdash;by the outgoing Minister for Industry and Commerce on the occasion of the nomination of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that, even on that occasion, his contribution in the debate would have been on a much higher level but, several times in the course of his short speech, he challenged the incoming Taoiseach as to what Fianna Fáil intended to do in relation to food subsidies.  That indicated to me very clearly that Deputy Norton knew there was a very serious recommendation by the Capital Investment Committee when he made these challenges from this very position in this House.  It was a speech entirely <Col N="1517" /> out of tone with the type of debate we expected on that day and it stuck out like a sore thumb to the extent that, since then, everybody is convinced that Deputy Norton knew, and well knew, the recommendation in relation to food subsidies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello said&mdash;and I think everybody will agree with him&mdash;that the outgoing Government had a difficult year just before they left office.  I suggest that that difficulty was largely of their own making.  They made Utopian promises to the people during the 1954 General Election and at practically all the by-elections that preceded it.  They deluded the people into the belief that the statements made by the members of the 1951-54 Fianna Fáil Government as to the condition of the State's finances and the balance of payments were so much poppycock and that if given the opportunity of going into Government as a Coalition or inter-Party group, or whatever they were going to form, they would prove beyond yea or nay that Fianna Fáil were only trying to adopt a hair-shirt policy in order to penalise the people for putting them out of office in the period 1948-51.</P>
    <P>The second inter-Party Government was a very short time in office when they fully realised the rectitude of the policy Fianna Fáil preached between 1951-54.  In various ways, even though it meant eating their own words in many respects, they tried to implement Fianna Fáil's policy but unfortunately their implementation of it came too late.</P>
    <P>The 1952 Budget&mdash;which was much more heavily denounced and decried by Opposition speakers than is the present one&mdash;was practically adopted by the incoming Government in its entirety.  Not one penny of the extra taxation imposed in that Budget was restored to the taxpayer and, of the amount by which the subsidies were reduced in that Budget, only 5d. was returned to the purchasing public by way of restoration of subsidy on butter. Generally speaking, that Budget which was so wrongly denounced was adopted in its entirely by the incoming Government. As well as that, having examined the facts for themselves, they accepted the statements Fianna <Col N="1518" /> Fáil had been making in relation to the balance of payments and the serious position into which the country would get itself if such a situation were allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>We are told that Fianna Fáil secured office this time by making promises to the people, by telling the people that there was no question of increases in prices, that there was no question of a reduction in food subsidies.  Deputy T. F. O'Higgins went to great pains to prove that it was a matter of Fianna Fáil propaganda during the general election campaign that food subsidies were not to be removed.  He quoted extracts from a statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce some one and a half or two years ago. Far from promising that food subsidies would be retained, I think in the last election, Fianna Fáil concentrated on telling the people, so far as they could, that the position was very serious and one that would require the united effort, not only of the Government but of the people, in order to overcome it. In short, not only in the General Election but in the by-elections which preceded it, practically all of which were won overwhelmingly by Fianna Fáil, we told the people that the hay-ride was over and that the time had come when the Government and the people together had to face up to changing circumstances and realise that no longer could there be expenditure from Government sources, unless there was a corresponding increase in production to maintain the standard of expenditure and the standard of living that such expenditure was giving.</P>
    <P>We asked the people&mdash;and I suggest if any of our election literature is available, I can be borne out&mdash;to come down to realities, but apparently before the change of Government, a strong element of the inter-Party Government were not prepared to face up to realities.  They were not prepared to face up to difficulties, some of which I have already mentioned.  They were not prepared to take decisions which obviously would bring further contumely on their heads.  Ultimately, they left office under circumstances largely similar to those which attended the break-up of the first Coalition, trouble from within.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> I suspect that if the inter-Party Government wished to remain in power such trouble as arose then through the defection of Deputy MacBride and his Party from the inter-Party Government could have been overcome.  In fact, even with the defection of the three Deputies to whom I have referred, the Government, on the motion of no confidence that was put down, would have been able to remain in power, had they so desired; but, as was the case with the previous Coalition, they grasped the occasion of internal strife and dissension and left office, leaving their successors with many of the problems, which the Coalition had largely brought on their own heads, unsolved.</P>
    <P>I think it would be unfair, and certainly far too partisan for me to suggest that the inter-Party Government, or the more responsible elements of it, on realising that there were difficulties, which to a large extent they had got themselves into and which possibly to a lesser extent world conditions had got them into, decided that remedial action should be taken.  In fact, some remedial action was taken in the imposition of the special levies by which it sought to reduce the deficit on the balance of payments.  These levies were admirably successful, but unfortunately, the levies were a double-edged sword because they contributed largely to the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil assumed office, we had to face the problem of deciding whether the levies should be retained or abolished, and we decided that those which so far as we could see in the short time at our disposal were just and put there in the interest of the country should be allowed to remain, temporarily at any rate, and that those which could be removed without affecting the economy and with the hope of stimulating the economy should be removed.</P>
    <P>In that connection, it was decided to remove the levy on goods which could be described as raw materials for productive enterprises, and, by doing so, the Government denied itself an income of £1.7 million in the coming year.  It might have been more or less.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> Also, by doing this, the Government stimulated employment and production and the question immediately arises: in the light of events, would the inter-Party Government have maintained these levies producing £1.7 million?</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, in his radio speech, said, I think, that the Government deliberately threw away as a means of revenue, be it revenue for ordinary revenue purposes or for capital purposes, that £1.7 million, but the possibility was there of removing these levies which were a tax on production and a limitation on employment, or of removing them and easing the budgetary problem.  I doubt if, on contemplation and full examination, Deputy Costello would not have acted as the present Government has acted in that respect.  It must be remarked that in imposing some of these levies, at any rate, the last Government sailed rather close to the wind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that</i> 20 <i>Deputies were not present; House counted, and</i> 20 <i>Deputies being present</i>,</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the imposition of these levies, I was suggesting that the inter-Party Government sailed very close to the wind in relation to the possibility of a breach of trade agreements, particularly the trade agreement with Britain.  In that respect, I should like to refer to the statement of the outgoing Minister for Finance immediately after the Budget statement of the present Minister for Finance, saying that the abolition of the special levy on motor cars exceeding in value £1,300 was the economics of a madman.  But the levy imposed, the present Government were advised, was a clear breach of that agreement and, therefore, in order not to undertake the risk of losing other sections of the agreement, the Government had to decide not to reintroduce that levy.  So, far from being the economics of a madman, it was the economics of men who try to honour international agreements made either by themselves or by their predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have commented on the question whether or not, in regard to the loss of £1.7 million which the abolition of some of these levies meant to the Exchequer, the inter-Party Government <Col N="1521" /> on contemplation might have taken the same course in an effort to stimulate production and employment. Had they done so, I would just like to pose the question: What other means would they have adopted to make good that £1.7 million to the Exchequer? The gap would have been there, as it is now.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to food subsidies, if the inter-Party Government were restored to power in the foreseeable future, would they restore these food subsidies, either entirely or to any extent?  I believe that they would not, but, if they did and if they could, I should like to ask them on what commodities would they increase taxation? It would require an increase in beer, tobacco, cinema seats or otherwise. It certainly would have to be got in some way and I would ask Opposition speakers, at least those of them who would advocate the restoration of the subsidies, to say what commodities they would tax in order to get it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello mentioned that one-half of the small savings which were expected in the current financial year accrued to this Government in the month of April alone, the first month of the financial year, and of course, the bulk of that was brought about by the contributions to the prize bonds fund.  The Minister for Finance gave due commendation to the enterprise of his predecessor in initiating this scheme, but it must be remembered that only about one-third, if indeed one-third, of the total sum ultimately subscribed was in fact subscribed up to the time the change of Government was certain.  I shall not try to contend that the change of Government was entirely responsible for the great upsurge of applications for participation in the prize bonds scheme that occurred from the first week in March onwards, but I certainly would suggest, and I am sure with some degree of justification, that the change of Government did contribute very largely to that upsurge.  It was born, I am certain, of the confidence the people had in the incoming Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with the subsidies before the Deputy came into the House and I do not intend to go back on them, but, in relation to what the Deputy has just said, I might as well recapitulate to this extent, that in so far as I can interpret the speeches made by some of his own colleagues, they suggested that they have accepted that the abolition of the food subsidies was necessary, to what extent in the current year or in the next year, I do not know, but, in so far as some of their speakers are concerned&mdash;some of them very fair&mdash;it could be said that that was a course they would have followed if they were given responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is completely in conflict with what Deputy Costello said on two occasions.  Apart from the abolition of the food subsidies, which was a step that was taken and that had to be taken, the Deputy will remember that many newspapers, showing what was once described in the House as intelligent anticipation, said that the food subsidies would probably go.  I think that fairly reflected the mind of the majority of the people.  I think there was general anticipation that, if the food subsidies did not go entirely, they would go in a large measure.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the fact that the upsurge and increase in small savings was largely attributable to the fact that a change of Government was about to take place, that, at the end of the first week of March, it was certain that a Fianna Fáil Government would take over.</P>

      <P>I have already mentioned the fact that the outgoing Government did take some ameliorative measures on the question of the balance of payments and I also would like to say that the tax remission they gave on profits from new exports was another step in the right direction.  The tax remission as given by them, of course, was on new exports only and those firms who, without subsidy or tax remission on profits, pioneered production for the export market were left out in the cold, possibly because the outgoing Minister could not find the necessary finance for them.  But, when the new Government came in, it was decided that all exports, not only the increase of exports, but all exports of any firm, should also get certain tax remission on profits. That was a step in the right direction, which has received due commendation from the leader of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The capital needs, as pointed out by the Minister, amount to £31,000,000, which is some reduction on what was budgeted for the capital programme last year.  In relation to our Capital Budget, for many years now, we have been devoting capital moneys to projects of a social nature, projects which are to some extent productive, but not really productive.  Even though they were not really productive, they were absolutely necessary in many respects. In relation to housing, hospitalisation and other social amenities, that was due to the fact that in such a short time successive Irish Governments had to make up such a great back-log.</P>
      <P>It has often been contended that these projects should be financed out of current account and I presume that was done at one stage.  Unfortunately, the magnitude of the task, the amount of money involved, having regard to the reasonable taxation that we could afford, made that impossible.  There-fore, capital moneys that might not in the ordinary course of events have been devoted to such purposes had, of necessity, to be devoted to housing, hospitalisation, sewarage schemes, school buildings, and other developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> The effect was that much of our skilled and semi-skilled labour was diverted to these projects and these big undertakings.  Many local authorities have already achieved their housing targets, and much of the labour to which I have referred now finds itself without an outlet.  There were subsidiary activities, joinery, paint manufacture and other activities like that to which other labour was attracted and that labour cannot find an outlet.  To that extent, these projects, which should have been productive, were not productive.  I am not expressing criticism, but unfortunately I do not think the Governments of the country faced this matter in time and made allowance for the absorption of that labour by some other means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The time has come when that must be done.  There has been a tailing-off in the capital projects of many local authorities.  In many cases, including my constituency, the tailing-off stage has not been quite reached.  Even though there has been the necessity for some cutting down, I hope that that can be avoided for at least another year or two.  Nevertheless, unproductive capital undertakings must be continued and in the meantime the money that possibly can be saved for capital purposes must be diverted in other directions.  That money must be directed towards more productive activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, of course, has already tried to give an earnest of its desire to do so, first of all, in relation to forestry and then in relation to certain sea fishery undertakings.  The Minister has provided for a new ice plant in Dunmore East where, unfortunately, in the past financial year we saw the sad picture of thousands and thousands of pounds worth of good food being necessarily wasted because the huge catches of herrings were incapable of being consumed or marketed.  It is in these directions, by providing capital works of that nature, that we will be able, to some extent, at any rate to divert labour which is now redundant.  We hope to do that and to absorb an increasing amount of <Col N="1525" /> that labour and especially of those who have gone abroad.  I have already made reference in this House to people who emigrate and reference was made again to emigration here to-day.  I am convinced that many people who emigrated in recent times had no good reason for doing so.</P>

      <P>There are many who emigrate within a matter of days of losing their employment who in ordinary circumstances would remain, if this bug of emigration had not infected the whole country.  They would have stayed at home and possibly would have turned into some other type of employment.  I said during the course of the Estimate for the Department of Education that we needed some form of crusade and I was criticised and told that it should not come from teachers or politicians.  I feel that disinterested young men of influence in the country should try to start a crusade and tell young people who might think that they had to emigrate that they owed something to the country and that now was the time to give it their love and interest.  If that happened, we would, to a large extent, curb some of these from emigrating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, it behoves the Government of the day to create as much employment as possible.  I am <Col N="1526" /> not going to suggest that capital moneys are the only means of providing such employment.  I am convinced that the best means of providing employment is through private investment. If there was sufficient confidence in the Government and the country and in the future of the country, and particularly in the financial position of the country, I believe there would be a sufficient volume of such private investment to provide the necessary increased employment.  It would enable us successfully to produce agricultural and industrial goods so that we would be able to export the surplus.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy of the Labour Party asked what was the use of encouraging more production when we could consume only a limited amount of it here in this country.  He was speaking in relation to butter and said that we might have to subsidise the exportable surplus.  As I understand the drive for production, it is designed mainly to reduce the cost of production.  If one can produce with the same tools and the same machines 20 per cent. more goods than would otherwise be produced; if one, through using new techniques and in the case of farming, through fertilisers, can reduce the unit cost of production then one would be able to sell the product at home at a cheaper rate, increase one's home sales and be better able to compete on markets abroad.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the contention that production should be discouraged because we might have to subsidise our exportable surplus in any one commodity. I think the ideal in increasing production should be to decrease the unit cost of production.  In order to create that private enterprise to which I have referred, the first and most essential thing is to secure stability and to secure as far as possible confidence in the country and in its future.  I believe that the first task in that respect is for the Government to create confidence in its own finances.</P>
    <P>Even though I am not a very advanced economic student, I can now appreciate the views given by Government experts over the years in the matter of balancing Budgets.  I <Col N="1527" /> appreciate that, unless the Budget is balanced, one is going to create dislocation and discontent in those who invest in our State finances, or those who, in fact, invest in the future economy of the country.  For that reason, and even though this Budget is severe and is a bit harder than any Government would have liked to introduce, I believe the people generally agree it was essential and agree that from it will flow these very necessary improvements and the private investment that is so desirable and so essential for the expansion of our economy in the future.</P>
    <P>I must comment that most of the speeches made will not touch off any disturbing factors, now that a realisation of the serious position of the country has come to the people and hope they will not do so.  I believe we can achieve that goal.  We already have achieved a situation of confidence in the Government.  We can achieve the necessary increase in private investment and in investment in Government projects by that means.  With the assistance of the people, we will be able to mark this year as at least one point from which we will never go back, but from which we will progress in the interests of the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I recall that, last year, the then Minister for Finance had to face much the same situation as faced the present Minister for Finance last week when introducing his Budget? He had then a deficit of £5.3 million in his current Budget.  He looked around and he had to go far afield to make provision for that deficit.  The subsidies were staring him in the face but he did not touch them.  He imposed taxes on matches, table waters, dances, cigarettes and petrol.  The taxes were very severe and they were criticised very severely.  I myself was very critical of the tax on petrol, but I have a distinct remembrance of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, complimenting Deputy Sweetman on his courage and vision in balancing his Budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister in introducing his Budget then, laid emphasis on the fact that it was his aim to balance the Budget and to see that in the interests of the nation and in the interests of stability here, we would have a balanced Budget from year to year.  We all know that this has been a most disastrous year for any Minister for Finance.  All during 1955, there was a gradual drop in the unemployment figure, until about the end of 1955 when the turn came because of international circumstances.  A lot of our troubles in this country are due to the fact that we do not realise our own limitations. It is quite obvious to us now that every jolt in international affairs has its repercussions here.  The year 1956 was a year of grave anxiety the world over and that anxiety had it repercussions in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, the Minister for Finance, in his statement, said there was a deficit of £5.9 million in the current Budget.  That deficit is explained by a <Col N="1529" /> drop of £4,500,000 in the estimated sum in revenue and a drop of £1,500,000 in the estimated sum of over-expenditure during 1956.  I cannot understand at all the inconsistency that has been shown in the figures given by Ministers and some Deputies on the Government side during this debate. We must take it that the figures given by the Minister for Finance are the authentic figures.  Leaving aside the capital Budget&mdash;nobody last year could have estimated capital expenditure with any sort of accuracy&mdash;the Minister for Finance truly said that the drop in savings was at the root of all our financial troubles.  Capital Budgets have to find their finances from savings and from borrowing.  With a drop in savings and with the failure of the National Loan, there was no hope of our having any success in that field during the past 12 months.  I sincerely hope the Minister will have more success in his efforts during the next 12 months and succeeding years and will not have to face the agony, anxiety and gloom the previous Minister had to face during the latter part of 1955 and all during 1956.</P>
    <P>Let us come to the present Minister's handling of the Budget this year.  Let us go back to the history of the subsidies that were applied to help to cushion the people against the high cost of living.  They were applied, in <Col N="1530" /> the first instance, because of the severe cost of living and they were gradually increased over the years as the exigencies and circumstances of the time demanded.  Having been gradually increased, I hold that, to avoid a jolt to our stability here, they should be removed in the same way&mdash; gradually over a period.  Nobody anticipated their removal this year.  I have a great feeling that, as well as the jolt such action will give to our economy and stability, the disappointment resulting from it will be even greater and will have an even more disastrous effect.</P>
    <P>The argument was put forward here by the Tánaiste that the one disadvantage in the food subsidies was that they benefited all sections, both rich and poor.  The Government that applied the food subsidies originally must have been aware of that.  The same argument could be applied to children's allowances.  Personally, I do not know if it was a wise provision at any time or prudent administration to apply food subsidies and to have a scheme of children's allowances.</P>
