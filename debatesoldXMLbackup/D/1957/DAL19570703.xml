    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bartley) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bartley)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend our existing law relating to industrial property and copyright in order to bring our legislation into conformity with three international conventions. None of the amendments affects the basic principles of our law in these matters which is embodied in the Acts of 1927 and 1929.</P>
      <P>The three conventions to be implemented are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the revised Industrial Property Convention signed at London in 1934,</P>
      <P>(2)  the revised Berne Copyright Convention signed at Brussels in 1948, and</P>
      <P>(3)  the Universal Copyright Convention signed at Geneva in 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay in implementing the London convention arose because it was considered at the time that a number <Col N="525" /> of other amendments to our law concerning patents and trade marks might be necessary.  Examination of this question was impeded by the war after which it became clear that the conventions relating to copyright were likely to be revised by later conventions. There were two subsequent conventions and it was considered that implementation of the three conventions would be conveniently embodied in a single statute for the purpose.</P>
    <P>As regards the first convention the object of the international convention for the Protection of Industrial Property is to develop and unify the laws and practices of member countries in relation to the protection of industrial property and to secure the grant of reciprocal rights between member states.  The convention was revised at the London Conference of 1934 which was attended by a delegation from this country.  The convention is a worldwide organisation embracing some 43 member states.  It is administrated by the International Union for the Protection of Industrial Property, a body with headquarters in Berne, which is concerned with patents, trade marks and designs.</P>
    <P>Under our existing law every application for a patent, except those made under the international convention, must contain the name of the true and first inventor but the true and first inventor is not mentioned in the patent. Section 2 of the Bill provides, in accordance with the revised convention, for the mention, on his request, of the name of the true and first inventor in the patent granted for an invention.</P>
    <P>Section 4 extends to aircraft and land vehicles temporarily imported into the State the immunity from action for infringement of patent rights now enjoyed by certain foreign vessels in respect of inventions used in the machinery or appliances connected with the vessel.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 relate to designs.  It will be no longer necessary for an article to which a registered design is applied to bear a prescribed mark to denote that the design is registered; and the registration of a design will <Col N="526" /> not in future be cancelled merely on the grounds that it is not being utilised industrially in this country.</P>
    <P>Section 7 grants applicants for patents under the convention the same rights to a single patent for cognate inventions as are at present accorded to non-convention applications.</P>
    <P>Many of the amendments required to implement the conventions involve mere changes in procedure or in the periods of time in which certain things are to be done.  Examples of this kind of amendment are the provision to prevent abuse of monopoly rights in Section 3, the international arrangements connected with applications for patents, and for registration of designs or of trade marks in Section 7.</P>
    <P>The subject of copyright is dealt with by two of the international conventions already mentioned.  The first, the International Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, was revised in Brussels in 1948.  This convention, which is commonly called the Berne Copyright Convention, provides for reciprocal rights between countries of the so-called Berne Union. The main principle laid down is that a work first published in any country which is a member of the union is accorded the same protection in each of the other countries of the union as if it were first published in each of these countries.  The union embraces some 50 States throughout the world but does not include the United States or any of the countries of the Pan-American Union.</P>
    <P>The second convention relating to copyright is the Universal Copyright Convention, which was the outcome of a world inter-governmental conference at Geneva in 1952 and was the culmination of action by U.N.E.S.C.O. begun in 1947.  It marked the first occasion in which the United States and the other countries of the Pan-American Union entered into an agreement with the countries of the Berne Union in the matter of copyright.  Because of the many interests covered by this convention the measure of agreement embodied in it is necessarily restricted to basic principles.</P>
    <P>Fundamental changes are not <Col N="527" /> necessary to bring our legislation into conformity with these two conventions.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the Brussels revision of the Berne Convention is effected by Sections 9, 10 and 12 of the Bill. Section 156 of the 1927 Act provides that any time after the expiration of 25 years from the death of the author of a published work reproduction of the work is permitted, provided the publisher pays the copyright owner 10 per cent. royalties.  This provision conflicts with the Brussels revision and its repeal is necessary in order to enable this country to accede to the convention.  Section 9 of the Bill accordingly grants absolute protection for the full agreed term of copyright, i.e., the author's or artist's lifetime and 50 years after his death.  In the case of works of joint authorship, Section 10 extends the period of copyright to 50 years after the death of the author who dies last in lieu of the existing provision of 50 years after the death of the author who dies first. Section 12 in effect extends copyright protection to all cinematographic works; and also alters the definition of &ldquo;simultaneous publication&rdquo; in the 1927 Act from within 14 days to within 30 days.</P>
    <P>Sections 8, 11 and 13 of the Bill arise out of the Universal Copyright Convention. Section 8 provides that copyright in a protected work shall, as regards translation into the Irish language, cease to exist at the expiration of seven years from the first publication of the work instead of ten years as at present, unless the author has the work translated into Irish in the meantime. Section 11 enables the Government to protect by Order the work of a national of a contracting State first published in a non-contracting State. Section 13 provides protection for the unpublished and published works of the United Nations, its organs and specialised agencies, and the Organisation of American States, and empowers the Government to extend copyright protection to such other international organisations as they may think fit and specify by Order.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the convention will not involve any additional costs of <Col N="528" /> administration.  I recommend the principle of the Bill for approval by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was, of course, prepared by the outgoing Government. It is a necessary Bill for the purpose of confirming the convention to which the Parliamentary Secretary has referred.  The whole system of patent and copyright law is one which is extremely complicated and one into which I do not propose to delve this morning.  The Parliamentary Secretary will, no doubt, be relieved to hear that I do not propose to cross-examine him on his knowledge of patent and copyright law for a variety of reasons, the principal being that I do not know sufficient about the subject myself to do so.</P>
      <P>There are three points I should like to make and three questions I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to answer.  What is the position here in relation to the protection of a patent or copyright against the State?  Is the State in the some position as any ordinary private individual, if it infringes either copyright or the ordinary patent law in relation to mechanical inventions? Our situation here is, I think, somewhat different in that respect from the situation which obtains on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Deputy to amplify that?  Could he give us some examples of the type of situation he visualises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Suppose, for example, an author prepares a paper and does not publish it himself and the State subsequently decides, for its own purpose, to publish that paper, is the State bound to pay him the equivalent of a royalty for his authorship in respect of that paper?  Suppose, for example, a private person makes a plan involving certain mechanical inventions and suppose that plan is submitted to the State for a purpose and not used by the State for the purpose submitted, is the State then entitled to utilise it without breach of patent or breach of copyright for other purposes? Or is the State in exactly the same position as any private individual?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the law, if the <Col N="529" /> Parliamentary Secretary writes a pamphlet, even if it is a pamphlet extolling the virtues of Fianna Fáil, I am not entitled to utilise such a pamphlet or to reproduce it, though, in such circumstances, I could hardly see myself assisting in any such reproduction. If the Parliamentary Secretary writes an article on some aspect of fishing in Connemara and publishes that as a private pamphlet and sells it himself, is the State entitled to take that pamphlet and reproduce it or republish it without payment, or is the State in exactly the same situation as any ordinary private individual?  I think the State is in the same position as a private individual, but I should like the situation confirmed.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the water, I think the position is not the same.  As I understand the law there, the State has absolute right to do what it wishes in that respect and is bound only to give a gratuity, which it does, equivalent to what would be the copyright. Here the position is different.  I should like confirmation.</P>
    <P>The other question I wanted the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with is the position of copyright in relation to broadcasting and television.  Television has become a matter of some public controversy at the moment. What is the situation there in respect of reproduction?  Is it covered by the copyright laws we have here?  Is it covered by this Bill?  What is the exact situation now?</P>
    <P>Apart from that, in relation to ordinary broadcasting, what is the law?  Is there a copyright in respect of it and, under these conventions, are we doing anything to enlarge its scope or to restrict the existing scope of copyright in respect of sound broadcasting problems?</P>
    <P>Broadcasting itself is hardly a problem and when the 1927 parent Act was going through the Houses of the Oireachtas, certainly, television was not a problem then.  Television now seems to be a matter that is coming to the fore and it would be as well if the position, in so far as these conventions and this Bill deal with either of these subjects, were clarified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position as <Col N="530" /> sketched by Deputy Sweetman in relation to the practice in England may have had its origin in constitutional usage there, based on the principle that the King can do no wrong.  We have not any such position here.  We have a written Constitution and it is a matter of common knowledge that a Minister of State can be prosecuted for almost any act of tort.  I do not know exactly what difference Deputy Sweetman wants to inject into the vindication of rights in respect of copyright as compared with ordinary actions of the kind which we see occasionally reported in the papers and which in fact find their way into our courts.  In any case, the positive reply to the specific question which he has put to me is that, in fact, the individual has a right as against the State and his right is protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the simple answer to his question.  I take it that that will also apply to any infringements of copyright which may be laid at the door of the television authority when we have such an authority in this country.</P>
      <P>This Bill really implements the findings of two conventions, one of which was held as far back as 1934 and in respect to which, for various reasons, but principally because of the war, no legislative action was taken.</P>
      <P>I am advised that further conventions will be necessary and that, arising out of the deliberations of these further conventions, additional legislation will be required to bring our copyright law and the laws for the protection of industrial property into consonance with present day conditions.</P>

      <P>What is the situation in respect of the misuse of the arms of a corporation?  Can they come in under this agreement?  What happens very often is that souvenirs are made outside the country and come in here with the arms of a particular corporation on them.  It could happen even in Galway.  Will this agreement give us any protection against that sort of abuse for corporative bodies here as apart from private individuals?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,440 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Secretary to the President, and for certain <Col N="533" /> other Expenses of the President's Establishment (No. 24 of 1938).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it this Estimate includes all the expenses which make up the President's establishment? At present, the public are being exhorted by the Government and by responsible people inside and outside the House to tighten their belts and spend less.  As a matter of fact, it has been decided generally that Government spending all round should be reduced, if at all possible.  That has been accepted here.  But when we come to putting such an agreement into operation, we find it is a different matter altogether.</P>
      <P>I do not know how true this Book of Estimates is but I presume it is correct. This year the total expenditure on the President's establishment, as outlined in the Book of Estimates, is £50,478.  To my mind, that is pretty hefty expenditure in view of the general situation.  A sum of £50,000 on the President's establishment, at a time when we are not even able to give reasonable employment in the City of Dublin, to me sounds very contradictory on the part of those people who maintain that their main interest is the working man.</P>
      <P>In connection with the figure I mentioned, I note that the emoluments and allowances of the President himself are £11,500.  I do not suggest for one moment that the President&mdash;a man for whom I have the greatest respect&mdash; utilises this allowance for himself.  I understand it is for entertainment purposes for visitors from abroad and so forth.  In my opinion, we are doing this thing on too big a scale for this small Republic.  I believe that in this regard we are aping our neighbours, who can afford this pomp and luxury expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear that our presidential establishment is modelled, in a smaller way no doubt, on the establishment we find in the neighbouring island, with the one exception that over there the person at the top is described as &ldquo;Her Majesty, the Queen&rdquo; and here it is &ldquo;His Excellency, the President&rdquo;.  Both have <Col N="534" /> about the same amount of power, though I would say there is more power in the hands of Her Majesty, the Queen than lies in the hands of our President but the same type of pomp and ceremonial goes on in each establishment.  I do not think it was ever envisaged here that an Irish Republic would go in for this type of ceremonial.  The upkeep of this establishment is costly and the expense in connection with public works and buildings is considerable.  The whole set-up is one that should be examined. If only for the sake of setting a good example, there should be a cut of at least 25 per cent. in the expenditure for the coming year on this establishment.</P>
    <P>There is one point I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  I understand that the President keeps horses on behalf of the Irish people. Just as her Majesty has her horses in Britain, our President has his horses here and runs them at Leopardstown and other racecourses.  If he is to have horses for that purpose, I suggest it would be no harm at this stage to revert to the old style escort the President had here, a horse escort.  If it is logical to keep and run horses in the name of the Irish people, surely it is rather contradictory to have the President followed all over the country by a motor-cycle escort?  We are noted as a country famed for the breeding of first-class horses, and here we have the President himself utilising a motor-cycle escort and a car escort, composed of imported commodities, when he could be utilising Irish thoroughbreds for escort purposes.  This use would give first-class publicity to the fact that we have such horses.</P>
    <P>My suggestion to the Minister is that the question should be re-examined.  If it is found that we must keep racehorses to enter in the &ldquo;National&rdquo; and other races, then let us keep horses for ceremonial escorts of this kind.  I would ask the Minister to do that or, if it is not possible for him to do so, to bring the matter to the attention of the occupant of this post in the hope that he himself will take the necessary steps to restore the practice that obtained hitherto.  I understand the majority of those people who admire the establishment <Col N="535" /> in the park are disappointed, and have been disappointed over the years, that this change was made in connection with the ceremonial array and escort.  It is desirable that their wishes in this regard should be met.  I hope every effort will be made drastically to reduce the expenditure in this establishment. It is no good asking people to reduce expenditure, unless the people at the very top are prepared to set the good example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not very much to say to the points made by Deputy McQuillan.  The big item in this Estimate, of course, is for Board of Works expenditure, both on new works and maintenance of the President's establishment, both of which would be regarded as capital expenditure.  I have pointed out that the President's salary is £5,000 and the allowance for entertainment is £6,500. I suppose if we want the luxury of having a Head of the State, we cannot do it for very much less than that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the horses to which the Deputy referred, the horses produced by the National Stud are run in the name of the President.  He has no further interest in them except that his name is being used.  I do not know if he has better information about the horses than anybody else before they run.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he will take all possible steps to ensure that native fuel is used for the heating of this building.  It is deplorable that up to the present the heating has been provided by means of oil, a foreign fuel.  It is a very extraordinary position to have at the moment, in view of the necessity for cutting down imports.  The various Departments of State have exhorted public bodies and firms to utilise Irish fuel for energy and heating purposes and surely it is not too much to suggest that the Houses of the Oireachtas should set the example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unsatisfactory that the accounting officer of the Central Statistics Office should be the Secretary of the Department of Finance.  The Central Statistics Office was deliberately taken out of the purview of the Department of Industry and Commerce and put under the control of the Taoiseach, for the specific purpose of ensuring that so far as possible it would not merely give&mdash;as I believe it does give&mdash;entirely independent statistics but that, in addition, they would seem to be independent.  It is unsatisfactory that any Vote should have as its accounting officer a civil servant who is not in the Department responsible for it.</P>
      <P>That was the position, I might add, that I found in respect of Vote 22&mdash; Universities and Colleges.  The Secretary of the Department of Finance was the person responsible to account for Vote 22, but the Minister for Education was the person who had the responsibility of submissions in respect of universities and colleges and education generally.  It seemed to me to be quite incomprehensible and incompatible with good administration.  I arranged that the accounting this year would be changed to the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An exactly similar situation arises in respect of the Central Statistics Office. I do not see why the Taoiseach should not take the accounting for this Vote under his wing in the same way as he deals with the Arts Council for which there is a separate Vote.  However, the Minister for Finance this year is responsible for the accounting of the Central Statistics Office to this House and I should like to know what are the <Col N="538" /> prospects of further expedition in the production of the statistics which are so necessary for the purpose of being able to appreciate and prognosticate our economic trends.  I do not want, in saying that, to be taken in any way as being critical of the work of the Statistics Office as it is.  I have the utmost respect for and appreciation of that work and of the assistance it was to me when I was on the Minister's side of the House.</P>
    <P>I do think we are a long way behind here in the production of vital statistics&mdash;I do not mean vital in the sense of life&mdash;of the necessary statistics to gauge economic trends, and that these statistics produced here are, of necessity, very much more slowly produced than the same statistics are produced in other countries.  I think part of that difficulty arises, not from the Statistics Office, but from the fact that the commercial community have not yet appreciated how necessary is the provision of economic statistics for governmental direction and, ultimately, for their own benefit.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that the Minister will be able to give us some assurance that during the coming year steps will be taken to expedite the production of these documents, and of these figures, which will enable us to form a more mature judgment of our economic prospects at an earlier date.  <i>The Irish Statistical Survey</i>, which is one of the most valuable documents published under this Vote, would be of even greater value if it were made available earlier in the year.  It is one of the documents the earlier publication of which would probably do more than anything else to influence economic thought amongst people outside, rather than the cold statistics normally published which are considered, in the main, only by experts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>With regard to the accounting, the idea is that there is a certain economy in having a department of accounts in the Department of Finance, as well as in the Taoiseach's office.  I do not know whether there would be any point in changing that or not.  There would be a certain amount of extra expense and there <Col N="539" /> might not be much to gain by the change.</P>
      <P>As regards the publications of the Statistics Office, I am assured they are as prompt in issuing these figures, whatever they may relate to, as in other small countries.  We may not be as quick as some of the big countries, but we are as good as some of the small countries.  All the figures are reliable, generally informative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The job of auditor is not merely one of checking tots and making sure that there have not been misappropriations, though even in that respect I want to express a doubt.  The job of an auditor is to advise the commercial firm concerned and I do not think the function of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, in relation to ordinary Civil Service auditing, is one <Col N="540" /> that means his office and his staff are constructed and equipped for the purpose of dealing with a commercial audit which is an entirely different thing.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor-General, in his capacity as auditor for the ordinary Civil Service Supply and Central Fund expenditure, is merely making sure that expenditure has been issued within the ambit of the various Votes, and making certain that the provisions which have been granted by this House in particular, and by the Oireachtas in Appropriations and Central Fund Bills, have not been exceeded.  It is not part of his function to make any effort to suggest new methods, to make any effort to suggest more efficient methods, or to alter any form of the accounting.  A commercial auditor, however, is expected by the firm or company which retains his services not merely to make sure the tots are correct but to do a great deal more.  A commercial auditing firm is in a position, for example, to make checks in relation to possible misappropriations and defalcations on a commercial venture which the Comptroller and Auditor-General is not in a position to make.  A good commercial auditor has experience of these matters and he is able to put his finger, in relation to various types of business, on the place where it is desirable for him to make absolutely certain that his clients have not been misled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good commercial auditor is also bound to give, and does give, to his clients, considerable advice on the form of the presentation of their accounts, on their accounting system, and will also assist his clients in pointing out to them what lines of business appear cursorily, from the examination of their audit, not to be working as they should.  I do not think the Comptroller and Auditor-General is in any way qualified to do that in his office.  In saying that, I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not casting any aspersions whatever on the personnel of that office&mdash;on the contrary &mdash; but the job they have been brought up to do, the job of auditing Supply and Central Fund expenditure, is in itself entirely different from the <Col N="541" /> job of dealing with the commercial audit of semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>So far as I can recollect, there are some 20 of these outside bodies, some partly inside, some partly outside, for which the Comptroller and Auditor-General acts as the commercial auditor. They are Irish Shipping, Limited, Fuel Importers, Limited, Mianraí Teoranta, Ceimicí Teoranta, Bord Fáilte, the Central Bank, the Irish Assurance Company, Shannon Airport catering service, the Army canteens, Aer Lingus, Aer Linte, Aer Rianta, Bord na Móna, the National Stud, Irish Steel Holdings, Tea Importers, Grain Importers, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, the Arts Council and Foras Tionscail.  I am sure that list is not exhaustive, but it is a list in respect of some of which I have no doubt whatsoever that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has his audit machinery quite competently organised but in respect of others of which I do not think he has.</P>
    <P>I believe that part of the reason is that it was thought it would save some part of the costs from an Exchequer point of view having the Comptroller and Auditor-General do it.  If that is to be the situation, there should be a separate commercial section of his Department to deal with semi-State organisations.  It should not be, as it is at present, merely merged and amalgamated with the ordinary Supply and Central Fund expenditure audit. I want to deal with certain other modernisations which I think are necessary in our accounting system but I think it would be more proper to deal with it on Vote 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers for Finance in the past insisted on having the work done by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The Minister for Finance at the time felt he would get more uniform information from the various bodies and that his interests would be better looked after by having the Comptroller and Auditor-General audit the accounts.  I do not know exactly what the considerations were.  I would have to look into the matter and see. There are about 20 bodies&mdash;I think Deputy Sweetman named practically all of them&mdash;whose accounts are <Col N="542" /> audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  They are all bodies in which the Minister for Finance has a financial interest and for that reason the Comptroller and Auditor-General did the audit.  There may be something in what the Deputy says, that a commercial auditor with more experience of business might be better in certain respects but I am afraid this matter will have to be considered more fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is <Col N="544" /> aware, a new Civil Service Commission Bill was passed at the end of last year. I should like to know from the Minister whether all the necessary consequential Orders have now been made. I think they have but I should like confirmation in that respect.  Actually, I think they were made before the Minister took office.  In addition, I should like to know how experience has shown the administration under the new measure is progressing or whether some of the reforms that were considered desirable have, in fact, proved to be successful.</P>
      <P>This is also the Estimate by virtue of which the Local Appointments Commission is provided for.  Again, I understand, that while the Civil Service Commission is entirely a matter for the Minister for Finance, I thought the Local Appointments Commission as such came under the direction of the Taoiseach rather than the Minister for Finance.  I think I am correct in saying, however, that sub-head A (2)&mdash; Salaries and Fees to the Examiners of the Local Appointments Commission&mdash; is included here.  Perhaps the situation is that while the administration is dealt with by the Minister for Finance the policy is dealt with by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that there is and has been for many years&mdash; I freely admit that the Minister can say it was so during the past three years also&mdash;considerable public apprehension about the working of the Local Appointments Commission.  There has always been and always will be some doubt in relation to the work of any commission of any sort like that which has so much power in the selection of personnel for local authorities.  That is inevitable but I think the Local Appointments Commission add to the suspicion that is thrown round all their working by the air of secrecy with which everything they do is covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be far better and far more satisfactory, in dispelling the suspicion that undoubtedly exists throughout the country, if the Local Appointments Commission made a practice not merely of dealing with the second person who is recommended for a position but also if it made it the normal practice of telling the local <Col N="545" /> authorities, or anyone interested on the local authorities who would inquire, what the approximate order of merit was of the first three or half dozen candidates.</P>
    <P>Very often one hears that an outstanding person is going up for a particular local authority position.  Someone else is recommended by the Local Appointments Commission and is appointed.  I have known cases where I once felt that the commission should be attacked vigorously for not giving the position to a person who was undoubtedly the most qualified man but then I discovered that the most qualified man had been offered it and had refused.  The air of secrecy which surrounds all the abracadabra of the commission's recommendations to local authorities means that there is bound to be suspicion and distrust, where no suspicion or distrust need arise if this commission acted in the ordinary way applicable to people, for example, sitting for an examination.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with the principle of ensuring that merit should always get a position.  I am not certain that it does with the Local Appointments Commission, but that is due to the regulations within which the commissioners have to work, rather than to any individual bias.  I am not competent to say whether these regulations are satisfactory or can be bettered.  I hear people who are competent to form an opinion criticising them even more vigorously than I do.  That is a nettle which someone will have to grasp at some stage.</P>
    <P>I am not competent to judge whether the methods adopted by the commission to ensure that due and adequate regard and appreciation are given to the national language are the right methods, but I have heard many people who are properly qualified to speak on that subject say they have grave doubts about it.  It certainly is a problem which will have to be faced if our system of appointments to local authorities is not to be left in distrust by all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Civil Service Commission Act, it came into operation in February and of course <Col N="546" /> we have not very much experience of it yet but certainly there has been no complaint.  I think it is running very smoothly.</P>
      <P>The question raised by the Deputy regarding the Local Appointments Commission is a very big one.  My own experience in other Departments is that the Department settles with the commission the qualifications necessary. Sometimes the commissioners argue very strongly on some aspect to which the Department may not seem to be paying sufficient attention, but at any rate the qualifications are settled in the end and it is on those qualifications that the advertisement is issued.</P>
      <P>I think the system of appointment there is really foolproof against the use of any influence.  The candidates do not know who is on the interview board until they come before it.  As Deputies know, the commissioners themselves are not on the board; they appoint the board.  I do not think we could improve on the system as laid down.</P>
      <P>There may be something in what the Deputy says, that there is too much secrecy and that that gives rise to suspicion.  However, it might not be advisable to change that.  For instance, take the case mentioned by the Deputy.  If it is made known that so-and-so was offered a post and did not take it, then everyone would know that the man who got the post eventually was only second best.  In the case of a county surgeon, people would say: &ldquo;We have not got the best surgeon; we have got only a stop-gap.&rdquo;  Therefore, there are various aspects which must be taken into account in considering these things.</P>

      <P>A Bill was passed to give civil servants the opportunity of commuting part of their pensions and substituting for the pension so commuted an equivalent, according to the life tables of the pension, for the wife or certain dependents.  I think it is under this Vote that the practice under that Act should be discussed.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether that Act, since it was passed and came into operation, has been availed of to any degree or not.

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the 20th March last I have had some reason to discuss with colleagues of mine in the solicitors' profession delays arising in relation to the settlement of the valuations of estates for death duty purposes. There has been a considerable improvement over the past years in the position in this respect.  However, I am afraid it is not the inadequate work of the personnel, by any means, that is causing the delay, but the system.  Representations have been made to the Commissioners of Valuation to the effect that the system should be changed somewhat so as to ensure that there would be reasonable expedition in the determination of these valuations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most inconvenient&mdash;this does not affect the solicitors' profession in the slightest&mdash;to the next of kin or to the devisees under wills that they are not able to know for a substantial period what is the valuation on which <Col N="552" /> they are to be charged death duties. Until such time as they are aware of the final claim for estate duty or succession duty, it is obvious they cannot make their plans in relation to the user of the property in the future. It is, therefore, vital to their interests that the valuations of such estates, such lands, houses or property as belong to people who have died, would be dealt with at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able, with the assistance of the Commissioners of Valuation, to bring into operation a scheme through which the delays at present in existence will be virtually removed.  I should like to make it clear, at the same time, that the personnel of the office are most helpful in dealing with such cases when they are brought to their attention, but the general run of cases involves delays that make it extremely difficult for beneficiaries.  I shall spare the Minister by not going into a discussion on valuations generally.  This would require new legislation and is too late in the session to get into such long discussions.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to a matter I raised earlier in the session by way of parliamentary question.  It is in connection with the two-thirds allowances given on new factory buildings.  This allowance is not applicable where a new building is erected on the site of an old building which has been demolished and which has not been struck off the valuation list one year or more before the application for the two-thirds allowance has been made.  I suggest that the provision would be altered to ensure that if an industrialist came along to start a new factory he would be entitled to the full two-thirds rebate on the entire valuation of the new building, built on <Col N="553" /> the site of a demolished old one.  I think this would be an encouragement to industrial development in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take a note of it. I imagine the provision was made to ensure that the old building was down before the allowance was given in respect of the new one&mdash;a safeguard, if you like.</P>

      <P>Last year I think a start was made on the precise levelling of the country based on the mean sea level datum in place of the old datum which was 21 feet, I think, below the mark on the base of the Poolbeg Lighthouse. That is necessary to ensure that our maps and charts can be read on an international basis.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what progress has been made in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think a new tide gate station was to be erected at Portmore Pier, Malin Head, to give the reading on which this datum would be based.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to tell us what revision has been carried out of the various Ordnance Survey maps.  I think a periodic revision of the 25-inch sheets is carried out every year.  As well as I recollect&mdash;perhaps Deputy Griffin would be more certain about it than I&mdash;County Meath was scheduled for revision during the year just closed.  I wonder whether that revision was carried through.  The megalithic survey in County Meath was to be completed last year.  Was it, in fact, completed and was it continued on into County Tipperary, as <Col N="554" /> was proposed?

      <P>There are just two matters to which I wish to refer.  The first concerns the recent issue of Exchequer Bills.  I am glad to say that we have had a great success and that the issue was oversubscribed. It gives us great encouragement to proceed with this type of borrowing in the future and, I hope, on a more extended scale.  I cannot say now when we shall be in a position to issue bills of this kind again but, as Deputies are aware, the present bills will be due for redemption at the end of September.  Therefore, around that time, if not sooner, I presume we shall be on the market again for more of these Exchequer Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 12th June I indicated, in answer to a question asked by Deputy O'Higgins, that full particulars of the manner of the first draw for prizes under the prize bond scheme, due to be held in September next, would be published early in July.  I would like to take this opportunity of giving Deputies the promised information on the subject.  As the House is aware, the amount subscribed to the first issue <Col N="555" /> of these bonds last spring was approximately £5.4 million.  Assuming that withdrawals in the meantime will not be appreciable, there will be over £100,000 in prize money for the September draw.  On the basis of a £100,000 prize fund, there will be ten prizes of £5,000 ten of £1,000, 200 of £100 and 400 of £50, making 620 prizes in all.</P>
    <P>The first draw will be held during the first fortnight in September in the Bank of Ireland, College Green, Dublin, where the registers of bondholders are kept, and will be under the supervision of the bank and my Department.  As the space available in the bank is limited, it will not be possible to open the draw to the general public but representatives of the Press and radio will be present while a small number of representative persons will also be invited.</P>
    <P>Consideration was given to the systems in use in various countries for selecting prizes in State lotteries, etc., including the electronic device in use in Britain in connection with their Premium Savings Bonds Scheme.  It was decided that the system most suitable for our prize bonds drawing would be one based on those in use in such countries as Sweden, Norway, Belgium and France.  Briefly stated, it consists in selecting, by lot, each digit composing the winning number.</P>
    <P>For the coming draw a special apparatus is being made for the Bank of Ireland by a Dublin firm.  It will consist of six small drums capable of being rotated together by means of a handle at one end.  Reading from left to right facing the apparatus the first drum will represent the hundreds of thousands digit of the winning number, the second the tens of thousands digit, the third the thousands digit, and so on.  Each drum will contain counters bearing respectively the numbers 0 to 9 while the drum representing the hundreds of thousands digit will, in addition, contain a counter numbered AO as bonds numbered in excess of 999,999 will bear the prefix letter &ldquo;A.&rdquo; These counters will be so constructed that when closed the number on them is concealed from view.  Each drum <Col N="556" /> will have a hinged door and three sides of glass so situated that when the door is uppermost the glass sides will face the audience so that they will have a clear view of the counters and can see the operator removing them.</P>
    <P>When the drums have been rotated and come to rest one counter will be picked at random from each drum simultaneously by a team of operators who will then open and display the counters to the audience.  The prize bond represented by the number consisting of the digits and prefix letter, if any, drawn from the drums will be the winning bond.  This procedure will be repeated until all the prizes have been drawn.  If the number drawn represents the number of a bond cashed before 1st September or is the duplicate of a number previously drawn during the course of the draw or is a number in excess of the highest bond number issued, it will be rejected and another number drawn instead.</P>
    <P>As it is a condition of the prospectus under which the prize bonds were issued that a bond will not be eligible for inclusion in the draw if the holder has died before 1st September or if it is held by a person not entitled to hold prize bonds, for instance, a person under 16 years of age, it will be necessary before the draw proceedings are brought to a close to draw a small number of additional numbers which will be held in reserve in case one of the numbers on the winning list is later rendered ineligible to receive a prize under the terms of the prospectus.</P>
    <P>Lists of bond numbers which win prizes will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and notification will also be sent by post by the Bank of Ireland to the holder of the winning bonds. Statutory regulations governing the method of the first draw are at present being prepared and will be made by me shortly.  The actual date of the draw in September will be announced later.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that it was found impossible to get any place large enough to enable the public to be admitted generally.  I hope it will be possible to consider that in future. Deputies are perhaps aware that in order to engage a large hall in Dublin <Col N="557" /> you must put in your application nine or 12 months ahead, which makes it very difficult.</P>
    <P>There will be publicity in this draw in that the Press will be present.  I am sure they will give a description of what takes place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the subject of premium bonds, there is only one request which I want to make to the Minister in respect of the draw to which he has referred and that is that he will ensure that my number comes out of the drum.  I dare say he will have a fair number of requests of that sort.</P>
      <P>With regard to the draw, I presume there will be adequate facilities not merely for reporters as such but for Press photographers.  A movietone news item, or something like that, would be desirable.  So long as there is sufficient publicity of that sort, I do not think anybody would mind that the general public would not be able to be present though I suppose a good many people would turn up for the thrill or in the hope that their number might come out of the drum.  Has the Minister yet made arrangements as to whose will be the golden voice on this occasion announcing the success of the various units?  If it is somebody connected with the Department of Finance, it will be a new rôle for him to be giving something like this rather than in his normal and proper rôle of restriction. Perhaps the Minister will keep that pleasure to himself?  However, time will tell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the issue of Exchequer Bills is concerned we are glad on all sides of the House that the issue was a success.  There has been some considerable discussion from time to time about the provision of an Irish money market.  From the editorial in the <i>Irish Press</i> the other day it would appear they thought this was an Irish money market.  It is not, of course, but it is undoubtedly a system of short term Government financing which is very desirable indeed and which, as I indicated the other day, is one which could not be successfully introduced until, first, our balance of payments had been put on a proper basis and <Col N="558" /> secondly, until British Treasury Bill rates had dropped.</P>
    <P>The Minister was lucky in that the previous Government created the first situation for him.  So far as the second is concerned, nothing that we do in this country can in any way alter the international interest rate nor the British Treasury Bill rate.  The augurs were favourable for the Minister and he took advantage of them and on all sides of the House we are extremely glad that the issue has been so successful.</P>
    <P>I noted in the statement that was made, the Minister indicated that the average price of issue was somewhat below the maximum.  That also is satisfactory.  I think the information that was published in that respect is the same information published in respect of British Treasury Bills.  I can easily see that to ask for any additional information might very well impact on the confidential nature of the individual transactions and, therefore, so far as I am personally concerned I do not propose to ask for any information other than that divulged by the Press statement through the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>While many countries issue bills of the sort which have just been issued, very few countries indeed have the money market and the complex system of discount houses which exists in London.  It is not necessary to have that complex system of discount houses for the successful issue from time to time of direct Government Bills.  I think Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa&mdash;to mention some countries of the British Commonwealth&mdash;all operate the type of Governmental Exchequer issue such as that we have released but I do not think any of them operate the type of money market and discount house which exist in London.  In fact, to the best of my recollection, Australia did once start an effort to have such a money market and it was a complete failure, while the issue of Treasury Bills in Australia remained most successful.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking on this the other day, I did not want to say too much before the issue closed but there <Col N="559" /> is no doubt in my mind that it was the re-discount facility which made the issue a success.  I think without that facility the Minister would not have got many of the applications he did receive.  I hope that in whatever new issue of bills he may contemplate in future he will pay particular attention to the re-discount facilities that are offered because, in my opinion, they are even more important than the fractional rate of interest over or below the average which it may be possible to achieve.  At the average tender price of £98 17s. 9d.  I think the interest is somewhere about £4 11s. 3d. per cent. which is an extremely high rate for a bill which has the guarantee of 48 hours' discount that these bills have.</P>
    <P>It is a rate which I think we would be able to reduce in the future, but at the same time let me be quite clear in saying that I think the Minister was right in making his initial rate the maximum figure he quoted and which would be the guide to tenderers.  He was right in making that rate fairly high on this occasion so that he would be sure in that way that the initial issue would be successful.</P>
    <P>I hope that further issues will be made along the same lines and, even if the Minister does not make any issue before the 30th September, I hope that when these bills come for redemption he will make a new issue at that time. By then also people will have become more acclimatised to the situation and it might be possible to get more small tenders for the bills than perhaps was the case on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether he proposes to retain the services of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee?  I hope he will retain their services.  It is an organisation appointed for the purpose of giving advice, and only for that purpose. The decision must remain with the Minister if it is within his ambit, or with the Government if within their ambit, but at the same time I think it is desirable that a body such as the Capital Investment Advisory Committee should investigate our problems and tender disinterested advice on <Col N="560" /> them.  It remains then for the people concerned to judge the value of that advice and to take decisions on it.</P>
    <P>Obviously the committee will give that advice only from the purely economic standpoint and other things have to be taken into account in arriving at decisions.  It does not necessarily mean that rejection of economic advice is any indication that the economic advice as such is considered unsatisfactory.  It may be entirely satisfactory as economic advice but at the same time it might set off certain trends in other fields that would render the economics of it open to serious criticism.</P>
    <P>For that reason therefore, the opinion of any such committee can only be purely advisory and must not be regarded in the nature of a decision. We heard some remarks from time to time during the Budget debate on this matter which I do not propose to go into now but I remember Deputy Loughman saying the Government had taken the committee's advice.  The Government, of course, did nothing of the sort.  The advice of the Capital Investment Committee was in relation to capital purposes not in relation to current purposes as was the Minister's decision.  However, that is all water that has flowed under the bridge.</P>
    <P>I should like to reinforce what I said on the Central Statistics Office in relation to the Department of Finance.  The Minister is aware that I made a certain effort to try to strengthen the economic section of the Department of Finance but I was not able to get exactly what I had in mind.  I hope that, if that opportunity arises in the future, the Minister will be able to strengthen the Department in that way.</P>
    <P>I have very strong views that it is through the Minister for Finance the Government should be advised on economic matters.  It is impossible for the Minister adequately to advise the Government on economic matters, unless he has an adequate economics staff in the Department.  The officials that were there to advise me on these matters gave me advice that could not have been bettered.  I was extremely lucky in their co-operation, but, at the same time, they were so limited in <Col N="561" /> number that there was a certain disadvantage. The number available requires expansion and if something is not done, should the opportunity arise wherein to carry out that very necessary expansion&mdash;it is only a trifling expansion&mdash;I am afraid some officials will be very seriously overworked, with bad effects not merely on their own health but on the eventual quality of their work.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to tell us whether the system of the Government stock for dealing with national loans and other Government securities which was instituted in 1954 has been successful in recent months.  It was initiated in 1954 in relation to Irish Government securities, and was subsequently expanded to other issues, and I should like to know whether that expansion for Dublin Corporation issues, for example, has proved satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I have two other matters to raise, and one I shall raise in a general way only.  I was very surprised indeed to see that it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and not the Minister for Finance, who made a statement yesterday on the future of the levies.  The levies were imposed for balance of payments purposes and it was the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance who were primarily concerned in these levies.  I was quite amazed therefore when I saw that it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce and not the Minister for Finance who made the statement last night prognosticating what their future was likely to be.  I hope that, by that, the Minister for Finance is not relinquishing the primary responsibility that remains to him, and should remain to him, of dealing with levies, should our payments and our balance, visible and invisible, vary from time to time. It would be most unsatisfactory if that were so.</P>
    <P>The other matter is one which does not require legislation, in my view, and I think it would be very bad, if it did require legislation.  The reason I say it should not require legislation is that I feel we have got to arrive at a situation in which the Central Bank and <Col N="562" /> the commercial banks will co-operate more closely with the Government of the day than they have done up to the present.  In saying that, I do not want to suggest at all that there has not been a liaison.  There is, and it has been a satisfactory liaison in many respects; but I think that liaison must become even closer in the light of our present economic conditions; and one of the things that must be done is that the Minister for Finance must impress upon the commercial banks that they will have so to alter their system that they can have selective interest rates to a degree not existing at present.</P>
    <P>If the Minister goes back on the records of his Department, he will see that I made certain suggestions along those lines some little time ago.  Other circumstances arose in relation to our balance of payments which necessitated that my concern would be taken away from that and directed towards other much more pressing matters.  I think we will have to have here a system of more selective overdraft interest rates so that we will be able in any potentially inflationary situation to damp down the type of spending that we do not desire and at the same time, stimulate the type of productive investment that we must have in far greater degree if we are to improve. The present situation, by virtue of which an overdraft for luxury consumption pays exactly the same interest rate as one for productive development, does not provide a satisfactory solution.  I know, of course, that the trade loan guarantee system does provide for a lower rate of interest, but that is a very limited aspect of the problem and the problem requires to be dealt with on a much wider basis.</P>
    <P>In no circumstances should it be dealt with by legislation, in my view. It would be highly undesirable that there should have to be legislation for that purpose.  It is a matter that should be dealt with administratively between the spokesman of the Government, the Minister for Finance, on the one hand, and the commercial banks, on the other, with, perhaps, the Central Bank in between acting as the cement, as somebody so graphically <Col N="563" /> described it the other day in relation to a somewhat similar problem.</P>
    <P>Now that we have got ourselves on to an even balance of payments keel, I hope that in the time ahead that will be one of the reforms which will be possible of achievement.  It was one which it was not possible for me to tackle while our balance of payments was in disequilibrium in the years 1955 and 1956.  The Minister will find that Australia, subsequent to my making certain suggestions here, adopted this system and now has in operation this system of selective overdraft rates. The report of the New Zealand Banking Commission, which was published round about last Christmas, recommended the same thing.  They are countries, like ours, which are underdeveloped.  They are countries, like ours, which may have inflationary tendencies from time to time and may desire to curb these tendencies, without, at the same time, affecting the productive enterprise so necessary to build them up just as it is so necessary to build us up here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the methods at present available to and availed of by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the collection of income-tax arrears from employees. I do not know why the present system was instituted, whereby, if an employee fails to pay his income-tax, certain pressure is brought on his employer to deduct the amount from his wages and, failing that, the employer can be made liable for the arrears and methods bearing on the Gestapo-like can be employed if the employer fails to pay.</P>
      <P>The Minister may have seen a letter which appeared recently in the Limerick papers from a very reputable firm of contractors, Messrs.  Lanigan Brothers, setting out the steps which the Revenue Commissioners had taken to collect arrears due by certain of their employees who had left their employment without paying those arrears. The Revenue Commissioners even went to the extent of seizing some of the firm's property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest very seriously to the Minister that the time has come when the laws governing that particular <Col N="564" /> section of income-tax payers should be revised.  A very sensible step in that direction would be the introduction of the P.A.Y.E. system which is in force in England and other industrial countries. Undoubtedly, it is a hardship nowadays for any working man, particularly if he has a family, to be presented twice a year with a substantial bill for income-tax.  Whether we like to admit it or not, a very great proportion of the workers to-day and, indeed, of every class of the community, live on a week to week basis and it would make the position very much easier for the categories concerned if the P.A.Y.E. system were introduced in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are certain difficulties and possibly some expense involved in the introduction of that system but it would be well worth while.  Certainly, if we ambition expanding as an industrial nation we will have to adopt systems which have proved themselves outside in regard to employees' income-tax.  The case that I have referred to of Messrs.  Lanigan Brothers of Limerick has left a very ugly taste in the mouths of people in my constituency and Southern Ireland generally and I would urge the Minister to make a general study of the whole question.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the suggestion made by Deputy Sweetman that professional and economic advice should be available to various Ministers. I had hoped to have an opportunity of raising this matter on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, but the debate concluded rather earlier than I anticipated.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that, not only should we adopt the policy of setting up commissions or committees to advise Ministers on various matters connected with the national economy, but that one or more professional economists might be included on the staffs, certainly on the staff of the Department of Finance.  If we had availed of the very efficient, highly expert, professional and economic advice available in this country, the procedure adopted in regard to the investment of public funds over the past 30 years might have taken a different trend and the present demand <Col N="565" /> for priority for productive investment might have been put into practice at an earlier date, to the great benefit of the country generally, if we had had competent professional and economic advice available to the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>I would seriously suggest to the Minister for Finance that consideration should be given to the question of employing on a permanent basis professional and economic advice of the most expert kind, particularly now that we have reached the stage in our economic development when we must look ahead and plan for an expanding economy or suffer very serious consequences, consequences even more serious than those we are dealing with at the present time.</P>
    <P>I should also like to suggest to the Minister that at the earliest possible date he should indicate to the Dáil his plans for inducing investment of outside capital in this country.  In his speech yesterday to the Dáil, the Minister for Industry and Commerce stressed the fact that, as far as his Department is concerned, he proposes to introduce facilities to encourage the investment of outside capital and the activities of outside capitalists in this country, a development with which I am very much in agreement.</P>
    <P>Taking the short view, the best way at this stage to get industrial know-how and the requisite capital is to go outside the country.  One way of doing that is to offer attractive inducements. I do not believe that export of capital should be restricted to a major degree. If we accept the philosophy of a free enterprise economy, it is far better to attract capital into the country by offering inducements rather than to restrict the export of capital by any artificial form of restriction.  If capital gets a fair return in this country, Irish capitalists will retain their capital in this country and there will be a flow of outside capital coming into the country, to the benefit of the economy in general.</P>
    <P>In that regard, a review of the income-tax code is long overdue.  I understand that a commission is to report to the Minister in due course on that matter but time is moving on and I suggest that, in the present precarious <Col N="566" /> state of our economy, the question of inducements to capital requires the Minister's urgent attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in his Budget statement that certain inducements will be given to shipping companies.  I think I am correct in saying that that would bring us into line with what is being done in England and elsewhere. In such matters we should be prepared to go even further than other countries in order to induce shipping companies and others at least to register their ships here, if it is not practicable to build the ships here.  We must get out of our heads the idea that it is sufficient for us to follow what is done outside.  We must be prepared, if necessary, to take the risks involved in going further.</P>
    <P>I should also like to support the suggestions made by Deputy Sweetman in regard to credit facilities.  It must be admitted that the world is living on credit and that any serious restriction or attempt to curtail credit drastically, in the nature of a deflationary policy, is likely to have even worse results than the pursuit of an inflationary policy.  I do not intend or wish to advocate in any sense an inflationary policy, which would lead to disaster in the long run, but I think that credit should be available for worthwhile projects, particularly productive enterprises that would give employment and expand the economy.  A general direction from the Minister to the Banks Standing Committee in regard to this whole question of availability of credit would have a very salutary effect on the banks.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the banks should throw money around indiscriminately. I would be strongly opposed to any such suggestion.  The trouble is that when there is a question of a credit squeeze, a blanket is thrown over the whole industrial and commercial life of the country and credit is restricted, willy nilly, whether the enterprise happens to be productive or one that is either socially or economically undesirable.  In other words, a dance hall proprietor probably has as much chance&mdash;I have nothing against dance hall proprietors&mdash;of getting funds when there is a credit <Col N="567" /> squeeze on as a person who wants to start a new industry.  As Deputy Sweetman suggested, there should be some question of priorities in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have in this country in abundance two of the essential things that go to create wealth.  They are human material and land.  We are short of capital.  I suggest that anything that can help to utilise the two ingredients of which we have a surplus supply should be done and our available capital resources should be utilised to the best possible extent.  If I developed that to any extent, I would be going outside the Vote altogether.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to suggest very strongly to the Minister that, in his financial policy and in the policy of the Government in general, every possible inducement should be given, and given as soon as possible, to outside capitalists to invest in this country. It would be a very desirable development, not only from the point of view of getting in capital, but also because with the capital would come the technical know-how and experience which otherwise might take a very long time to provide from our own resources, no matter how desirable that might be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Russell raised a number of important points but in order not to delay the House I shall just deal with one&mdash;the question of the income-tax code and the collection of arrears.  We all know that people of very modest incomes, particularly unmarried men, are now charged income-tax.  It has come to my knowledge that when arrears mount up and when the income-tax bill is presented and perhaps taken home to the mother of the house, there are no means by which the comparatively large sum looked for can be paid in a short time.  In consequence, the revenue commissioners perhaps spread it over portion of the coming year. Then, when the man concerned takes into account that deduction from his wages, plus the deduction for the current year's income-tax, he feels he is working for a very low wage indeed. I have known young men who, rather than meet these deductions, have emigrated from this country and gone <Col N="568" /> abroad.  I think there is a very strong case for the introduction of the pay-as-you-earn system of income-tax.</P>

      <P>We were all glad to learn from the Minister for Finance of the success of the issue of the Exchequer Bills and that it is his intention to proceed with such issues in the future for public financing of State capital development and so on. However, I felt that the Minister, in moving his Vote to-day, would avail of the opportunity to refer to a statement issued by a member of the Government, and I suppose on behalf of the Government, in which it was declared that £200,000,000 of our capital assets had been wasted since the war.</P>
      <P>That statement was made at a time when the Exchequer Bills were being issued.  I think the Minister should have addressed himself to the validity or otherwise of that statement.  I know it was made and issued to the Press in a script so that it was not any careless slip of the tongue by the Minister for Lands.  Therefore, we have to take it that it is the considered view of the Government that it is correct.  I suggest the Minister should either repudiate the statement or inquire into it and deal with it in a very positive way.</P>
      <P>I quote from the <i>Longford Leader</i> of the 29th June, and it was published elsewhere:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;£200,000,000 of war savings had been largely wasted on non-productive expenditure.  They were wasted mainly during Coalition terms of Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that is true, action must be taken by somebody.  It is a charge that cannot be allowed to go unattended.  If the Government feel that that charge is true, they should take the necessary steps to deal with the people responsible for it.  I now invite and challenge the Government to hold a judicial inquiry into that.  But at the same time they should inquire as to whether a time when Exchequer Bills are being issued is the time to make a statement of that sort.  I will not admit for one second that £200,000,000 of our external assets were wasted since the war either by the Coalition or Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>£200,000,000.  It is published in every paper.  It brings up another question.  According to this Minister's statement, apparently £200,000,000 was accumulated.  Where was it kept and what use was it put to? What interest rates were we getting for them?  If there was £200,000,000 to be spent by us or by Fianna Fáil and wasted on unproductive expenditure, it must have been some place.  It is a serious matter which cannot be passed by.  If that statement were taken seriously&mdash;and it will be taken seriously by a number of people&mdash;I think it could do untold damage to the credit of the State and to the credit of everybody concerned with the Government and the Oireachtas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The administration of the Department is governed by the policy of the Minister and his predecessors.  However, I shall leave it at that.  I presume that it could be more appropriately raised on the Taoiseach's Vote in which general policy could be surveyed, but I feel that on this question of finance this matter should be raised now.  I agree with the proposal that capital for productive expenditure is our great need and I trust that every effort made by this Government, or any Government that may hold office, to find capital will be successful.  It is important in the interests of the country that it should. There is no reason why overdrafts and credit facilities, if required for worthwhile productive activities, should not be made available at a reasonable interest rate, much less perhaps than that for expenditure which is not so productive.  I shall go no further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Prize Bonds have also been successful.  I trust that when the names of the lucky winners come out of the drum next September, under the supervision of the Minister for Finance and the Bank of Ireland, the fortunate winners will regard this <Col N="570" /> country as the best place in which to invest their money once more.

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the decision which the Minister announced a couple of weeks ago in reply to a question of mine.  He stated that he would not set up a commission, or small group of experts, to investigate and advise on the relationship between the Government and the commercial banks.  It is in the interest of the country to bring our banking system into line with the banking systems of other countries.  At present the Government can exhort the commercial banks to expand or restrict credit but they can do nothing else. The question of policy with regard to credit expansion or restriction is entirely at the discretion of the commercial banks.  I do not wish to suggest that the commercial banks, in deciding their policy, may deliberately decide to act against national interests but the national interests in regard to expansion or restriction of credit should be determined by the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>The relationship between the Government, the Central Bank and the commercial banks is archaic.  It is not in tone with recent developments in other countries.  It is now over 20 years since we had an independent body of experts to investigate our currency and banking situation.  It seems to me that the time has now come&mdash;and other countries faced with a similar problem have thought so too&mdash;to investigate the present set-up.  I believe that legislation may be necessary in order to bring the Government policy into line through the medium of the Central Bank and the commercial banks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With respect, Sir, I am endeavouring to relate my remarks to the administration of the Minister in the light of recent statements made by him in the Dáil.  I am suggesting that his administration is at fault through his refusal to set up a group of experts such as I have suggested.  I should like to make it clear that in my view the proper <Col N="571" /> course to adopt would be to set up a very small commission of a few selected experts, strengthened by outside experts, to investigate conditions here.  New Zealand has recently had a report from a banking and currency commission.  Great Britain has recently set up a banking commission, although changes were made there as recently as 1946 and 1947.</P>
      <P>It does appear to me that the system which we operate is not one which in our circumstances works in the national interest.  I feel that there would be no opposition from the Government to steps necessary to give more power to our Central Bank in the direction and control of credit policy. What I have to say in this respect is not, I wish to make it clear, directed against the commercial banks who are doing the job as they feel it should be done but I feel that the duty of the Government has been to a certain extent abrogated.  It is a duty which in the national interest the Government must undertake.</P>
      <P>Over the last few years the overall demand for goods and services was to some extent influenced firstly by the amount of wages in the community, secondly by the amount of savings and thirdly by the amount of credit given by the commercial banks.  It appears to me that by far the greatest influence on the expanding or contracting of our economy was the last mentioned item. It is the policy of the banks that really determines what will happen regarding employment and production.  I suggest that the Minister should reconsider the decision announced a couple of weeks ago.</P>
      <P>There is, for example, very important advice ready to be given by experts from O.E.E.C.  As a result of our joining the Bank of International Reconstruction and Development it is possible to obtain expert advice on this aspect of our economy from the bank and if the Minister does not see fit to set up a commission I suggest he should obtain the services available to him from that organisation so that we can have a report from an outside independent body on the matters I have referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> There was one aspect of the banking system last year to which I think particular notice should be paid.  Since January, 1956, up to March of this year the non-sterling assets of the legal tender note fund increased by over nearly £5,000,000.  That is a very good development and I sincerely hope that the Minister will continue the practice, which was advocated by his predecessor, of seeing that the assets of the legal tender note fund are invested to a greater extent in non-sterling securities.</P>
    <P>In this respect, too, it seems to me desirable that the assets of the Central Bank should be kept in Irish Government securities.  To my mind there is no economic or financial reason why that should not be done and there are many good reasons why it should be done.  There is power to extend legislation to do it.  Our financial system could be strengthened and the position of the Government with regard to its capital programme would be strengthened if a certain proportion&mdash;not all&mdash; of the investment portfolios were held in Irish Government securities.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the situation is such that I do not think opposition would come from any section of the House if the Minister were to suggest to the Central Bank, or otherwise bring pressure on the Central Bank, to invest some of its assets in Irish Government securities.  If our banking system were to be streamlined in accordance with modern requirements, I think it would get the support of everybody in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out to Deputy Costello what the last experts left after them.  Fifteen or 16 commissions brought about this position. There is only one way in which this burden can, at least, be reduced.  I was glad when I heard the Minister for Finance announce previously that he intended to reduce the burden on this country in regard to payment of the Civil Service.  We have at present something between 4,000 and 5,000 civil servants more than are required. The burden of paying them is a heavy one, some £17,000,000 a year.  We have an enormous amount of brass hats, some 900 of them, drawing over £1,500 a year.  I do not wish to see men sacked because in the Civil Service, if you sack them, you have to give them a pension.  By stopping recruitment and allowing the natural wastage to take place, it would not be so many years until the Civil Service was reduced to the number that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed to see an advertisement for further examinations for civil servants during the past two months.  It is time that was stopped. We cannot afford to pay £17,000,000 a year to civil servants.  We cannot afford those two dead weight debts together, that of £15,500,000 principal and interest on public debt and £17,000,000 a year for the Civil Service. That is over £32,000,000 a year which <Col N="574" /> must be found by the taxpayers before anything else is done.  There is something here for the Minister to do.  A responsibility rests on him to have each Department examined in turn to see what the staff position is and to take steps accordingly.  I do not want any more commissions.  I think the Minister could easily have one of his Parliamentary Secretaries take on the job of doing that.  I do not want it done by civil servants because I know what that would mean.</P>
    <P>With regard to letters from local authorities to Government Departments, it takes six months from the day a letter arrives in a Department before anything like a definite reply, or a definite decision, can be expected by any local authority.  It has sometimes taken up to five years.  One case with which I dealt last week in relation to the health services took 20 years before a decision was made.  It has cost the ratepayers and taxpayers &mdash;I do not know which will have to pay it&mdash;over £40,000.  It is time these things ended.  It is unfair to the public.</P>
    <P>In regard to credit facilities for farmers, I suggest that the Minister in that respect examine the terms and conditions attached to loans issued by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and let us have some explanation, if he can, as to why such loans are not forthcoming from that corporation even to men in good standing, men who have their rates paid up, who owe nothing to anybody and who, if they apply to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan of £100, must have at least £1,000 in the bank before they get it.</P>
    <P>These are the conditions under which we are endeavouring to carry on.  I see no occasion for any loan to any farmer if the farmer is paid for his produce.  He is not, and Government legislation has been brought in to force him to accept an uneconomic price.  The farmers are the chief producers and the people we have to depend on for the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>As long as that condition of affairs prevails, we cannot hope for increased production.  There are two ways of <Col N="575" /> getting it.  One is by offering inducement, by giving a fair economic price to the farmers; the other is by starving the farmers out in such a way that he will have to till to save his life. The question is, which way is this Government going to adopt?  The previous Government adopted one road and we know where that led us. As regards any further commissions of experts, we have too many experts bringing us into bankruptcy quicker day by day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked, first of all, about maintaining the services of the Capital Investment Committee.  I have met the committee already and they have very kindly consented to continue their investigations and continue to render any advice they can.  I must thank the committee indeed for their past services and I am looking forward to receiving information and advice from them in the future.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point made by various Deputies that the Minister for Finance should have access to the best possible economic advice.  I agree also he should have independent advice, advice which does not come from other Departments.  Naturally if his advice comes from other Departments he is not in a position to consider the schemes from those Departments as they should be considered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman asked about the Government stockbroker and the scheme inaugurated some time ago under which the Government stockbroker was prepared to buy or sell Government stock at any time to a limited extent.  The scheme has worked very satisfactorily on the whole.  It means that anyone who wants to get rid of Government stock finds a market.  In fact, I am told there is more difficulty in finding stock for sale than there is in finding a buyer, as a general rule.  That gives an indication that the scheme has been successful. The scheme was extended to some local authority investments, but the stockbroker has not been so successful in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no intention of relinquishing my responsibility for the import levies and Deputy Sweetman need not have <Col N="576" /> any fear on that score at all.  A question raised by Deputy Sweetman, which has been rather a question of contention between Ministers for Finance and the banks for some time, is the question of rates of interest&mdash;selective rates of interest, as Deputy Sweetman put it, according to the national productive content of the scheme for which the credit is sought.  The banks have more or less resisted any pressure put upon them to provide selective rates of interest.  They say it is very difficult, and so on.  In any case, I am afraid our trouble at present with the banks is to try to get them to look favourably on the application for a productive project, whatever it might be; and we have not come down to the question of rates of interest yet, until we find that their attitude towards applications of that kind is favourable, in particular where the productive content is good.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell spoke of the method of paying income-tax.  It is true that the Revenue Commissioners will ask an employer to collect the amount due and will deduct it from the employee's wage or salary.  That is a power I would not like to relinquish on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, to collect it in that way.  It is quite possible that, as Deputy Russell said, if we had the P.A.Y.E. here there would be less recourse to that particular power.  Of course, it is open to any employer here to bring in P.A.Y.E. himself, if he and his employees agree; and there are various systems worked out by different employers.  Some employees pay in so much a week, making a fair guess at what their income-tax will be, and that sum is standing to their credit when the demand comes along.  There are various systems worked voluntarily by groups of employees in agreement with their employers.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to P.A.Y.E. and I am not prejudiced against it.  The commission at present sitting on income-tax will consider that system&mdash; that is, if they do not advise the abolition of income-tax altogether.</P>
    <P>I was asked also as to what inducements we were offering outside capital to come into industry here.  In the recent Budget we gave inducements in regard to taxation; we gave extra <Col N="577" /> benefits in the wear and tear on machinery and&mdash;I would say, more important probably for outside people, as Deputy Russell pointed out, who have the know-how as well as the money&mdash; we gave a concession on export profits. A firm starting for the first time will, as a result of the Budget, have the profits they make on export completely exempted from income-tax.  That is a very big inducement indeed to anyone coming in from outside&mdash;as it is also to people inside who have money to invest, since, of course, it applies to them also.  In fact, it applies more to them, I suppose.</P>
    <P>I do not know under what circumstances a Minister of the Government made the statement that a lot of money was wasted in the past and therefore I cannot deal with it.  I will have to leave it to Deputy MacEoin to deal with at another time when it can be dealt with better than I could deal with it now.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to set up any commission to deal with the relationship between the Government and the commercial banks.  We know what the relationship is, there is no difficulty about that.  It is well known what the relationship is and the banks are very sure of the relationship and so is the Government.  There is no necessity for any commission of inquiry into the relationship. A part from that, I am not convinced and I do not think anyone is that any particular change would be sure to be beneficial to this country.</P>
    <P>We all make suggestions as to things which might improve matters but there is no certainty, no volume of opinion in this country as far as I know, in favour of any particular change in any particular direction.  We will have to wait, I am afraid, until we know at least what we want and what we think might be a good change before setting up a commission to investigate it.  We could not ask them to try to think out some better way of dealing with finance than we have at the moment.  The terms of reference would be too wide.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the commercial banks have the great powers some people say they have.  I do not think that the commercial banks do, in fact, direct policy here.  What directs policy <Col N="578" /> to a great extent is the general financial position with regard to the balance of payments and many other things which enter into the matter.  The banks have to take things more or less as they find them and try to carry on the business within the framework as it is. There are changes gradually taking place in connection with the relationship between the Government and the Central Bank and the Government and the commercial banks, and also in the relationship between the Central Bank and the commercial banks.  Some of the changes made recently are very significant and should have a good effect on the financial position here and on the smooth working of our financial position in the future.</P>

That evolution is very good.</P>

Hullamhaíodh na Meastacháin seo <Col N="579" /> seachas an suim le h-aghaidh an Ghníomhaireacht Nuachta Eireannach sar ar ghlacas-sa oifig, agus mar sin, níl fúm ach déileáil ar bhealach anghinearálta leis na figiúirí atá i gceist mar fuaireas iad.</P>

Laghdaíodh an soláthar do Dheontas-i-gCabhair i leith Comhair Chultúrtha ó £10,000 go dtí £2,100 mar gheall ar an Rialtas, a bhí ann roimhe seo, dá chinneadh an Comhar Cultúrtha a chur ar fionraí ó shaothar.

Bhí méadú beag sa ranníoc a mbeifear ag súil leis uainn, sa bhliain airgeadais reatha, i leith costas Chomhairle na hEorpa, agus £4,500 de mhéadú chun soláthar i gcoinne measúnuithe mhéadaithe ar ár ranníoc faoi chomhair costas an Eagrais um Chomhar Eacnamaíochta san Eoraip.</P>

      <P>It is preferable to compute the proportions sought by the Deputy by reference to gross national product at market prices rather than by reference to gross national income.  Central Government taxation was 17.2 per cent. of the gross national product at market prices in 1954.  The corresponding percentages in the case of local authority taxation and of other taxation paid to extra-budgetary <Col N="582" /> funds were 3.4 per cent. and 1.0 per cent. respectively.  The separate figures for 1955 are not yet available but the total taxation under the three categories was 22.0 per cent. of gross national product at market prices in that year.  The data for 1956 will be available shortly.</P>
      <P>It may be mentioned that to consider fully the relationship of taxation to the various aggregates of income and expenditure used in national income statistics, account should also be taken of subsidies and of transfer payments (e.g. old age pensions, children's allowances, etc.) from public authorities to persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am contemplating the cancellation of certain extended age limits for serving officers.  The replies to the queries (a) to (e) inclusive in the Deputy's question are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) and (b): The ages for retirement for officers are prescribed by Defence Force Regulation.  At present the normal ages for retirement for officers with the 1916 Medal and/or the Service (1917/21) Medal are one year higher than the normal retiring ages for other officers.  In addition, in the case of an officer&mdash;(i) who was awarded the 1916 Medal and/or the Service (1917/21) Medal, and (ii) who is found, after medical examination within three months of the date on which he is due to reach the normal age for his retirement, to be medically fit for further service, and (iii) who is certified by the Chief of Staff to be capable of fulfilling the duties of the appointment which he holds, and (iv) in regard to whom I as the Minister for Defence am satisfied <Col N="593" /> and so certify that it would be in the best interests of the service if he continued to serve beyond the normal age for his retirement, the age for his retirement is increased by a further two years (subject to a maximum of 65 years).</P>
    <P>Apart from taking steps to ensure that the extra year is granted once only in his service to an officer, I do not contemplate changing the normal ages for retirement for the class of officers in question.</P>
    <P>I contemplate cancelling, with effect from a current date, the Defence Force Regulation which provides for the further increase of two years in the ages for retirement for such officers.</P>
    <P>(c)  The purpose of any action which I may decide upon in this matter would be to serve, what I consider to be, the best interests of the Army as a whole.</P>
    <P>(d)  The number of officers who have benefited by the two years' increase in the ages for retirement is 35 (seven of whom have retired). In addition, 30 officers who benefited by one year's increase had retired before the introduction of the additional two years.</P>
    <P>(e)  The number of officers still serving who would be eligible for consideration under present Defence Force Regulations but who have not yet been granted the two years' increase in the ages for retirement is 64.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question of rectifying the injustice that was done to the other officers, who had also planned their future on the basis of the retiring ages which applied when they joined the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that, is the Minister aware of the fact that normal promotion during peacetime was far slower than it was during the emergency and that, in fact, the rate of promotion for officers who served prior to the emergency was substantially slower than it was for those who served during the emergency, and subsequently? Further, in view of the fact that these particular officers were not only foundation officers but had service as members of the Old I.R.A., will he consider the special circumstances of their position before he decides to concel this regulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already considered all the aspects of the matter and I have to consider the effect on the Army as a whole.  The officers referred to have already been treated very well.  Their normal retiring ages are one year higher than those of other officers and the majority are also drawing military service pensions in addition to their Army pay.  I understand the military service pensions increase according as the holders of them get promotion in the Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that so far as officers of the rank of captain are concerned, officers not in receipt of the benefits of the regulation to which we have been referring received a special increment to compensate them for any delayed promotion?</P>

Coal is used in certain types of cooking apparatus, central heating boilers and other appliances in which other fuels would be unsuitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I must do is to register a protest against the manner in which the Minister introduced his Estimate here this afternoon and the contents of his remarks. The Minister's speech was wholly in Irish.  The Minister is entitled to his view that the Irish language should be used as much as possible in this House, but I feel that the occasion of the Vote on the Department of External Affairs is not an occasion on which the Minister should speak entirely through Irish. Apart from the number of Deputies who do not know Irish, there is another very important consideration; that is, there are many people outside this country who are interested in the foreign policy of the country and who read our debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people not concerned with debates in this House on other topics, but they are concerned with matters of external policy which are discussed here.  These are matters which concern other people and in <Col N="597" /> which other people have an interest. On at least one occasion, to my knowledge, the debates in this House were reported by a foreign organisation <i>in extenso</i> and were circulated throughout Europe to the members of that organisation.  It appears to me, therefore, that the Minister does a disservice to the country in addressing his remarks entirely in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it appears to me to be unnecessary for the Minister to come into this House at all in view of the manner in which he introduced his Estimate; if the rules of procedure so permitted, the Estimate could have been introduced by an accountant from his Department.  The remarks the Minister made were very short and contained nothing but a statement of expenditure for the coming year.  There was no indication of foreign policy.  There was no indication of the views of the Government on our position in the United Nations and all the many matters that are at present stirring in Europe in relation to our Partition problem.  We must be unique, I think, in the democratic assemblies of this world in having a debate on External Affairs in which the Minister introduces his Estimate without making any reference at all to foreign policy.  I am aware that the Estimates which the Minister is introducing were prepared by his predecessor.  So were the Estimates for Industry and Commerce, but the Minister's colleague yesterday was able to give a policy statement on a number of important matters.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that this will not be a precedent for future years.  I should like to remind Deputies of what occurred last year, when the Minister's predecessor made a very long and very clear statement of policy with regard to our position in the United Nations, and with regard to our relations with other countries with which we are collaborating in the Council of Europe. I feel it is wrong that the Minister at this very crucial time should ignore these trends, should ignore the position in which we find ourselves and should merely treat the House, the country and people outside to a mere accounting statement of the affairs of his Department.  I trust that the Minister, <Col N="598" /> when replying, will give us some indication of the policy of the Government with regard to the many matters over which he now has control.</P>
    <P>Last year, in the debate on the Estimate for External Affairs, the Minister's predecessor made very clear the principles which he believed should actuate our stand, our statements and our actions in the U.N.O.  I should like the Minister to comment on these matters in his reply and I would suggest to him that when he goes to the United Nations in the autumn and when he instructs his officials as to the line that they should take up on the various matters that arise, certain things should be made very clear.</P>
    <P>Although this country is militarily neutral, it should be made quite clear that we are not uncommitted in the war of ideas.  It should be made quite clear that in the struggle between Communism and the Western Democracies we are not, and cannot be, neutral.  We must maintain our freedom to criticise. We must maintain a position of freedom to criticise people whose actions we generally may support.  I think our freedom in that respect was very well utilised by Deputy Cosgrave at the United Nations Assembly last year, when he joined with other nations in condemning the action of the British and French Governments in the Suez adventure.</P>
    <P>Whilst maintaining that right, however, we must make it perfectly clear that our cultural ties, our economic, political and, indeed, our spiritual interests are on the side of the Western Democracies.  In this regard we cannot afford to equivocate and we cannot afford to be pusillanimous.  By our voice in the United Nations Assembly and by our votes there and in its many committees we should do what we can to assist the West in its struggle against totalitarian Communism.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, a mistake to underestimate our importance in the United Nations as well as a mistake to overestimate it.  In many regards our position is unique.  We are a European power with strong cultural and historical ties with the mainland of Europe but we are unique also in that we are probably the only European <Col N="599" /> power that was never a colonising power and we, because of our struggle for freedom, because of the stand that we took for so many centuries and since we have obtained our freedom, have got the sympathy and the understanding of great nations like India and also, I believe, can get the sympathy and understanding of the nascent new nationalities growing up in Africa, the Middle East and the Far East.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the fact, because the predominant religion of our people is the Catholic religion, that we have natural ties with countries like Spain and also some of the South American countries.  Lastly, and probably the strongest tie that we have, is the fact that over the years our emigrants have gone to Canada, Australia and the United States of America and by virtue of that fact our influence in these countries is far from being insignificant.  All these factors, I believe, combine to give Ireland a unique position in the Assembly of the U.N.O.  It is a position in which, if we make judicious use of it, we can have a considerable influence on the affairs of that Assembly.</P>
    <P>It has so happened, developments of such a nature have taken place over the last 12 months or so, that we now have an opportunity to exercise our influence there much greater than we had, perhaps, two years ago.  In the last 12 months the most significant developments in the U.N.O. have been the growing influence of the Assembly over the Security Council and the fact that the Assembly's voice has now got such a great influence in the deliberations of that organisation when, a few years ago, the organisation was dominated almost completely by the Security Council.  Secondly, there has been the fact that a number of countries less committed than others have been able to get a dominant position in the various debates that have arisen in the Assembly.  I refer particularly to Canada and Sweden.  It seems to me that these developments could assist Ireland very considerably in playing a very important rôle in the U.N.O., a rôle completely out of proportion <Col N="600" /> to its size as a small island in the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
    <P>I am of the view that it is the duty of whatever Minister and Government are in office to see that proper opportunity is taken to raise the issue of Partition at the United Nations Assembly.  It is right that we should, if favourable opportunity arises, endeavour to get assistance from that organisation in righting our great national wrong, but I should like to say that we must act warily, skilfully and diplomatically.  We must strengthen the friendships that we have already in that organisation and endeavour to forge new ones.  From my very limited experience at international meetings, I have come to this very firm conclusion, that if a country wishes to get assistance for its own national wrongs it must first of all gain the sympathy of the international organisation and show itself a good and useful member of it.</P>
    <P>A person with a constant grudge gets written off as a crank.  Similarly, a nation with a constant grudge gets written off in international organisations. I have seen in the Council of Europe the Greek case over Cyprus, which was an unanswerable case before any assembly, being pushed into oblivion because the situation was not handled with, perhaps, the skill that it required, because it was pressed at the wrong times, because the ground was not properly prepared for it.  The result was that in the Council of Europe the Greek case over Cyprus was largely ignored.  I feel that there is a danger that the same thing might happen Ireland with regard to our own particular wrong and our particular problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to say in this context that the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Cosgrave, has shown the way in which we can with dignity and with strength bring our wrong to the notice of the U.N.O.  I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on the speech which he made to the United Nations Assembly last year.</P>
    <P>Before passing from this topic, I think praise, too, should be given to <Col N="601" /> our permanent representative and ambassador in the U.N.O., and to the officials from the Department who have assisted him there.  It is not an easy task for a new delegation to attend a body such as the U.N.O. and reports from many sources indicate they have already gained great prestige for this country in the few short months we have been represented there.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the affairs of the Council of Europe and the recent developments in Western Europe.  I do not wish to refer to-day, at this time at any rate, to the setting up of the European Economic Community and to the proposed establishment of the Free Trade Area.  We are to have a debate on these matters later to-day and we have not enough information yet to come to any definite conclusion on them.  There are other developments in Europe to which I would like to direct the Minister's attention and on which I would like his views when he replies.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, there has been a strong move in recent months to try and streamline the many parliamentary institutions of an international character which now exist in Europe.  There are the Assembly of the Western European Union, the Council of Europe, the Assembly of the Coal and Steel Community, the Assembly of N.A.T.O. and there is to be the Assembly of the European Economic Community.  Proposals have been put forward by the British Government under the title &ldquo;The Grand Design&rdquo; which are one set of proposals for endeavouring to get rid of the prolificacy of these international organisations.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister, when he is discussing these matters at the meetings of the Council of Ministers, and when his deputy is doing so at deputy level, that he will oppose the British Grand Design.  No matter how well-meaning those proposals may be, I feel they will only serve to weaken Europe eventually.  By bringing in the assemblies under the aegis of N.A.T.O., and by bringing in Canadian and Australian representatives as these proposals envisage, I feel the proposals of the British Government may indeed <Col N="602" /> weaken the drive instead of strengthening the force for European unity.</P>
    <P>It must be made clear that it is in the interests of this country that Europe becomes more united and stronger.  I think the Minister at meetings of the Council of Ministers, and his deputy, should bear that in mind and we should not support any proposals which will weaken that drive which is such a potent force in Europe to-day.</P>
    <P>At the present moment discussions are taking place between O.E.E.C. and the Council of Europe with regard to, if not an amalgamation, at least closer co-operation between the two organisations. I should like to hear the Minister's views on this movement.  I should like him to support the movement for closer co-operation between O.E.E.C. and the Council of Europe. It has, indeed, been a remarkable development in recent months that O.E.E.C. have discontinued their opposition to any closer collaboration between their organisation and the Council of Europe.  I hope the Minister will endeavour by his voice to assist that movement and, if possible, to bring about an amalgamation between the two organisations.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference in his opening remarks to Partition.  It is agreed, I think, by every Deputy in this House, that force is not a solution to ending Partition.  From that, certain logical conclusions must fellow.  If we decide that we cannot and we should not end Partition by means of armed force, there is only one other method of doing so and that is by breaking down the barriers of suspicion and prejudice which divide us from a minority of our fellow-Irishmen in the Six North-Eastern Counties.  I do not think Partition can be ended by rubbing away a white line on a country road; it can only be achieved by removing, or reducing, the intangible and impalpable factors which go together to divide us from the Protestant minority in the North.</P>
    <P>I think the bitternesses of the past, the prejudices which have become so ingrained, can be reduced in time if the proper policies are followed.  We <Col N="603" /> must offer to the young men who are being misled an alternative to the method of force.  We must point out that this division in our country can be overcome in time.  I think the methods by which it can be overcome are the methods of co-operation.  We have had co-operation between the Government of the Six North-Eastern Counties and the Government of the Republic in the past, co-operation which has worked in the field of fisheries, electrical development and radio development.  I think that could be continued.</P>
    <P>There are many Departments of State, for example, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Justice, who could to a certain extent work in co-operation on various matters with similar Government Departments in the Six Counties.  In case my remarks are being misunderstood, may I say in parenthesis, when I mention co-operation between the Department of Justice, I do not by any means intend to convey that there should be extradition between the two parts of the country.  What I do mean to convey is that there are certain aspects of the administration of justice which form a useful field for co-operation.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned these matters before in the House.  They include the serving of writs outside the jurisdiction and the question of the issue of judgments that have been obtained in the two parts of the country.  These matters could be subject to a convention between the two Governments, that we treat each other within the jurisdiction of each other's courts so that it would be unnecessary to serve a writ outside the jurisdiction in Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa</i> here. Similarly, it would be possible to execute judgments here obtained in Northern Ireland and vice versa.</P>
    <P>It does seem there is a wide field for co-operation in matters of trade.  I do not see any reason why we could not obtain here a type of common market which is being put up on a much wider field on the European mainland at the present time.  It may also be possible to envisage co-operation with regard to civil defence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> The question of the establishment of radar stations, warning posts, is something which affects Belfast as much as Dublin and this would appear to be a field for co-operation between the two Governments.  On different levels also, on the artistic, the literary, the sporting, these barriers to which I have referred could, over a period, be weakened by a proper policy of co-operation. We can do that as we have done it in the past without weakening in the slightest our legal rights and claim to jurisdiction over the Six North-Eastern Counties.  There would be no weakening of our position by admitting that they were an <i>ad hoc</i> Government which we did not propose to recognise juridically, but the existence of which for practical matters we would be prepared to accept.  There is nothing inconsistent about following a good neighbourly policy and at the same time endeavouring elsewhere, and as far as we can, to bring to the notice of the world the wrong from which this country is suffering.</P>
    <P>There is one matter of administration of the Minister's Department to which I wish to refer, the recruitment of new officers for the Department.  At the present time new entrants to the Department of External Affairs are not given an interview until they have passed an examination in Irish which is of an extremely high standard.  It is advisable that our diplomats should know Irish, but it is a foolish thing indeed to keep good people out of the Department of External Affairs because they are not able to pass an extremely stiff examination in Irish.  I know of people who, I am convinced, would have served the Government well but because they failed to pass the examination in Irish they were not even considered at the interview board.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that that procedure should be reversed.  You want good people, the best people you can get, in that Department.  These people will eventually be representing our country abroad and we should endeavour to get them by seeing that they have proper qualifications, by having a proper interview board.  Let them attend that board and let their qualifications be sifted as future diplomats.  If they are <Col N="605" /> found successful at that stage then let them attend and do an examination in Irish, say, after a period of 12 months' probation in the Department.  If they are unable to pass it and if they are unqualified for the service they could then be dismissed.  It seems to me wrong that we should keep out of the Department of External Affairs people who would serve it well, when we would achieve both ends, having our diplomats speak Irish and know Irish and having the best people in the Department.  The present procedure is the reverse and I sincerely hope the Minister will consider this proposition.</P>

      <P>As this Estimate was prepared during my period in the Department I have little to say on its details.  The work carried out by the Department during the past 12 months has shown satisfactory results in a number of activities.  Trade under the various trade agreements in operation and, in particular, under the trade agreement with France, showed satisfactory expansion.  These agreements have been availed of by a great number of people in the country and the work in the negotiation and the operation of the agreements by the officers of the Department at headquarters and in the various missions abroad has proved beneficial in making it possible to develop and expand trade with a number of countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to advert to the position which has arisen in relation to the cessation of licences by the French authorities in respect of certain commodities.  I feel we should make it known that the refusal to grant licences is, if not actually a breach of the agreement, certainly not in accordance with the terms under which that agreement was negotiated. Agreements of this nature, if they are to work satisfactorily, depend on a mutual appreciation of the position of both countries by the responsible authorities dealing with them.  Over a great number of years the trade with France has been heavily adverse so far as we are concerned.  Last year the picture was very different.  I hope it will continue to remain so in the future, but in view of the trend of trade in previous years I think we are <Col N="606" /> entitled to expect the French authorities to honour that agreement, not only in the letter but in the spirit.</P>
    <P>On the question of Partition, the need for a consistent policy on this national problem is obvious.  I have repeatedly expressed the view that it will not be solved easily or quickly. In this country all are agreed on the aim of a united Ireland.  Differences, however, arise on the method of achieving that aim.  National policy must be decided by Dáil Éireann and the Government responsible to the Dáil.  Whatever decisions are carried out must be based on the views of the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in solving Partition should be calmly and quietly analysed. Our efforts must be then directed towards removing them and resolving them as quickly as possible. It is not sufficient for anyone to say that nothing has been done and that, because Partition still exists, the very existence of this situation entitles any individual or group to take whatever action he or they think appropriate. I am convinced that the solution must be secured on the basis of co-operation between our people in both parts of the country.  In fact, it is essential, if we are to eliminate the suspicion which would sow the seeds of dissension, that such mutual understanding should be present in order to make progress.</P>
    <P>Contacts between different groups and on a number of levels in the community will enable people of goodwill to get a better understanding and appreciation of each other's viewpoints. These contacts are possible through cultural societies, through trade and industry and, of course, through sporting organisations.  The resultant understanding which should flow from meetings would provide a basis on which to work for further agreement, wherever possible.  On many occasions in the past too much attention has been paid to publicity and not enough to the requirements of a practical policy or plan.</P>
    <P>Publicity may be useful or it may not.  Where it wins sympathy and understanding it is beneficial, but if it shows us in an unfavourable light the <Col N="607" /> contrary is the case.  It is essential we should realise that the solution of Partition will, to a great extent, depend on our own exertions and that while we may seek the help and assistance of friends elsewhere, in the last resort the ending of this problem is a matter for Irishmen in both parts of the country.  The work we do in international organisations may help towards solving some of the problems, but the real work must be done here and in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Events in recent months and in recent years in certain respects have not contributed to a solution of the difficulties.  In fact they may well have had the opposite effect.  We must be quite clear that the sole responsibility for deciding questions of national policy on this or any other matter rests on the Dáil or the Government responsible to the Dáil.  We cannot have an irregular approach to the solution of Partition any more than we could have self-appointed groups deciding how to deal with other national problems, whether they be political, social or economic.  There is far too much loose thinking on this subject.  Actions are sometimes applauded without thought and without any advertence to the problems involved or to the reactions they might have when irresponsible groups arrogate to themselves responsibility to which they have no right or claim.</P>
    <P>The unity of this country depends to a considerable extent on the willingness of all the people to give allegiance to the country.  The status of the country abroad will undoubtedly contribute towards uniting all sections. The ability we show to run our own affairs in a competent way, and the manner in which we administer our affairs, must assist in the realisation of our main national aim.  We may, therefore, have to review past policies and actions and decide what is the best approach in the light of existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>Since the establishment of the State we have had responsibility for running the affairs of the Twenty-Six Counties.  Whatever policies are decided upon in the future must represent <Col N="608" /> the will of the majority of the people.  The majority of the people have decided that force is not a solution for the unnatural division of the country.  It, therefore, follows that no group can arrogate to itself the right to use force for the purpose of ending Partition.  The people are quite free to change their representatives, to change the Government.  That right has been exercised on numerous occasions, but no group has the right to assume that it has some greater wisdom or patriotism that entitles it to act in the name of the people.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that comparisons between conditions now and conditions prior to the establishment of the State are no longer valid, that, in fact, no true analogy exists.  Those who make these comparisons fail to recognise the fundamental difference that exists between conditions existing in the past and the circumstances of the present. In the past our people struggled for the right to decide all questions of national policy in an Irish Parliament. We now have such a Parliament and a Government responsible to that Parliament.  That is the only body entitled to decide questions of national policy.</P>
    <P>I believe we should benefit by the lessons of history.  One of the problems on many occasions in the past was that when the Irish people were in sight of victory or in sight of some achievement dissensions and disunity arose.  If we refuse to allow similar mistakes to occur again, if we are determined to see that the unnatural division of the country is the outstanding political problem to be solved, then I believe that, with the same unity of purpose, the same determination which achieved for us the right to govern ourselves in this part of the country, we can achieve the worthwhile national objective of uniting the country.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the campaign which has occurred sporadically over the past few years in the Twenty-Six Counties will lead nowhere and should not be countenanced by anyone as helping towards a reunification of the country.  In fact, as I said earlier, it may well have the opposite effect.  If <Col N="609" /> we are prepared to work together on the basis of securing agreement where it is possible to find it, of extending contacts, of working together on a good neighbourly basis in the realisation that the development of the country as a whole is in the interests of all sections, North and South, then I believe we can go a good distance towards achieving the unity for which so many are anxious and for which so much effort has already been expended.</P>
    <P>I believe that the attitude which we have taken up in the United Nations is sound and that we should maintain an independent but co-operative approach to all the questions considered by that organisation.  If we consider these questions on their merits we have a part to play in world affairs.  Our history and tradition enable us to play a useful part and we have some contribution to make in that as in other organisations.  We are not, by any means, a large country but nevertheless because of our tradition, because of the sympathy and understanding which our viewpoint has already won in many parts of the world, because of the large numbers of our people and their descendants scattered in so many parts of the globe, I believe we can make a contribution which will enable us to play a part suitable to our size and in conformity with our approach to these various problems which have to be considered by the United Nations, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation and the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>Our position in these organisations depends to a considerable extent on the manner in which our representatives take up whatever attitude is regarded as being in the national interest and on endeavouring to promote the maximum goodwill possible in the belief that our destiny is indissolubly bound up with the free world.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to express to the staff of the Department both at headquarters and in the various missions abroad, my appreciation of their magnificent service while I had the privilege of working in the <Col N="610" /> Department.  The various officers are devoted servants of the State anxious to work for the interests of the country. Their work has secured for themselves and the country a reputation of which we may all be proud.  It was for me a pleasure especially to work with so many disinterested public servants who loyally give their best to whoever is temporarily in charge of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also of opinion that it is a pity the Minister did not see fit to make a more comprehensive statement on foreign affairs.  It is usual for the Minister when introducing the Estimate to state policy as a whole. Although we are a small country on the outskirts of Europe, events cannot entirely pass us by.  It should be remembered that we are members of three international organisations, United Nations, O.E.E.C. and the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>A rather significant thing has happened recently in foreign affairs affecting the world generally.  The United Nations set up a special committee to review and report on the situation in Hungary.  That report has recently been published and is now on the agenda of the United Nations.  I have been abroad recently and I know it is the wish of all the European countries that this report should be fully discussed as soon as possible by the United Nations.  We have been asked to press in our Parliaments that this should be done.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister himself has this report in detail.  It indicts Soviet Russia for the action she took, and it seems very desirable that a debate on this should take place as soon as possible.  When he is replying I should like the Minister to indicate if this Government, which has always been so interested in the freedom of countries, intends to press for this to be put on the agenda of the United Nations as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also note that things such as the changing circumstances in Eastern Europe cannot entirely pass us by.  It is becoming increasingly obvious that <Col N="611" /> the iron control that Soviet Russia asserted by brute force over her own people and over the satellite countries is gradually failing.  This would appear to be due to two conditions, first, the heroic resistance&mdash;if one may pay tribute to it&mdash;that has been shown in all satellite countries and in all the countries that have stood out firmly against persecution and in support of the right of the individual to be free. That is the strongest single factor that is defeating Communism and which will bring it down, please God, in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The second factor is the total failure of the Soviet Government's attempt to impose the system of collective organisation and collective production on farms on their own people.  The reports that are issued by the officials concerned and by those coming from behind the Iron Curtain show that agricultural production has fallen to such a low level in the satellite countries and in Russia itself that the citizens of those States are practically on the verge of starvation.  The result is that the Soviet has had to change its methods and liberalise farming.  That has resulted in the industrialists in those States also pressing for liberalisation and we gradually find the situation arising in which the economies of all the satellite States are being changed round.</P>
    <P>This in itself is a significant development and one which must affect us sooner or later, not only from the spiritual but also from the material angle because if the great might of Soviet imperialism is to break down it means that the economic repercussions throughout the whole world will be tremendous.  These are matters which must affect us and as we are a member of international organisations I think some sort of indication as to our foreign policy coming from the Minister would not have been out of place.</P>
    <P>In regard to Partition, for the five or six years that I have been in this House I have never heard a Minister for External Affairs introducing his Estimate without some reference to Partition.  Of course, we do accept the fact that the Minister himself is as <Col N="612" /> anxious to see the removal of Partition as we are on this side of the House or in any other part of it.  I think a very significant thing that is worthy of comment happened in the last few days.  The Six-County Government always claims that it wants to stay within the orbit of what it is pleased to call the British Empire, because of the benefits accruing to it from that association, and it is a curious thing that within the last few days, despite the benefits that they claim they have, with a huge shipyard at their disposal, when there is a general demand for shipping all over the world one should hear on the wireless that the Six-County Government is inviting American industrialists to come and start industries within the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>This is an indication, to my mind, that the binding link which the Six-County Government claim is essential to their economy appears to be somewhat weakened.  Is it not possibly a fact that Britain, having priced herself out of so many markets because of her costs of production and so forth, finds that she is unable to produce now at an economic price and this is reacting on the Six Counties?  They find themselves now not having the benefits which they always claimed to have had before.  It seems to me this is an indication that ultimately they must turn to another economy.  Geographically, historically and nationally, their economy should be linked with ours. The existence of two Governments is a costly business for any country.  We have all experienced recently that one Government may be a costly business.</P>
    <P>That gesture, or movement, on the part of the Northern Ireland Government rather indicates that all that they banked their hopes on, or claimed to, has been falsified and this may be a move or step in the direction of turning their eyes economically towards us.  I am all in favour of co-operation between the two Governments.  Like other Deputies, I do not approve of this junta Government in Northern Ireland but, as Deputy Declan Costello pointed out, it is an established fact that the Government is a <i>de facto</i> Government and as such we <Col N="613" /> have to recognise its existence.  The more we negotiate with them and the more we have a combined tourist effort as we had in the railways, electric power and so forth, the better it will be.  It seems to me there are many advantages for the North to come and join with us.  We have much to offer them.  We have much in common with them and a United Ireland would surely get them a better standard of living than they enjoy at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are wrong in disposing of the Irish News Agency.  From the Minister's speech it does appear that no absolutely hard and fast vital decision has yet been taken and, as I read his speech, the Estimate is being reduced from £45,000 to £41,000.  That rather indicates that the Irish News Agency will continue for the time being.  We suffer a great deal from adverse propaganda. The Big Powers have influence, they have the Press, they have the control, and they can falsify everything against us to our detriment.</P>
    <P>The only instrument we had to rebut and counteract that falsification was the Irish News Agency.  That agency may be costing a certain amount of money, but at least it is there to put the Irish point of view to foreign journalists and to put it as an unbiased yet truly Irish point of view.  If we are to rely on other agencies dealing with us in a vicarious relationship, the true facts will never be given.  I have been abroad a good deal and I have found that there is the grossest misrepresentation against us.  I have asked the Minister for External Affairs, and another Minister, to reconsider this matter. I appeal to the Minister again now.  This agency is invaluable.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I should like him to tell us what the intention of the Government is with regard to the holding of a full-dress debate in the United Nations as soon as possible on Hungary and with regard to not letting the Soviet Government get away with one of the most brutal invasions in history.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde concluded by asking the Minister to give his view on a particular matter when he comes to reply.  In <Col N="614" /> view of the statement the Minister made in introducing his Estimate any Deputy is entitled to ask whether or not the Government have any view at all in relation to any aspect concerning policy from the point of view of external affairs?  The Minister spent approximately one-third of his introductory statement dealing with one matter&mdash;something the Government have decided not to do or not to continue in the future.</P>
      <P>We heard nothing from the Minister with regard to the Government's policy in relation to the United Nations Organisation, in relation to Partition, or in relation to practically anything touching on the policy of this country and this particular Government in so far as external affairs are concerned. I want to suggest that the Minister for External Affairs should not, on the occasion of introducing his Estimate, come to the House in that particular manner.</P>
      <P>I said he spent approximately one-third of his time dealing with one matter which the Government have decided should not be continued, namely, the Irish News Agency.  Unlike my colleague, Deputy Esmonde, I do not quarrel with the Government's decision to discontinue the agency.  If the Government, having reviewed the position, have decided that it is not worth while and is not worth the money spent on it, then they did the right thing in deciding to discontinue its operations.  But the Government should give the House some information with regard to the commitments, if any, which still exist in connection with the agency.  Last week, and again this week, I put questions to the Minister on that subject.  I regard the reply given to the question I put yesterday as entirely unsatisfactory and as not constituting a reply, in fact.  I understand from the Ceann Comhairle that the matter could not be raised on the adjournment because it was regarded as a matter of detail for which neither the Minister nor his Department could be made responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to call the attention of the House and the Chair to the fact that the decision to discontinue the Irish News Agency is part and parcel of the <Col N="615" /> Government's budgetary policy.  It was announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement and, in his Budget statement, the Minister for Finance referred to the fact that for some years to come there would not be any substantial saving to the Exchequer by the decision of the Government to discontinue the news agency.  In dealing with the news agency the Minister said, as reported at column 941 of Volume 161 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As soon, therefore, as arrangements can be completed, the Irish News Agency will be wound up and payments from the Vote terminated. In view of existing contractual commitments, however, there may be no net saving for some time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister now what contractual commitments exist in relation to the Irish News Agency?  I want him to tell the House what those commitments are.  I want him to tell the House the cost of those commitments and their duration.  This is an important matter, particularly with regard to the general decision to wind up the Irish News Agency.  Those Deputies who share the point of view expressed by Deputy Dr. Esmonde, may very well feel that if there is to be no net saving to the Exchequer for some time, as was indicated by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement, then the decision of the Government to discontinue the agency is a foolish one.  That argument would not exist if the Minister for External Affairs can tell us that, in fact, there will be a substantial saving within a comparatively short time.  I do not know if the Minister is now prepared to give this information to the House. He certainly did not give it when I asked him to do so in a parliamentary question yesterday.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the question of the Irish News Agency&mdash;as I say, the Minister spent one-third of his introductory statement dealing with it&mdash; there are many other things with which the Minister should have dealt when introducing his Estimate.  We did not hear any statement of Government <Col N="616" /> policy from him.  We did not hear from him any review of the activities of his Department for the past 12 months. It might not be entirely fair to criticise the Minister for not giving such a review if he felt in any way diffident about it, if he felt, out of deference to his predecessor, that that was a task which his predecessor, though now in Opposition, was more fitted to perform. If that was the Minister's approach, I am prepared to excuse him but I do not excuse him for his failure to give at least some indication as to what are the Government's main principles and heads of policy in relation to external affairs and, in particular, in relation to the co-operation of this country in the work of the U.N.O.</P>
    <P>I did not hear the Minister's speech. I have read it.  I am very disappointed that he did not take this opportunity to pay some tribute to the work done by his predecessor in the U.N.O. Deputies on all sides of the House will share the view that the work done by Deputy Liam Cosgrave as Minister for External Affairs in U.N.O. was magnificent and that he expressed, in a way that we can all be proud of, the viewpoint of this country in that world Assembly.  I am sorry that the Minister did not feel it incumbent on him to take the opportunity of referring to that work and paying a tribute to Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister left it entirely to Deputy Cosgrave to deal with other matters in relation to this Vote which the Minister might have dealt with.  We have heard the speech made by Deputy Cosgrave and his reference to the question of Partition. I was thankful that there was somewhere in this House a person who could speak with knowledge and authority on these subjects, in default of the Minister giving the House the benefit of whatever views he has and whatever views the Government have on these questions.</P>
    <P>I have very little doubt that the Minister for External Affairs and every one of his colleagues do, in fact, share the views which were expressed by Deputy Cosgrave from this side of the House and do, in fact, respect the <Col N="617" /> views propounded by him and the work which he did while he was Minister for External Affairs but it should not be for someone talking from these benches to say that.  These are things which should have been said by the Minister for External Affairs in introducing his Estimate.  As the Minister did not do so on that occasion, I want to express the hope that he will do so when he is concluding.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House any longer except to underscore the appeal which I have made to the Minister to deal with these topics when he is concluding and to give the House the information which I have asked him to give in relation to the contractual commitments of the Irish News Agency.</P>

      <P>There is no necessity for me at this stage of the session of the Dáil and after the long years of the people's experience of the Fianna Fáil policy to labour the obvious.  A Minister coming in here representing Fianna Fáil could talk for several hours on what the Fianna Fáil policy is in relation to various matters.  I do not think it is necessary to labour the obvious, as certain Deputies have done here at great length.</P>
      <P>There are just one or two matters to which I should like to refer.  On the question of Hungary and what is to be done with regard to the report of the committee that has gone into the matter, the proposers of the resolution are considering it and our representatives will be sitting in on the consideration as to whether a resolution on the matter is to be pressed at the next General Assembly meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the O.E.E.C. and <Col N="618" /> the Council of Europe, and as to whether we should accept the British line which Deputy Costello condemned in one phrase and recommended in another&mdash;that there should be an amalgamation of these organisations&mdash; I think it is a very doubtful proposition. They have two very different functions.  The Council of Europe is an advisory body.  It is not representative of Governments but it gives an opportunity for various sections of various Parliaments to have their say on all sorts of questions, but O.E.E.C. is a body appointed by Governments and they have, when their Ministers or Deputies speak in that council, to be prepared to live up in action to what they say.</P>
    <P>O.E.E.C. has done very valuable work in the reconstruction of Europe and we look forward in the future to its continuing that good work.  I think it would be unwise, particularly at the present time, to attempt to put over the O.E.E.C. a type of organisation such as the Council of Europe.  One might destroy both organisations and put an end to the valuable work that each can do in a separate capacity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello raised the question of trade with France.  We have, of course, taken up with the French Government the question of the lamb trade which they have ended for a period.  As everybody knows, the French Government got into great difficulties on the balance of payments. They have not got the money to pay for a lot of things they would like to buy from abroad, but we have urged them to make the money available as quickly as possible to purchase our lambs.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity for me to say anything on the question of Partition. The one new development in Europe which I think is valuable from the point of view of world peace, and also from the point of view of its reaction on our national problem, is the fact that the American, the British and other Governments have demanded that Russia should agree to have the question of the future of Germany&mdash; both parts of the State&mdash;settled by an all-German plebiscite, on the basis of free elections for the whole of Germany. <Col N="619" /> I hope that will come about and I also hope that the same principle will be applied to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The German nation as a unit is established only 100 years but our nation is very much older than that as a single unit.  I think it is desirable for the peace of the world that Germany should be reunited, and desirable also that, as an indication to Russia of what it should do, as an example of what Russia should do in relation to Germany, the British Government should do in relation to Ireland what they propose for Germany. They should take up the attitude that it is as much in their own interests as it is in ours, that Ireland should be reunited, just as they have taken up the attitude in relation to Germany that it is in their interests, and the interests of peace in the world, that there should be free elections for the whole of Germany.</P>
    <P>Some questions were asked about the Irish News Agency.  Deputies on both sides of the House are aware of the history of the Irish News Agency from the time is was established in the days of the first Coalition.  When it was brought into operation, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out in the debate here on External Affairs in 1953, the Minister told the House at that time that it would not deal with hot news.  It departed from that and it dealt with all sorts of news just as an ordinary news agency.  From the very beginning there was doubt as to what the news agency was supposed to do. When I took over the Department of External Affairs in 1951, though I did not approve of the organisation of the Irish News Agency, I did all in my power to persuade the Government, during the three following years, to give it every chance.</P>
    <P>That agency was started by one Government and I did not think it would have been right for us to follow the Coalition's example and close down the news agency overnight, as the Government had closed down, say, the chassis factory and put an end to lime distribution and fertiliser subsidies, just because the previous Fianna Fáil Government had started them.  I urged the Government to give the news <Col N="620" /> agency a fair chance and it was given a fair chance in the years between 1951 and 1953.  When the Coalition Government came back in 1954 they continued the news agency.  Its running expenses, during the last year they continued it, were at the rate of about £45,000 a year but only £35,000 was provided for it.  This year we have had to pay the deficit and also pay for the winding up expenses incurred by the board.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins has been very insistent during the last few days that we have contractual obligations and to-day he indicated that it would be more costly to close the news agency than to continue it.  I am glad to say he is wrong.  If he had read the speech he would have seen that though the board of the news agency has had to compensate the staff for the loss of their employment, and though there were other matters in which contracts had to be dealt with, there will be a saving of at least £4,000, and in the following financial years there will be a saving of £45,000.  If we had a news agency here that was paying its way, or half paying its way, and it had the co-operation of both the professional newspaper people and of the owners of newspapers, then it might do valuable work, but that has not been the situation.  Ever since the first day, the news agency was opposed by the professional staffs of newspapers and by other interested organisations.  The hopes that were held out of the good work it could do were not justified in the event and the Government decided they could not continue to ask the taxpayers to pay at the rate of £45,000 a year for the benefits that would accrue to our people from the operations of the news agency.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the many broad issues that have been raised here.  It is not the first time that this Parliament has debated external affairs and all the Deputies and the country know the policy upon which Fianna Fáil has acted in the past in relation to external affairs, and that is the policy upon which we propose to continue to operate.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £19,480 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach (No. 16 of 1924; No. 40 of 1937; No. 38 of 1938; and No. 24 of 1947).</P>
      <P>There is nothing in particular to which I should draw attention in the Estimate.  There is a slight reduction of £340, due to a diminution of staff.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Statistical Survey is not available which usually gives an opportunity to Deputies to speak with knowledge of the fundamental economic facts.  However, most of the relevant figures are available to Deputies in the official publications already issued, for example, in the <i>Trade Journal</i>, in the monthly trade returns, in the monthly Economic Series and, of course, in the statistical tables that were issued at the time of the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking back on the year 1956, we can say certainly it was a year of economic depression and, in a sense, a year of gloom.  Perhaps the best single economic indicator is the national income. The figures show that the national income, at current market prices, has been reduced from £459,000,000 in 1955 to about £450,000,000 in 1956.  That, in itself, is serious, because it shows that for the first time since the war there has <Col N="622" /> been a reduction.  From the end of the war up to the year 1956, there has been a steady increase.  The reduction in 1956 is even greater if we express it in real terms.  Gross national production at constant prices was about 3 per cent. less in 1956 than in 1955.</P>
    <P>One could well expect that that would be accompanied by a reduction in agricultural output and a reduction in industrial output.  These in turn would lead you to expect, if you did not know it otherwise, that there was a decrease in employment and, of course, an increase in unemployment, probably accompanied by an increase in emigration.  Of course, it does not always follow that an increase in emigration accompanies an increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>In fact, gross agricultural output in 1956 was down by about 4 per cent., if you take account of the changes in stocks as well as sales off the farm and consumption on the farm.  We had also a decrease in that year of industrial output of about 4 per cent., if you take all industries covered by the Census of Production.  If you take transportable goods alone, you have a reduction of as much as 5 per cent.  In agriculture, there were 9,000 fewer males employed than in the year before.  The figure of 9,000 is alarming.  There were about 8,000 fewer employed in industry. The total unemployment figures showed increases.  The unemployment percentage went up from a relatively small figure of 6.8 per cent. in 1955 to 7.7 per cent.  The number on the live register reached a very large figure at the beginning of 1957: it was as much as 24,000 more than it had been the previous year.</P>
    <P>That figure was reduced in mid-March to about 16,000 more than had been on the register at the corresponding period last year, so that there was an improvement.  This improvement continues to date.  The difference between the unemployment figure for the 22nd June this year and the corresponding date in the previous year was 6,800.  Emigration, as was pointed out in reply to a parliamentary question recently, cannot be determined accurately outside intercensal periods.  Outside <Col N="623" /> the intercensal period we cannot get any figures on which we can rely as regards emigration, but there is no evidence that the figure for 1956 did not reach the figure of 40,000 which was the average for the previous intercensal period.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance was introducing his Budget, as was usual he gave a picture of the State finances and of the general economic conditions. In the previous year there was a deficit as between income and expenditure: income failed to meet expenditure by close on £6,000,000.  That deficit had, of course, to be met by borrowing. In that year, besides this deficit, capital expenditure amounted to £40,000,000.  That £40,000,000 had to be met, to the extent of £29,000,000, by borrowing.  Accordingly, if you take the borrowing necessary to meet the Budget deficit and to meet capital needs there were total borrowings of £35,000,000.</P>
    <P>That was for the financial year 1956-57. When the Minister for Finance came to frame his Budget for 1957-58, he was faced in the first place with a deficit of £9,000,000 on current account. It was unthinkable in present circumstances that we should borrow to meet that deficit.  Borrowing meant that we would have to eat in on the sums that would be available for the capital account.  Because of that, the Minister and the Government made up their minds that we would have to balance the Budget.  That was done, as you know; it was fully debated here in the House.  The food subsidies were abandoned but some compensation was provided for those in the social assistance groups.  There was some increase in taxation.  In that way a balance was struck.</P>
    <P>On the capital side, the programme amounted to £41,000,000 for the current year.  We hope that the ready acceptance of the Exchequer bills may be an indication that the sum that will require to be borrowed will be provided. However, the whole situation, as everybody knows, has been serious. If we wanted to make any progress it was necessary to try and increase activity in various directions.  Everybody <Col N="624" /> knows that the one way in which that can successfully be done is by increasing production.  It has been said so often that people are tired of hearing that phrase but it expresses a fundamental truth to which we must pay attention.</P>
    <P>The circumstances did not give the Minister for Finance much opportunity, through the Budget, to induce activity or to give effect to the fundamental policy of the Government.  However, a certain amount was done.  One of our chief difficulties is, as is well known, our balance of payments.  In 1955 there was a deficit in the total balance of payments of £35,500,000.  It was obvious that no Government could complacently allow that to continue. The previous Government took steps, through the special import levies, and otherwise, to try and reduce it.  It was reduced from £35,500,000 in 1955 to £14.4 million in 1956.</P>
    <P>Serious consequences followed the previous Government's measures, however, and the present Government felt it was essential that economic activity should be stimulated.  The Minister for Finance, in the Budget, did provide certain stimuli, particularly for exporters.  It is obvious that if we are to continue to preserve the standard of living which we have at the moment and that we have been enjoying in recent times, we must do so without depleting our reserves.  The consequences of such a depletion are now clear to everybody.  Our external financial reserves are absolutely essential to us and they have been reduced to a level below which we cannot go without facing a situation in which the standard of living will inevitably diminish and unemployment will increase.  We have to keep our eyes definitely on the position of the balance of payments.  The trading deficit for the year 1956 was £73,500,000.  In the first five months of this year there has been an improvement to the extent of £18.7 million, and it is possible that at the present moment, if we take into account the invisible as well as the visible items, we have a favourable balance.</P>

      <P>But we must beware <Col N="625" /> of thinking that we can be sure that situation will continue.  There are certain factors which could operate and which could very well upset that balance.  There is, for instance, the fact that certain stocks were reduced and are likely to be replenished.  Stocks for industry had been reduced consequent on reduced industrial activity.  We have tried to revive it and that is also likely to lead to increased imports.  On the exports side there is the fact that it is most unlikely that our cattle stocks will enable us to continue cattle exports at the same rate for the remainder of the year as we had for the first five months.</P>
      <P>We must also take into account that the ratio between export and import prices, or the &ldquo;terms of trade&rdquo; as it is usually called, has worsened since the beginning of the year, so that we cannot be at all happy about the situation in the sense that we can be satisfied that the improving trend will continue. We hope it will, and certainly the Government will keep an anxious eye on the trade returns to try to ensure that the balance which it is so necessary to maintain, will in fact be maintained.</P>
      <P>I have said that it is necessary to maintain that balance by increasing exports, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been very conscious of that.  He showed that when he was in office before and since he has come back to office the Minister for Finance has been helping him by giving certain tax concessions as an inducement aimed at increasing the volume of exports.  Taxation reliefs on increases in exports have been doubled&mdash;from 50 to 100 per cent.  To meet the legitimate claim of those who pioneered in the export of Irish goods there is an alternative to the 100 per cent. in the form of 25 per cent. of the total.  Other inducements include the inducement given to industry generally through an increased allowance for depreciation. A 40 per cent. allowance has been provided in the case of new ships.  I am just mentioning a few of the steps that have been taken to foster greater industrial activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we came into office one of our principal concerns, of course, was <Col N="626" /> unemployment and the emigration that generally accompanies it.  The building industry was in a more or less parlous condition and we set out to try to improve that situation.  Between the aid given to the local authorities, through the Local Loans Fund and so on, and the other measures we have taken, it means an addition to the capital programme of close on to £2,000,000.  That is a serious matter seeing the difficulty there is in providing capital.  We did it after very serious consideration believing that, on the whole, it was best in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Many people are of opinion that too much of our capital resources in the past have been devoted to building. While I realise that it was a very high proportion, I am one of those who felt in the past and still feel that, although we do not get from the building of houses an immediate return in productivity in the ordinary sense, it was a necessary foundation for the well-being of the community.  While we have to watch very carefully so as not to overstrain our resources in that regard, I still think it would be quite unrealistic to consider the money that has been spent on housing as money spent uselessly. It has produced very valuable results in decent homes for our people, but it is quite true that there is a limit to what we can do in this respect. Fortunately the most pressing needs have been met, except in the large cities, but there is still considerable work to be done before our people are housed as the community would wish. With the best will in the world in that regard we have to face the fact that our capital resources are limited and that we have to ration them out and see that they are expended so as to produce the maximum advantage.</P>
    <P>We have to review the situation carefully, therefore, in regard to capital outlay, and it was with full knowledge of the dangers of spending capital urgently required for productive purposes on amenities&mdash;some might be inclined to regard housing beyond a certain degree, at any rate, as an amenity&mdash;that we considered this matter.  We must be careful to see that the amenities do not unduly encroach <Col N="627" /> on available capital required for productive purposes.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is necessary to go into these matters at any greater length at this stage.  If any questions are raised I shall, perhaps, do so in reply but I think it is unnecessary at this stage to do more than indicate the general aim of the Government.  That general aim is to try to recreate industrial activity, to foster it and get it going again so that our people by their efforts will produce the things that are necessary to maintain the standard of life to which we have been accustomed.  We have no vast mineral resources, such as other countries have.  Our chief resource is our soil and consequently our principal industry is and must remain for a considerable period, as far as we can see ahead, agriculture.  As far as the Government is concerned, therefore, every effort must be made to stimulate agriculture and every effort must be made by the people, in their activities, to increase agricultural output.  Agriculture is the main source of our exports.  It is very largely our agricultural exports which enable us to purchase the raw materials and other essentials required for manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The basis upon which our agricultural economy can hope to expand is through the medium of profitable export markets abroad&mdash;export markets which will give a decent return generally and a fair recompense to the farmer.  The securing of such markets must, therefore, be the primary aim of any Minister for Agriculture in present circumstances.  Such markets and their potentialities will be explored to the utmost.  Everything that can be done to secure these markets will be done. Everything that can be done will be done to avail of these markets.  All the steps necessary will be taken.  For that reason, a sum of £250,000 has been provided towards enabling the marketing side of our agricultural economy to be properly organised by getting all the information possible about foreign markets and by taking all the steps that have to be taken to ensure that the goods we have for sale will be profitably marketed.</P>
    <P>I have told the House what we are <Col N="628" /> trying to do in regard to industry.  We are trying to build up industries which will give us exports that can be sold abroad at prices ensuring a reasonable return to our manufacturers here.  In agriculture, we are of course also trying to become as reasonably self-supporting as we can.  We are doing that for a variety of reasons.  One of those reasons is related to our balance of payments position.  It is quite clear that if we produce at home wheat and cereals which we would otherwise have to import, it will be good for our national economy as a whole.  If our farmers produce barley and feed that barley to their stock, that will help to benefit our economy and we are doing our best and will continue to do our best to stimulate that effort.</P>
    <P>I have made clear on many occasions what our industrial and agricultural policies are and it is hardly necessary for me on this particular Vote to dwell upon them again.  We are convinced that progress has been made within the last three months.  We are convinced that there is a spirit of greater confidence abroad.  We are satisfied that if our people bend their will and their activities to the situation in which we find ourselves we can, here in this island of ours, make a home, and a happy home, for a much greater population than we have at present. The trouble is that, as everybody knows, there are certain attractions which pull our people from this country, apart altogether from economic pressures which may push them out. Our young people are affected by the idea that they can do better abroad. That is a quite natural feeling, but it is nevertheless a delusion.  The successes that one hears about are generally the exceptions and not the rule and those who go abroad, and who have experience, are willing to admit that life in this country can be as happy as, if not happier than, life anywhere else in the world.</P>
    <P>I have certain ideas of my own on this subject, ideas which may not be shared by others.  One must take life as a whole and consider its satisfactions and the contentment it can give. One must consider the happiness which the individual can have within himself. Were it not for the pressures and the <Col N="629" /> pulls which are causing our people to seek different ways of life, with different traditions, life here, if we were free to adopt our own standards, could be a very full life indeed, and we could carry a much greater population than we have at present.</P>
    <P>Young people have different views. Many of them look for standards equal to the standards that they see in countries to which they have access, countries such as Britain and the United States of America.  It will not be easy for us to overcome these attractions. If we are to overcome them, we shall have to imbue our people with the belief that here we have a splendid country, an excellent soil, a temperate climate and an intelligent people.  If we want to have standards comparable to those of other countries we shall have to take full advantage of the opportunities that we have and we shall have to work harder.  Hard work does not mean slavery.</P>
    <P>Human beings are generally more content and happier if they are working, particularly when they see a profit from that work.  If we can get our people back to that intense love of country which was so evident here some years ago, that will help us in this national effort.  We hope that the people will make up their minds to a combined national effort so that we may overcome our present difficulties. These difficulties are not by any means insuperable.  The results that have followed the efforts made in recent months have proved that the task is well within our competence.  We have only to make up our minds as a people that there is a task and that, in order to accomplish that task, we must work intelligently, we must use all the scientific knowledge available to us and we must do that with the desire to succeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, for the information and assistance of the Dáil and Seanad, <Col N="630" /> it is expedient that a Select Joint Committee, consisting of 18 Deputies and seven Senators, of which the quorum should be eight, with power to send for persons, papers and records, should be set up for the purpose of inquiring into and reporting to the Dáil and Seanad on the following matter, namely:&mdash;</P>
    <P>the economic consequences for Ireland likely to follow the participation or the non-participation by this country in (a) the proposed Free Trade Area, and (b) the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I would like to direct the attention of Deputies to the very careful framing of this proposal.  In order that Deputies should understand both the object and the scope of the motion it would, I think, be proper that its implications should be very carefully studied.  I should perhaps say, first of all, what the motion does not propose to do rather than indicate what it tends to achieve.</P>
    <P>By its terms, the motion asks for the formation of a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad with the powers stated in the motion to inquire into and report on, for the information and assistance of the Dáil and Seanad, the economic consequences for Ireland likely to follow on participation or on non-participation by this country in the proposed Free Trade Area and the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The motion does not propose to initiate a debate upon whether or not this country should join either of these organisations or communities.  It does not intend to initiate a debate upon the merits of joining or not joining the Common Market or the proposed Free Trade Area.  Still less does it ask the House now, and on the meagre information before the country at the moment, to come to any decision whatever on whether or not we should join either the Common Market or the Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>The object of the motion is to secure that all the representatives of the people, whether in the Dáil or in the Seanad, and through them the country, will have the fullest possible information upon these vital matters which <Col N="631" /> will have such a profound effect upon our economic and social life now and in the future and so that the vital decisions that must be made will be taken in the fullest knowledge and by a well-informed people.  The motion does not in any way seek to detract from the ultimate responsibility of the present Government, or any other Government that may be in office when vital decisions have to be taken, to carry out on behalf of the nation that ultimate responsibility.</P>
    <P>There are, as will be observed, in the motion, references to the Free Trade Area and the European Economic Community. The establishment of the European Economic Community preceded the proposal for a Free Trade Area.  Six of the important countries of Europe, on the 25th March of this year, signed a treaty, very elaborate in its provisions, very ambitious in its objects, and one which certainly stirred into activity, if not apprehension, many of the other countries that were not parties to that treaty.</P>
    <P>The treaty came as a result of considerations and proposals that had been going on for some time and the rapidity with which that treaty was put into shape and form really gave food for thought to the other members of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation and made them wonder with some measure of alarm how their own national interests might be involved prejudicially by the establishment of the proposed European Economic Community or Common Market as it is more commonly called.</P>
    <P>That Economic Community which was intended to be formed by the treaty had as its proposal the establishment of a Common Market for the members of the community.  It envisaged that each of the members of the community would within their own borders have free trade and would abolish all impediments or barriers to free trade amongst the community.  It further provided for the creation of common tariffs between the member countries.</P>
    <P>The proposals for a Free Trade Area which emerged from the establishment of this European Economic Community <Col N="632" /> differ somewhat fundamentally from the proposals dealing with the Common Market.  Those nations in the O.E.E.C. who had not taken part in, or had held aloof from, the proposals for a Common Market endeavoured to discover whether or not it was possible to achieve some form of association or link between their countries and the countries of the European Economic Community.  It was found as a result of an inquiry that it was technically possible to have such an association.</P>
    <P>Great Britain rather hurriedly proceeded to announce her determination to take part in the proposed Free Trade Area, with certain reservations of a very important character.  This country, in common with other countries affected, has to make up its mind as to what its attitude will be towards those proposals.  It would be utterly impossible for the country to maintain an attitude of mere benevolence towards the proposal.  It would be still less possible for this country to maintain an attitude of complete isolation.</P>
    <P>There will be involved in these proposals the creation of a market or markets comprising something like 250,000,000 people and each of the countries involved, either in the Common Market, European Economic Community or the proposed Free Trade Area when it is set up, will be bending all their national energies towards capturing as far as they possibly can the biggest share of that large market for their own nationals.  We simply cannot allow ourselves to be outside the scope of those proposals.  The extent to which we will be involved or the conditions on which we may be allowed to participate are matters of vital concern for all of us.  I think there has been no topic in recent years that has had such an impact upon the Irish public mind as these proposals for a Free Trade Area and a Common Market.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, it is gratifying to know, as a further proof of the fact that our people are growing in political and economic strength and knowledge and education that they have realised the importance to the country and to them <Col N="633" /> as individuals of the proposals that are agitating the financiers and economists of Europe, of which, incidentally, we form part.  The impact upon the public mind has been such that there are in the country discussions in various groups, industrial, agricultural, scientific and educational, of the effects of these proposals upon us and of whether we ought or ought not join the Common Market or the Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>It is because, in one sense, that there has been so much discussion in the country, that we determined to put down this motion.  It is because we felt that the decisions were being taken without adequate information, without sufficient advertence to all the difficulties and all the factors involved that we thought a lead should be given here in public by the members of the Oireachtas to the parties and organisations concerned in the country, either from their economic or social interests.</P>
    <P>When these proposals were taking shape early this year the inter-Party Government sent a circular to agricultural and industrial organisations seeking their interest and stimulating their concern in reference to the proposals. I suggest to the Deputies that this motion is merely an extension of the motive behind the Government's action at that time in seeking the help and assistance of the people closely affected, either in their economic interest, agricultural interest or social interest, by these proposals for a Common Market and a Free Trade Area.  If I may make a quotation from portion of that circular it may assist Deputies to understand the motive behind the present proposals.</P>
    <P>A short history of the proposals was set out in that circular and the problems were indicated.  Within one of the paragraphs was stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government are at present considering whether it would be in Ireland's interests to join such an area, and, if so, on what basis we should seek to have the area constituted in relation to the several matters referred to.</P>
    <P>Whether we join the area or not, the formation of a Free Trade Area <Col N="634" /> and the emergence of an integrated Western European market of 250,000,000 people are developments which would have significant implications for Ireland's economy requiring fundamental re-appraisal of economic plans and policies.  The effects, favourable and unfavourable, of entering a Free Trade Area on Ireland's agriculture, industry and general economy, not only now but in the future, must be most carefully weighed.  Amongst the specific considerations which must be borne in mind in this context are the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  the effects of assuming an obligation to remove existing protection progressively over a period of years and of foregoing the right to impose further protection against countries within the area;</P>
    <P> (b)  the possibility of the inclusion in the agreement establishing the area of provisions for:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  escape clauses related, for example, to balance of payments difficulties;</P>
    <P> (ii)  special arrangements modifying the obligations in favour of member countries like Ireland, whose economies are not fully developed;</P>
    <P>(iii)  investment and re-adaptation funds and</P>
    <P>(iv)  measures to avoid unfair competition (dumping, for example): and</P>
    <P> (c)  the benefits likely to accrue to Irish exports from the removal of tariffs and other trade barriers in the countries of the area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It wound up by saying the notice was being circulated so that interested bodies would have the opportunity of putting forward their views to the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>That was an effort to secure the interest, the experience and advice from interested parties in the country.  It was an effort, not merely to stimulate the interest of the people in these proposals <Col N="635" /> which would have such a profound effect on their lives and future economy of the country, but was an effort to get them in behind the Government so that whatever vital decisions might have to be taken would be taken with unity and courage, and any risks involved&mdash;and there would be risks&mdash;would be realised and fully understood if it was necessary to take those risks and necessary to override particular interests, or selfish interests, in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I know from my own experience in dealing with that problem that the Government has a very difficult task and is engaged in harnessing the best brains that are available in diplomacy, finance and economics, to advise them of the facts and factors involved in all these considerations, so that the Government may determine its own policy and have its proposals ready for a certain date for submission to the Dáil and to the country.  I do not think that is enough.  I do not think it is right or proper that this policy should be considered, and the problems involved and the decisions taken, merely by the Government, however carefully they may make them or whatever expert advice is available to them, without every Deputy and every Senator being fully informed and fully educated on all the factors involved, and on the facts that would have to be faced.</P>
    <P>Since these proposals emerged, further difficulties have arisen.  Great Britain would appear to make it as a condition of her entry into the Free Trade Area that agriculture should be excluded. Agriculture is the basis of our hopes of prosperity in this country.  It is vitally necessary for us, therefore, to know what policy we ought to adopt in reference to that proposal.  It is of fundamental importance for us to bear in mind that we are living in a highly competitive world, that our whole hope of progress, political, economic and social, rests upon the development of our primary industry here, agriculture.</P>
    <P>How is that going to be affected by these proposals?  We do not know the facts yet and it is for the purpose of getting the facts that this motion is <Col N="636" /> put down, so that Deputies of every Party may sit together as a unified body, leaving politics aside, leaving their own particular points of view aside, and collect and collate the facts and as a body representing the Dáil inform the Dáil of all the facts, so that all Parties may approach the consideration of these important problems, and the factors involved in this very vital and fundamental matter, in a detached way, thinking only of the paramount interests of the nation.</P>
    <P>That is what this motion proposes to do, to ask the Dáil and the Seanad to appoint their representatives on a committee charged with the duty of ascertaining the facts, ascertaining the problems involved in all the considerations in the Common Market and Free Trade Area, so that all the factors, the facts and the problems may be collected, collated, assessed and put before Deputies here so that they may approach the problems with a full appreciation of these very fundamental matters.</P>
    <P>We have had problems for many years but whatever Government has been in office since 1922 it has endeavoured, in very difficult circumstances, to make up for centuries of neglect in our own country, to build up our industries and agriculture to the level required.  We may think, as we do think, that for many years too much emphasis was placed on one sector in our economy, to the disadvantage of other sectors, but whatever our views may have been politically we have all been endeavouring to build up our country.</P>
    <P>These proposals for a Common Market present us with a challenge. Personally, I think they also present us with an opportunity but we cannot accept the challenge or avail of the opportunity unless every Deputy, every Senator and all the organisations affected throughout the country, know the problems, know the facts, and are able to assess what is involved and, if possible, leave aside their own particular selfish or vested interest in the nation's concern.  It would not be possible, in my view, and in the view of many of my colleagues, to arrive at a really satisfactory national policy in <Col N="637" /> this matter unless all sections of the country, and all Parties in the House, worked together in a unified effort to meet this challenge and to avail of the opportunities.  This motion is put down for that purpose, as a method of achieving that very desirable aim.</P>
    <P>Since the proposals emerged, further difficulties have arisen, as I have said. Great Britain is insisting on agriculture being left outside.  How far that will be persisted in nobody knows. How are we going to be affected by these proposals?  One matter that must be borne in mind in all our consideration and thoughts on this very vital matter is that there will be no sentiment allowed to operate in connection with the proposals for the Common Market and the Free Trade Area. There will be nothing but highly competitive effort on the part of each nation in each of the communities.  We have to gird ourselves and arm ourselves for that highly competitive idea.</P>
    <P>We have our trade agreements with Great Britain.  We will get our agreements with Great Britain on the strength of the case we can make, not because we are either in or out of the Commonwealth.  We have the emergence recently within the last few weeks of expressions of views from certain members of the British Commonwealth of Nations desiring closer trade relations between the members of the Commonwealth.  How are we going to be affected by that?  I know it could be said that they are matters for the Government.  One phrase that irritates me&mdash;there is only one other phrase that irritates me more&mdash;is that &ldquo;it is the duty of the Government to govern&rdquo;. The other phrase that irritates me is that &ldquo;it is the duty of an Opposition to oppose&rdquo;.  The duty of the Government is to seek views where it can and it is the duty of the Government to accept ultimate responsibility.  In circumstances such as these the duty of the Government is to bring into close co-operation, consultation and effort every section of the community and every Party represented in the House.</P>
    <P>I want this committee&mdash;I hesitate to use a phrase which I do not like either &mdash;to be more than a fact-finding committee. <Col N="638" /> I envisage this committee as a committee that will work and work hard to educate each member of that committee and through that committee educate each member of the Dáil in the very vital interests that are affected by the Common Market or the Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>We have been concentrating, as I was about to say some few moments ago, on building up our country and, perhaps, we have unduly emphasised the building up of our manufacturing industries to the detriment of agriculture. That may not be the view of all Parties but it is certainly our view. At all events we can no longer afford to concentrate our efforts inwardly on the home market.  This is a challenge to us as a nation.  Decisions must be taken, decisions which will affect our country fundamentally for many years. Those decisions can best be taken by the members of a Parliament fully informed and fully educated.  I envisage this committee as a means of informing and educating the House so that when the ultimate proposals come before the Government it will not be a case of people saying: &ldquo;The Government have the means of ascertaining the facts.  They have the diplomats, the financiers, the economists who should know what they are doing and we will just walk in behind them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want every Deputy to approach the proposals of any Government on a constructive basis but above all in an educated and informed fashion.  If the committee do their work well, finding out what are the facts, what are the problems, what will be the effect on our economy of participation in the proposed Free Trade Area or the Common Market, and then, having done their work, present a report to each member of the Dáil and Seanad for study, then I think we will have the material for building up unified public opinion in the country and unified, informed and educated opinion in the Dáil.  In that way we will know that in the very serious problems that are involved it will not be merely a Party decision that will be taken but a national decision in the national interest. Accordingly, I recommend the acceptance of this proposal by the Government.</P>

      <P>The Government is unable to accept the proposal in this motion.  I hope the motion will not be put to a division but if it is we will have to vote against it.  Our objections to the proposals of the motion are both practical and constitutional.  I propose to deal with the practical objections first.</P>
      <P>The motion suggests that consideration should start now through the instrument of a committee of the kind described in the motion of the probable economic consequences of a decision to join or not to join the proposed Free Trade Area or the European Economic Community.  So far as the Free Trade Area is concerned, it would not be possible for any committee, no matter how constituted or how well informed, to assess intelligently the consequences of membership of the Free Trade Area until there was some knowledge of what the obligations of membership would entail for this country.  We do not know now what will be the obligations of membership, nobody knows. No country in Western Europe is in a position of knowing what the obligations of membership of a Free Trade Area will be.  Still less do we know now the extent to which these obligations may be modified to meet the special circumstances of our case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello said he did not want to initiate a debate on the merits of the Free Trade Area proposal.  Why not?  I think Deputy Costello would answer that question by saying because we have not got now the knowledge, the information and the data needed to debate that question intelligently here.  The committee will be in no better position.  If such a committee were set up composed of intelligent persons it could do nothing at its first meeting except decide to adjourn <i>sine die</i> until it knew what it had to report about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello spoke about proposals and because he used that term more than once I think there may be some misunderstanding of what is <Col N="640" /> happening.  The only decision which has yet been made was that taken by the council of O.E.E.C. in February last to begin negotiations for the bringing into being of a Free Trade Area which would on a multi-lateral basis associate the European Common Market, for which the six-nation agreement has already been concluded, with other members of the O.E.E.C. That is the only proposal we have yet of a definite kind&mdash;a proposal to begin negotiations to bring a Free Trade Area into being and to associate that area on a multi-lateral basis with the European Common Market.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of enabling these negotiations to take place, O.E.E.C. set up three committees or working parties.  The first of these working parties is concerned with the main problem, the technical measures necessary for associating the other countries of Western Europe as a group with the Common Market.  The second is examining the possibility of extending the idea of the Free Trade Area to cover agriculture, and the third committee is dealing with the special situation of countries like Ireland which are in course of economic development.</P>
    <P>These three committees are working, but none of them has reported.  Nobody would even attempt at this stage to forecast when they may report.  It is hoped that they will be able to submit their reports to the council of O.E.E.C. before the end of the year. There was an idea at the beginning that the planning would proceed more rapidly.  There was a suggestion that these committees would be able to report this month.  That idea has long since been abandoned&mdash;and even the estimate that the committees might complete their work and submit their reports before the end of the year is, in some quarters, regarded as optimistic.</P>
    <P>Ireland is, of course, represented on all three committees.  It is not even possible, from the work that has already been done by these committees, to reach a conclusion as to what probable form their reports may take.  Divergence of views has already <Col N="641" /> been revealed at the discussions.  It has occurred on a wide variety of matters in Committee No. 1&mdash;&ldquo;Committee No. 21&rdquo;, O.E.E.C. calls it&mdash;the main committee dealing with technical aspects.</P>
    <P>The differences which have occurred are, firstly, those between a group of countries that want to confine the agreement to one removing tariffs, quotas and other trade restrictions and to go no further than that, as against another group of countries which wants a more comprehensive association like the European Economic Community which would cover not merely the removal of restrictions on trade but also such things as transport, social welfare services, wage levels, employment opportunities, invisible transactions and so forth. Secondly, in that committee other divisions have appeared between one group who want a rigid system of tariff dismantling with a minimum of escape clauses or with no escape clause at all, and those who want a more flexible system.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody would attempt to forecast at this stage which viewpoint will predominate within that committee and determine the character of the report it will submit.  The second committee deals with agriculture and has a still more difficult problem.  I do not know if it is appreciated fully by all Deputies that free trade, in the sense in which these words are usually interpreted, in agricultural production, is not contemplated even by the European Economic Community, although the Rome agreement between the six countries who comprise that community does envisage a common tariff against the products of countries outside that community.</P>
    <P>The committee set up by O.E.E.C. in connection with the Free Trade Area proposals is considering whether that régime contemplated by the European Economic Community can be associated with the other members of O.E.E.C. in a way which will avoid the discrimination which is implied in the agreement.  That committee has a most difficult task because these common market countries have not yet worked out a policy to achieve their <Col N="642" /> aim.  The agreement contemplates that an agricultural conference for that purpose will be convened after the agreement has been ratified.</P>
    <P>It is therefore clearly impossible for the O.E.E.C. committee dealing with agricultural problems to make a report based upon any reliable knowledge of what will happen even in the European Economic Community.  The British position in that regard is well known: the British Government has proposed that all agricultural production defined as food and drink for man or animal, whether raw or processed or packed, should be excluded altogether from the agreement.  One of the tasks given to this committee of O.E.E.C. is to consider how that attitude of the British Government can be reconciled with the main conception of the European Free Trade Area.  That committee has hardly begun its work and the discussions of the committee so far have not proceeded beyond the point of clarifying the problems that have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The third committee, the committee which is dealing with the special problems of countries in the course of economic development, has been working and the case which we prepared for that committee has been considered by them.  As the House is aware a delegation from that committee came here last week for consultations with Ministers.  The negotiations are proceeding.  It is not contemplated that they will be resumed earlier than the end of September or early in October and of course it is only a matter of guesswork when one tries to assess what the outcome of that committee's deliberations may be. At some stage, and before the negotiations with that committee can be finalised, it will be necessary to have discussions with the British Government on the implications, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, of the Free Trade Area.  And, indeed, until such discussions have taken place it is clear that one very important factor bearing on the whole issue will not have been clarified.</P>
    <P>Most of the organisations in the country which represent special interests, in response to the invitations <Col N="643" /> issued to them, have submitted very useful memoranda of their views, but all of them, I think without exception, have referred to their inability to make more useful comment upon the proposals until the reports of these working parties are available.  I do not think that these organisations are in any need of information about the interests they represent and yet it is clear that they have realised that action such as is proposed in this resolution at this stage is, from their point of view, completely premature.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have said that the negotiations for the drafting of the European Free Trade Area Agreement are not nearly at the stage when it is possible for us, or indeed for any country, to assess with any precision the economic consequences of a decision to participate or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I think it is in the public interest that that fact should be made very clear.  No sudden or radical change affecting our trade is about to take place.  Indeed, the setting up now by the Dáil of such a committee as is proposed would give a wrong impression by conveying a suggestion of urgency that is not justified.  Even if the case we are making for a special protocol in the agreement modifying the obligations of membership in our case is rejected <i>in toto</i> I think we would still be a long way from the point of decision.  I think that is a brief summary of the practical case that can be made against the proposal in this motion that a special committee should be set up to report upon the economic consequences of a decision to join or not to join the proposed Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>So far as the motion contemplates an examination of the desirability of joining or not joining the European Economic Community the idea is, I think, even more unrealistic.  It is true that the agreement for the setting up of that community has been completed and signed and its terms are known.  It is true that the process of ratifying that agreement has already started but in that case we could not join the community by our own unilateral decision.  The agreement provides <Col N="644" /> for the admission of additional states by the unanimous vote of the existing participants in the agreement.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we could or should in any circumstances, so long as the agreement is limited to those existing members, contemplate such an application.  It is fairly clear now that we could not get into the European Economic Community on a limited liability basis.  I understand Denmark has applied for admission to the European Economic Community so far as agriculture only is concerned and has been refused.  That agreement signed at Rome for the establishment of a European Economic Community commits those who are in the community to maintain a common tariff agreed by all against the products of countries outside it.  It contains also far-reaching provisions for economic integration as distinct from the mere removal of trade barriers, and for the harmonisation of social and financial policy.</P>
    <P>The obligations involved in membership of the community are of a character which I believe it would be impossible for us to accept at the present stage of our development or to accept in circumstances in which our nearest neighbour and largest customer remained outside it.  It is certainly not practicable to consider membership of the European Economic Community until the position regarding the Free Trade Area proposal has been made clear.  It is obvious that the obligations of members of the European Economic Community are far more rigid and onerous than are contemplated in regard to the Free Trade Area.  It would not be merely inappropriate but highly undesirable for the Dáil to set up a committee for the purpose of giving formal consideration to the desirability of joining the European Economic Community with these rigid and onerous obligations attaching to membership when the case we are making to the O.E.E.C. is that even the less onerous obligations of the Free Trade Area require modification in our circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would direct the attention of the Minister to the <Col N="645" /> fact that the motion does not envisage considering the desirability of joining or not joining either of these organisations. That is not in the motion at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What the motion says and what the motion means may be two different things, and I will come to that in a minute.  Any question of joining the European Economic Community would obviously have very profound implications so far as our trading relations with Britain are concerned and I think most intelligent people will accept that, if we are at any time to consider the question of joining the European Economic Community, it will be after the negotiations for the Free Trade Area have been concluded and the nature of the agreement for the establishment of a Free Trade Area known and fully understood.</P>
      <P>These are the practical objections to this motion, but there are other objections to it also.  I think, whether Deputy Costello intended it or not, this motion has got constitutional implications which are undesirable.  The Deputy may not have intended to propose the transfer to a Dáil Committee of what is constitutionally a function of the Government, but I think that is what the setting-up of this committee at the present juncture would mean. The Constitution puts squarely on the Government the responsibility for negotiating and concluding international agreements.  There is no doubt that, when the terms of the Free Trade Area agreements are known, the Government, the members of the Dáil and the public generally will have to take an important decision.  There is no doubt also that that decision will have to be based upon an assessment, such assessment as may be possible, of the economic consequences of going in or staying out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not now a question of whether it is desirable that the members of the Dáil or the public should be fully informed on all these matters and should have the knowledge and the information which will enable them to help in making that decision.  The question is whether a particular committee of the kind proposed in the motion under <Col N="646" /> discussion here is the best means of informing them and, as an argument against the setting-up of that committee, I urge that it would constitute a very dangerous and undesirable precedent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello has declared that he does not desire to detract from the responsibilities of the Government, but the establishment of the proposed committee would inevitably have that effect.  It is contemplated by him that there should be a Dáil Committee which would have power to send for persons and papers.  I do not know if he contemplates that this committee which he proposes should have the right to ask the officers of my Department, or of the Department of External Affairs, or the Department of the Taoiseach, or the Department of Agriculture to come before them and to express personal views there, or to reveal the instructions they get from their Ministers, or to answer questions designed to find out whether they are of a different viewpoint from that expressed by their Ministers in the Dáil. Any such arrangements would undermine the whole theory of ministerial responsibility.</P>
    <P>Ministers are here responsible to the Dáil, entitled to be questioned by any Deputy on any matter affecting their administration.  Members of the Dáil have the right to table motions for debate here.  That is the way that democratic Governments should work and not that private members of the Dáil should have the right of access to departmental files, the right to examine into the processes by which ministerial and Government decisions are taken.  Many of the documents which have been received from O.E.E.C. relating to this Free Trade Area proposal are marked as intended for confined circulation to members of the Government only.  Is it contemplated that members of the Dáil should have access to these documents? The motion does apparently contemplate that, irrespective of the intentions of those who framed them or sent them to us, they should be made available to Deputies outside the Government.</P>
    <P>Now this is not a question of Government <Col N="647" /> versus Opposition.  It is not a question of the Opposition sharing the burdens of Government.  The Government Party, presumably, would have in any committee set up in accordance with the procedure of this House a majority and would, therefore, be able to protect itself against the submission of a majority report which might be prejudicial to the interests of the Government or to the interests of good government.  The question here is not a Party question. It is a constitutional question whether a Dáil Committee is a more suitable instrument for the making of policy decisions than the constitutional Government.  We feel that would be a most undesirable precedent to establish.</P>
    <P>I have said that it is not a question of making information available to Deputies.  Deputy Costello defended his proposal on the ground that it would be a means of informing Deputies and, through Deputies, the country, about the issues involved in this matter.  It would be an instrument of education.  I have as much enthusiasm as he displayed for the giving of the fullest possible information to all members of the House and to the country and for ensuring that the information is properly assessed and understood and used intelligently to help in the making of right decisions. We have every desire to give to the Dáil and to the country the fullest information on this matter and to promote discussion on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello mentioned that when he was Taoiseach a memorandum was circulated to interested organisations, associations of traders, trade unions and so forth setting out the facts as they were then known.  I have since then circulated another memorandum to all these organisations bringing that information up to date, and the intention is to keep on supplying all members of the Dáil and the organisations interested, directly or indirectly, and the people generally with the information available to us from time to time, as soon as anything definite has happened. I do not know at what stage we may decide that further informative <Col N="648" /> memoranda of that kind can add anything to those already circulated. The committees of O.E.E.C. have to make progress reports to the chairman before the end of this month and I doubt if these progress reports will be very informative.</P>
    <P>The important stage of these negotiations will be reached when the committees make their final reports and there will be a considerable interval between the submission and publication of their final reports and the actual preparation of the Free Trade Area Agreement for discussion and possible amendment by the Council of O.E.E.C.</P>
    <P>In so far, therefore, as there is any desire to improve the machinery by which information concerning the proposal or the progress of the negotiations on the proposal can be supplied to the House or to the country, we will welcome suggestions.  The desire is to give the fullest possible information, to provoke the widest possible discussion on the proposal.  We are at all times prepared to hear the views of Deputies, particularly the leaders of Parties in opposition, on the position as it develops.  We might at some stage consider methods of consultation but it would be difficult to provide for more formal consultation without appearing to prejudice or weaken the Government's responsibility.</P>
    <P>In so far as Deputy Costello has recognised the need for maintaining the responsibility of the Government in this matter, he will also, I am sure, appreciate the difficulty of having any formal means of consultation.  In the last resort, the Government must make its own decisions.</P>
    <P>We recognise, of course, that the policy decided now in regard to this Free Trade Area idea will affect the economic position of this country long after those of us who are now debating it will have received our temporal or eternal rewards and, therefore, it would be very useful if general agreement upon the approach to the whole issue was found to be possible.  So far as we are concerned, we will certainly try to promote it but even there it is necessary to put in a qualification because no Government living up to its <Col N="649" /> responsibilities will take decisions that it does not believe to be wholly right merely for the sake of getting agreement or avoiding the possibility of controversy. All Governments must eventually stand and act upon their own judgment.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, the obligation under the Constitution to bring to the Dáil for ratification by the Dáil any international agreement that we may make.  The last word is spoken by Parliament.  We will have the responsibility, and can easily find means of discharging it, of giving the Dáil an opportunity of discussing and passing judgment on a decision not to make an agreement or to join in an agreement if that should be the decision.</P>
    <P>Whatever decision the Government will take will be based upon its assessment of the economic consequences for this country likely to follow on it.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is realistic to think that it will be possible for the Government, with all its expert advisers behind it and all the trade organisations of the country conveying their views to it, much less a Dáil Committee, to assess with any precision what the economic consequences of such a proposal as this may be.  It would imply an ability to look forward ten, 15, 25 years, to understand what would happen, not merely in this country but in other countries.  I do not know that it would be possible ever to do more than decide upon a general line of approach to the whole issue of economic development and methods of economic development and to take a decision upon the specific proposals relating to the Free Trade Area in the light of that general approach.</P>
    <P>But, in so far as it is possible to assess what the economic consequences may be, can we hope that a Dáil Committee or the Government or anyone else can do better than note the conclusions of specialised trade organisations as to the effect of the operation of the proposal upon the trades and economic activities that they know intimately?  I do not think so and, therefore, I think that part of the process of educating the people and informing the Dáil about this matter, <Col N="650" /> of giving them the material which will enable them to take a decision in this matter, will be the making available to them in the appropriate manner and at the appropriate time and, of course, with the permission of the organisations concerned, the views which they have expressed to us.</P>
    <P>I urge that this motion be not pressed to a decision.  If it is pressed to a decision we will have to oppose it. I have tried to indicate the very practical reasons why it is impossible to establish such an inquiry at this time. I have indicated the theoretical objections to a committee, as is proposed here, at any time, but I want to make it quite clear, in conclusion, that it is not because there is any desire on the part of the Government to withhold information from the Dáil or to deny the Dáil access to the knowledge which will enable them to assess the economic consequences of this proposal but because we do not think that this is a good way of serving these ends and because we believe that these ends can be better served by the methods now being used.  In so far as these methods are concerned, we will, as I have indicated, always be prepared to consider any suggestions that may be made by any of the Parties in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to approach this motion and the consideration of this whole question in a scrupulously non-Party way because I realise that the issue which is now before us transcends all lines of political demarcation.  The concept of a European Free Trade Area and its ramifications is the most stupendous challenge that has ever been thrown down to the economic stability of this country.  The Free Trade Area concept and its possible evolution will call into question the ability of this country to maintain its economic and political independence.  I think the issues raised are so tremendous that we cannot afford to look upon this matter in a Party way.  What we must try to do is to distil the collective wisdom of all Parties, sections of our people, and specialist organisations in order to give us as much material as possible to enable us to build up a case, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Free Trade Area in regard to our special position, having <Col N="651" /> regard to our economically weak position and having regard to the industrial giants with which it is suggested we should merge in Europe.</P>
      <P>The issue before us to-day, having regard to our limited economic development, is one which, no matter what we do, will have a very serious impact on the economy of our country. If a Free Trade Area, consisting of six European countries, comes into fruition and Great Britain decides to associate herself with that undertaking, then in accordance with the concept of the Free Trade Area Britain will be obliged, if we stay out of the Free Trade Area, to impose tariffs against our imports to Britain.  That would mean we would lose the benefit of the trade agreements which we have with Britain.  It would mean that approximately £8,000,000 to £10,000,000 worth of goods of a non-agricultural kind that go into Britain duty free would all be taxed by Britain, because of the fact that under the free trade scheme the countries concerned bind themselves to trade freely with one another but to impose an agreed tariff on those countries outside the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to go into the Free Trade Area it would mean we would be obliged to let down all the protective barriers that have been built up over 30 years and behind which it has been possible to develop to some extent an industrial fabric.  Has anybody contemplated for one moment what the letting down of the protective barriers would mean to Irish Industry?  I know it was calculated in the Department of Industry and Commerce that the letting down of the protective barriers would involve the disemployment of 60 per cent. of our industrial workers. Taking the number of industrial workers at approximately 154,000 in 1955 that would mean disemployment for 100,000 workers, or possibly fewer if food and drink were excluded from the commodities covered by the Free Trade Area.  At all events that was the estimate of the Department of Industry and Commerce of the possible disemployment if traffic barriers were let down.  Going into the Free Trade Area on the basis now <Col N="652" /> visualized means, according to the architects of the area, letting down those traffic barriers and having free trade within the area.</P>
    <P>We have trade with that European area but at the present time it is a lopsided trade.  I think the figures of our exports to European countries amount to £5,500,000 and our imports from these European countries represent over £34,000,000 so that the difficulty of establishing ourselves in regard to trade in these countries is overwhelming.  As a matter of fact, a good deal of the export trade to these countries is in non-industrial goods.  It is in agricultural goods, simply because these countries want agricultural goods.</P>
    <P>No matter what we decide to do as regards the Free Trade Area, go in or stay out, the emergence of such an area represents a challenge to our economic and political independence. It represents a challenge to our ability to sustain ourselves as a weak unit within a highly industrialised orbit. Therefore, I look upon this as a matter which is a challenge to each and every one of us to see what it is possible to do to ensure that the Irish case is made with cogency and reinforced with the logic which may make that case irresistible.  When are we going to get the case made?</P>
    <P>This motion suggests that a committee of the Dáil and Seanad should be set up for the purposes of reporting upon the question of economic consequences which are likely to follow the participation or non-participation of this country in a proposed Free Trade Area and the European Economic Community.  With all respect I do not think that a Dáil Committee, or an Oireachtas Committee of this kind, is the best medium for extracting that information.  If I were Minister for Industry and Commerce, I would say that such a committee is not the best manner of getting that information.</P>
    <P>I think what is needed is an economic secretariat to ascertain all the information we can get on this matter, then distil it and let us try to present a case for our special position in the light of the information we thus obtain. <Col N="653" /> When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I suggested to the Government that we should circulate the trade unions and employers' organisations of all kinds with whatever information we had, in the form of a memorandum, so that they could consider the impact of the Free Trade Area in relation to their economic activities here. I said at that time that the officials of my Department would be available to elucidate any point on which clarification was wanted and to give these organisations as much information as possible.</P>
    <P>I did that because I believe we have got to get the greatest possible measure of co-operation from all these organisations. We have got to get as many people with us as possible in the formulation of a policy which will not represent just the policy of a particular Government, which policy rarely represents much more than half the community.  Rather should we get a policy which represents the whole community. In the Department of Industry and Commerce there was a committee which represented not only that Department but also all other Departments. It was the Foreign Trade Committee, and that committee did a great amount of work on this question of the Free Trade Area.  As far as Free Trade Area discussions have progressed, I think there is a vast mass of material available on what is intended by the concept of a Free Trade Area, and what the consequences are going to be, on the assumption that what is in the minds of the architects of the scheme at the present time will ultimately be carried into the final scheme when it is in operation.</P>
    <P>I think this matter of a Free Trade Area has a significance not merely for those in the European Economic Community but also has a significance for other countries outside it.  Countries like Greece, Spain, the Scandinavian countries such as Sweden and Austria will all be affected by this idea of a Free Trade Area.  They have their own particular views and some of these views are common to more than one country.  All their cases will presumably be put in due course.</P>
    <P>I do not think, on the information <Col N="654" /> available to me that we would normally think of joining the European Economic Community, but once the Free Trade Area comes into being, we cannot ignore its existence and our policy in this respect may be shaped, not even so much by our own consideration&mdash; because you cannot decide your attitude in this matter objectively&mdash;but in very large measure by what Britain does.  We have a market in Britain for our exports, and that is the country in which we sell most of our products. That is the most valuable market we have got to-day.  Therefore, we must watch all these Free Trade Area developments with an eye to what the British do in relation to that area.  I do not think it is possible for us to stay out if Britain goes in nor do I think it is possible for us to go in if Britain stays out.  Therefore, the relationship of the British attitude to our attitude is one which in the long run will profoundly affect the ultimate decision we take.</P>
    <P>As I said, what we need above all is the maximum amount of information on the repercussions of the establishment of the Free Trade Area on the whole Irish economy.  As the Minister admitted, the question of our participation will not arise until such time as agreement has been reached with the Free Trade Area and then presumably we may endeavour to secure our association with that Free Trade Area on terms which will be least onerous so far as we are concerned.  Having regard to the number of committees which are meeting to deal with this problem, I imagine it will be quite a considerable time before all the problems which are thrown up for solution are dealt with by these committees.  The scene will change from week to week and from month to month.  Many difficulties not now foreseen may very well arise before we are in a position to come to any decision, and it is only when final decisions are taken <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Free Trade Area and Britain determining our attitude to the Free Trade Area that it may be prudent for us to come to a decision.</P>
    <P>Referring this matter to a committee of the Dáil and Seanad is not likely to advance our knowledge on the subject to any great extent.  I do not think the <Col N="655" /> members of a Dáil and a Seanad Committee can be got to apply themselves energetically and dynamically to an examination of this problem with the care and zeal that are necessary if they are to be a fruitful fact-finding committee. It would be better to get together an economic secretariat, to get the best brains we can in the Civil Service and outside for the purpose of constantly surveying and detailing the various moves and the variety of voluminous documentation which is being thrown up by an examination of this problem in Europe.  That is the kind of committee that will give the best results.  I do, of course, think that there is an obligation on the Government not to stand on any starchy rights in this regard.</P>
    <P>Whatever Government is in office when this matter is decided will be making a decision which we probably will not be able to change for a very long time, if indeed ever.  Therefore, it is essential that whatever we do should be done with the greatest possible number of people sharing responsibility for the decision which is taken.  Therefore, the Government has the obligation of consulting with the different Parties from time to time, not in any detailed way but in a broad informative way so as to keep those Parties informed as to the moves which are being made on this whole question. If the Government were prepared to do that, to give us the benefit of research by an economic secretariat, that would be the best type of machinery at this stage by which we could get at all the known facts as they affect or will possibly affect our relationship with the Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>We have a case to make and I think the officials who went to Paris to make the Irish case made a good case.  They have put before the working parties the special position of Ireland and they have been able to make it clear that this means for us something vastly different from what it means to those who are in the European Economic Community.  Perhaps they can still make a stronger case in the light of the developments which take place before the Free Trade Area is established, if it is established.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> This whole concept of the European Free Trade Area was one which arose out of a desire to promote greater economic co-operation between the countries of Western Europe.  It would be a sad thing if the O.E.E.C. became an instrument of what could only be economic catastrophe for this country. If the Free Trade Area means greater co-operation, a great integration for the mutual advantage of Europe, then the advantages ought to be obvious. If those benefits are obvious and if they are applicable to all, well and good; let all share in them.  However, having regard to our undeveloped position, to the economic backwardness of the country <i>vis-a-vis</i> those countries with which we are asked to associate, we are entitled to say to the authors of the Free Trade Area that if the Free Trade Area requires the promotion of co-operation, the promotion  integration that is to bring European countries closer together for their mutual advantage, then we ought not to be asked to bear the grievous burdens in the way of letting down our protective barriers until we are at least shown the corresponding benefits which we will get by association with the Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>If the authors of the Free Trade Area say this is good for European co-operation, good for European integration, there is no reason why we should be excluded from the good. But it would be obviously unfair that we should be expected to drop all our protective barriers causing, as it would, catastrophic disemployment of our people while our economy and our industrial machine were not geared to take advantage of whatever benefits are available in the Free Trade Area.</P>
    <P>It may well be possible to secure agreement to allow this country to continue its special trade relations with Great Britain.  These trade relations are vitally and fundamentally assailed if Britain goes into the Free Trade Area, because Britain then must drop the trade agreement with us and will be compelled to impose tariffs on our goods while all our friends in the Free Trade Area will be able to send their goods, tariff-free into the British market, whereas at the present time, <Col N="657" /> even with no tariffs on our industrial goods, we are finding it extremely difficult to keep our place in that market with the competition that exists not only from within Britain but from some highly tariffed goods coming in from other countries.</P>
    <P>I think we have a special case to make.  I believe that whatever Government is in power when a decision is finally taken will do the best they can to protect the interests of the country. At the moment our concern is what is the best machinery through which a report could be made on the matter.  I do not think the Dáil and Seanad Committee suggestion is the best.  I think that the mover of the motion was mistaken in that, because I believe that an economic secretariat would be better able to serve the purpose by producing, from time to time, a memorandum which would be available to the different Parties.  The different Parties could themselves examine the material that would be available to them in that way and bring to the Government, in the course of periodic consultative conferences, their views on the problems, having been educated by such an economic secretariat.</P>
    <P>I would therefore propose that, as a result of this discussion, we would have some positive assurance that the different Parties in the House will be kept in touch through summaries of documents and of reports on happenings of importance in Europe on this subject of the Free Trade Area.  If we get that I think it will be possible for the Government, or whatever Government is in power at the time, to arrange for conferences to be held with the different Parties here so that, as far as possible, all the Parties will lend their aid in the preparation of the best possible case, treating us in a manner which takes cognisance of our economically weak position.</P>
    <P>If, in spite of the best possible plan we can get or hire on this question, our case is rejected by the architects of the Free Trade Area, the choice before us will be a bitter and a cruel one, whether we go in or stay out of the Free Trade Area.  Whether we do one or the other, unless we can get adequate safeguards for the maintenance <Col N="658" /> of our present trade, the decision to be made will be one which, as I said at the beginning, may undermine speedily the economic and even the political independence of our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at once I have no desire to press this to a division. Our principal desire was to raise the issue and have it ventilated.  I do not think the Leader of the Labour Party is quite conversant with the proposal we have in mind.  I entirely agree with him that the Minister for Industry and Commerce must fortify himself with an economic advisory committee drawn from the staff of his own experts, of his own colleagues in the Government and, very possibly, outside advisers whom he may wish to consult or employ from time to time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is something rather different.  For instance, Deputy Norton, when speaking, dwelt on various aspects of this question which I am sure are quite novel to most members of the House.  The purpose of the motion was to provide a machine whereby the members of Dáil Éireann and of the Seanad would be informed of the fundamental facts.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce rightly said, when speaking, that the exclusive constitutional function of the Government is to formulate policy.  He said that in the last analysis that policy is brought to Dáil Éireann.  The sole purpose of this resolution is that when the present Government, or any other Government in power at the time, does come to Dáil Éireann with a grave decision of the character envisaged by the Leader of the Labour Party, it will get an informed Dáil who will know something of the problems that the Government has been digesting and confronting and which the Government's proposals are designed to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste seemed to take fright at the idea of sending for officials of any Department of State outside his own and of subjecting them to an examination.  That, he thought, was a constitutional monstrosity.  Does the Minister forget that I, a member of the Opposition, will preside to-morrow morning over a meeting of the Public <Col N="659" /> Accounts Committee when I shall send for all the officials of his Department and when I have the right to send for the most junior official of his Department and question him most closely on any figure I may require some information on as regards administration?  I may not ask his opinion on policy but I am entitled to question him as closely as I please on any matter of administration.  If I am not satisfied I, as chairman, supported by a majority of the members of the Opposition, can require the Minister to bring before me any departmental file.  Accordingly, I do not see any very shocking constitutional horror in suggesting that a committee of Dáil and Seanad should be set up for the purpose of getting information&mdash;nothing else, no question of policy.</P>
    <P>While listening to the Minister speaking to-day, I got the impression from him that one of the practical objections, apart from the constitutional objection, was that there was nothing to inquire into yet, that it was all, as yet, in the air.  Here is the treaty.  The Minister must have a copy of it if I have one.  I can read him the article under which any European State may ask to join the community.  I submit to the House that the Minister himself must have known&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Economic Community Common Market.  Article 237 says that any European State may ask to join the community, exactly as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said.  The treaty exists for the Common Market.  I was present in Paris at the meeting of the O.E.E.C. at which the concept of the Free Trade Area was born.  I heard Mr. McMillan say, when presiding as chairman, that <Col N="660" /> while Great Britain could not contemplate joining the Common Market, he would ask the British delegates&mdash;Mr. McMillan was there only in his capacity as chairman&mdash;to propound their views on it.  He was authorised by the O.E.E.C. to open communications with Mr. Spaak as Secretary of E.E.C. to get information for O.E.E.C. The British delegate then declared that while they were not prepared to contemplate joining the E.E.C. they were prepared to consider very favourably being associated with it on certain terms which he then proceeded to outline. These are the kind of facts that the members of the Oireachtas should know.</P>
      <P>Another interesting statement which seemed to involve a certain inconsistency was made by the Tánaiste when he said that Denmark had applied for admission to the O.E.E.C. on terms.  The Minister tells us he is informed that Denmark has been turned down flat.  That is something I have no doubt the Leader of the Labour Party would hear with interest, that Denmark has put this thing to the test, has tried to gain admission on the basis of agriculture only, and the Tánaiste tells us now that the answer is categorically &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These are the very facts we thought it was so desirable for the ordinary member of the Dáil and Seanad to know.  I have certain reservations in my mind of a constitutional character, which I think also trouble the Tánaiste himself, regarding the proposal of the Leader of the Labour Party about constant consultation.  I agree with the Tánaiste, and I am a bit of a purist on this issue, that the Government has its responsibilities, that they are responsibilities of a kind nobody can share with them and that in the last analysis they have to come to Parliament and say: &ldquo;That is what we recommend and if you do not like it, turn it down.  No hard feelings, but you will have to get another Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how in our system of government&mdash;and I think it is the best system of government&mdash;that ultimate responsibility can be shared.  I think the Government has to come to Parliament <Col N="661" /> with what it proposes and believes to be right, and if Parliament does not like these proposals, then, without any hard feelings, there must be another Government or a general election.  Somebody else must take over and run the show.  I do not think we can have a situation outside wartime emergency&mdash;when there is in effect a national Government&mdash;where there can be a substantial abrogation of the ultimate responsibility of the legitimate Government of the country to come to Parliament with their proposals and stand or fall by them.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that our proposal is of a much narrower character and is designed merely to get information for everybody so that when the Government does come with proposals, or has any interim proposals to submit to the Oireachtas it will be confronted with an Oireachtas which knows what it is all about.  Is there anybody in the House who will maintain that the majority of us know the essential facts of even the existing situation?  I do not think we do.  If our scheme for giving that information does not commend itself to the Dáil, has anybody else any proposal to make whereby we can get for the members of the Legislation the information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that would provide what we are aiming to get.  We are not aiming to get information for a select coterie of our various Front Benchers.  What this is aiming at getting is information for the generality of members of the Dáil and Seanad so that they will constitute an informed deliberative Assembly when decisions have to be taken which, as the Leader of the Labour Party rightly said, may be of a most fundamental and irrevocable character.  I want to press this view.  Some machinery is wanted <Col N="662" /> whereby membership of this House and, through it, the people, may be informed of the facts.  If this plan does not commend itself, will somebody else propose some other plan?</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to leave this thought with the House.  Our system of Government is not the easiest system to operate but it is the price of freedom.  It would be much easier in situations of this kind if you had an executive and nothing else, from the executive point of view but the ordinary Deputies of this House constitute a two-way channel that not only brings, or ought to bring to this House, the feeling of the people at large, but ought also be able to channel down from this House to their own constituents certain essential information about the vital business of this State.  They cannot do that if they are not given the facts.  It is not necessary to adopt a special procedure to get that information for them about the vast majority of business transacted in this House because debate to and fro here ordinarily provides a Deputy with all the factual information he requires in respect of any issue that may be raised.</P>
      <P>Here is a Treaty of some 246 or 248 Articles; here, as the Tánaiste has rightly said are three committees of O.E.E.C. operating in circumstances in which the strangest divergencies are beginning to emerge; here, as most of us know, are Governments which are parties to this treaty, who are in a chronic condition of inability to survive; here, as the Leader of the Labour Party said, is a situation in which our judgment might require to be very profoundly influenced by the decision taken by the British Government.  All these are facts which the members of this House should know and which they do not at present know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these matters are facts on which members of the House should be able to have access to advice similar to that which a Minister has, because naturally a Deputy on this side will not accept from a Minister of the present Government as wholly objective a view expressed, because we naturally feel that the Minister's view of the proposal is influenced by his general political philosophy and outlook, but <Col N="663" /> all of us&mdash;certainly those of us who have been in Government&mdash;know that if one approaches the public servants of the State, they have been trained in the art of providing objective, factual information, not biassed one way or the other, awaiting their Minister's decision and thereafter operating policy.</P>
    <P>I think it would be very helpful to members of the House if, by some machinery, that kind of information were available to them purely on the factual basis on which it is available to members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Let us remember if we did adopt a procedure&mdash;and I entirely agree it should be looked upon as quite an unusual procedure and should not constitute a precedent for ordinary transactions&mdash;in a very radical matter like this we would not be doing something which was inimical to democratic institutions or anything of that kind because, in fact, what we would be doing would be adopting a procedure closely analogous to that which is in daily use in the Congress of the United States.</P>
    <P>I think that, to employ that procedure in regard to every piece of legislation which comes before a Legislature, is a bad business, tends to make legislation almost impossible and creates a highly undesirable situation. But the Americans like it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but it is a democratic system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is that distinction, but it is a recognised procedure not only in America but also in the French Assembly where they have regular committees on foreign affairs, finance, and a variety of other matters. The fact that it is done elsewhere does not necessarily mean that we should do it here, but the fact that it is done elsewhere in democratic Parliaments, in the French Assembly where the Government is responsible to Parliament, in the United States <Col N="664" /> Congress where the Executive is not responsible to Congress, is worth considering before we reject as unfavourable the terms of this proposal.</P>
      <P>In any case, if this is not accepted between now and next autumn will somebody think up a scheme whereby ordinary Deputies will get the kind of vital information they ought to have in order to keep intelligently abreast of this problem and, not least important, in order to be equipped to tell their constituents, who may ask them for a broad outline of what the problem is, what the facts are?  We have not got that information at present and I certainly would like to devise some machine which will supply it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands we have circulated memoranda which have dealt with all the facts up to date.  Admittedly, they did not contain opinions or interpretations of the facts, but rather mere statements of fact.  It is intended to continue that and, indeed, I would welcome suggestions as to additions that might be made to the memoranda but, at the moment, I find it difficult to see at what stage something which could be described as a fact and which should be communicated is likely to emerge. I should think that will not be for some time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>In principle, there is not radically any large difference between us and it is very largely a matter of devising some suitable machinery to achieve a common object.  If we cannot do it through the medium of this motion, then I hope that between now and the autumn some machinery will be discovered which will give effective purpose to what we all have in mind.</P>

      <P>The putting down of this motion has produced some useful results, though perhaps not the result we would wish for.  But there is one thing upon which we all appear to be agreed and that is that the problems involved in the Common Market or the Free Trade Area should not, so far as our country is concerned, be approached on a purely political basis.  We are all agreed that everybody so far as possible should be educated <Col N="665" /> on the facts and informed fully of the facts.  I do not think it is a derogation of Deputies to say that there is not a handful of them who have the remotest notion as to what the difference is between a Common Market and the proposed Free Trade Area, not to talk of having an informed view on what is involved.  I am quite certain also that if this motion had not been put down the facts that Deputies do know now, meagre as they are, as a result of the Tánaiste's statement and possibly as a result of my own contribution, would never have been disclosed to this House.  I do not think there can be any controversy about that.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose the Government or the Tánaiste had the slightest intention of ever taking the opportunity of informing the House in relation to the position regarding the Common Market and the Free Trade Area.  The very form and content of the Tánaiste's reply to the arguments I put forward rather make the case for information, if not through the machinery suggested by us or that suggested by the leader of the Labour Party, then by some other sort of machinery.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has just said there should be some method devised by which Deputies should be kept fully informed and, if I may again emphasise it, fully educated on the very vital issues involved in this matter.  I do not propose to go through the Tánaiste's arguments advanced against this motion.  They were very largely make-believe.  He read into the motion matters that are certainly not in it and most decidedly were not intended to be in it.  The motion was carefully framed to avoid any suggestion that we should discuss here on the motion whether or not it was desirable that we should join either the Common Market or the Free Trade Area. Certainly, the arguments put forward as to the constitutionality of the proposals were, as put by the Tánaiste, singularly indecisive.  To me, they smacked of officialdom&mdash;I nearly said bureaucracy.  Nothing is so abhorrent to the Civil Service mind as the creation of a precedent, and out comes the Tánaiste saying that this would create a dangerous precedent.</P>

      <P>I should like to see the official memorandum because I would be prepared to make a bet that that phrase occurred in an official memorandum from some of the Minister's advisers.  Deputy Dillon has dealt with this alleged unconstitutionality; it is all shadowy make-believe. There is no such thing as any breach of the constitutional principle of Government responsibility, none whatever. The motion was carefully framed to avoid that and I said so at the outset. I said it was a fact-finding commission, although I dislike that phrase, intended to educate Deputies who, I repeat again, know nothing whatever about the difference between the Common Market and the Free Trade Area.  I am sure 99 per cent. of Deputies and Senators are not properly informed of the issues and the arguments involved.</P>
      <P>If I were to go through the Tánaiste's various points I think I could explode most of them.  He said there is nothing to be considered. Deputy Dillon has referred to this Treaty.  How many Deputies knew that a Treaty of that bulky character existed?  It has 248 Articles, several Annexes, a Convention dealing with overseas territories and 11 Protocols attached to it.  In addition to that, how many Deputies know that this is one of the proposals contained in it?  How many know that the proposal in relation to the Common Market deals specifically with tariffs on agricultural produce?  Would it not be a matter for some consideration by this committee if it were set up, or some fact-finding committee, to find out what effect that would have on our exports to the Continent:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;For the signatories have agreed what the common tariff is to be in respect of certain items in list F, which includes some of Ireland's possible exports to the Continent.  It is provided, for example, that the common tariff on cattle will be 16 per cent.; on fresh, chilled or frozen meat 20 per cent.; on dead poultry <Col N="667" /> 18 per cent.; on live horses 11 per cent., and on butter 24 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely that is a matter that could be inquired into?  Surely that is a matter upon which it would be proper for a committee, or some body, to inform the House?  That is something that has been agreed upon.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste says there is no danger of any sudden or drastic decision being come to in reference to the Free Trade Area.  I think the answer to that is that the very concept of a Free Trade Area arose from the panic almost, certainly the apprehension, in the minds of those nations in O.E.E.C. who were concerned with the creation of European economic unity because of the effect it would have upon them and because of the rapidity with which this European Economic Community was brought into operation.</P>
    <P>I think everybody thought when it was brought into being that the nations and their spokesmen, their economists and financiers would be holding committees and working parties in <i>saecula saeculorum</i> before a Common Market was brought into being.  The fact is that it was brought into being with far greater rapidity than was ever thought of.  So quickly was it brought into being that the Treaty itself, big and comprehensive as it is, was framed with most remarkable speed.</P>
    <P>That Treaty has not yet been ratified. It has been signed by the six Foreign Ministers of the six nations that propose to form the community but it is about to be ratified by France.  It is only in the last day or two that it came before the French Assembly and from the account I read last night in the <i>Manchester Guardian,</i> it is highly likely that this Treaty will be ratified in a very short time by France and will then be in operation.  So that the very community, whose creation has brought into being the concept of a Free Trade Area, is itself being brought into operation with quite remarkable and unexpected rapidity. The Free Trade Area, which is the answer to this by the nations who are <Col N="668" /> not members of it, may be brought into operation with rather greater rapidity than we bargained for and we have got to be alive to all these implications.</P>
    <P>It may be that better machinery than we suggest in this motion could be devised.  We thought that it was desirable to educate Deputies and Senators.  It may be that Deputy Norton's suggestion is a better one for general purposes, but what I think does emerge from this debate is that there should be some sort of machinery created by the Government which will not affect their precious constitutional right of having the last word in policy, but which will, at least, have the advantage of telling us what is going on.</P>
    <P>Again I repeat, and I end on this note, that I have no doubt whatever&mdash; I will understate it&mdash;that 80 per cent. of Deputies had not the remotest notion about the things that have been brought into discussion here, and would not have had it and would never have been told it, if this motion had not been put down.</P>
    <P>We agree fully with Deputy Norton that this matter should be approached from an entirely non-Party and nonpolitical point of view, that the paramount consideration before our minds, in all our thoughts and conceptions about the matter is the national interest.  In case there should be any suggestion that we put down this motion for any reason other than those I have stated, in case it should be suggested that there was any political notion behind this, we do not propose to divide; we accept the invitation of the Tánaiste not to divide.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Age Limits for Officers of Defence Forces.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice of my intention to raise the subject matter of Question No. 23 on to-day's Order Paper on the Adjournment because I believe this is a more satisfactory way of dealing with a matter of that sort than trying to bring it to a conclusion by means of numerous supplementary questions to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> The reason I raise this matter is that I feel a great injustice may be done to a number of officers who, according to the proposal which the Minister has in mind, will not benefit by a two-years' extension of service that was granted, I think, in October, 1954, and which has now been in operation for almost three years.</P>
    <P>The circumstances which moved the Government at that time to grant the extension were that it was considered that these officers, who had rendered loyal and faithful service to all Governments since the establishment of the State, had experience which was valuable in the light of the then existing internal circumstances.  I need not elaborate here on the circumstances which existed but the fact that events occurred on the Border and across the Border caused the Government to consider the desirability in the national interest of having available officers who had previous experience of a somewhat similar situation.</P>
    <P>All of the officers concerned were required to have I.R.A. service and it was decided that they would get an extra two years provided each individual officer had satisfactory service, that his retention was recommended by his commanding officer, approved by the Minister, and that his health was satisfactory according to medical standards.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments against granting that extension which the Minister used, and I know the view is held by other officers, is that granting an extension to a limited number of officers prevents normal promotion.  It is well to reflect on the situation about promotion which obtained over the years.  Normally, in all armies, peacetime promotion is slow and the Army here was no exception to that rule. From the establishment of the State right down to the emergency of the war years, promotion was slow and all officers, and men for that matter, no matter what their rank, were affected by it.  That particular situation was not peculiar to this country.  In fact, it is common to all peacetime armies. Peacetime establishments involve a slow rate of promotion.</P>
    <P>The period varied in different armies <Col N="670" /> and even General Eisenhower was a lieutenant for several years.  However, when the emergency arose promotion was more rapid and our existing officers, as well as those who joined during the emergency, benefited by the more rapid promotion, including officers who had been commissioned after comparatively short courses.  This is a factor which should be borne in mind.  Regular officers, commissioned after the normal two years' course, have fulfilled the full training period but quite a number of the emergency officers had substantially shorter courses to fulfil.  That was necessary in view of the rapid growth of the Defence Forces.  However, the position is that quite a number of officers, as a result of the growth of the Army, benefited by that promotion.</P>
    <P>I am entirely in favour of rapid promotion. I believe if incentive is to be provided, and the enthusiasm and interest of officers are to be retained, there should be the incentive of rapid promotion.  Such promotion will be an incentive to all officers to display their maximum energies, to perfect themselves in their special capacities in order to gain whatever advancements which may come through proficiency in their skill and experience as soldiers.</P>
    <P>When this decision was taken, it was recognised that the peculiar circumstances of the time warranted an extension being granted.  In order to avoid causing any hardship on officers who have not benefited by this, special increment in pay was granted to officers up to the rank of captain.  They would normally be the officers affected by it because up to that rank promotion is automatic.  When this two years' extension was granted these officers concerned planned their future arrangements on the basis of it and I feel, that having once given a concession of that sort, it is unfair to withdraw it from them.  If the Minister proposes to withdraw that concession the full compensation should be made to the officers concerned.</P>
    <P>If this regulation is now cancelled the anomalous position will exist whereby some officers who would normally have retired earlier than others, will now find themselves serving <Col N="671" /> on longer than their fellow officers who would have retired before them. That anomaly will arise because of the fact that it is proposed to cancel this arrangement.</P>
    <P>I feel that, irrespective of what Government is in office, these officers with I.R.A. service have given loyal and faithful service to the State.  Some of them, perhaps, played a more important part than others, but they have all been foundation officers who rendered service to all Governments, and were responsible for the fine traditions which the Army has built up over the years.  They are handing on a very efficient and loyal Army to future generations.</P>
    <P>I feel if the Minister considers this will in any way impinge on the promotion which normally would be granted to other officers who are not entitled to this service, he might consider dealing with it by granting added years in their cases as well.  I certainly urge on him, in view of the fact that wherever in the past concessions or improvements in conditions have been granted in respect of Army service, provided the person concerned did not himself in one way or another warrant disciplinary action, these concessions should not be withdrawn.  I urge on him in the interest of fair play to those concerned, if he persists in withdrawing this regulation, that at any rate compensation of a material kind on the basis of salaries or allowances for the period in question, should be granted to the personnel concerned.</P>
    <P>This is not a matter which will arise again because these officers with I.R.A. service are a very small number. It was because of the particular circumstances at the time that it was felt it was in the national interest that their services should be retained.  I have no doubt they have given, and will continue to give, the same loyal service to the State no matter what Government is in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure Deputies, firstly, that I would have had no objection whatever to the previous Government having made provision for some <Col N="672" /> extra reward to these officers, whom Deputy Cosgrave has described as foundation officers in the Army.  I can well understand that the previous Government could be of the opinion that they deserved some extra reward and I would not for a moment object to them providing that, if they had done so in the proper way, out of the Exchequer.  In actual fact the steps taken to make special provisions for these foundation officers were taken at the expense of other serving Army officers.  In order to reward these foundation officers, other officers had their prospects of promotion, to which they could reasonably look forward, taken away from them.</P>
      <P>The effect of that on the morale of the officers generally in the Army was, in my opinion, disastrous.  It resulted in splitting the general body of officers into two sections, those who were the possessors of medals and those who were not.  In fact, the result of it was, to a certain extent, that the medal which should be a symbol of respect, and generally speaking is regarded as that, and has entitled its owner to the respect of other people, now almost came into disrepute in the Army.  It had been made the condition on the basis of which a serious injustice was inflicted on other officers.</P>
      <P>The position that obtained prior to July, 1949, with regard to service in the Army was that there was a scale of retiring ages laid down for each rank of Army officers, a certain age for lieutenants, captains, commandants and so on.  In July, 1949, the Minister for Defence introduced a new regulation as a result of which this certain category of officer whom Deputy Cosgrave has described as a foundation officer of the Army had his service extended by one year.  When that was done every other officer in the Army had his conditions of service disimproved and was from then on labouring under a sense of injustice.  At least on that occasion his prospects of promotion were blocked by only one year but subsequently, in October, 1954, this new regulation providing for a further extension of two years for these officers was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> The effect of that new regulation on the morale of the Army was little short of disastrous.  Officers who had come into the Army under the old terms when the same retiring age applied to all officers found that their conditions of service had changed overnight.  Some of these people had been able to work out what their prospects of promotion were and at what age they would probably retire and at what rank. Some of them found that instead of retiring as, say, lieutenant-colonel it now appeared quite possible that they might never rise beyond their present rank of captain.</P>
    <P>To give an example of what the effect of these extensions on other officers was, I shall take the case of an officer&mdash;one of those foundation officers that Deputy Cosgrave has mentioned&mdash;who had reached the rank of colonel and who had reached the retiring age.  He now got an extension of three years.  As a result of that, a vacancy that should in the normal course have arisen in the rank of colonel did not arise and was put back for three years.  Consequently a lieutenant-colonel who was due for promotion to the rank of colonel found that his promotion was blocked for three years.  Because he did not get his promotion a commandant found himself in the same position; similarly a captain was held back.  Therefore, for the one man who got a small financial advantage there were at least three who suffered a serious financial disability. I have no doubt that the effect in some cases would be that a man who might have retired as a lieutenant-colonel had retired so much earlier and retired on a smaller pension.</P>
    <P>The giving of this further extension was, according to the regulation, to be dependent on the fulfilling of certain conditions, but in actual fact it became automatic and was applied to everybody.  The other officers in the Army could see that their prospects were very seriously affected and it had a very bad effect on their morale.  That was the sole reason why I decided it was my duty to remedy this injustice and do what I could to restore the morale of the Army generally.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have done anybody an injustice.  After all, it was a condition <Col N="674" /> of that two-years' extension that I should certify that, in my opinion, it was in the best interest of the Army that the officer concerned should be given that extension.  I was not in a position to certify that because I know to the contrary, that the granting of this extension has had a very adverse effect.  When I say that, I do not mean to cast any reflection whatever on the officers concerned.  I fully agree with Deputy Cosgrave that they have given loyal and faithful service to every Government.  As I have said, I would have no objection to Deputy Cosgrave, when he was acting-Minister for Defence, granting them some extra reward in this respect provided he did it out of the Exchequer and not out of the pockets of other Army officers.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Cosgrave made a very good case.  I was hoping that he would explain to me how he decided that the claims of those officers outweighed the grievance that would be felt by other officers, as a result of the granting of this extension to 10 per cent. and thereby inflicting an injustice on 90 per cent. of the officers in the Army.  I know that at the time this measure was brought in it was stated that Deputy Cosgrave, the then acting-Minister for Defence, believed that the claims of those officers out-weighted the grievance of the other officers but I was hoping he would explain to-day how he felt that that was so.  He has not given any such indication.</P>
    <P>These officers have not been badly treated by any Government and I certainly do not think I am doing them any injustice by removing this new regulation.  Up to the time that the Fianna Fáil Government came into office there was no provision at all in the Army for retired pay for officers or men and one of the first things the Fianna Fáil Government did in 1932 was to bring in an enabling Act which enabled the Government to introduce retired pay schemes.</P>
    <P>In 1937, again under a Fianna Fáil Government the first retired pay scheme for the Army was brought in and again in 1953 under a Fianna Fáil Government provision was made whereby officers actually serving in the <Col N="675" /> Army could draw the military service pensions which were awarded to them on the basis of their old I.R.A. service. The position, therefore is that since 1953 these officers, in addition to drawing their pay as Army officers, are also drawing the appropriate military service pension, and I understand that practically all these officers come within that category.</P>
    <P>Another point is that these military service pensions are in the case of Army officers, based not on the rank that they had while they were in the I.R.A. but on the rank that they held in the Army in 1953. Therefore, a man whose pension was fixed in, say, 1924, which might have been based only on his rank as lieutenant, could now draw a military service pension based on the rank of colonel which he had acquired since that time by virtue of his service in the Army.</P>
    <P>I do not think that an Army officer retiring at the moment is badly treated.  A colonel retired from the Army now may qualify for a gratuity of £1,176 and, if on his maximum, gets maximum retiring pay amounting to £784 per annum.  A lieutenant-colonel can qualify for a gratuity of £1,003 and get a maximum retired pay of £649 per annum.  A commandant may qualify for a gratuity of £787 and a maximum retired pay of £507 per annum.  So I do not think these officers are so badly treated.  They are certainly in a much better position financially than a number of other people who had equal service with the Old I.R.A.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> Deputy Cosgrave mentioned that in peacetime there was a slow rate of promotion in all armies.  However, I do not think other armies did what was done here in granting extensions in service to certain classes of army officers.  I have been assured that that regulation was not asked for by anybody in the Army.  In fact, as far as my information goes, it was accepted in a rather shamefaced manner by the people concerned.  I believe they felt quite self-conscious about accepting it because they were in a position to know of the injustices being done to the vast body of Army officers.</P>
    <P>I feel that my action in withdrawing that regulation will have a very good effect on the morale of the Army in general.  Deputy Cosgrave said that an increment of pay was given to Army captains to compensate them.  Surely he cannot be serious in suggesting that one increment of pay could compensate a man for having his promotion blocked for three years and for having to retire at an earlier age on a smaller pension than that at which he would otherwise have retired.</P>
