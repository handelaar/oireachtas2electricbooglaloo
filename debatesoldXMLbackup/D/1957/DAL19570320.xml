      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I have to oppose this nomination.  In formally opposing the election as Taoiseach of Deputy de Valera, the Fine Gael Party does so in no spirit of animosity towards him but in the firm conviction that in present circumstances the Party to which he belongs is not equipped to <Col N="18" /> provide the kind of Government which the county needs to help it over its difficulties.  That Party has so far shown no policy which would justify a Government being selected from it. For those reasons and also for the reason that in opposing the motion we are discharging our duty towards the people who elected us, I formally oppose the motion and record our objection to the nomination.</P>

      <P>The nomination of Deputy de Valera for the position of Taoiseach indicates that the Party opposite are anxious to take office, and, while I do not quarrel with their ambitions, I should like to say that a Party taking office ought to have a policy.  I am going to give the Fianna Fáil Party the credit of saying that they think they have a policy.  If they have, I do not want them to recite the whole story here to-day.  I want to put one question to the potential Taoiseach: to ask him to tell the House and the country, before we vote on this motion, what is the Fianna Fáil policy in respect of the food subsidies?</P>
      <P>During the election, the Fianna Fáil Party maintained a majestic silence as to their attitude towards the food subsidies. I said during the election, and I repeat it now because I believe it to be true, that Fianna Fáil intends to abolish the food subsidies.  If anybody is in doubt about that, he should go back to Deputy MacEntee's speech in 1952.  If anybody, after reading that speech, should still have any doubts about the Fianna Fáil policy in respect of the food subsidies, he can have his doubts removed by a moment's reflection on the vicious Budget of 1952.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the 1952 Budget under which the food subsidies were viciously slashed, but there is still in existence subsidisation of essential foodstuffs to the extent of £8,500,000.  If these are abolished, the price of butter will go up; the price of flour will go up; the price of bread will go up; you will have more demands for wage increases; you will have a price-wages spiral which must not be allowed to arise if we are to promote peace and harmony and tranquillity so that the nation may set about tackling in a vigorous way the problems which have so far defied a solution.</P>

We ought to have an answer to that simple question before the House is asked to vote on this motion.</P>

      <P>I hold that, on an occasion like this, when a new Dáil reassembles, we should get some indication of policy from the person proposed as Taoiseach. During the two periods of their office, the inter-Party Government promoted many useful works and brought them to a very high degree of success.  I could mention a few of those dearest to me which were connected with rural Ireland.  The first is afforestation. Secondly, there is arterial drainage and the land reclamation scheme under which work of a useful nature was done on the land with resultant employment. I do not think it is good enough that the House should be asked to vote before the person nominated as Taoiseach gives an indication of what the policy is towards these matters. For that reason, I oppose the motion <Col N="20" /> nominating Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach.  We have no indication that the useful works which have been commenced and which have met with universal approval will not be curtailed or abolished.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton made a lot of promises on a previous occasion about the pulling down of prices.  He was proved wrong.  He is now making prophecies about rising prices.  I hope we will be able to prove him wrong. I do not know and I cannot know what we can do until we have seen what is the position of the Exchequer. We have got to see how the financial position of the country stands before we make promises.  When we came into office before, it was not our intention to interfere with the food subsidies, but when we found that £15,000,000 had to be made up in the deficit of the first Budget we had to face&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem to have heard all this before.  Meanwhile, there are 94,000 unemployed people in the country.  I, as an Independent Deputy, would like to say a few words on the motion.  It is clear now that the Fianna Fáil Party has been given a clear mandate by the people to rule.  I am afraid it is also clear that their election programme consisted almost exclusively of a plea to trust that their leadership would deal effectively with the grave economic situation in the country as it is at the moment, as well as to deal with the two great evils of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The electorate, in their wisdom, have decided to place their trust in that leadership.  In consequence of that, it is clear that a very heavy responsibility now rests on that leadership.  I would like to suggest that the old methods of dealing with unemployment and emigration have failed miserably.  It should be clear that the restrictive policy on <Col N="21" /> finance carried out over the last five or six years has not only not helped the problem of unemployment but has made it very much worse.  It is about time that both sides of the House should realise this and accept it.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is said that one of the causes of our failure has been that younger men have not been given posts in the Cabinet.  I do not share that view.  The outgoing Coalition Government did this to a very considerable extent, with what results you can see.  Those results are largely due to the fact that the young men came in and took over all their older colleagues' thinking and theories and gave us the old clichés and the old excuses for the failure of these policies to solve our problems.  The outcome has been higher unemployment, static production and the younger generation having to flee the country in their thousands because our country refused to give them, the poorer of them anyhow, a reasonable standard of comfort and a reasonable level of social security in their own country.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the replacement of the older, conservative politicians by younger, equally if not more conservative politicians in Ministerial posts, should not be used as a device to delude the people into believing that the very badly needed changes could be then or must be then brought about.  I have good reason to know that in the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party there are many people who have courage and ability and who have the intelligence and the integrity to do some fresh, original thinking on the social and economic problems which face us.  It is my hope that these men, young or old, or young and old, insist on their right to express their own views both inside and outside this House and in that way try to influence the character and the destiny of the Party which in the natural train of events must ultimately devolve on them.</P>
    <P>It is probably true also that there is in the other Parties forward thinking by an intelligent, progressive element. I cannot say that from experience as I can in respect of Fianna Fáil, but I hope it is true and that they will try to influence the Parties in an endeavour <Col N="22" /> to bring about the obviously clearly-demanded, radical and fundamental changes of thinking and policy in the public life of our country in the next few years.  It seems to me that if the old thinking continues to prevail there is no hope for Ireland.  In a short time almost every person, outside the privileged classes, who can earn a living abroad will have fled from our shores.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I should like to refer.  I am sure that the serious significance of one very important and very illuminating factor in the results of the election is not lost on the shrewd politicians of the older generation in this House, that is the very sizable vote which was cast for candidates in the recent election who had, as the most important plank in their platform, a pledge that they would not take their seats in this House if they were elected.  That is a trend which should be very carefully considered.  I think it would be quite wrong to regard it as a transient whim of the people who returned these candidates in the election.  It is indeed a factor which should cause each one of us carefully to examine our consciences.</P>
    <P>Some people say that if the election had been fought on the new register the number of people who would have cast their votes for abstentionist candidates would probably have been very much higher.  The Government to be has now an unrivalled opportunity.  It has the largest majority that any Government has had since the establishment of the State.  There are no external forces operating against its putting its economic policies into operation.  There is no war.  There is no economic war.  There is no shooting war.  Intentions must now be translated into practical policy and an account must be rendered to the people who have placed their trust in those intentions.  We all know that Ireland cannot afford even one more mistake.  I believe from the trends of the election that it is not just the Fianna Fáil Party alone which is on trial for the next five years; it is democracy itself.  Away back in the 1930's, an Irish politician&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am just concluding now because this is relevant to the issue.  That politician said that if he could not solve unemployment within the existing system, he would go outside that system in order to solve it.  There was no ambiguity in that statement.  It connoted a readiness to apply courageous, even daring, policies to rid our people of the despair which had gripped them and which sent so many of them abroad to seek a fuller and more abundant life. It was a statement which gave great heart to the generation which heard it.  Now that man, that politician, Eamon de Valera, has at his disposal all the power which he needs to carry out his policy without any interference or any hindrance.  The results will be eagerly awaited particularly in the very many houses in which unemployment and poverty have cast their shadows.  I was elected as an Independent Deputy and I intend to vote independently, to support legislation when I believe it to be progressive and to oppose it when I believe to the contrary.  I do not intend to vote on this motion because I feel that my vote could be misunderstood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>As a new Deputy, I would like to say a few words.  First of all, I do not propose to vote in this division.  I feel the electorate have given the Fianna Fáil Party an adequate majority to carry out the changes which this country must have if it is to overcome its present economic and social difficulties.  I would like to say that if the Fianna Fáil Party, under the leadership of Deputy de Valera, can provide the dynamic leadership and a clear-cut policy, the courage and foresight to solve our problems, I will certainly support them.  If I am satisfied they are not providing the necessary progressive policy, I will oppose them.  I feel that any other policy on my part would be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when Deputy de Valera forms his Cabinet, he will put into the different Ministries young men with courageous, progressive ideas.  Whether the Fianna Fáil Party blames the Fine Gael Party or <i>vice versa</i>, we cannot escape the fact that the two Parties between them had the handling of <Col N="24" /> affairs for the greater part of 35 years. I feel the time has come for a change and any change that will promote the necessary improvement in our social and economic life will have my support. Four Deputies are not taking their places in the House and I feel that one of the reasons for that is that this country is passing through a period of frustration and apathy.  Anything the new Government can do to clear that away will have my support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief.  I have no intention of opposing the election of Deputy de Valera to the office of Taoiseach.  I really cannot understand the attitude of the Fine Gael Party to-day.  For the last month, they have preached the policy of a national Government and of co-operation. They had a glorious opportunity to-day, when they had no candidate themselves to put forward, of having the decency to keep quiet.  So far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, I contested the General Election against them.  I felt it would be a retrograde step if a group of men who have reached, or are over, the 70 mark, with all respect to them, were elected and that it would be putting the clock back if they were saddled with the task of Government for the next five years.  I feel that in that age group we will not get that dynamic drive so essential to tackling the major difficulties which must be solved.</P>
      <P>I am looking forward to hearing the Cabinet which Mr. de Valera proposes to nominate.  Like the other Independent Deputies who have spoken, I hope the material he chooses will be intelligent, with initiative and vigour to pursue ruthlessly the policy which is so essential if we are to survive and preserve our independence as a nation.  Any progressive legislation introduced will have my full support. I cannot agree at all with the statement made by the Leader of Fine Gael that they will formally oppose the nomination of Deputy de Valera.  I see no sense or reason to that.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to support the nomination of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach, despite the fact that Deputy de Valera has publicly stated that his first task will be to <Col N="25" /> solve unemployment.  I have heard these promises before and my presence here is a symbol of broken promises and should be taken as a warning that emigration and unemployment will no longer be suffered in silence.  This election proves that the people have given Fianna Fáil the task of solving unemployment.  I realise that that problem will not be solved in a few weeks and that any Government should <Col N="26" /> be given an opportunity of putting its programme into effect.  I will support fully any scheme which will reduce unemployment and emigration.  I hope my simple statement will be met with understanding, both inside and outside the House.</P>

    <P>Caoimhghin Ó Beoláin (Kevin Boland).</P>
    <P>It is not necessary but I think it is right that I should give some explanation. Deputy Seán Lemass will take his old post, in the first place as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I will nominate him also as Tánaiste.  Deputy Seán MacEntee will take Health; Deputy Dr. Ryan, Finance; Deputy Frank Aiken, External Affairs; Deputy O. Traynor, Justice; Deputy P. Smith will have his old post &mdash;Local Government&mdash;and Social Welfare; Deputy E. Childers, Lands; Deputy Jack Lynch will take Education and the Gaeltacht for the present, and only for the present. Deputy Neil Blaney will take Posts and Telegraphs and Deputy Kevin Boland, Defence.</P>
    <P>There is one missing.  Seán Moylan was not elected, but I think it would be a great loss to the Government and to the affairs of the country if he were not a member of the Government.  I intend to use the power given to the Taoiseach for nomination to the Seanad to bring him back as a member of this Government and to assign to him the very important post of Minister for Agriculture.  Meantime, Deputy Frank Aiken will hold that portfolio.</P>
    <P>We have also to consider the question of the Ministry of the Gaeltacht. <Col N="30" /> As those on the opposite side know well, and as I pointed out when I was on the opposite side myself, it is a very difficult post to fill.  It has both economic and cultural aspects and I propose to examine this question as best I can in the next week or so.  I shall then come to the Dáil with a nomination for that post.</P>
    <P>The post of Social Welfare will be filled by the Minister for Local Government with a Parliamentary Secretary.  I think that is about the only information which it is necessary to give the Dáil as regards the Government, and I put it to the Dáil that the nomination be approved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be proper for me to make any comment upon the personnel of the Government chosen by the Taoiseach. We realise that the Government which has to face the conditions prevailing at the moment will have before it a very serious and difficult task.  The responsibility for carrying out those tasks rests primarily upon the Taoiseach and it is his responsibility to choose those members who, he thinks, will most effectively support him in the carrying out of those very difficult and trying tasks.  It is his responsibility and if he fails it will be his loss.</P>
      <P>I have said we realise that the Government faces very serious economic, financial and political difficulties. We realise also that on us in Opposition here&mdash;and I speak on behalf of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;there rests a very high duty and serious responsibility. I have stated again and again in the course of election speeches that when we are fighting the democratic battle of elections to Dáil Éireann we are not playing a political game; we are engaged in a very high and responsible purpose.  I hope that the Fine Gael Party in this Dáil will discharge that high and grave responsibility with due regard for the national interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would certainly be our aim, so far as we can, to be a constructive Opposition, and not to indulge merely in recriminations or bickerings.  We have every reason to know the kind of tasks and problems that face the present Government.  We went through a period of stress and strain during the <Col N="31" /> last 12 months.  We believe that we have made a helpful contribution to the solution of those difficulties which began over 12 months ago.  We believe that when we announced our policy for production on October 5th last we had given a headline, that we had set ourselves tasks which would result in making at least some considerable inroads on the problems of unemployment and emigration and the other social problems that afflict the country.</P>
    <P>We hope that those policies in which we have faith and which we had hoped to carry to fruition will be adopted by the present Government, and in the adoption and carrying out of those policies, if they see fit to adopt them, they will get every support from this side of the House and certainly from the Fine Gael Party.  We were anxious to know the personnel of the Government, and, when listening to the Taoiseach state the names of the members of the Government and the Departments to which they were assigned, we sought eagerly for some clue as to what I might call the most jealously guarded political secret of modern times here in Ireland&mdash;the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government. Looking at the list of names, I am afraid I have not been able to get any clue as to what that policy is.  We must only hope for the best.  The personnel or even the assignment of Departments amongst the personnel of the Government does not disclose any indication of whether we are to have a policy of restriction or a policy of expansion.  However, I think we can claim to have left behind us a basis on which a policy of expansion can be put into operation for the benefit of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to make this an opportunity for any extenuation or explanation of the work done by my colleagues and myself in the last Government. We leave that, with full confidence, to history.  However, I assert that we tackled a job of great difficulty and complexity which required courage of the highest order.</P>
    <P>We took our decisions in disregard of our own political fortunes.  I think we can claim to have left behind us a <Col N="32" /> solid contribution to some of the difficulties that have confronted and that still confront the country.  Undoubtedly, there are still problems of unemployment, problems of emigration, social problems and political problems as well as budgetary problems of great difficulty.  I think I can promise the present Government, on behalf of my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party, that we will do our part to help them to solve these difficult problems and to give them constructive opposition to the best of our ability.  We know the difficulties that will face this Government. We hope we will be able to override our human frailties and our political frailties, if you like, and forget that we did not get the co-operation to which we were entitled from the Opposition in the last Dáil and which we will give to this Government in this Dáil.  I have just indicated that there are grave difficulties of unemployment and emigration, as well as budgetary difficulties and financial difficulties of one kind or another. However, there are even more serious difficulties than these, serious and all as they are.  In this Dáil, we are facing a somewhat unprecedented position.  A number of people have been elected to sit in Dáil Éireann but refuse to take their places in this institution and not merely refuse to take their places here but deny the validity of the institutions of this State which have been set up over the last number of years.  That is a very serious situation in which all Parties in this House, whether they sit on the Government benches or on the Opposition benches, and all individuals, whether they are on the Independent benches or not, must cooperate together to end for all time. There is a serious danger to this State and to the institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>I believe, and I have said it on numerous occasions, there are people and organs of public opinion that have been directly responsible, through their speeches and writings, for bringing about a situation in which the institutions of this State have been brought into something like disrepute. Speeches have also, I regret to say, been made from a motive of gaining passing political party advantage which have resulted in the reputation <Col N="33" /> of this country being decried and belittled abroad so that our international credit at the present moment stands in great jeopardy.  There are writings in periodicals published abroad suggesting that this country is in a bad way and almost on the verge of insolvency.  It is our duty, from every part of this House, to restore confidence in our country and to make all sections of the community believe in the future of the country in which we all ought to have faith and in which we, on this side of the House, have faith.</P>
    <P>In the darkest times of last year, we insisted, and I insisted in every speech I made, that, whatever the difficulties, they were difficulties that were capable of being got over; that we had faith in the country and the people and that we believed in the institutions of this State which had been set up with such great difficulty and with so much human sacrifice.  It is our duty to see that this Dáil, Parliament and all the institutions of the State are properly respected by every organ of opinion in this country and that we do our part to bring to an end the kinds of things, speeches and writings, that have belittled the institutions of this State, Dáil Éireann, the members of Dáil Éireann and politicians who give themselves up to the service of the State.  That is one of the greatest problems we have to meet, tackle and solve.  It is as great as the problems of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>If we do not inculcate, particularly in the young people growing up, respect for the institutions of the State as now established, respect for our traditions and hopes, then the country is facing a far more dangerous situation than we are facing because of unemployment, emigration, or any of the social problems that affect us. Certainly, in the Fine Gael Party, for whom I speak and for whom only I am entitled to speak, we will do our part now because we know the country requires <Col N="34" /> that this Government should succeed in this task.  We will give it every possible assistance to see that it does succeed.  That does not say that we are going to lie low here in these Opposition benches.  We will, I hope, give a constructive opposition, but at the same time I believe we will give a vigorous and a vigilant opposition.</P>
    <P>The present Government appears to have all the ingredients necessary or requisite for a stable Government.  We are all agreed that the country needs stability in Government, but it needs more than that.  It needs a good and a just Government.  It will be our duty and our high task and responsibility in Opposition to help the Government to be a good Government and to be vigilant to secure that in every respect it is a just Government, seeing to the rights of all sections of the people and not merely of those sections of the people who happen to support Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I hope I have said sufficient to indicate the manner in which we undertake our task as a responsible Opposition in these very serious times.  The whole country looks now for good Government.  The country sees and knows that not merely is the country on trial, but, equally, that our institutions are on trial.  I do not think that we on this side of the House will fail in the trust that has been imposed on us.</P>

      <P>I have nothing more to say.  I appreciate the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition.  As I said in Irish earlier, we all here have responsibilities, on whichever side of the House we sit.  We will be doing our duty to the country if we discharge these responsibilities fully and properly.</P>

      <P>I propose to ask the Dáil to meet on Tuesday next to dispose of some business which must be finished within the present financial year, that is, before 31st March.  I understand there are a number of Supplementary Estimates which are required. Then there is the Vote on Account and the Supplies and Services Bill.</P>

      <P>And the Central Fund Bill, which follows on the Vote on Account.  It is proposed to ask the Dáil to deal with that business on next Tuesday.  I gather the House has agreed that we shall try to finish that business on Tuesday, in which case it is proposed to ask the Dáil to adjourn until 24th April.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 6.40 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 26th March, 1957.</P>
