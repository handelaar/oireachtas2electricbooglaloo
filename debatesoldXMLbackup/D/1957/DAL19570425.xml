      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in relation to the proposals for a European Free Trade Area the Government proposes: (1) that Ireland should join, and if so, on what terms; (2) to issue a White Paper embodying the views of representative organisations and departmental observations; and (3) to seek the authority of the Oireachtas before taking final steps and, if so, at what stage in the negotiations.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the Deputy's Question, the time for a definite answer in the form of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; has not yet arrived; the position has not changed since the previous Government decided that no commitment in regard to the Free Trade Area should be entered into until every possibility had been explored of securing adequate safeguards for this country.  In accordance with his instructions, the Irish representative at the meeting of the Council of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation on the 12th February, 1957, made it clear that Ireland's decision on the question of joining or not joining the area would, of course, depend on our assessment of how our national interests would be affected.  While referring to Ireland's favourable attitude to movements by European countries towards closer economic association, he urged that <Col N="280" /> the aim should be to establish conditions which would enable every member country of the organisation to enter the area without fear of serious damage to its economic fabric.</P>
      <P>The Council of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation has set up three working parties in connection with the proposed establishment of the area, and Ireland is participating in the activities of these working parties.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Question, it is proposed to issue, in the near future, a memorandum for the information and guidance of interested organisations and individuals, which will bring up to date the information on the Free Trade Area proposal contained in the memorandum which was published in January last.  With regard to departmental observations, these are made to the Ministers concerned, whose views will be taken into account before the Government take any decision on this matter.  It would be inappropriate to publish departmental observations.  The extent to which it is necessary or appropriate to publish observations received from represenative organisations will be considered in due course; most of the representative organisations concerned have not yet formally submitted their views.</P>
      <P>As regards the third part of the Question, it is intended that, in due course, the decision taken by the Government in relation to the proposed European Free Trade Area will be brought before Dáil Éireann.  At this stage, one cannot clearly foresee how the matter may develop, and all that can be said definitely, at the moment, is that, before any final commitment of the State, concerning the area, is entered into, consultation with Dáil Éireann will take place.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (a) using the year 1948 and (b) using the year 1953 as base 100, the index of the terms of trade for each quarter since 1948, and for January and February, 1957, if figures for the first quarter of 1957 are not available.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing to the bases specified in the Deputy's question quarterly index numbers of the terms of trade (defined as the ratio of the domestic export price index to the import price index) in the years 1948-56.  No similar figures are yet available for any period in 1957.  These figures will be furnished to the Deputy as soon as they are available.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>TERMS of Trade in each quarter of the years 1948 to 1956 (<i>a</i>) to base 1948 as 100 and (<i>b</i>) to base 1953 as 100</P>

    <P>There has also been introduced into the levies a licensing provision in the following terms, operative from 3rd April, 1957:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so thinks proper, the Revenue Commissioners may by licence authorise any particular person, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, to import without payment of Special Import Levy or Special Import (No. 2) Levy any articles chargeable with such levy which are intended for use in a process of manufacture or for the equipment of an industrial undertaking and which are articles such as are not obtainable otherwise than by importation or in the case of any such articles already imported, to take delivery thereof without payment of such levy, either, as the Revenue Commissioners shall think proper, without limit as to time or quantity or either of them, or within a specified time or in a specified quantity.</P>
    <P>It is of course not possible to estimate how the yield of the levies might have been affected if this licensing provision had been in existence during the year 1956-57.</P>

I considered the suggestion when the Finance (Excise Duties) Vehicles Act, 1952, was being prepared and I decided that its disadvantages would offset any merits which it might contain.  I am still of that opinion and accordingly I do not propose to recommend the Government to sponsor amending legislation as suggested.</P>

The Deputy is aware that the overheads in connection with the making of certain types of arrangements and division would be very heavy.  The Deputy will also be aware that rearrangement of a small number of holdings confers great benefit on the area, but he should also be aware that, however small the holding, the proportion of expenses attributable to the administrative cost, the difficulties of making the rearrangement, the difficulties in relation to title and in relation to the rights of legatees must add proportionately to the expenses, and that the expenses in many cases must be higher than they would be in the case of an enlargement of a large estate of 300 acres where there were no such complications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress last night, I was dealing with the question of private planting. I feel that if it were properly developed, private planting could give us very large areas of forestry.  It is a shame that last year&mdash;taking last year as an example&mdash;only 625 acres were planted by private effort.  I do not agree with the ex-Minister when he says that the smallness of the grants is causing that situation.  I think it is lack of knowledge, the knowledge of the type of trees to plant, of the time of year to do the planting and of the proper care to give to trees.</P>
      <P>For that reason, it would be advisable that the knowledge which is necessary for private individuals before they undertake planting should be made available from various sources.  It should be made available by having the Department of Lands issue booklets to national schools, to the technical schools and to the secondary schools, so that the people would have a proper understanding of planting methods and the care of trees.  It might also be possible to make available from the Forestry Division and from the vocational committees officers who would give lectures to parish councils and farmers' organisations in the various localities.  The knowledge thus imparted could be used by farmers and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are in this country various tracts of waste land on individual farms.  In many cases, small pieces of waste ground are in the hands of county councils or urban councils.  All these should be brought in and put <Col N="316" /> under trees.  In most cases, this land is going to waste and producing nothing for the nation and every encouragement should be given to private individuals to put this type of land under trees.  The financial stimulus would be a secondary consideration.  Admittedly, the grants in existence now have not been revised for some time.  The grants are available only when not less than one acre is planted.  It is too much to expect a small farmer to plant an acre.  There is too much work in an acre and he may not have an acre of waste land available.  I would also suggest that the grants be increased slightly and that they be available to persons who plant less than an acre.</P>
    <P>This question of private planting is important.  I do not think we should leave everything to the State.  When our forests were being demolished and the country stripped of trees by the British, there was a general outcry by the Irish people, and rightly so.  The same applied when efforts were being made to destroy our language&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think that when we got control of our own affairs, there would be an all-out effort to replace those plantations but that has not been the case.  However, I must say that the facilities for private planting are available.  Every county council has a scheme whereby trees are available to land owners at a very nominal charge.  In the case of a farmer with under £5 valuation, trees are available at about 4/&ndash; a hundred.  The price is <Col N="317" /> slightly increased when the valuation exceeds £5.  It is not a question of lack of finance or of the machinery not being available.  It is a question of lack of knowledge.  That knowledge should be made available.</P>
      <P>In other countries, a good deal of the planting done is carried out by private land owners.  We should encourage and foster that angle.  It could be very useful and could help the efforts of the State.  A great part of the difficulty, so far as the State is concerned, is that the State must get fairly large tracts of land.  It is not economic for the full State machinery to operate on small pieces of land, whereas it could be profitable for private individuals to have on their farms some investment of that nature.</P>
      <P>A lot has been said about the difficulty the Forestry Division experience in obtaining land.  I do not think that is so.  My experience is that a good deal of land has been offered to the Forestry Division and in many counties they are not able to take all the offers available.  I have experience of my own constituency where a lot of land is on offer.  There is delay in getting round to consideration of those offers. I know it is not easy.  There are difficulties in regard to getting agreement, the question of price, the question of title, and so on; but I think that should not be used as an excuse for not increasing the over-all planting rate and the intake of land.  A time may come when for various reasons this land may not be available at present prices.</P>
      <P>Somebody mentioned yesterday that there was a danger of over-planting. I do not think there is.  I saw it mentioned somewhere that about 600,000 acres of forest would meet our demand for timber.  At the present rate of planting, it will be a number of years yet before that maximum is reached.  If we over-plant in regard to our own needs, then the surplus could be easily and profitably exported and could be used for many other purposes besides its use as timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Forestry Division are laying too much stress on the planting of soft woods.  Admittedly, commercial <Col N="318" /> timber of that type is necessary for building, but more attention should be devoted to hard woods used for furniture making, and especially to ash for the supply of hurleys and so on.  The rate of demolition of our hard woods is greater than the planting rate.  That is a mistake which should be remedied and we should see to it that our stock of hard woods is kept up.  Since the war, the manufacture of furniture and household equipment made of timber has increased in this country.  At the moment, I think we are self-sufficient in that regard and the furniture industry caters for the home needs.  It would be a pity if the raw material for that industry should be allowed to disappear.  Only by keeping up our supply of hard wood can we make sure that material for the furniture industry will be available.</P>
    <P>There is great scope for further development of forestry in the West of Ireland.  It is something that will help the West.  It will improve the employment position there and more of this type of work should be done in the Gaeltacht areas, where unfortunately there is heavy emigration to other countries and to towns and cities within this country.  The employment which forestry would give in the Gaeltacht areas would be valuable.  The planting of trees would be an asset to those areas, not alone from the point of view of giving employment, but from the point of view of producing something from the land available there.  That industry should be started in the Gaeltacht to keep the people at home, and we should make the best use of the things that are available in those western areas.</P>
    <P>The type of land that is available there is in many cases useful for nothing but trees, but it can be used profitably for that purpose.  It may be said, in some cases, the mountains are too high and that trees will not grow on the high slopes of those mountains, but I would suggest that what is being done, say, in the Six Counties, in the areas where there are high mountains, might also be done in our own case, that is, that a belt be planted along the foothills at first and as this grows, it will provide shelter for a belt higher <Col N="319" /> up and in that way we can use the hillsides for the planting of trees.</P>
    <P>Forest research was mentioned by the Minister.  It is important because from past experience we find that some varieties planted in certain types of soil will not do well and it is essential from the points of view of economy and prevention of waste that we should be as sure as possible that wherever trees are planted, they are suitable for the particular area and soil.</P>
    <P>I should like to say this in regard to research: a good part of the money could go to research into the uses which can be made of the waste coming from the forests which are now beginning to produce waste in fairly large quantities.  It would be a pity, seeing that we have got well on our feet on the way to progress in regard to afforestation, if we should allow any of the forest products to be lost and I think we should spend some money in finding ways of using the thinnings that are becoming available in those forests.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the making of roads and he gave figures for the purchase of machinery.  The type of machinery necessary for the roadmaking is expensive because bulldozers and equipment of that kind cost a lot of money.  I would suggest, instead of investing large sums of money in that kind of machinery, there should be some co-operation with county councils who have already purchased such machinery and it might be possible to get the use of bulldozers, for instance, by hiring them from county councils so that we would not be compelled to invest a lot of money in that kind of new machinery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would have been a nice thing if the new Minister had introduced the Estimate this year by paying a tribute to his predecessor on a very remarkable occasion, because in this year, on 31st March we achieved the astonishing prodigy of being able to claim that there has been as much forest land planted in this country since 1948 as had been planted since the foundation of the State.  On 31st March this year, we could claim that <Col N="320" /> the area of forest planted had been doubled since Deputy Blowick first became Minister for Lands.  I think that is a very remarkable achievement and I think it would have been a graceful thing if the present Minister had signalised the occasion by commenting upon it.</P>
      <P>Speaking in round figures, I think it is true to say that, in 1948, we had about 100,000 acres of planted forests; we have to-day over 200,000 acres planted.  I should like to ask the Minister&mdash;and, mark you, I am not prepared to challenge the Minister to-day for a vast volume of detailed information, because manifestly he is entitled to a reasonable period in which to familiarise himself with the detailed administration of the Department&mdash;to answer two questions.  The Estimate that the Minister introduced is founded on a policy fixed by his predecessor, envisaging a certain rate of expansion to which he has himself referred, that is, the planting of 17,500 acres for this year, rising to 20,000 acres.  I seemed to detect in the Minister's introductory remarks some indication that he was preparing the public for an announcement that he proposed to cut down on that rate of progress.  I think it is not unreasonable to ask him to state categorically on this occasion whether he intends to honour his predecessor's decision to expand the rate of planting from 15,000 acres this year to 17,500 next year and 20,000 acres thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I had not.  I was astonished at the rate of progress made by my colleague.  The policy upon which those figures are founded was a policy settled by the Government of which I was a member.  I think I may be excused if I express amazement at the rapidity with which the objects were achieved.  There are in the process of acquisition at the present moment close on 200,000 acres of land at one stage or another.  The previous Government passed an Act of Parliament which enables the Department of Forestry very materially to shorten the procedure involved in the acquisition of that land, by permitting the Department of Forestry to place in deposit the purchase price, once it has been agreed, leaving complicated matters of title and so forth to be settled at leisure while the Department is free to appropriate the land and proceed with its work and the money paid for it can be disbursed to those who subsequently prove their title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is legitimate in our existing affairs constructively to regard that 200,000 acres as having been acquired and to proceed on the five year cycle, that you have that land and are entitled to plant up to that limit.  I think the Department, in existing circumstances, if they will adopt that procedure, are entitled to regard the reserve of land they have at present as being sufficient to sustain the 20,000 acre programme.  They will continue to acquire land which they can add to the reserve which is already in hands, so that I do not believe that lack of land will provide any alibi for an attempt to depart from the programme initiated by the present Minister's predecessor, and I think the Minister ought to reassure <Col N="322" /> us that he has no intention of being a party to any scheme for the reduction of that programme.</P>
    <P>I should remind Deputies on all sides of the House that there has been a good deal of clatter since the present Government was elected about the zeal with which they are concerned to put men to work.  I hope they will put as many men to work on forestry operations in the next year or two of their survival as a Government as our Government put into employment during the past three and a half years. I think it right in an avuncular and neighbourly way to warn them that the split which will ultimately afflict their Party will be expedited, if they start trying to cut down on forestry now.</P>

      <P>I am just warning them. I think it is only fair to warn one's opponents of the dangers which beset them and one of the dangers which beset the Party opposite is an attempt to cut down the forestry programme. But there is a second problem, and here again I think the Minister would be entitled to say to me that he has not had the opportunity of investigating this matter closely, but I would direct his special attention to this matter.  The forestry programme has now reached a stage where the yield of thinnings is rapidly increasing and the yield of lumber is coming near to hand.  The kind of codology that Deputy Cunningham is talking about, the wicked conspiracy by the evil, base, bloody and brutal British Saxon to rob us of our timber resulted, in fact, from some enterprising citizens of the Irish nation going out and buying trees cheap and selling them dear to the British or anybody else who would buy them.  That is the plain fact.  But what in the name of common sense are we growing trees for if, when they reach maturity, we do not want to sell them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not I who said it. I am asking Deputy Cunningham to bring his mighty intellect to bear on this simple question: if we have four times more timber in this country than we have use for, are we making ready to tell potential customers for that timber now that they are base, bloody and brutal British Saxons if they buy it?  All I want is the removal of codology from this discussion.  As I understand it, our purpose is to build up from the land a great additional export, over and above our domestic requirements of lumber and pulp.  Is that not our object?  The greater the surplus we have over and above our own domestic requirements, the better it is for the country and the forestry programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger is that the codology of the kind Deputy Cunningham is talking gives rise to the emergence of a certain <Col N="324" /> type of &ldquo;chancer&rdquo; in this country who says: &ldquo;Very well, then; Deputy Cunningham is bursting to see that none of our timber is bought by the Saxon. Very well, how will we do that?  We will put a prohibition upon the export of timber; our Irish timber is to be reserved for Irish manufacture.&rdquo; When that has been effected, the Irish manufacturer turns up and says: &ldquo;But the most we can pay is £4 10s. for this timber.&rdquo; Somebody from abroad comes along and says he will give £9 for it, but Deputy Cunningham has succeeded, by his illuminating intervention, in getting a prohibition put upon the export of timber.  That has been put on for the most highly patriotic motives, in order to conserve the essential supply of raw material for industry, but the net result is that some gentleman arrives in this country, establishes a so-called industry here and then proceeds to buy timber from the Irish Forestry Department at one-half of what he would have had to pay for that timber if he bought it and took delivery of it in his own native land.</P>
    <P>He processes the timber here and then he can ship it anywhere he likes but in the meantime the Department of Forestry and the Irish State have subsidised the timber as to 50 per cent. of its total cost.  I know of an occasion in my constituency when a man came from Northern Ireland and was prepared to pay twice as much for the logs on the ground as anybody could be got to pay for them in this part of the country. He was told he could not draw them across the Border, that he would not be allowed to do so.  The timber was sold for half the price to somebody here and we had the satisfaction of saying to ourselves: &ldquo;Thanks be to God, the base, bloody and brutal Saxon has been debarred from giving us twice as much for our timber as any pure-souled Gael was prepared to offer.&rdquo; Did you ever meet with such fraud as that?  How are we going to build up a prosperous forestry industry if it is forever to be subjected to that kind of codology?</P>
    <P>My objective is to ensure that the timber produced in our forests is sold to the highest bidder, if it is sold at <Col N="325" /> all, wherever he may come from.  If that means that we have to import timber at the same time as we export timber, why not?  But what sense or meaning is there in creating a situation whereby, having invested countless millions in establishing forests in this country, the produce of those forests is to be sold for half its commercial worth?  That is something to which I invite the attention of the Minister for Lands and Forestry.  I suggest he should take up the position: If I am expected to produce revenue from these forests commensurate with the money I am asking for, year after year, from the public purse, I cannot do it if I am not allowed to put the produce of these forests up for public tender and get for it the highest price I can in the public market.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest that any outside buyer should be given preference over a domestic buyer, but it is the purest fraud and codology to suggest that there is any legitimate reason why a domestic buyer should claim the right to buy our timber, grown in our forests on foot of public investment of capital in its production, at a price lower than that which others are prepared to pay for it.  I believe that, if that kind of cod policy is pursued, we shall end up by crippling the whole forestry effort and persuading the public that the public money invested in forestry is being poured down the drain.  That ought not be the case.</P>
    <P>There has been an immense investment in forestry in this country and there will be greater investment in it in the future.  Unless we can look forward with reasonable confidence to the day when the produce of those forests will pay off the investment in them, we cannot long justify the forestry policy at present operated in this country.  It is a good policy and one which, in the long run, will pay, and pay well, but only on the assumption that we are permitted to get for the output of those forests their full commercial value.</P>
    <P>There is much more which one could discuss on this important Estimate. However, I think it is unrealistic to press on the Minister a series of <Col N="326" /> queries to which he must, quite frankly, honestly and briefly say he is not yet in a position to deal with intelligently. However, I would ask him these two strictly limited questions: (1) Does he propose to maintain the present rate of progress established by his predecessor and to honour the programme which was handed over to him by his predecessor, and (2) does he foresee the day when we can expect that the forestry authority for the sale of timber, whatever it may be&mdash;whether he sets up an independent corporation to handle that business or leaves it in the hands of the Forestry Branch as it is at the present time&mdash;will be free to get the maximum price for the produce of the forests, or whether Deputy Cunningham's patriotic policy is to be indefinitely pursued whereunder domestic processors may claim the right to purchase the timber at half its value and any outside buyer who comes and offers its full value is to be denounced in Dáil Eireann as a base, bloody and brutal invader who devastated the country and robbed us of our birthright?  That kind of cod does harm.</P>
    <P>The more customers I can bring into this country to purchase the produce of our soil or industry, the better pleased I am.  The more they are exposed to furious denunciation in Dáil Eireann for coming here to purchase what we have to sell, the greater the danger that people will make up their minds that it is safer to go and deal elsewhere.  I believe, in regard to agriculture and forestry, in a policy of expansion, based on a growing export trade.  I should be interested to hear the Minister's view as to whether it is possible to maintain progress on those lines.  It is essential, for the prosperity of the industry, that we get a freely competitive market for the produce of our forests in which the true value of that produce will be paid, and not a fraudulent price, based on fake patriotism, by those who want to wrap the green flag round them and pay half of what their neighbours would be prepared to give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Dillon, I should, first of all, like to pay a tribute to Deputy Blowick, the former <Col N="327" /> Minister for Lands and Forestry.  However, I will not run ahead as much as Deputy Dillon did.  In giving credit to Deputy Blowick for the work he did in the Department while he was Minister, I would say that when Fianna Fáil were in power in the years before and after the war and when the inter-Party Government&mdash;in which Deputy Dillon played such a prominent part&mdash;were in office they failed dismally for many years in relation to the problems dealing with forestry.</P>
      <P>It is well known that Deputy Blowick was interested in doing everything possible, but it is also well known that at all times the Labour Party was insistent on the speeding-up of the forestry policy.  Having said that much, I would say, for Deputy Dillon's benefit, that if Deputy Cunningham is to be accused of &ldquo;Dillonitis&rdquo;, accused of codology, then more of us are happy to be on a par with Deputy Cunningham concerning some of the remarks made in this debate.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister's opening speech, to Deputy Blowick's speech and to that of Deputy Cunningham.  I do not know whether or not Deputy Dillon was in the House all the time but I do know that, though I listened carefully to the debate, I never once heard the suggestion from Deputy Cunningham that timber should not be sold abroad.  His remarks were addressed to points which he has raised here on many occasions.  He reiterated the views I hold.  Year after year here certain Deputies have been consistent in their views on forestry. Even when Deputy Dillon was a Minister, the views expressed by Deputy Cunningham and by myself were directly related to the fact that for many years this country had suffered in having our woodlands denuded of timber.  Timber was cut down during the British occupation.  It was also cut down during the 1920's and 1930's when we had our own Government.  Little or no replanting was done.  Surely, then, Deputy Cunningham and I are justified in asserting that something must be done to remedy the position now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Dillon does not <Col N="328" /> remember, but on every occasion here since 1948, as a member of the Labour Party, as a member of a Party supporting the inter-Party Government I had occasion to draw attention to the fact that in many areas in South Cork timber was cut down during the emergency and a good price paid for it.  But no replanting was carried out.  Possibly that is true of other areas as well.  That happened in the years 1948-1951 during the inter-Party Government.  It also happened in the years 1951-1954 when we had a Fianna Fáil Government in office.  Will that policy of not replanting be allowed to continue?  Whether the people who reaped the benefits were Irish or those so vividly portrayed by Deputy Dillon is immaterial to me.  The fact remains that these areas are now denuded of timber and nothing is being done to ensure that those responsible fulfil their obligations or, on their failing to do so, that the law will take its course.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Dillon on one aspect.  I still have some doubt as to whether future policy will mean a stepping-up of progress or a slipping-back so far as acreage is concerned. I listened to the Minister last night and I read this morning's papers. I still have some doubt as to what the Minister's policy is.  I think he should clear the matter up when he comes to reply.  The Labour Party believes it is vitally important to move forward. It is not satisfied to remain static where forestry is concerned, much less consider any retrogression so far as acreage is concerned.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the £2,000,000 provided for afforestation, the Minister referred to a fair return for a fair day's pay.  That is something with which everyone agrees.  I am just wondering, however, what is behind all this?  Is it hoped to improve the volume of planting with a lower labour content? Is it hoped by the introduction of modern methods to replace a certain amount of labour?  If that is so, it is not sufficient just to come in here and tell us that.  We want some further information.  For many years we have been hearing in local authorities of the improved returns which can be gained by more modern methods, more modern <Col N="329" /> machinery and a lower labour content. In the last analysis, we invariably find that the new methods do not always give anything like the results hoped for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick paid tribute to the staff of the Forestry Branch.  I agree with all that he said, but I do not agree with him in the picture he painted when he alleged that up to some years ago nobody here seemed to know anything about the planting of trees. There has always been a certain section of our community vitally interested in planting.  Deputy Blowick described some of them as cranks.  A crank is a most essential part of any machine and if we did not have our cranks we might be slow to do many of the things so essential for the well-being of our people as a whole.  I am not satisfied that we were in such a helpless position in the 1920's and the 1930's in so far as staff and experts were concerned.</P>
    <P>When the Minister comes to reply I want him to give us a clear picture of the overall cost.  We have a certain amount of information in the Book of Estimates, but the Minister can enlighten us much more successfully. Will he tell us, first of all, what percentage is actually spent in wages? What percentage is spent in supervision? What percentage is spent in making inquiries, and all that goes with such inquiries, before the land is acquired?  It is essential we should know the complete costing in relation to acquisition, the preparation of the land and the ultimate planting of it. We will then know how far we may safely go in relation to labour content. We shall know whether we should cut down or expand the number of workers in the various areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick gave a clear indication of the areas he thinks the most suitable for planting.  He favours, probably on the advice of his officials, extensive planting in the West of Ireland.  Deputy Blowick, when he was Minister, visited the south-west and the western end of County Cork.  We give him credit for that.  I fail to understand, however, why certain other areas have not been considered as well as the areas which are now being <Col N="330" /> tackled.  I remember not so many years ago being warned of the terrible dangers of planting in certain parts of the West of Ireland.  Modern scientific progress may be a certain help to us. So, too, modern views on afforestation are giving us a clearer insight into the possibility of now utilising land which would have been considered wholly unsuitable for afforestation some years ago.  Why, therefore, should the Minister and the departmental advisers concentrate on one particular part of the country?  There are many tracts of land in South Cork that are equally suitable.  There are a few areas such as Kilbrittain, Riverstick and to a certain extent part of mid-Cork that are being tackled but it was a long time before some of the areas were tackled. I would ask the Minister to give closer consideration to the claims of these areas.  There are hundreds of acres in the stretch from Carrigaline to Kinsale and to the old Head of Kinsale.  We can discuss later the problem in relation to the acquisition of land but let the Minister not inform us that it is essential to concentrate on the West of Ireland.  There is land suitable for afforestation purposes in the South and, unfortunately, there are men unemployed there who could be put on to this important work for the benefit of themselves and the country.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister's remarks in connection with the new policy as regards thinnings.  Apparently, the old system had many disadvantages, particularly from the financial point of view.  I would ask the Minister to give us a clear idea as to whether under the new system of the sale of standing thinnings, removal is being done as carefully as it was done in the Forestry Division in the past.  I should like to make sure that that is the case.  It is vitally important that no damage should be done to the standing timber in the removal of thinnings.  If the new policy results in better returns, it may be all right.</P>
    <P>There are two matters with which I should like to deal&mdash;private planting and land acquisition.  Deputy Blowick and the Minister have referred to them.  As the Minister has stated, things look very bad when we consider <Col N="331" /> the very small amount of private planting that is being carried on. Deputy Cunningham also referred to that matter.  We have reason to be very disappointed with the rate of progress of private planting but I cannot agree completely with the remarks of Deputy Blowick on this subject.  He made it very clear that, in his view, under no circumstances whatsoever should we even consider taking land unless it was handed to us on a plate, as it were.  I know there is much land in the constituency that I represent where neither cattle nor sheep are being grazed and where nothing but gorse is growing.  It takes good land to grow gorse.  Are we to be told that all the sacred rights that we hear of are so important that we must leave large tracts of land to grow nothing better than gorse?  Some people in this House seem to imagine that we can go so far but no further with the owners or occupiers of those lands who, in my opinion, are criminal in so far as they are making no use what-ever of the land.  Some method of acquisition must be introduced whereby they will be given a fair return.  I am not asking for confiscation of this land.  These people should be made to realise that they have an obligation to the community as a whole as well as to themselves and to their families.</P>
    <P>Suggestions were thrown out last night to the effect that we must give more grants for the planting of these lands.  The Minister himself went so far as to say that he is hoping for some scheme in future, in the operation of which the farmer who has a small area of land to spare for planting would have the satisfaction of knowing that his grandson or granddaughter would have a dowry.  There are many people in this country who know that their granddaughters or grandsons will never have dowries.  They are the ordinary workers.  When reference is made in this House to cranks in relation to forestry, Deputies are equally entitled to speak of the people who seem to expect grants for everything and increased grants for everything and at the same time want to reduce the cost of Government.  I am speaking from <Col N="332" /> the Opposition side of the House.  I am not defending the Government.  I have no reason to do so.  It is essential, irrespective of which side of the Chamber we occupy, that we should express our views on such an important matter as forestry.  If we have to depend on people who expect more grants to grow decent timber on some of the marshland that they own and who are waiting to get further benefits from us in order to provide dowries for their grandchildren, then God help Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be more realistic in his approach to this important problem. It is a big problem.  There are large areas that are suitable only for poor quality timber but that is no reason why that land should not be planted.  If we cannot grow grade 1 or grade 2 or grade 3 timber on it, why not grow grade 4?  Why is it that people are not prepared to make a fair attempt at growing small shelter belts?  Apparently they must be provided by the State also.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this important aspect I would ask the Minister not to regard organisations such as the Trees for Ireland Organisation as cranks.  I am not a member of that organisation. I would ask the Minister not to treat their complaints as the complaints of cranks.  Perhaps Deputy Blowick did not mean it in that way but it is essential that these people, who are giving their time and labour voluntarily for the benefit of the State, should get greater facilities from the State.</P>
    <P>Each year Deputy Cunningham and I have agreed on one point because in County Donegal and County Cork the county councils have always provided a certain service in relation to forestry and I had hoped that Deputy Cunningham would have dealt more fully with the point that I am now about to make. If the Minister is considering any plan for the speeding up of private planting he should consider the advisability of linking the State service with the local authority service.  In counties which do not operate a county forestry service they have agricultural advisers who could advise the people in their areas in regard to forestry.  It is not essential <Col N="333" /> that the agricultural adviser should be an expert on every aspect of forestry.</P>
    <P>There should be co-operation between the State and the local authority.  If that were done, it might help in those areas.  Until it is brought home to the people on a county basis, at the very narrowest, until they realise in their own counties, first of all, the responsibility which is theirs, secondly, the advantages which could be theirs, and thirdly, the advantages which will undoubtedly accrue to the country as a whole if they are prepared on a county basis to throw in their weight in relation to this important industry, forestry, then perhaps we may not be worrying about the question whether or not we have too much land under forestry.</P>
    <P>In fairness again to Deputy Cunningham, I must say I agree with him when dealing with the question of exports of timber.  Last night, when the Minister was speaking on this point, he stepped a little rather in advance in one aspect, I think, when he spoke of the possibilities not alone of stopping imports but of the great advantages of exports.  We all believe in that and we all hope for that time to come, but it would be fantastic for us to imagine here in dealing with this Estimate in the year 1957, that in a few years' time or even in ten or 15 years' time, we would be in a position to go into the export market in such a big way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon may assume that we can sell so much timber to Britain and other countries who may be anxious for it, that we will have no trouble in straightening out our financial accounts; but we know of course, that even at the present rate of progress, it will be a long time before we can satisfy all the domestic requirements of the people here, let alone be prepared to enter into the export market.  We all are anxious to see the day coming when we can enter into that important market, should it be available to us, but it is vitally important, first of all, to see that, by providing each year an increased amount for forestry, we can come <Col N="334" /> nearer to our ideal of providing all the necessary timber requirements of the home market from home grown timber.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was speaking last night on the question of £2,000,000 a year, the impression I got&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;was that he seemed to be worried that the time may come when we might be outstepping ourselves in relation to the progress we were making.  He also referred to the fact, which we know to be true, that we cannot hope for an early return financially from timber.  May I ask the Minister one simple question, if he is prepared to continue examining the policy in relation to the financial return: what is the return financially that we get from house building?  Yet each and every one of us knows that it is essential that not alone should we continue a policy of building houses but should step up the building of houses until the time arrives when we are satisfied that the housing requirements of each local authority have been met?  It must be a long term basis in relation to housing and so also must it be a long term policy in relation to forestry.</P>
    <P>We must be prepared for that, if our people in future years are to get the benefit of the policy which is in operation now and for some five or six years back.  It is quite true to say that plenty of people outside this Chamber and plenty of people writing to national papers find it very amusing to point out that we are all tarred with the one brush, that everyone in politics is supposed to be a devil out of hell, as it were; but if by the wisdom of the various members and Parties in the Chamber at the present time and if by our line of approach, we are prepared to hand over to posterity a policy which in itself will give to those people in times to come an increased capital value in relation to improved forestry, then I think it can be said that at least in dealing with this important Estimate we have done our own part.</P>
    <P>I finish, therefore, by saying to the Minister that, while we are fully aware of the problems that may confront him as a Minister, we are not satisfied with any suggestion&mdash;it may not be his and <Col N="335" /> I hope I am wrong&mdash;that there should be any reduction in the amount of money being made available for forestry or in relation to the increased acquisition of land for this important industry in the State.  If he is to continue to improve on the figures mentioned here in his Estimate, the figure of the last few years on which we have been stepping up, and if he is satisfied to keep stepping it up, at the very least up to the 25,000 acres, then if there is any question or any suggestion of a reduction or of halting the progress in relation to that target, certainly we will be completely opposed to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in speaking here this evening is twofold.  First of all, I would like to make a few general remarks by way of contribution to this very important debate. Secondly, I want to make a few suggestions to the Minister with a view to drawing his attention to the requirements and the potentialities of my own constituency.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general points of the debate, I have listened very carefully here since the commencement.  It appears to me that at the present moment we are all inclined to place too much emphasis on the danger of acquiring land from unwilling owners by methods other than those of voluntary offer.  I think the difficulty of acquiring land is somewhat exaggerated. My general experience in that connection suggests to me that, by a more proper approach to land owners, much more land could be acquired and particularly it could be acquired in a shorter period and at a more reasonable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an accepted fact down the country that when the State, or any large body such as the State is deemed to be, endeavours to acquire land, they must of necessity be expected to acquire it at a greater price than a private individual or a private firm. That is the general experience of public bodies who come to acquire land for housing sites, cemeteries, water schemes and so on.  I would like very much to suggest to the Minister that in <Col N="336" /> the acquisition of the land, he might ask his Department to confer a little bit more freely with such people as Bord na Móna.  That organisation is the one shining example in so far as land acquisition is concerned.  I am prepared to agree that they have not had reason to acquire such large tracts of land as the forestry people have, but I was always very impressed with the methods employed by Bord na Móna in the acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>Of course, somebody will readily suggest that Bord na Móna were not put to the same test in the acquisition of land as the forestry people were, for the simple reason that Bord na Móna were generally only acquiring bog land and that the Forestry Department sets out, at least in the first instance, to acquire land of a better type.  However, bog lands in themselves were, and are now more than before, considered very valuable to their owners.  I am prepared to state that it is as difficult at any time to get bad land as it is to get good land.</P>
    <P>The approach in the past by the forestry people has not been as practical as it might be.  If every landowner were approached in a business-like  way by officials authorised to negotiate with him and prepared to offer a definite price, very much more progress would be made.  As far as I can understand the general policy of the Forestry Division with regard to the acquisition of land, it seems that an official of the Minister's office approaches a reputed landowner who might have a parcel of land to offer.  From then on it would appear as if one party were trying to beat down the other as regards price.  There is a considerable amount of red tape at the moment, a considerable amount of correspondence takes place and it is only after a long period that acquisition takes place.</P>
    <P>I believe we should be more realistic in our approach to the acquisition of land for afforestation.  Forestry officials should be authorised to approach landowners in the same way as a private individual would approach them.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to alter the methods of his organisation <Col N="337" /> in order to bring about a speed-up in the acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the employment content is very great in forestry.  I have listened very carefully to the debate so far, particularly to the Minister and to the former Minister, on that sphere of the Department's activity.  The State's capital contribution is very considerable and I feel sure that, at the outset, the State was influenced to make such a high contributions because of the very substantial labour content that the industry carries with it.  Somebody spoke this evening of the danger of our being unable to find a market for the produce of our forests.  I am doubtful if that position will arise because there are quite a number of industries which rely for their raw materials on timber and on timber by-products.  In my view we can contend with that difficulty when we meet it, if ever in years to come.</P>
    <P>Our big problem at the moment is to step up our annual acreage of planting to the suggested target of 25,000 acres annually.  We should try and maintain it at that figure until we are satisfied that we have attained our objectives. I am very glad to observe that the pool of land now available to the Department for afforestation is fairly considerable and that it gives them what I might call a good stake with which to carry on pending further acquisition the need for which will grow less as time goes on.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out this evening that there may be some danger to employment due to mechanisation.  The Deputy who made that point suggested that the Minister might be well-advised to be a bit more conservative and patient with the ordinary methods now employed by the Department.  I agree with that.  In an industry like afforestation our aim should be to give the highest employment possible.  Forestry is in itself a good local industry; it gives an excellent fillip to local incomes where there are few other industries. In most of these areas the only other employment is on the land.  Forestry workers get good employment near their homes and families.  Generally speaking, I think, they are a contented body of men.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Desmond that <Col N="338" /> the results from the old and existing methods, which, we are told, are antiquated, were satisfactory and we should be very careful before we replace them by extensive mechanisation. I feel quite sure the Minister will bear this point in mind before he commits himself to over-mechanisation at the expense of labour.</P>
    <P>For many years I have been very keen on the suggestion that a Forestry Board be appointed and I am very glad that I have been afforded an opportunity to speak on it now.  The difficulties in the way of such a Board are very great, but I think the Minister could overcome them by adopting methods successfully employed previously.  I think such a board should be more or less on a commercial basis rather than a civil service unit.  We have had happy experience of a number of other boards of a similar type as that envisaged for Forestry; we have had Bord na Móna and Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann.  The success of those two boards should be a sufficient indication to the Minister of the desirability of setting up a similar board to look after Forestry.  The immediate difficulty in the way of establishing such a board forthwith could be overcome by making some arrangement with Bord na Móna similar to that made with I.A.O.S. in 1933 when the Turf Development Board was initiated.  The I.A.O.S. did a good job for a year or two until the Turf Development Board and later Bord na Móna were able to take over.  Bord na Móna has never looked back since.</P>
    <P>If the proposed Forestry Board could become even half the success Bord na Móna has been, then the Minister should have no hesitation in complying with requests that such a board be set up.  I feel sure a number of people have spoken to the Minister on this matter, that he has had advice from some very important people.  I hope he will act on such advice in the very near future.  There is a very good pool of enthusiasts in the sphere of afforestation and there are some organisations in the country that claim to have special knowledge on the subject.  I think it would be a <Col N="339" /> good thing if, sooner or later, these organisations could be encouraged to come in and take an active part in this great drive.  Hitherto the activities of these organisations have been more or less confined to the position of the hurler on the fence, but now that we seem to be approaching the situation in a more realistic way it is time that the advice of those organisations should get a higher priority than it has got in the past.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement I was glad to observe that the Minister dealt very fully with the question of private planting.  It is high time that this important aspect of forestry was dealt with because what is not generally known or appreciated, except by those of us who have reason to go more closely into the figures, is that the State programme of forestry is contributing very substantially now to the general forestry programme.  It has come to the point where it would be unreasonable for many reasons to expect the State to go much further afield in future.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, and in order to bring this whole question properly into the forefront, it is only right that private interests, in so far as it is so, should give a helping hand.  Too practicable and possible for them to do much is expected of the State in the matter of forestry, and the State has, due to the pressure of the political Parties forming the legislature, given way perhaps more than is good in order to foster and develope forestry in general.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very big job before him to make private planting a success and it is there that the proposed forestry board could do very useful work.  Pending the formation of that board, the Minister will have to rely a good deal on local co-operation. He is rather lucky to have available to him such organisations as Trees for Ireland, parish councils, parish committees, the various councils of Muintir na Tíre, the Countrywomen's Association, and more particularly such bodies as the county committees of agriculture.  Those latter bodies, whose primary function, of course, is to stimulate <Col N="340" /> agriculture, have been doing quite a lot in the matter of private local forestry, and their services should be utilised to the fullest possible extent in encouraging private planting.</P>
    <P>The first thing required in connection with private planting is some sort of general technical advice which is not available at the moment in any fair way to farmers and to landowners in rural districts.  The number of horticultural instructors who look after private forestry for the county committees is rather limited.  In most counties, the number of horticultural instructors is limited to two and they can spend only a very short time in dealing with questions of forestry.</P>
    <P>We must try to make our rural people a little more forestry-minded than they have been, and, through the co-operation of our Department of Education, good progress might be made.  It is very desirable that the Department of Education should provide facilities in the primary schools for the forestry officers to give lectures to the senior classes on the problem of private forestry.  It is to be seen with satisfaction already that in quite a number of primary schools throughout the country, teachers have shown a fine spirit of initiative.  They have very often at their own expense and great inconvenience planted demonstration plots.  These plots are there as an example to the people living in the locality, but unfortunately up to the present that example has not been generally followed.</P>
    <P>While suggesting to the Minister that local instruction is absolutely necessary to make the private planting campaign a success, I realise that at this stage, even if the money is available, the Minister would probably be unable to find a sufficent number of trained people with degrees in forestry or the equivalent from the university. However, that should raise no sefious problem because the Minister has his own staff of foresters and assistant foresters who have been trained and it should be made possible for him to make available a number of those officers&mdash;I agree a small number and possibly at a very slow rate&mdash;to form the personnel that would be eventually <Col N="341" /> required to educate the people on the question of private planting.</P>
    <P>There is in every homestead and every farm, particularly in the average type of land, some waste ground, and with the initiative that could be given by the county committees of agriculture and the other organisations to which I referred, I feel certain that the Minister will succeed to a very large extent in pushing the private-planting programme.  I would appeal to all Deputies to co-operate with him in that connection. Deputies will no doubt have an opportunity on various occasions in their travels through their respective constituencies of making appeals to the people to co-operate in that great drive.  It is my belief, now that the Minister has seen fit to deal with that very important aspect of forestry, that he will make an unqualified success of it.</P>
    <P>In order to stimulate private planting, grants should be increased.  We are aware that the county committees of agriculture makes grants to people of certain valuations, but we should go further than that.  The Minister should prepare a scheme of grants on similar lines to those operating under the Farm Improvements Scheme and the Land Reclamation Scheme.  As some Deputy said, he would probably be going a little too far if he were to subsidise private planting.  Nevertheless, there is a great deal of expense involved in the planting of trees&mdash;I have some experience of it myself&mdash;in fencing off the area, in protecting those trees and giving them attention during the early stages of growth.  I can tell you that out of every 100 trees that an ordinary person will plant he is very lucky if 20 come to maturity in due course.</P>
    <P>It would be too much to expect at this stage to have private people experimenting to that extent.  As has been suggested in the Minister's statement, very few people will take on the job on such a large scale.  Generally speaking, you will find many people who will take three to five acres and plant them, which would be no mean achievement. Money would be very well spent if <Col N="342" /> those people could be facilitated with grants and I see no reason why a sum of money should not be spent for the purposes of private forestry, just at it is spent for drainage or any other agricultural purpose.  I wish the Minister every success in his very difficult undertaking.  I think we have a long way to go yet. We are very happy to know from the Estimates and from the reports available to us from this debate that we have at last turned the corner. I am glad that we have a man such as Deputy Childers as Minister, with drive and initiative to carry on the good work in the future.  I wish him every success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>The activities of the Forestry Branch have been debated here at least four times during the past 12 months.  They came up on the recurring Estimate last year and they were debated on two motions which came up during 1956.  This annual Estimate gives the fourth occasion for discussion on the activities of that Division.  Perhaps all that goes to show the importance of the Division; to my mind it is a Division that will grow in importance in the immediate future years and it may well rival other Departments in importance in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that this is the most tree-denuded country in Europe. We regret that as a national loss, that we have considerable arrears to make up in the matter of afforestation.  If forestry had been undertaken 25 or 30 years ago we would to-day have a very valuable money earner. Had it been undertaken on a scale such as the Shannon Scheme, or as an alternative to the Shannon Scheme, we would probably have had more beneficial results in forestry development in this country than even through the development of electricity.  If for no other reason than the fact that it holds out a vast potential field for employment, forestry should be undertaken with great energy.  It is to the credit of the previous Minister that he advanced the annual planting acreage to 17,500 acres last year and that he had aimed at a plantation of at least 20,000 acres <Col N="343" /> next year.  That emanated from the debates here during the past 12 months &mdash;that we should aim at a minimum target of 25,000 acres yearly.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will keep that in mind and that there will be no lack of money for planting, whatever economies are to be effected.  I hope that these economies will be effected in the interests of the plantation of this country.  I doubt if there is any sight so soul-stirring as that of a young growing forest.  It is one of the loveliest products of nature but apart from the sentimental values that we can get from forests and apart from the fact that they beautify the country, forests improve drainage of the land, provide much needed shelter in exposed places and help to give a drier climate.  They improve, we are always taught, the atmosphere by the absorption of certain chemicals from the air.  These are things which should not be lost sight of.  The main fact, however, is that the development of forests affords wide-scale rural employment and in a few years when electricity development will be coming to an end and unskilled workers in rural electrification will be dis-employed, we should have advanced sufficiently in forestry to absorb those workers as well as those who will be available for employment in the interim.</P>
    <P>We are agreed that capital is scarce with the Minister but, whatever capital is invested in Irish enterprises, certainly the capital available for forestry should not be cut down.  We shall all be disappointed if the target is not maintained; I believe there would be an outcry if there was a cutting back of the money which is now available. There is no scarcity of planting land. I was delighted to hear from Deputy Dillon that 200,000 acres of land are in the process of acquisition at the moment.  That is very comforting but I think that the present price offered for lands for planting bears no relation to real money values now.  I was amazed to learn during the past 12 months that when land is taken over for forestry development and when the price comes to be paid for the land, the accumulated arrears of the <Col N="344" /> annuities outstanding on that land have to be deducted from the price so that the Department will take it over as a freehold.  I do not think that is fair. I think there should be some inter-changeable arrangements between Departments to take responsibility for the payment of these annuities.  It is discouraging to find out that this is the case and I was amazed to be brought face to face with that reality.</P>
    <P>When he was speaking yesterday on the Department of Lands, the Minister referred to the fact that he was consulting rural organisations in regard to certain matters in connection with his Department.  It has been suggested here that he should continue that on a wider scale in regard to forestry.  We are not tree-minded in this country but if the Minister would keep in touch with big organisations, such as Macra na Feirme or the National Farmers' Association, and get them to suggest where plantable pockets are available in their areas he would get them to become tree-minded and that in turn might encourage private planting which is so desirable.  The intensification of private planting would greatly relieve the Department of some of the work which it now has to face, relieve it of a great deal of responsibility and create that atmosphere in the country which is very desirable.</P>
    <P>Forestry fires recur all too frequently. I think it is an unpardonable crime for anybody to set fire to a forest deliberately.  Miscreants responsible in the past have got off too lightly for interfering with forests; we have lost a good deal as a result of such conduct. No matter how often the Minister warns the public the fires will go on until the public becomes conscious of their responsibilities and of what forests mean to the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to digress for a moment to refer to what the Minister said when speaking last evening on the Department of Lands.  He made the statement here that any representations made by Deputies on behalf of applicants for lands will carry no weight with him.</P>

It is a false conception and strikes at the very roots of democracy.  I am glad the Minister has had the courage to declare himself in this respect and I hope he will be followed by other Ministers in their respective Departments. Deputies know the annoyance they would be spared if there was a more direct approach to the Departments from the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the general national position is far too serious for us to spend time lamenting the failures of the past.  The faults and defects are too obvious.  We should rather face now the present position and set our minds towards the improvement and expansion of the national wealth and well-being.  It is a matter for satisfaction that improvements have been made and are being made in afforestation, as the years go by.  It would be very disappointing if that were not the case.  The planting of 15,000 or 16,000 acres a few years ago compared with 17,500 acres in the present year does not show a very abnormal expansion; but it is well that some progress has been made, and I hope that progress will be maintained and extended until we reach a substantial standard of annual planting in accordance with the requirements of this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National wealth is being produced; employment is being given; the general appearance of the country will show, both to our own people and to strangers visiting us, that there is a spirit of enterprise and an improvement in our national wealth.  That in itself would be a very useful thing, but the important point is the labour content of the afforestation programme. Anything that helps to stem the tide of emigration is to be commended very heartily.  One disappointment in that regard in recent times is this: When land is acquired in a certain district where there is considerable rural unemployment&mdash;seasonal unemployment, at any rate&mdash;a big number of workers are brought in by the Forestry Division from miles away and the local people are left unemployed.  Anyone could <Col N="346" /> understand that a number of key workers are absolutely essential in a new forestry project, but the fact that the local labour potential are left in their existing condition does not improve the situation very much.  I would ask that that position be remedied and that a good proportion of the local unemployed people be taken on when forestry work is being carried out in a rural area.</P>
    <P>In the first place, this gives encouragement to those who have been waiting for work.  If they are not taken on, it means disappointment and very grave disappointment.  Furthermore, it deprives that particular place of the advantage it would have from the interest these people would have in the forest in subsequent years.  Deputy Manley spoke a while ago of the immense loss due to forest fires and so on.  If the local people had taken part in the planting of the forest, they would have an interest in it.  In future years, the people living in the cottages and homes around the place would have an interest in the preservation of that national asset.  I think that should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I agree also that it is bad policy to purchase at this stage heavy machinery for the construction of roads through our forest lands.  A big amount of heavy machinery has been imported and that did not contribute favourably to our balance of payments position; but when it is in the country, and in the hands both of private people and local authorities in particular, it should be used to the fullest extent. We all know that, in recent years, at any rate, there has not been sufficient money for county councils to keep their workers and machinery employed right over the year.  Here is a field where they can co-operate.</P>
    <P>If the road is to be a private road, just a forestry road, that machinery and some of the workers could be employed for the making of the road. If it is eventually to be a public road, for which the county council will be responsible when it is constructed, then the policy that prevails at the moment in many counties where big building sites have been developed <Col N="347" /> could be adopted.  It is that the builder makes money available to the county council on an agreed estimate and the county council finishes off the road because the county council will maintain it subsequently.  That is the type of work the Forestry Division should engage in rather than spending £32,000 or £34,000&mdash;I think that was the figure the Minister mentioned last night&mdash;in one year for the purchase of heavy machinery for road construction in our forest areas.  I think that would be very bad and I would be sorry to see it undertaken.</P>
    <P>The machinery is there in every county council area.  The work is the work on which engineers and workers are ordinarily engaged throughout the year when there is work for them. They would be working in their own sphere; it would give them more continuous employment; and it would be a better development generally.  I would deplore very much the present trend of bringing a big body of men into these forest areas and absolutely ignoring the appeals of the local men. Many of them would have emigrated but they saw that forestry development was to take place in the district. Many of them have been waiting for years to get employment and then their appeals for work are ignored and people are brought in from outside.  It should be local development as far as possible.  By all means, bring in the necessary unit to get things going and to show how things should be done, but use local labour to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I was rather impressed by members who advocated more education in the matter of showing the worth of the reafforestation project.  Lectures are all right in their way.  It took a long time to build up a favourable public opinion towards the policy of covering certain portions of our land with trees.  What makes most appeal is the demonstration. I was glad that some members made reference to that fact, that pupils in the vocational schools are actually taken out and allowed to plant some little patch with trees.  In that way, they are shown how things are done and they see through the years how <Col N="348" /> the trees grow and beautify their particular area, as well as being a national asset.</P>
    <P>To help in planning the planting programme, we now have nurseries in certain county council areas.  We should see for what types of tree there is a home market, and we should set out to develop that home market, either by processing the timber when it is matured for utilisation locally or for use in industry by its conversion into pulp and paper and so on.  In that way, we can expand our industrial potential from our own national wealth.</P>
    <P>The type of tree planted is very important.  We have seen that in Scotland, for example, when they start on a planting programme they consider what the railway requires for sleepers for tracks; they see what is required for housing and for various rather rough developments such as the building of sheds and outhouses as well as the poles required for all sorts of purposes, props for the mines and so on.  They plan according to a system and when the trees come to maturity the market is there for them.</P>
    <P>We have had a fine training down through the years.  Foreign experts have been brought in from countries where forestry work has meant a great deal.  We now have the necessary trained personnel, I am sure.  A previous member of this House, the former Deputy Dowdall, was at one time very seriously aggrieved by the fact that when men were brought up in the forestry section and had been trained in the development of afforestation they were moved to some other Department of State and all the work and training lost.  It was felt that the men who were trained in such a special way should be promoted within the compass of their own Forestry Division so that their experience and training would be all the time available for further forestry expansion.</P>
    <P>I think that private planting takes on a different aspect from the big woods and forests.  We want to dot the countryside around the holdings with shelter belts and little scenic plots that will take the dreary aspect from our countryside.  The help of local organisations would be very useful <Col N="349" /> towards that end.  Some progress has been made; further encouragement will lead to further progress and I think that eventually the results will be satisfactory.  The public mind is now attuned to progress along these lines and the availability of young plants from county council nurseries, demonstration plots and elsewhere, as well as instruction by county committees of agriculture and inspectors on their visits round the country, will bring to the rising generation, who are looking afresh at the whole problem of Irish agriculture and Irish industry a new outlook that will have beneficial results.  I hope the Minister will throw his undoubted talents and energy into the production of the best possible results from the money expended on this work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>So much has been said from time to time about the Forestry Division here that it is unlikely that anything new can be offered now or in the future.  However, it would appear that the very best position one can take up in matters such as this is to keep pressing the same points year after year in the hope that some of them at least may be accepted.</P>
      <P>I regard this branch of the Department of Lands as a very important one, one in which it is particularly noticeable that we have the desirable position that the labour content is very high.  On my reckoning, out of a total estimate of £1,941,000, there is clearly and distinctly laid out for labour £1,493,000.  In addition to that latter figure, there will be that type of skilled labour which is taken into account under various other sub-heads. I think, subject to coercive reasoning and to a good explanation, that the figure of £250,000 in an Estimate of something approaching £2,000,000 is too high for administrative costs and would not be tolerated in any well-run business enterprise.  That can be said of almost all Government Departments, but then there may be something special to explain such a high percentage devoted to administrative costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate and concede that inspectorate costs in a Department such as this must be very great but nevertheless <Col N="350" /> I would regard the figure of about £250,000 as too high.  When you put that with the figure of £47,000 for travelling expenses, making a total of £300,000 for administrative costs, as against almost £1,500,000 for the exact labour content, that is 20 per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Not administratively or possibly on strict accountancy methods, but nevertheless approaching it in practice.  I think that possibly too great a stress is being laid on the present-day commercial value of forestry enterprise rather than on paying some attention at the same time to the decorative as well as the useful. Upon examination it will be found that forestry, even in small amounts over many places, is not of decorative use only; it has a climatic and a tourist value in addition to stimulating other people towards private planting.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is directing his mind towards stimulating private planting and, within the compass of his thoughts on that matter, I would ask him to direct his officials to try to stimulate private planting particularly in relation to shelter belts along farms which adjoin large commonages.  You will have the dual combination of the shelter belt and the prevention of trespass upon tillage land by animals using the commonage.  &ldquo;Trespass&rdquo; is probably not the right word.  It is probably the damage done to lands by the actual owners of the animals by reason of the fact that there is not any adequate protection.  I speak of that particularly in relation to sheep farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intervened in this debate, apart from any general observations which I might make, for one particular purpose, which is to refer to a small enterprise&mdash;small at the moment but capable of very great expansion&mdash;in my constituency at Glenamoy, County <Col N="351" /> Mayo.  Anybody who will recall questions on the Order Paper yesterday asked by me of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Lands in relation to the labour content on these enterprises at Glenamoy at various times will readily understand my apprehension in this respect.</P>
    <P>This area was first acquired at the intervention of the Department of Industry and Commerce for the growing of grassmeal.  That was discontinued by the last Government and the lands were taken over by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Lands.  The Minister has 19 people employed, apart from engineering and executive staff, in his particular portion of those lands at the moment.  I refer to the matter particularly because I am apprehensive as a result of two things.</P>
    <P>One was that the present Taoiseach, speaking at Belmullet on 28th April, said he deplored the discontinuance of the grassmeal scheme in this area and that, when he had an opportunity, they would look into the matter and see if it were a commercial proposition&mdash;even at that late stage, there seemed to be some doubt as to that particular facet of the business&mdash;and would continue it.  That at the very best might mean that the forestry work at present going on there might be discontinued or reduced to a negligible minimum.</P>
    <P>On the day after that speech the present Taoiseach visited this area with a former director of the grassmeal project.  The purpose of that visit is not clear, but if one puts the two together, the speech on the evening before and the visit the following day with a former director, one must naturally be apprehensive as to the future of the forestry undertaking in that area and particularly on those lands, and I should like to know from the Minister whether there is any intention in his Department at the moment to discontinue the forestry project, reduce it, alter it, or interfere with it in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two points upon which I should like to have clarification from the Minister. I think it will be agreed that no forestry programme can be kept up continually or successfully, unless there is a steady intake of suitable land.  I have not gone into the actual amount of land that must be taken in per year in order to give a planting rate for the following year or the years afterwards, but I am quite certain that if we embark upon a planting programme of 25,000 acres per year, we need to take in at least 40,000 acres.  Therefore, if we are to pursue and adopt the 25,000 planting acreage per annum, it is necessary that we would have the intake of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see in this Forestry Estimate under sub-head C (1)&mdash;Acquisition of Land (Grant-in-Aid) (a)&mdash;a figure of £110,000 <Col N="353" /> for the acquisition of land for afforestation purposes.  That is the figure for this year.  A similar figure was there last year, but at the bottom of the page there is a note to the effect that the expenditure out of this Grant-in-Aid will be accounted for in detail to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, but any unexpended balance of the sums issued will not be liable to surrender at the end of the financial year.  The balance as at 31st March, 1957, is estimated to be £60,000.</P>
    <P>I am not very well up on the accountancy so far as forestry is concerned, but I should like the Minister to let me know whether it is a fact that there is a sum of £60,000 unexpended out of the grant-in-aid made available last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  There is a sum of between £60,000 and £70,000 unexpended and it can be spent this year. Therefore, the acquisition amount is not being increased but that does not mean there is any slackening in the rate of acquisition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The second one is in connection with the price paid to farmers for land purchased from them for forestry purposes.  I feel that the majority of the members of this House are only too anxious to have a first-class afforestation programme.  In order to get that afforestation programme under way, it is necessary that a reasonable price be given to the farmers for the land purchased from them.  Up to the present at any rate, there is no incentive, especially in the West of Ireland, to the smallholder to sell his land to the forestry people at the very miserly figure offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> The man in Roscommon, Galway, Mayo or Donegal with ten acres of land which might be suitable for afforestation finds that the ten acres are more precious and valuable to him than, perhaps, 30 acres to the man in the Midlands.  That small farmer may keep sheep on the side of a hill.  It may be cutaway bog which is of benefit to him. Therefore, the price that has been paid of £3 or £4 or less per acre is not a fair price to that man.  I know the argument will be put forward immediately that, if you pay a very high price for land, the forest itself will be an uneconomic proposition but there are other ways of dealing with it.  If the forestry people embark on a reasonable programme in a locality, they should be in a position to give a guarantee of continuity of employment, in the initial stages, to people who give up land at a low cost.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made by the Forestry Division to help the small-holders with regard to the construction of new houses or the improvement of their existing dwellings.  It is in relation to such matters that you get the enthusiasm and support of the people as a whole in rural Ireland for the forestry programme.  I mention these matters because I see no provision for them in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not had time yet to do very much in his Department, but I can assure him that I will remind him of his duties from time to time, so far as planting in the West of Ireland is concerned.  There are very poor and congested areas in my constituency, especially in the western part of Roscommon where the unfortunate people have no hope of improving their economic conditions, unless forestry is started in their locality.  Having listened to the Minister's statement here yesterday and having read his concluding remarks last night, I am more or less certain that there is no hope whatever, while he is in office, that new holdings or alternative holdings will be given in Roscommon to the people concerned. Therefore, in order to give them some hope for the future, the least he might do would be to get forestry going properly in these congested areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> I will mention two areas in particular to him.  The first is the Clonfad area in the Castlerea electoral division. Last October, the Forestry Division started work there and, if they do not mind, I should like to pay them a compliment, if it does not shock them too much, for the work they did in that locality.  So far the acreage that has been planted is small, but the hope which has been given to the people there for the future is tremendous. There are people there who have never known anything but the dole, a few weeks work on a minor employment scheme or the boat to England.  By embarking on a forestry programme in the area, the Forestry Division have given the people there a hope of continuity of employment.  Last winter, a small number of men were employed continuously.  In itself, the employment was of great benefit to their families, but it had the added benefit of giving hope to other married men in that heavily congested area that they, too, would get continuity of employment, if the Forestry Division expanded activities in that area.</P>
    <P>There are at least 4,000 acres of suitable land in the Clonfad area.  I would ask the Minister to give every opportunity to his Department to continue the good work which was commenced there in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>The second area is that of Slievebawn in Strokestown.  Another excellent scheme was started there within the past two years.  It is giving continuous employment and it has brought stability to the locality.  Fewer people are now inclined to leave that part of Roscommon because they hope they will get employment.  They can say to-day: &ldquo;We can get employment there next year, the year after next and the year after that again.&rdquo; That cannot be said of other counties in the West where the people do not know from week to week, or from month to month, when they will be handed their cards by the local ganger, and so on.  The most important factor in the life of the people of any country is security and continuity of employment.  If we can give that to our people, they will have a very strong incentive and a very <Col N="356" /> strong reason to stay at home. Forestry is an excellent means of providing that security and continuity in employment.</P>
    <P>In his capacity as Minister for Lands and Forestry, I can assure the Minister that he will get every possible help I can give him.  If I criticise him, I shall do so because he is not spending enough money on this important work and my criticism will also be aimed at strengthening his hand if he should have to go to the Cabinet for more money to expand afforestation activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a most interesting debate, particularly for me as I have had very little experience of this Division.  In the past four weeks, I have done my utmost to acquire knowledge of the Forestry Division and both the Department of Lands and the Department of Fisheries.  Therefore, if some of my replies are rather hesitant, I hope Deputies will forgive me.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to deal with Deputy Dillon's comment on the work done by Deputy Blowick while he was Minister for Lands.  I am not the kind of person who would in any way refrain from complimenting a person to whom honour is due.  There is no question but that Deputy Blowick had great enthusiasm for forestry work and that, during the post-war period he increased the planting rate.</P>
      <P>When we achieved office in 1951, we continued the plan.  However, I must make it clear that Fianna Fáil started the drive for afforestation.  We progressed a certain distance until the Emergency inevitably cut down the planting rate.  In 1947, we had plans to expand afforestation if we were returned to office at that time.  There-fore, I do not think Deputy Blowick can take credit for thinking of afforestation. In the very beginning, Fianna Fáil had the concept that, as we were the most treeless country in Europe, we should do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I pay tribute to Deputy Blowick for showing enthusiasm and success in his work, I must also point out that the original idea for developing forestry on a large scale was put into <Col N="357" /> operation by Fianna Fáil during a very difficult period.  It was at a time when agricultural prices were low and when there was an economic depression.  We had the difficulties of an economic war and the programme was barely started when the second World War began. Staff had to be diverted.  Materials such as fencing, and so on, became very difficult to obtain.  We did not succeed in securing office in 1948 and consequently the plans which we intended to put into effect did not mature at that time.  I hope I have been fair in saying this because I am the last person in the world to want to deny the competence of another individual, simply because he happens to belong to a Party other than my own.</P>
    <P>First of all, Deputy Dillon raised the question as to whether I, and my colleagues in the Government, are really anxious to keep the afforestation programme going or whether we have some doubt in our minds about it.  In that connection I should mention a fact that is being lost sight of in this debate, namely, that a cut was made by a former Minister for Finance in the amount available on the assumption that there would be no wage increase in the Forestry Branch this year.  If there are wage increases, then it will be necessary to find more money, if the money is available.  The Forestry Branch has been subject to a cut, which may or may not have certain adverse results in the present financial year.  The Government will naturally have to consider that, along with all the other liabilities they will have to face in the future.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general position, I would like to repeat again what I said in connection with the Department of Lands.  I regard the period of the last three years as a turning point in our national history.  No Minister could enter any Department of State which deals with production or involving heavy capital expenditure without automatically considering the import of every development in his particular Department and its significance in the life of the nation.  The reason for that is known to all of us.  We had a former Minister for Finance informing us that <Col N="358" /> £200,000,000 of our war-time savings had largely been wasted on non-productive expenditure.  We had another Minister for Finance in 1951 warning us that savings were being wasted.  We are now facing a position in which capital will be more difficult to raise. Capital is difficult to raise in many European countries.  The position is that we are now taking our place with a number of European countries in which savings are not automatically available; they have to be earned.  We are not in an exceptionally dire position, but our position has altered and, therefore, when a Minister for Lands takes office he adverts to the fact that for the last ten years £17,000,000 per year has been flowing out in the form of savings, creating an appearance of prosperity.</P>
    <P>When I come to examine the work of the Forestry Branch I want to make quite sure, therefore, that the maximum economies are being effected and the maximum output is being achieved. I naturally want to examine every aspect of forestry.  Incidentally, I have a natural curiosity in regard to all these things.  I think one learns, as life proceeds, that one must have curiosity.  I want to know why everything is being done, the purpose of it, the cost of it and what lies behind the decisions taken.  If I have the honour to be appointed as a Minister in Government, I immediately try to satisfy that natural curiosity and the sort of questions I have been posing to my officers are questions relating to the economic development of forestry, the cost of forestry and the other questions which from time to time disturbed the minds of former Ministers, even the mind of my predecessor.  I ask, for example, as to whether in relation to the area of submarginal land, which amounts to about 15 per cent or 20 per cent of the total being acquired, it is safe to pursue planting at the present rate.  We are planting a very large acreage on an experimental basis&mdash;when I say &ldquo;very large&rdquo; I mean large in relation to the risks attendant thereto&mdash;and that experiment is, I understand, being repeated in Great Britain.  It commenced there about the same time as it commenced here and we have no practical experience <Col N="359" /> or precedents to follow.  We do not know whether the timber grown on that land will prove remunerative in the end.</P>
    <P>I naturally ask what are the risks in that?  Should we take them?  I would like to take them but, before I can speak here with perfect confidence, I would at least like to examine the situation myself.  I believe we must give up a vast amount of sentimental codology in regard to the spending of public money on anything and everything. We must make sure that the maximum amount is channelled into production, or we shall die as a people. I think everybody appreciates I am speaking truth.  It has been said, and mercifully for us it has been repeated by members of all Parties, that our whole future relies on trade&mdash;more and more trade, trade for which capital is required, and capital is scarce. Therefore, I naturally have to ask certain questions and the decisions we make in regard to this matter will be made as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Another question I have to ask is whether some of this work could not be done through private forestry.  If I could get part of the acreage planted by private effort to arrive ultimately at the target of achievement set since the war, I would very much like to do that.  There would be great enthusiasm and that, in turn, would encourage agriculturists to consider other types of new rural development.  We could encourage, too, a spirit of initiative in our rural population.  Naturally, there-fore, I want to inquire into that aspect.</P>
    <P>I am determined to examine every aspect of this whole question.  It is quite natural to dismiss with a facile shrug of the shoulders the comparative employment value of forestry vis-á-vis sheep rearing and to say that forestry employs so many thousands and sheep rearing almost no one and, therefore, we could easily replace sheep by trees. Unfortunately, the formula is not nearly as simple as that.  It is true there is direct employment afforded in forestry but the scientific breeding and fattening of sheep, coupled with the improvement of hillside pasture, in all <Col N="360" /> of which employment would be given, would also yield an absolutely certain return.  But that return would not necessarily come to the people living in the area; it would come in the sales of sheep and the money received from the export of sheep will assuredly employ thousands here.  I am satisfied from my preliminary reading of the case that the ultimate yield from afforestation on the amount of land we are securing will be greater than the yield from sheep, but I am nevertheless going to inquire into the costings again and examine them fully for my own satisfaction, because that is the kind of examination we must carry out if we are to progress as a nation.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with part of the question Deputy Dillon asked.  We, of course, want to see the forestry programme progressing.  We want to keep it going at an intensive level.  I mentioned a few figures in relation to the origin of this programme.  At one period a White Paper was published indicating that 1,000,000 acres was a desirable total planting.  Then we had the report prepared by Mr. Roy Cameron in which he more or less followed the line that had previously been taken to show what 1,000,000 acres would produce in the way of forestry yield and what its relationship was to our national needs.  Just to remind Deputies of that report, he did not recommend this planting acreage; he simply gave figures as to what it signified.  He said that, on the assumption of an increase in population of about 40 per cent and a rising consumption to about the Danish level of 60 standards per 1,000 of population, based on certain yields per acre, the details of which I will not mention, we would require 1,000,000 acres.  I understand that, in the view of our technical experts, he may have under-estimated the full potential of our forests, because he had little experience of a particular species which we had been planting.  I might add that, if the population remains static and the present consumption of timber rises every year, 12,000 acres a year will satisfy our needs and that anything over 12,000 acres would have to be sold abroad.  I just thought <Col N="361" /> that I would give those figures because it may interest Deputies to know the basis upon which the present plantation programme is being carried out.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we want to continue this programme and I should like to emphasise again that we do feel, nevertheless, that it is essential that it should proceed with the greatest amount of efficiency possible.  With the great scarcity of capital, I should not like to be faced by a colleague of mine dealing with production who would say to me: &ldquo;If you would reduce the forestry plantation grant by £X00,000 a year, I can use that capital out of which I can guarantee the perpetual employment of several thousand people in an export trade which would have a vital effect on this country.&rdquo; My duty is to protect my Department against inroads of that kind, because some of the appeals that might be made to me might be very difficult to answer.  Therefore, my objective is to ensure that the forestry programme moves ahead with the greatest possible efficiency, and when I said in the course of my introductory speech that an inefficient worker who remained in the employment of the Department of Forestry would inevitably result in another worker who was efficient not being employed elsewhere; I meant what I said with the greatest seriousness.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the vast majority of our workers perform a good job.  I simply wanted to stress this point because these are the hard economic facts.  Inefficiency of labour in one direction will produce unemployment in another direction.  That is the law of economics which, unfortunately, has to be observed, which is universal and which has to be accepted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon then spoke of the question of the value of exporting timber and timber products and the comparative value of using them at home.  I think he misquoted Deputy Cunningham.  I do not think Deputy Cunningham suggested that we should not export timber.  Unfortunately, the question of what timber we export and what timber we use at home, I understand, is a highly complex one.  It <Col N="362" /> involves the question of prices.  It may on certain counts pay to export timber; it may on other counts pay to reserve that timber for home use.  We naturally want to discourage what I might call speculation in timber exports, speculation by persons who are able to purchase timber very cheaply and sell it very dearly abroad.</P>
    <P>We equally want to make quite sure that as thinnings develop in our forests, they can be used in the most economic way.  There is a number of by-products of timber most of which are known to Deputies&mdash;cardboard, chipboard, wallboard, sawn timber itself, timber used for pulp for the manufacture of paper, and so forth&mdash; and every effort has to be made to see that our thinnings are used in a way which will promote the greatest trade and give good employment and that the factory locations in this connection should be satisfactory.  Therefore, we do need to have a certain control over the use of our timber.</P>
    <P>The market abroad varies.  Exports of pit wood become very satisfactory at one period and diminish at another. It is a highly complex problem.  The answer to Deputy Dillon is that we must take an intelligent attitude towards exports.  I quite agree with Deputy Dillon that if we could export our timber at two or three times the price which our own people are prepared to pay for it, of course, we should export the whole lot and import our timber requirements and thereby improve the net balance of trade of this country.  Unfortunately, the problem is much more complex than that, in a manner in which I have already indicated.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the use of machinery for making roads and for other purposes.  I am afraid that here again I will have to speak realistically.  The effect of the use of machinery, if used intelligently, all over the living world for the last 100 years has been to increase employment and not to diminish it.  I do not suppose it is necessary for me to enlarge upon that, except simply to say that the intelligent use of machinery reduces the cost of the product and <Col N="363" /> releases purchasing power to the people to buy other goods and, as a result, more people are employed.  It is an irrevocable economic doctrine which, with the exception of short periods of technological unemployment, because a machine may temporarily displace the workers, has improved prosperity in the entire world in the past 100 years and I shall not tolerate any sentimental codology whatever with regard to that matter, so far as afforestation is concerned.  If we can get forestry done more efficiently by the use of machines, one or two results will flow.  We will either be able to do more in afforestation or, as a result of doing afforestation more efficiently, more money will be available in another direction which will give employment directly by being invested in some industries, in fertilisers, in the use of the land.  That is the law of economics and it is an urgent matter that we in this country should apply that principle to our whole national economy or, again, we die as a nation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, in regard to this matter, there is absolutely no exception. The economic progress of nations has been based on that principle.  We want to ensure the humanities, ensure proper conditions of work and, as everybody knows, the immediate result in every well run country of using machinery is that wages of the people who use a machine go up and there are people who design the machines and service the machines, who repair the machines, which in turn inflates and increases the number of skilled as compared with unskilled workers.  I hope all the Deputies will follow me in that line of thought, with that proviso that I have last mentioned that the well run country where the workers have their share in the increased output is, of course, one of the most important aspects of the whole thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>How much machinery is being manufactured in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there has been considerable delay in the manufacture of machinery.  When Deputies speak of the effect of purchasing machinery on the balance of payments, <Col N="364" /> all that has to be considered.  I am quite aware of the fact that if one were to buy a vast amount of machinery whose effect on output would not be important, we would have to consider such a step, but I wish that we could have machinery manufactured in this country.  However that does not apply to this particular Estimate.</P>
      <P>In any event, I do not think we need to worry because, in answer to Deputy Desmond, the labour content in forestry is approximately 80 per cent. This is one of the highest labour contents of any industry or occupation.  So that I do not think the introduction of machinery will affect the high employment given and it might actually stimulate it by reducing the cost of what we do and enable us to do more of it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond, in that connection, asked whether we risked damage in doing thinning by contract.  I understand that we ourselves handle the risky lots of thinnings where damage might be done and have received no complaints in regard to thinning that has been done by contract.  There again a great deal depends on the machinery used, the intelligent extraction of the timber, the use of power saws, all of which will have to be investigated in future to see that we get the best results.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacCarthy made the point that we should take local labour for our forestry work.  I should like Deputy MacCarthy to give any example he knows to the contrary, because, as I understand, and from my own observations in my native County Wicklow, local labour, if it can be found, is invariably employed, with the exception of workers with some particular technical experience.  He may be thinking of contractors who thin the forests and who bring a gang of workers with them from some distance. For that we have no responsibility but we try to take local labour wherever we have the opportunity and in fact in the vast majority of cases that is our practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moloney spoke of our establishing a forestry board.  That is a long term consideration and it is <Col N="365" /> impossible for me to speak on that matter now.  He made the suggestion that we should buy land in a more direct manner.  Of course, as Deputies are aware, once a State Department is purchasing land the greatest care has to be taken in regard to the negotiations for purchase, for reasons that are all too obvious.  Making a purely by-the-way comment on the suggestion of a forestry board, I may say there are always pros and cons for and against boards to carry out certain objectives. There is more case for a board which immediately sells the whole of its product than for an administration which is still in the stage of acquiring land for planting and where there is not a great volume of immediate product to sell.  I merely mention that as one of the many aspects to be considered before any decision is made in regard to establishing our forestry operations under an independent or semi-independent board.</P>
    <P>Next I would like to say a few words about private planting.  I am glad to see that Deputies as a whole encourage private planting.  They have made a number of valuable suggestions in relation to education, teaching young people the value of trees and encouraging county councils to plant some of their property with trees, and in relation to private planting as a whole.  I agree with Deputies that we should establish tree-mindedness in this country and that we have a long way to go in that connection.  I would like to give every encouragement to the private associations encouraging private planting, such as the Men of the Trees, The Society of Irish Forests, The Roadside Tree Association and others.  I hope they will progress and I hope to be able to make an announcement which will have some good effect in stimulating the growth of our private forests.  I have already seen criticism of the present system of grants and I have seen criticism of the incidence of taxation in relation to estate duty on growing timber.  All these matters will have to be examined.  It will be very difficult at the present stage to secure any concessions from the Minister for Finance in regard to such things, nevertheless those are part of the study which will <Col N="366" /> have to be made of the whole question of private forestry.</P>
    <P>Just to give a little encouragement to those who may consider planting trees, I would mention the following figures.  The £ at present would have been worth £4 12s. in 1905, showing the constant devaluation which takes place in the value of money&mdash;not only sterling but many other currencies throughout the world.  Bearing in mind the devaluation which has taken place, the following figures will be interesting. These are very, very approximate, and I hope that none of the gentlemen who write extreme letters to the papers on forestry will start to analyse these costs, because I can only say that they are very, very approximate.  The cost of planting one acre of forestry has been reckoned very roughly for sitka spruce as being £47 for an acre.  Within the 15 to 45 years after planting, £300 would be received from the thinnings from that acre and within 50 years, and sometimes less on better land, £780 would be received from the final crop when felled.  That shows a return from £47 of £780 in 50 years.  Now, I do not believe that sterling or any other currency will devalue at the same rate in the future as it has in the past, but it can be seen that afforestation is a very sound investment, particularly for the man who does not have to engage in any very great overhead costs in carrying out his planting.</P>
    <P>I was asked a number of questions about help given to those who wished to plant privately.  Our own inspectors, in connection with their felling activities, give much useful advice in planting.  There are two special foresters in Counties Donegal and Kildare.  The horticultural instructors give a certain amount of advice, and I am informed that there were no less than 41 special advisory inspections carried out in each year, quite apart from the special advice given in the course of inspection in the case of tree felling applications.  The grant at the moment&mdash;as Deputies may know, but I would like to remind them&mdash;is £10 for a minimum of one acre, which must be planted in a certain number of plots of a minimum size or else in the whole <Col N="367" /> acre; £5 is payable on planting and £5 after five years provided the trees have been satisfactorily maintained. Technical advice is naturally available in this case.  There has been a very slight increase in private planting, namely, from 460 acres in 1954-55 to 625 acres in 1956-57.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputies will give me all the intelligent suggestions they can think of for assisting private planting. A great many alternative plans can be devised.  There can be grants for planting, and maintenance grants. There are all sorts of systems in operation for the dedication of private forests.  I have had a number of extra-ordinary suggestions made to me, some of which may not be practicable but at least are interesting.  There was a suggestion that children could get forest savings books, buy stamps from the post office until they have actually saved sufficient for an acre and then that the acre would be planted by the State and when they were 21 years old, it would belong to them.  Young people in an area would buy themselves, in that way, a complete forest which would be available for themselves or for their children.  It is an imaginative suggestion.  There are many difficulties attaching to savings schemes but there are always difficulties attaching to imaginative suggestions. The idea struck my fancy.  It may not be practicable but at any rate I would like to have as many practicable ideas and suggestions as can come from Deputies and others as to how to stimulate private planting.</P>
    <P>There is no good in offering excessive grants.  Private planting will not succeed unless there is real enthusiasm.  It is like everything else in this country. We will not succeed unless we want to do the thing for its own sake as well as making money out of it.  We will not succeed in developing agriculture unless in addition to making a profit, we want to have agriculture as perfect as possible for its own sake.  We know in our hearts that this is true and this will be the stimulus in efforts to provide afforestation in our present system.  Whatever we can do with <Col N="368" /> private forestry in the end, it will be done to some extent through personal enthusiasm, or the desire to save the dowry for the grandchild.  It will not be done because of a hard-boiled financial calculation as to the comparative value of the scheme, examining the value of bonds and national savings which are required for other purposes as compared to such a tree of which there can be no depreciation of value. Afforestation will be done for a variety of different reasons.</P>
    <P>I do want to encourage private planting and I intend to do all I can in the matter because there is something desperately wrong in this country, which I am quite satisfied can be put right, when I see that the private forestry grant is something between £4,000 and £5,000 in relation to a total grant of £1,250,000.  I think I have now dealt with most of the questions asked of me.  I have a note here in relation to a question Deputy Desmond asked.  He wanted to see more afforestation done in Cork.  I am sure all Deputies would like to see more afforestation in their constituencies; I certainly would like to see more done in mine.  In the case of Cork, the area acquired there last year was 4,123 acres and the area planted was 2,600 acres&mdash;15 per cent. of the entire country's plantation.  I think Cork County represents one-sixth of the total area, so Cork is getting its fair share.</P>
    <P>I should like to inform Deputy McQuillan that we do offer the best price possible for land.  I have been looking at the figures for Roscommon and have noticed that the average price offered for land in the process of acquisition is something like £6 an acre.  We are able to secure land at that price.  We have 207,000 acres in the process of being acquired but we do have to keep the cost down as much as possible.  The price of land has been increasing during the past number of years.  We will give due consideration to what the Deputy says, but it would be impossible for me to offer any promise about future prices.  Deputy McQuillan also asked about the progress being made in the Western congested area.  I am told that 38 per <Col N="369" /> cent. of our acquisition is taking place in the Western congested area.  This is a definite improvement on former years, partly due to the fact that we are now taking over certain types of land in relation to which there is a margin of risk but where we hope to succeed because of improved modern techniques and because of our growing knowledge of the best treatment for the submarginal areas.</P>
    <P>Certain Deputies spoke of the value of research, and as I indicated earlier we are establishing a research and assessment section.  I should like to tell Deputies that I am staggered by the tremendous amount of technical knowledge required properly to develop afforestation.  In fact I am appalled at the thought of how much superficial knowledge any Minister has to acquire even in relation to the kind of research required before one can grasp what afforestation means&mdash;everything from the weather, the sterilisation of the soil in which seeds are to be planted, the manures and composts to be used; involves research.  There is a huge amount of controversy on how, when and how often to thin, all of which must be studied by our technical officers.  This all involves a tremendous amount of scientific thinking and endeavour.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse what my predecessors said&mdash;that I have a wonderful technical staff.  We are keeping in touch with similar work abroad and my staff attend foreign conferences. We are doing everything we can to see that our forests grow successfully and in establishing the right kind of species to plant in the various types of land.  As the former Minister indicated, we do need our own research station so that we can apply our own knowledge to local conditions and so that we can measure accurately over the years how trees grow in various types of soil.  From such a station we can also learn something about the submarginal types of land, through very carefully conducted experiments.</P>
    <P>I have been reading some of the reports on certain research carried out which interested me, and to give Deputies an idea of the enormous <Col N="370" /> amount to be learned I should like to tell them that there are numerous devices for measuring the girth of a tree and that, by placing a flag near a forest, you can learn from the manner in which it becomes tattered by the wind the facts about wind strengths. These are examples of some of the devices now available for assisting those interested in afforestation.  There is also the question of the effect on climate, on shelter belts, the effect of forests on soils in areas adjacent to plantations.  I should like, in conclusion, to thank Deputies for their very helpful observations.  I hope we will be successful in our future efforts.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £61,130 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, including certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>If the House does not object, I propose to follow the practice of previous years and deal now with the group of Estimates Nos. 29 to 37, for which I am responsible as Minister.  These Estimates, which were all prepared before I took office, are for essential services.  In general, they show little change from year to year.  The net aggregate amount of the nine Estimates is £5,371,540, a decrease of £111,110 as compared with the total for 1956-57.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> The first Estimate, No. 29, is for a total of £91,700 for the Office of the Minister for Justice.  It shows a decrease of £3,830 as compared with last year.  The provision is mainly to meet the charge for salaries and pay of staffs employed in the Minister's Office and Accounts Branch, the Office of the Film Censor, the Censorship of Publications Board and the Adoption Board.  There is no material alteration in the existing staffs as compared with the year 1956-57, but it is hoped to make sufficient retrenchment during the current year to keep the expenditure within the limit of the sum which has been included in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>In previous years, reference was made to the administration of the Adoption Act, 1952.  This Act continues to work smoothly.  During the year 1956, the number of Adoption Orders made was 565 as compared with 787 in 1955.  Of these Orders, 263 were in respect of Dublin City, 71 in Cork City and the remainer, 231, in the rest of the country.  At the end of 1956 there were 14 registered adoption societies.  These societies place 66 per cent. of the children in respect of whom Orders were made.</P>
    <P>The next Estimate, No. 30, is for £4,666,080 for the Garda Síochána.  It shows a decrease of £87,860 as compared with the Estimate for 1956-57. This decrease, which is shown mainly in the provision made for pay, allowances and clothing and equipment, is entirely due to the fall in the strength of the force.  The saving so made is, however, offset by an increase of £89,000 in the provision for pensions and gratuities.  The cost of pensions and gratuities will be an increasing charge for several years to come. Members of the force are entitled to retire voluntarily on pension when they have 30 years' service and are 50 years of age.  The force is now 35 years in existence; consequently a very large proportion of the members have reached pensionable age.  On 1st April, 1957, it was estimated that 2,900 members, about 45 per cent. of the force, were entitled to retire on pension, should they wish to do so.</P>
    <P>The actual strength of the force on <Col N="372" /> 1st April, 1957, was 6,592 for all ranks. This represents a reduction of 918 over the past nine years.  For the year 1957-58, provision has been made for an intake of only 150 recruits, although the wastage over the year is expected to be at least 375.  Should the wastage reach this latter figure, the strength of the force on 31st March, 1958, is unlikely to exceed 6,370 which will represent a reduction in strength of 1,140 over ten years.</P>
    <P>With a view to offsetting any lessening of police supervision which might result from the reduction in strength, steps have been taken to increase the mobility of the force.  To this end, motor cars have been supplied to 71 Garda districts.</P>
    <P>The Prisons Estimate No. 31 at £174,940 shows a decrease of £10,800 as compared with the year 1956-57.  During the period from 1945 to 1956, the number of persons in custody has steadily decreased.  In 1945, the daily average number in custody was 796; in 1956, it was 396.  In consequence of this fall in the number of persons committed to prison, it was decided to close Cork and Sligo Prisons.  This was done in 1956 and there are now only three prisons in use in the country&mdash;Mountjoy Prison, Dublin, and those at Limerick and Portlaoise.  The closing of the prisons at Cork and Sligo, coupled with a reduction in the cost of victualling and the maintenance of buildings, is responsible for the saving which has been effected.  The fall in the number of female prisoners is remarkable. In 1945, the daily average number in custody was 96; in 1956, it was only 30.</P>
    <P>In December, 1956, the Borstal Institution (St. Patricks) was transferred from Clonmel to Dublin.  This transfer was necessitated by the fact that the average number of youths sentenced to Borstal detention had not exceeded sixteen over the previous five years and in one year had fallen as low as nine.  With such a small number in custody, it became impossible to run the institution at Clonmel and provide the industrial and other instruction necessary to improve the inmates and to assist in their rehabilitation. As the Borstal system <Col N="373" /> could no longer be administered at Clonmel, it was decided to transfer the institution to Dublin and portion of the female prison at Mountjoy has been segregated and is being adapted for use as a Borstal institution.  The work of adaptation is being carried out by the inmates and is almost complete.</P>
    <P>The location of the institution enables juvenile prisoners in Mountjoy Prison to be transferred to the institution where they serve their prison sentences.  This serves a double purpose: it provides sufficient inmates to run the institution and removes the juvenile prisoners from a prison atmosphere and thus enables them, no matter how short their periods of imprisonment may be, to benefit from the training which is afforded in the institution.</P>
    <P>Estimate No. 32 for the District Court at £90,790 shows a small decrease of £1,150, as compared with the year 1956-57.  The decrease is mainly due to a reduction in the number of provincial district court clerks.  The Circuit Court Estimate No. 33 is £10,230 less than last year.  This comparatively large reduction is due to retrenchment of staff and an estimated increase in the amount of Appropriations-in-Aid. The Supreme Court and High Court Vote, No. 34, shows a very small increase of £840 which is caused by increases of pay under the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme to court clerks.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is need for me to say much about Estimates No. 35 to 37 for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, the Public Record Office and the Office of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  The Estimates for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds and for the Public Record Office show small increases which are due to increases of pay granted during the year. In the case of the Registry of Deeds, the fees payable were increased during the year, with the result that the receipts to be paid to the Exchequer are estimated at £39,000 as compared with £25,000 in 1956-57, an increase of £14,000.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice for the Minister for Justice, when introducing <Col N="374" /> his Estimates, to give a brief review of the crime situation.  I regret to have to tell the House that the decrease in the number of indictable offences reported to the Garda Síochána which occurred in the years 1954 and 1955 was not continued into the year 1956. The preliminary crime returns for that year show that such offences reported to the Garda increased from 11,531 to 13,051 an increase of 1,520.  The increase was mainly in the Dublin Metropolitan Division where the figure for 1955 was 6,333.  For 1956 it was 7,353 an increase of 1,020.  The main increase in indictable offences was in respect of offences against property without violence (chiefly larcenies). The number of such offences in 1955 was 8,555, in 1956 it was 9,604 an increase of 1,049.</P>
    <P>I also regret to have to tell the House that there was a fairly substantial increase in juvenile crime during the year 1956.  The number of persons under 18 years of age known to have committed indictable offences was 3,092, an increase of 446 as compared with 1955.  The number charged in court was 2,478 being 340 more than in 1955.  It will be noted that 614 juveniles who committed offences were not charged in court.  They were mainly children under 14 years of age who were cautioned by district officers of the Garda instead of being brought before a court.</P>
    <P>There was a reduction of 4,655 in the number of prosecutions for summary offences as compared with the year 1955.  The number of such prosecutions in 1956 was 94,698 as compared with 99,353 in 1955 and 104,188 in 1938.  It will be observed that the number of prosecutions has fallen by over 9,000 below the pre-war figure.  Road traffic offences accounted for 50,063 of the prosecutions; offences under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts at 16,895 being the next highest, followed by 4,172 for unlicensed dogs and 3,909 prosecutions under the School Attendance Acts. The fall in the number of prosecutions for summary offences is chiefly due to the fact that there are now fewer prosecutions for trivial offences of a technical nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has submitted <Col N="375" /> an Estimate which we prepared and I wish to express publicly my thanks both to the Department and to the commissioner for their co-operation during the past five months in reducing the Estimate and in making it fit in with the general practice of economy in all Departments.  In connection with the number of Guards which we have at present, I am not unduly alarmed but the Minister seems perturbed because he states that there are 900 fewer than we had 30 years ago.  When we consider that at the present time we have mechanised practically the whole force it will be realised that it is not necessary to have the force which we had 30 years ago, when some of the Guards had not even got a bicycle on which to travel about their areas.  To-day also they are more concentrated in particular areas.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to see that no juveniles are now kept as prisoners in Mountjoy Prison and that they have been transferred to the St. Patrick's Home.  This prevents their having contact with any adult criminals.  They are now in a home where they will see young people being provided with a trade.  I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the officer in charge of the home.  I think the Minister will be satisfied with the progress made there.  Boys are not treated as victims; they are looked upon as friends and an endeavour is made to help them for the future by equipping them with a trade.  The work is there for the committee and for others to see and is well deserving of publicity because it fits boys for work in which they can engage when they are released.  I formed a committee on which I had representatives of all Parties and representatives of trade unions.  We tried, through trade unions and various industries, to impress on these boys that their time had been usefully spent, that they were not treated as victims but were being helped to become men and work for the good of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not go into other matters because I recognise that the Minister has difficulties in connection with them but <Col N="376" /> I wish to state that the whole Civil Service staff and the commissioner, when they knew my views on trying to achieve economy, gave me every co-operation. I know that the Minister has not yet received the report from the committee which we appointed to investigate further economies in the depot.  I am satisfied that he will, like myself, receive full co-operation in trying to achieve economy, without interfering with the efficiency of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of the visiting committee of the Borstal institution at Clonmel for many years. I regretted very much, because of the experience I had there, the change to Mountjoy.  I appreciate what the Minister says in regard to the very name of Mountjoy being bad for Borstal inmates and I am afraid that the fact that the St. Patrick's of the present day is part of Mountjoy Prison will still label those who are Borstal inmates as people who have been imprisoned in Mountjoy.  I have always realised, and the Department of Justice realised also, that the prison in Clonmel was not the most suitable place in which to keep people for Borstal training.  At the same time I think it was the best place available for such prisoners and over quite a number of years there has been a gradual process in changing of conditions there.  Except for sleeping accommodation I think the place really served that particular type of prisoner better than any other prison in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fall in the number of people committed to the Borstal institution was surprising.  A few months before the decision was taken to transfer the prisoners to Mountjoy, the committee sent a memorandum to the Minister in which there was a recommendation that the treatment in the institution and its success over the years be made known to the judges.  I think it was suggested that a prisoner who had been found guilty on three occasions and committed to prison would in those circumstances be transferred to the institution for treatment.  I believe it is established by records that fully 80 per cent. of the lads who are inmates <Col N="377" /> do not go back to prison again. It is only on a rare occasion that a person is committed to Borstal before he has committed two, three or more offences.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister that if the opportunity should arise at any time, he should transfer these lads from Dublin into the country where they will be dissociated from the surroundings of their homes and their circumstances of life in the past.  On many occasions, we have recommended to the Minister that a lad should be released, perhaps after six months or a year, and we have had to investigate the qualities of the parents and guardians of these young lads.  In very many cases, we discovered it would be far better for the lads to have only very infrequent contact with their homes during the years when they were being taught to be useful citizens.  As a member of the Borstal Visiting Committee for very many years, I always felt that that separation was the best possible thing for these youngsters.</P>
    <P>I would like to join with Deputy Everett in the tribute he paid to the governor of the Borstal in Clonmel and indeed I would like to pay tribute to the successive governors.  I felt that on all occasions not only the governor but the entire staff were interested in the welfare of these youngsters and were never anxious to inflict punishments on them.  Our experience was that they were always looking for concessions for them.  During General MacEoin's time, they were allowed to smoke cigarettes.  During the periods of office of other Ministers, they had a change of dress and were allowed out in the countryside.  Fields were provided for football and various other concessions were made all down through the years.  I think the ex-Minister's tribute was deserved in respect of the governor, his predecessors and the staff.</P>
    <P>I would again urge on the Minister that, if the opportunity should arise and if there should be a greater number of prisoners for the Borstal in the future, he should try to get some place more suitable than the portion of <Col N="378" /> Mountjoy Prison which is now known as St. Patrick's.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it would be a matter for doubt and perhaps controversy as to whether or not the reduction in the Garda Force is responsible in some measure for the opportunities provided for wrong-doers to carry on their depredations, in some cases perhaps without being apprehended. No matter how you mechanise a force or how you increase its mobility, nothing will make up for the local knowledge obtained by the Gardai in their own areas, whether in town or country.  The policy of mechanisation and mobility may be carried too far. A motor car in which two men are travelling would pay the salary of a man or two.  Would it be better to have these men located in a particular district rather than have them shooting around the country where they may come across somebody driving without due care for other users of the road, or somebody evading the licensing laws or something of that kind?  The general effect of the presence of law officers in a locality and the contacts they have there are far more important than having them careering here and there throughout the country, perhaps aimlessly looking for something to come their way.</P>
      <P>We all must admire the way in which the Gardaí carry out their work.  They work cautiously and any little aggressiveness that was there in the early days of their training has now entirely disappeared.  Their general approach now to the administration of the law is advice in the first instance rather than an anxiety to hale people before the courts, except in serious cases.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we have a certain amount of vandalism in the cities which has a bearing on the debate here to-day on afforestation.  There is destruction of young trees planted by local authorities to beautify the suburban areas.  If the Gardaí were living in those places, very often they would have a deterring effect on depredations of that kind.  That is my view.  There may be strong arguments against it.  I give it for what it is worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about the <Col N="379" /> evacuation of Cork prison and the closing down of that institution.  Applications have been made both by the county council and by University College, Cork, for that building.  If the university is ever to expand in its present location, this is the only opportunity they will ever have of getting a suitable place for their activities. They would be able to use many of these buildings straight away.  We know that technological developments of various kinds are very essential at the moment and the expansion of certain branches of university education will be most important in the building up of this nation's industrial life.  Due consideration should be given to the application by the university authorities for that building.  However, I am in the unfortunate position that I am a member of the governing body of the university and am also a member of the county council.  The county council is also looking for it, but the technical officers of the county council have stated very definitely that it is unsuitable for their purposes, that they cannot transform existing buildings to their requirements, but they think that as the local authority they are entitled to get the building and then dispose of it as they wish.  That is their view-point. I do not know what the Minister's view is, or what the House may think of the merits of these claims; but there is no use in leaving the building there to become derelict.  It would be better that a decision should be made so that whoever is to get it or use it would be in a position to do so without more delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point in one of these Estimates that should interest the House.  The former Minister for Justice has pointed out that efforts were made to bring certain economies into effect in the various <Col N="380" /> Estimates under the control of the Minister for Justice.  I see under the heading of Prisons&mdash;Vote 31, I think, sub-head K&mdash;there are a number of items, and as far as I am concerned I find it very hard to believe that the Minister or his predecessor, or indeed any officer of the Department, made any real attempt to carry out economies.</P>
      <P>The figure in sub-head K to which I am about to refer is insignificant as regards the amount of money involved, but I say that its significance has or should have far-reaching effects outside this House.  The item is No. 4, &ldquo;Execution Expenses&rdquo;.  In other words, there is a sum of £40 put down here for the hangman and his assistant and the prison expenses in the case of an execution.  I imagine that any Deputy or any officials of the Department who had been told to sit down and secure economies in the Department would surely say straight away: &ldquo;There is £40 that should be cut out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I agree that £40 was provided last year.  I did not go back any farther, but it is not the amount of money involved that I am concerned about: it is the horrible idea that this House is actually making provision in this Estimate for the likelihood of some unfortunate person being executed here within the next 12 months.  Surely if such a terrible thing happens, it would be time enough to pay for it out of next year's Estimate?  Why make provision at this stage in such a callous manner for something which we all hope and pray will never happen here?  The people who make out these Estimates or the Minister who is responsible for them are 30 years behind the times so far as civilisation is concerned, in allowing such an item to appear in any Estimate.</P>
      <P>I want the present Minister to wipe out that item in sub-head K, to wipe out that £40 for the hangman's expenses. I am sure there is not a Deputy who, if he had made an observation of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are very fond here of aping legislation passed in another country, but at least they can give us a lead when it comes to a question of humanity, and so far as the present law as passed by the British House of Commons is concerned, it would do us no harm to study the progress that has taken place there in this connection.  I want to make it quite clear that in spite of the fact that the sum is very small, I want to make the strongest possible protest against having such an item included in the Estimate.  I think it is a disgrace to every member of the House unless they ask for its removal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the Garda Síochána has been raised here.  Deputy MacCarthy put a case that some people have much sympathy with, the question of having Gardaí stationed in rural areas.  Then they would be among the populace; they would know what is going on and have the feeling of the locality; but I am personally convinced this country is civilised and that the question of having a large force of Gardaí stationed permanently in barracks throughout rural areas does not really arise.  There is no <Col N="382" /> necessity for it.  I think the squad car is sufficient and I think that the fact that the squad car is likely to appear at any hour of the day or night is a better means of preventing crime than having an unfortunate Garda on the spot going around on a bicycle, because if somebody is going to commit a crime he will know where the Garda is likely to be at the time if the Gardaí are stationed in the locality, whereas the squad car is likely to come at 9 o'clock in the morning or 7 o'clock at night.  The uncertainty is there.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would appeal to the Minister to carry out a promise made by his predecessor in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government to ensure that before the next election&mdash;I do not know when that is going to be&mdash;the Garda Síochána will be given the right, like any other citizens of the State, to vote.  That is all I will say about it, but I hope the Minister will take the necessary steps, because I understand there is a form of procedure in this House that, if a Minister gives a promise, his successor, although a member of a different Party, generally honours that promise. I am now calling on the present Minister, who is a man of his word, to carry out that promise.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Garda Síochána, there is provision made for the reconstruction or erection of Garda barracks to replace bad ones in the various towns.  The former Minister, in reply to a question which I put to him on 22nd February, 1956, assured me that in 1957 it was hoped to commence construction of a new barracks in Roscommon town.  I have looked up the Board of Works Estimate this year and I find that there is provision for the construction of barracks in various centres throughout the country and for the erection of new barracks in Kerry, Cork, Monaghan and elsewhere, but I see no provision made for the construction of new barracks in Roscommon.  I want to put it this way to the Minister: he himself knows that in County Roscommon there is no industrial employment. The town of Roscommon to-day is merely a ghost town, so far as employment is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> It is absolutely essential, if that town is not going to deteriorate further, that employment be given. Many of the people in the town and surrounding areas were very hopeful that this year a start would be made on the construction of a new barracks, especially in view of the promise made by Deputy Everett when Minister for Justice.  I would ask the Minister at this stage to put this work on the priority list.  I am not in a position to say when application was first made or a decision was first made in connection with the other barracks but in view of the special circumstances and the lack of employment in the town of Roscommon and surrounding areas, I would urge on him to ensure that the work commences this year on the erection of the new barracks.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that this hotel called the Bridewell is not what we would expect in the light of the conditions obtaining generally in England and elsewhere throughout the rest of the world.  Earlier in the new year there were seven young men detained in the Bridewell.  They were kept in solitary confinement for three days and, believe it or not, in this holy island, they were not allowed to go to Mass on New Year's Day.  I think that the people of Ireland should be told that.  It should be explained to them that seven young idealists, who were arrested for offences under the Offences Against the State Act, were detained in the Bridewell in solitary confinement for three days and were not allowed to attend Mass on New Year's Day.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of criticism of conditions behind the Iron Curtain.  If there were young Catholic prisoners behind the Iron Curtain who were not allowed to attend Mass on a Holyday of Obligation the papers here would be full of criticism, deploring the action of the particular Government in that matter.  Yet in Ireland we have this shameful action taken in connection with these young men.  I understand, apart from that, that conditions in this establishment are very bad indeed.  All I would say is that in future, whatever decisions are taken by this Government or by the Minister, arrangements <Col N="384" /> should be made to keep these young men away from the Bridewell.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give an explanation in his reply as to why provision was not made to allow these young men to attend their services.  I think the people of the country would be anxious to know whether it was a decision by the Government or an oversight on the part of the staff in that particular institution.  It is very essential that we should have the truth in this matter.</P>
    <P>Speaking about these young men and others who have been detained&mdash; some of them at present serving sentence&mdash;I believe that the former Government were not satisfied with the manner in which a number of district justices were administering the law.  The last Government saw fit to order an investigation into the conduct of one district justice who had the unfortunate and sad task of operating the law as it is in connection with the Offences Against the State Act.  That unfortunate district justice had to administer that law and in so doing had the terrible experience of sentencing decent young Irishmen to prison. Evidently the Government of the day were not satisfied that he was doing his job efficiently and an inquiry was ordered into his conduct.  For the purpose of clarification and for the record, I should like to point out that the members of the Government who took this action were enabled to do so as the result of an Act passed in this House in 1946.</P>
    <P>They took advantage of an Act passed under Fianna Fáil, an Act, when it was a Bill going through this House, they opposed tooth and nail, and yet, when it suited them, they took full advantage of that particular provision in order to intimidate&mdash; shall we say?&mdash;the lower echelons of the law.  I think it would be no harm to quote the remarks of Deputy J. A. Costello, as he then was, on the Courts of Justice Bill as it went through this House.  Deputy Costello at that time was afraid that at some stage in the future some Government would use its position and power to set up a one-man commission to inquire into the decisions and conduct of district justices.  This is what <Col N="385" /> Deputy Costello, as he then was, had to say on that occasion&mdash;I quote from column 205, Volume 102, of the Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A judge, whether he belongs to the lower ranking section of the judicial hierarchy or the higher, ought to have control of his own court.  If he has not control, through the exercise by politicians of control, of the business of his own court, his functions may be seriously interfered with and his independence sapped.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the statement of Deputy Costello in 1946 when it was suggested that in order to make district justices amenable they would be brought under the control of a High Court judge who could, on his own, carry out an investigation into their conduct and make recommendations upon their activities. Deputy Costello opposed that provision tooth and nail.  Yet when it came to his having the responsible position of Taoiseach, he took immediate opportunity of putting into effect that section which he deplored when it was being discussed in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello was not alone in his criticism in 1946.  He was ably helped at that time by Deputy Cosgrave who later became Minister for External Affairs and who, in that capacity, had plenty to say about conditions in every other country in the world when he went to the United Nations and gave advice to every other country in the world on how to run their own business but forgot to look at his own backyard at home.</P>
    <P>In 1946, when the Courts of Justice (District Court) Bill was going through, Deputy Cosgrave spoke here.  Like his colleague, he was horrified and perturbed that power be given to any Government to direct a High Court judge to investigate the conduct of a district justice.  As reported at column 397 of Volume 102 of the Official Report, Deputy Cosgrave said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In my opinion it is undesirable that district justices should labour under conditions whereby their conduct may be inquired into and reported upon by a single judge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave was Minister for External Affairs in the last Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> He, too, as a member of the Cabinet, must bear Cabinet responsibility for the decision to appoint Mr. Justice Teevan to investigate the conduct of a district justice who was doing his duty according to his lights.  This raises very serious issues with regard to the independence of the courts.  It raises the issue that no longer will a district justice have the independence he really should have.  The fear will always be there in the mind of a district justice that the Government will appoint a High Court judge to investigate his activities if those activities do not suit the Party in power.  We shall have to have it made crystal clear that the courts as they are should be completely free of political interference. It cannot be said that in the past three years the courts were free from political interference.</P>
    <P>There is a motion on the Order Paper which will enable me to deal with other aspects that come under the present Minister's jurisdiction.  I do not know whether or not I would be in order at this stage in referring to certain Acts which are in operation at the present time&mdash;in particular, the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>

      <P>In the course of the past few months a number of young men were hauled in by the forces of the State under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  To be quite frank with the Minister, I want to tell him that personally I was horrified to discover that such powers existed in this State as were available under that 1939 Act and put into operation here in the past few months.  I am referring specifically to Section 52 of that Act, sub-section (1) of which provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever a person is detained in custody under the provisions in that behalf contained in Part IV of this Act, any member of the Garda Síochána may demand of such person, at any time while he is so detained, a full account of such person's movements and actions during any specified period and all information in his possession in relation to the commission or intended commission by another person of any offence under any section or sub-section of this Act or any scheduled offence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In plain words, that sub-section means that any individual could be hauled in by a member of the Garda Síochána and asked: &ldquo;What was your neighbour doing yesterday at 6 o'clock in the evening?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What was your neighbour doing this day three weeks ago at 7 o'clock in the evening?&rdquo; If the individual concerned failed to betray his neighbour by saying what he was doing at those times he could be taken in and given a sentence of six months for not letting the cat out of the bag.</P>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan was worried about the £40.  I think my colleagues will agree with me that we may have need of it at the next meeting of the Cork County Council when it becomes known that Deputy MacCarthy suggests to the Minister that Cork jail be handed over to the university authorities.  I want to make the position plain.  A deputation met the previous Minister here in Leinster House in regard to this important subject. The members of that deputation spoke not as individuals but on behalf of the members of the Cork County Council as a whole.  Deputy MacCarthy was a member of that deputation.  The fact that he was also a member of the governing body of the college had nothing to do with it.  Perhaps I should also say that the members decided in the past, hold the view in the present and are determined to claim Cork jail in the future as the rightful possession of the Cork County Council whenever a question arises of handing it over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> If, then, there is to be a question of what use will be made of the jail or whether they, in turn, will give it to some other authority, I submit that that is a matter for the Cork County Council to decide.  It is most important that we state our claim to the property which we believe is ours in law and which we believe we should, in law, get.</P>
    <P>I notice that no mention whatever is made in the Minister's speech of the terrible accidents which have occurred in the past 12 months.  Indeed, many such accidents occurred in years gone by and they are getting worse.  I have in mind the type of person driving a motor car who is permeated with the spirit of alcoholic enthusiasm which has given him the feeling that he is the only person with a claim to the public highway and that everybody else must either get out of his way or be left dead on the road.  I am disappointed that the Minister failed to point the fact that accidents are increasing rather than decreasing.  I sympathise with the Garda authorities in their efforts to cope with a particularly undesirable type of motorist and I can see full justification for the Minister making adequate provision for motor transport for the Gardaí so that they can check on these individuals but, in my opinion, that is not enough.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan deplored the actions of certain people.  I tried to impress on Deputy Everett when he was Minister, and I want to impress now on the present Minister, the desirability of keeping a special check on accidents, first of all, on the court proceedings subsequently and, thirdly, on the outcome of such proceedings. Day after day complaint is made that there must be something radically wrong because so many of these menaces on the roads get off so lightly. Unfortunate men and women and little children are killed on the roads and the offender gets off.  Except for the payment of certain moneys, the offender gets away with it.  These accidents and subsequent proceedings should be pursued to the bitter end.  I shall say no more.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago I drew attention to the fact that it was vitally essential to provide motor-cycle facilities for <Col N="390" /> Gardaí on such roads as the Cork-Crosshaven road during the summer months.  I know that Deputy Healy will agree with me in this.  It is no use expecting Gardaí stationed in Douglas, Carrigaline or Crosshaven to check on these road hogs who are so anxious to kill everyone who comes in their way. That position cannot be successfully remedied by a system of Gardaí travelling around in easily identifiable cars. Every driver who sees that car becomes a careful driver on the instant.  We believe that the most successful way of coping with the dangerous driver is by having a system of motor-cycle patrols.  Last year we were told that such patrols were going South.  On one occasion, when coming to Dublin, I met six or seven, well-equipped, heading for the South.  So far, I have seen only one around Cork. Where the rest went, I do not know. We certainly need such patrols during the summer months.</P>
    <P>We all regret the increase in crime, particularly the increase in juvenile crime.  Now, exceptions must be treated in the way they deserve.  The problem is a big one in Dublin admittedly because of the density of the population but, on the other hand, there are many parents who, because the child's name&mdash;thank God, for the sake of the child&mdash;is not mentioned in the newspapers take the view that everything is O.K.  That shows a complete lack of parental responsibility.  It is lack of parental control which is causing so much of the trouble nowadays. We are all hoping for the day when one policeman will be sufficient in every village.  So long as parents fail to appreciate their responsibilities to their children and, through their children, to society as a whole, we will be faced with considerable difficulty.</P>
    <P>We shall have difficulty, first of all, in relation to the numbers essential to man an effective force and, secondly, we shall suffer the headache of worrying how these children will turn out later on.  I appreciate the excellent rehabilitation education given to these offending children in our institutions. It is good that the State, at any rate, tries to do the right thing for these children, but it would be better if parents could be brought to realise <Col N="391" /> their moral responsibility for their children.  I go so far as to say that where a child offends a second time, the parents of that child should be exposed for what they are, namely, a disgrace to the name of father and mother of Irish children.</P>
    <P>I want to raise an important matter now in relation to the preparation of the voters' lists.  The Guards are expected to check after another man has done the work, work which he is paid to do.  Year after year at local authority meetings attention is drawn to the fact that in every parish, and in every part of every parish, there are omissions from the lists and there are also additions which should not appear. I appeal to the Minister to consider the possibility of having the compilation of the list done solely by the Gardaí.  In that way someone will have responsibility and no one can be blamed except the responsible individual. I believe that if the Gardaí are given this work, they will make a good job of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address two queries to the Minister for Justice on one matter.  That is the matter of the inquiry held into the conduct of a district justice.  It is public knowledge that a district justice did behave in such a way that the provisions of the Act of 1946 were brought into play and the Minister's predecessor asked the Chief Justice, in accordance with the Act, to appoint a High Court judge to make inquiry into what was reported in the newspapers, find out what the facts were and, generally, to report. That procedure was fully carried out in accordance with the Act.  The Chief Justice did appoint a judge of the High Court and he did make inquiries and a report was received by the former Minister for Justice before he left office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two questions that I should like to ask with regard to that.  First of all, have the Government made up their minds whether any action is called for as a result of that report; secondly, whether it is the Government's intention to publish that report, whether they are going to take action on it or not?  These are two things <Col N="392" /> that I think should be answered and I am personally very clear that the publication of the report is the only thing that would quiet public interest in this matter.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk in this House about the independence of the judiciary.  The independence of the judiciary is not absolute, even in the phrase that is used about them in the Constitution, the cryptic phrase, which says that judges are to be subject to the Constitution and the law.  Whether that means that their independence is subject to the law is a moot question. But judicial independence is not protected for all judges.  It is not indeed protected for any judge as against misbehaviour or incapacity.  Judges may be removed by a parliamentary vote for misbehaviour and incapacity. The constitutional position is that the only limitation on the removal of a judge through the medium of the parliamentary vote is that that is given only to Supreme Court and High Court judges.  The other judges have been given the same protection by law, but the Dáil which passed that law has from time to time seen fit to make other provisions and they made a provision in 1946.  Certain people objected to it.  Deputy McQuillan called attention to the fact that Deputy Costello is one man who did and Deputy Cosgrave is another.</P>
    <P>The provision was passed and it became an Act of this House and, if that provision had not been put in in 1946, there was another provision which was in earlier Acts which enabled a committee of three to dismiss a district justice.  To my mind, the protection that was given to the district justices in the 1946 Act was a valuable protection, but it does not give absolute independence to any judge, particularly to a district justice or Circuit Court judge, and this House in its wisdom has seen fit from time to time to amend the conditions under which the independence of the judiciary is controlled and is guaranteed by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan speaks of a justice who had the unfortunate and sad task of sentencing certain people.  If it be so unfortunate as all that and so sad, he had one resort.  He could have <Col N="393" /> refused to act.  He would have lost his position, of course, but a man who is really indignant about being called upon to try people for offences, even under the Offences Against the State Act, need not act, and if his sadness and state of misfortune gets sufficiently heavy with him, he will probably take the alternative given to him: he can take his pension and go.  He need not try to exalt the independence of the judiciary to the highest point. It is not absolute.  You cannot put it beyond what is in the Constitution and even the constitutional position, where the protection was given in respect of certain judges, has been changed from time to time by law.</P>
    <P>I do not understand Deputy McQuillan's attitude about the public hangman and the £40 in the Estimates. I gather from his remarks that he does not object to £40 being paid to a person if he has to carry out an execution, but asks why should that be in this year's Estimate; if we are going to have a hanging this year, let us pay it next year.  That is the complaint the Deputy made.  The Deputy also states that from time to time we ape legislation passed in another place. He is speaking of England and he may have left people under the impression that England has abolished capital punishment.  Of course it has not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> Deputy McQuillan has discovered that Section 52 is in an Act passed in the year 1939.  Deputy McQuillan parades himself in his constituency as a man who is very alert in things and it is only this time apparently, since the raids in the North started about the 12th December last year, that he began to know Section 52 of the Act. The Taoiseach who is now in control of the affairs of the Government jailed many a man under Section 52 over a number of years.</P>

If the Deputy wipes out Section 52, will he leave the special courts, the <Col N="395" /> courts which have been composed all over the years of military people who need not have any legal qualification whatever and, if he does leave that out, will he go on to read the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act which allows people to be sent to jail because a Minister thinks it is proper that a man should go to jail?

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a word or two to what has been said in the debate.  First of all, I should like to avail of this opportunity in considering these Estimates which, of course, are the Estimates prepared by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Everett&mdash;I think it would be fitting from this Party, the Fine Gael Party&mdash; certainly&mdash;to pay a tribute to Deputy Everett as Minister for Justice.  Particularly in the past 12 months and especially in recent months, he handled a difficult and a potentially dangerous situation in an exemplary manner and by the action he took fortunately, I believe, a serious national crisis was averted.  The present Minister, I have no doubt, will be prepared to join in the tribute to Deputy Everett.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a pity&mdash;I notice that Deputy McQuillan is no longer in the House&mdash;that Deputies by anything they say or any action of theirs inside or outside the House should in any <Col N="397" /> way lend succour to those who threaten our democratic institutions here.  They possibly do not appreciate the danger involved.  Certainly the threat which the previous Government had to face at the beginning of this year was a threat aimed directly against this Parliament, against our laws and against our institutions.  I think it comes ill from any Deputy to be so foolish as to appear to support or uphold the action of those misguided people.  In any event, I think the Minister knows that, in relation to that difficulty and to dangers of that kind, he can rely on the support, so long as he and his colleagues discharge their duty, of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>May I just pass from that to one other matter, and again in this respect I think some credit is due to the Minister's predecessor?  Any Deputy who looks at the Statute Books for the years 1954 and certainly 1955, 1956 and 1957 and up to the change of Government, will be struck by the number of law reform statutes which are incorporated.  Certainly the last Dáil set a very inspiring example by the number of measures aimed at law reform which were introduced by the Minister's predecessor and passed through the Oireachtas.  May I express the hope that that good work will be continued?</P>
    <P>On many occasions when I was last in Opposition, I stressed on this Estimate the great need which exists for us in this country to bring the ordinary law affecting the rights and duties of individuals more into accord with modern needs.  Many of the laws which operate at the moment are archaic and out of date and need considerable modification and reform.  In the past two or three years, a very big step forward was taken in initiating worthwhile reform.  Many other Bills were planned and many other reforms were intended.</P>
    <P>One was a much needed reform dealing with the law of civil liability in relation to torts and particularly to the defence of contributory negligence. When I was last in Opposition, I introduced a Private Members' Bill <Col N="398" /> which was considered by the Dáil and which aimed at the abolition of the defence of contributory negligence as it is at present known.  The previous Government decided to make that measure a Government measure and it was planned to introduce it.  May I express the hope that the present Minister will interest himself in this work and that many of the measures, which I know have been pretty well prepared already, will be introduced?</P>
    <P>There are no votes to be got from law reform, but the only way in which the law can be reformed is by this legislative assembly.  I often feel that we waste a considerable amount of time doing far less valuable work and that it might be a good thing if we devoted more time to rectifying some of the glaring anomalies which have existed through the years and which have not been remedied simply because Governments have been too busy doing other things and the Dáil had not the time to do it.  Many of these Bills have been prepared already.  The very excellent section in the Law Offices available to the Minister has done, I understand, excellent work in getting these measures ready and I express the hope that they will be introduced and that this work of law reform may continue.</P>
    <P>Finally, in view of the fact that Deputy McQuillan raised this matter of the action of the previous Government in relation to the threat to our democratic institutions and in relation to the action it took with regard to a district justice, I do not think any member of the previous Government, with regard to these matters, makes or will ever make any apology for any action we took.  We did our duty in accordance with our obligations and even if it was misunderstood at the time, we are quite satisfied that what we did was right and that if we had not taken the action we took, a very serious danger would have threatened this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some matters I wish to refer to briefly on this debate.  The first one is in connection with the references made here to a district justice.  Taking the position of district justices generally throughout <Col N="399" /> the country to-day, to my knowledge, they are very largely unemployed.  The work which went on in District Courts has very largely disappeared.  To some degree at all events, that is due to the depreciation of money values and as a result the jurisdiction exercised by these courts in its present form is no longer realistic.</P>
      <P>I remember that some time ago legislation was introduced here to increase the jurisdiction in the Circuit Court and the District Courts.  I suggested an amendment to increase the District Court jurisdiction of £50 in the case of contracts and tort, but it was said we were doing something revolutionary.  Due to the depreciation in money value, there is no work whatsoever being done in the District Courts nowadays.  Very few cows knocked down on the roads nowadays are worth less than £50.  Accordingly, we have district justices twiddling their thumbs looking for work.  The situation is such that we could do with half the district justices in order to get rid of the work.  That does not mean that I believe they should be removed; what I am suggesting is that the Minister should re-examine the whole position with a view to increasing the jurisdiction of both the District Courts and the Circuit Courts to realistic sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am aiming at is decentralisation in every sense of the word.  The people should have available the services of these courts, even of the High Court, at less expense.  The practice has now grown up of sending the High Court on circuit; they have been hearing cases in Cork, Galway and other big centres, on the basis that it is more convenient to litigants and to poor people who would otherwise have to bring their cases to Dublin.  That position should obtain as a matter of right for the people of rural Ireland, who should have not imposed upon them the difficulty of travelling to Dublin with hosts of witnesses, engineers and doctors whose fees and expenses they can ill-afford to pay.  The services of the High Court should be made available to those people at the least possible expense.  There is no reason why the <Col N="400" /> High Court should not be sent among those people.</P>
    <P>I should like to make brief reference to land registration.  At the moment, there are long delays in the discharge of equities.  The discharge of equities is essentially a slow business, but there is no reason why it should take two or three years.  I am told the difficulty is because of staff.  It is a matter that should be remedied, because at the moment there are unnecessary delays in the completion of sales.  The same delays affect Departments of State, particularly the Department of Lands, who insist on equities being discharged before they acquire land.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy T. F. O'Higgins paying tribute to Deputy Everett, the former Minister.  Deputy Everett, no doubt, did his business well in his own way, but there is one matter he did for which members of my profession and the public generally will remember him not very kindly.  That is the astounding increase in stamp duties he imposed on all and sundry.  It went through very slickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Everett put it on and, in doing so, struck the greatest blow ever at the weakest and poorest sections of the community.  I do not know if he realised he was penalising even poor unfortunate labourers who might meet with accidents.  He penalised every person, no matter how poor, who might have recourse to the courts in order to recover compensation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is now criticising legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M. J. O'Higgins Mr. M. J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This was done by some form of imposition Order.  I want to give a practical instance illustrating how daft this legislation by imposition Order can be.  Take a case of bankruptcy. The stamp duty has been increased to such an extent that the State can now take £50 in stamp duty <Col N="401" /> at the expense of creditors who might have to be satisfied with four or five shillings in the £.  The cost of issuing civil bills has been increased from a few shillings to £1 each.  Each of these impositions has been felt by the poorest sections of the community.  No matter how badly off the previous Administration may have been for money, and no matter how closely they scraped the bottom of the pot, they might have left the unfortunate labourer alone in this regard.  The Minister might get an opportunity of looking into the position when he is considering the work of his Department.</P>
      <P>With reference to the Garda Siochána, there is one form of duty which they should not be asked to do.  That is the practice that has grown up in rural Ireland of dealing with unemployment assistance applications.  I think that is no work for the Garda.  It has bad consequences both for the morale and the efficiency of the force. Everybody knows that grave abuses have grown up throughout the country because Gardaí have been put at this work.  We all know it is very easy to put temptation in a man's way, particularly in the case of a man on small pay.  Unfortunately, some of our people are adepts at this form of corruption.  I suggest that the Minister should examine this whole position so that some other form of administration could be substituted. The present system is a bad one and the quicker it is replaced, the better for the force and the administration generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to speak for a moment on the administration of the Land Court.  I do not know how far this comes under the administration of the Minister for Justice.  Here again the procedure is obsolete, to the detriment of smallholders. The owner of ten or 15 acres is brought up here to have his case tried in Merrion Street before the Lay Commissioners, when his case might well be dealt with nearer home.  This is a serious imposition on some unfortunate people.  There was a time when such cases were dealt with in towns throughout the country.  There may be some justification for having appeals dealt with in Dublin, but not <Col N="402" /> for the hearing here of resumptions and acquisitions.</P>
    <P>The provisions made by the Land Commission in regard to costs and expenses are also completely obsolete; they are there since the year of one.  In small cases which involve land worth not more than £200, the amounts allowed by the commissioners are so small that the persons concerned are at a considerable loss in the paying of counsel, valuers and other witnesses. In so far as the Minister has any jurisdiction in this matter, I hope he will look into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to open my remarks by saying how pleased I am with three items mentioned in the opening statement of the Minister.  The first is the fact that we are closing two gaols; secondly, that there has been an extension of the system of cautioning children under 14 instead of automatically hauling them before courts, with consequent bad impressions on their young minds; and, thirdly, the fact that Guards have in recent years instituted fewer prosecutions for minor technical infringements, particularly road traffic infringements.  These three developments are very welcome, because for some years it appeared to many of us in the City of Dublin that the main activity of the Garda Síochána was to wait around the corner till somebody parked a car in a wrong place for about ten minutes, rush in, take the person's name and the number of the car and immediately institute a prosecution.  The time they took to deal with these minute offences could have been much more profitably used in performing their main function, the detection and prevention of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must, however, echo the expression of regret which the Minister gives us when he says there has been an increase in crime in the last 12 months, especially in the City of Dublin.  The problem of crime detection and prevention in our city is little different from the same problem in any other city, town or village throughout the State, because for many years now there has been a steady shifting of our population. Families have been moving from one portion of our city to another&mdash;<Col N="403" /> the result of the efforts of local authorities or private developers, the result of expulsions from their dwellings by landlords, and so on&mdash;changing over at the rate of 3,000 or 4,000 families each year.  Thus the newer areas in our city, containing thousands of families, have grown in many cases almost overnight, and this is not a condition which applies to many of our other cities and towns.</P>
    <P>A colleague of mine, Deputy Desmond, in his remarks indicated&mdash; he said he was expressing only a personal viewpoint&mdash;that he thought that the main cause for the increase in this type of crime in the city, in particular, was lack of parental control.  I do not like disagreeing with any Deputy, whether he is a colleague of mine or not, but some regard must be had to the fact that there are many, many parents of children in the City of Dublin residing outside the boundaries of the city and outside the boundaries of the State.  There are far too many families in our city where the bread-winner has been compelled to leave his home and to leave the responsibility of guiding, protecting and chiding the children solely to his wife, or in some cases even to his mother or another relative.</P>
    <P>The increase in the incidence of this type of crime may to some extent be the result of the very seriously unsettled conditions in our country and in our city, arising from very substantial unemployment and a very serious state of uncertainty and insecurity in the minds of our average citizens. Therefore, I would not subscribe to my own colleague's views in regard to the responsibility for and the cause of this increase during last year, and I would ask the Minister if, as a member of the Government, he will do whatever he can to help eradicate what I believe is one of the main causes.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  It is a minor matter possibly to many Deputies, but it is a very serious matter to those who have to live in the city or who have to traverse the streets and roads in and around the City of Dublin.  I refer to the increasing necessity for <Col N="404" /> some proper control of our traffic and the increasing necessity for the installation of traffic lights at many of the busy junctions.  This is a matter for which I think the Minister has some responsibility, and I trust he will give it his attention in the course of the coming 12 months.</P>
    <P>Finally, might I be permitted to mention another aspect in relation to the very often-discussed district justices, that is, the aspect of their attitude to many people who come before them charged with various offences? It is a frequent practice of justices operating in the courts throughout the metropolitan and other divisions to depart completely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the administration of the law is a matter for the courts, not some of the impudent remarks of the district justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking that the matter be examined and I am protesting, as a representative elected by the citizens of Dublin, against the attitude adopted on occasion to citizens in various sections of our city, people against whom no charge at all is levelled.  I am not criticising any district justice for the way in which he conducts his business as a district justice, but I am saying this, that if I live in a housing area and I am not before the courts on any charge, there is no justice, or anybody else, entitled publicly to take shelter behind an official position and make out a charge against me to indicate that I, and <Col N="405" /> hundreds of my fellow citizens, are not conducting ourselves with decency and decorum.  That is very often suggested in our courts and I ask the Minister to take full cognisance of it.</P>
      <P>I trust that the Minister will accept that in dealing with the question of detection and prevention of crime in our metropolis, our citizens are in this peculiar position.  There is much more widespread temptation because of the grouping of industries, commerce and distribution in our city.  There is the constant traffic into our city, by our own nationals and by non-nationals coming from outside the country, and, in addition, some of our townsfolk suffer from the problem of itinerants travelling into the city and on whom there is very little opportunity of exercising proper control and guidance.</P>
      <P>There is another matter and I am not quite sure whether it is proper to this Estimate, but I will take this opportunity of mentioning it because I think the Minister has some responsibility in the matter.  From time to time, the lives of people coming into the city and travelling on the outskirts of it are endangered by the fact that large bands of roving animals, particularly horses, are allowed to wander unchecked on some of the main arteries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Multi-coloured horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague remarks that they are multi-coloured horses. They are speckled and brown, but nevertheless they constitute a danger and up to the present there appears to be no constructive way of dealing with this problem.  Deputies who have occasion to travel into the city to attend this House may have occasion to risk their lives as a result of these bands of horses, but for the citizens living near these encampments, there is not merely the risk to their lives but the annoyance of their gardens being broken into and their children being in danger of being trampled under foot. Ther has been more than one incident of children being kicked by horses on the roadway or by horses permitted to obtain access to some of the public open spaces in and around the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say in conclusion that I wish <Col N="406" /> the Minister well?  I hope, however, at the conclusion of the year, to hear that there is a reduction, instead of an increase, in indictable offences in our city.  Personally, I believe that this will be assisted if there is a substantially smaller number of unemployed and if a smaller number of our citizens are compelled to leave home and look for work elsewhere, leaving their children without the guidance and control to which all children are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, may I join with the remarks of Deputy O'Higgins in praising the Minister's predecessor in the excellent work he did in reforming many branches of the law during his period of office.  I should like also to join with Deputy O'Higgins in his remarks in praising the very able officers of the Department for the manner in which the Acts were prepared and the assistance given to Deputies in the presentation of the Bills when they did come before the Dáil.  I hope the Minister will continue the reform of the law which is undoubtedly needed here.  There are many aspects of the law which are archaic.  There are many aspects with which this House would be glad to deal and I hope the Minister will continue the work of law reform instituted by his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain aspects of the administration of the law to which I should like to refer.  The first is the fact that we have an archaic and outmoded system of giving legal aid to poor prisoners.  We have from time to time a number of people who are unable to pay out of their own resources for their defence in the courts.  It seems to me that, while not going as far as the English system at present, this country should introduce a system of free legal aid for prisoners unable to pay for their defence from their own resources.  I would not wish my remarks to be taken in any way as casting any doubts on the manner in which justices and judges behave towards prisoners who are not legally represented, but there can be no doubt that injustice has been done on occasion where prisoners were unable to pay for their defence from their own resources.  We should help people in <Col N="407" /> this position and the system adopted in England, and extended by recent legislation, is that a justice can inquire into the circumstances of a person before him and if satisfied that he is unable to pay for his defence out of his own resources, may order legal aid to be given to him.  I think such a system would greatly assist the proper administration of justice in our courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the incidence of juvenile crime in the country.  There is one aspect of juvenile crime to which I should like the Minister to give particular attention, that is, the state and condition and the circumstances of the remand house here in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is of very great importance that immediate steps be taken to look into the manner in which the children who are remanded in custody, sometimes for a week and sometimes more, are put into custody in a remand house here in Dublin, sometimes with confirmed criminals.  I know of my own personal knowledge of cases of young boys put into the remand house here for a period of a week and sometimes two weeks who have undoubtedly deteriorated, perhaps irrevocably, as a result of the contacts they made in that period.  Obviously it would not be a great financial burden on the State to make proper provision, to have proper houses and proper staff in such circumstances.  It is something to which urgent attention should be given by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect of the Department's activities to which I wish to refer is the Adoption Act.  When the Act was going through the House it was not, I think, contemplated that the number of applications for adoption orders would be as great as it has transpired they are.  It has been proved that there are a number of faults in the existing machinery of the Adoption Act.  I would be glad if the Minister would turn his attention to the work of the Adoption Board in order that the machinery may be perfected.  I think it is proper that praise should be given to the members <Col N="408" /> of the Adoption Board who have done, under very great strain, excellent work under that Act.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is one other matter to which I wish to refer.  It raises larger issues than are contained in this Estimate but I think they are none the less relevant to it.  It seems to me that anything that would bring the two parts of our country, North and South, closer together should be welcomed by the House.  There are a number of aspects of the administration of justice in which we can co-operate with the Northern authorities.  I am referring to a matter to which I have referred before.  It is the issue of writs out of the jurisdiction and also the execution of judgments.  At the present time in the case of a person to be sued in Northern Ireland an application to serve the writ out of jurisdiction has to be made.  At present if judgment has to be executed against a person in Northern Ireland fresh proceedings have to be started in Northern Irelánd to do so.  A similar position obtains in Northern Ireland when somebody in the Republic has to be either proceeded against or judgment obtained against him.</P>
    <P>I can see no objection to an arrangement being arrived at by which the two parts of the country would treat each other as within the jurisdiction of the courts.  It seems to me it would assist materially in the administration of justice if civil bills and summonses could be served directly on defendants in Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa</i> and if sheriffs in Northern Ireland would execute judgments against defendants in Northern Ireland, reciprocity being granted here.  It might be a small thing but it would none the less be a step in the right direction of the recognition of this country as one whole nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask your indulgence, Sir, to say a few words of personal explanation.  During my absence from the House a Deputy from the Labour benches stated that I had been on a deputation to the previous Minister regarding the question of the allocation of Cork prison, now closed, to Cork County Council and that I now <Col N="409" /> am advocating giving the building to University College, Cork.  I wish to say that when I approached the Minister with the deputation from the county council the technical officers of the county council had not examined the prison and pronounced it unsatisfactory and unsuitable for their purposes. The university authorities stated subsequently that it would suit their purposes.  In reply to the Leader of the House I stated I had no hesitation under existing circumstances in advocating that the college authority should get the building but there was no inconsistency in my action in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M. J. O'Higgins Mr. M. J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few matters I want to raise on this Estimate.  I would be glad if the Minister could deal with them in his reply.  In his opening statement the Minister did not give any indication as to whether his Department have been giving consideration to the question of reorganising the Dublin city and county District Court areas.  I understand that for some time past that matter has been receiving attention.  I am not aware of the extent to which it has been receiving active consideration by the Department but I am aware that a scheme was put up to the Department some time ago by the Dublin Solicitors' Bar Association giving their views as to the type of reorganisation which was necessary in the Dublin city and county areas.  I think that the Department have considered the suggestions put up by the association and have conveyed their views on those suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be unduly critical of the Minister for not having dealt with that particular matter in his opening remarks.  I quite appreciate that it is the kind of matter that he personally probably will not get around to considering for some time.  My purpose in raising it is to draw his attention to it.  I think it is a matter which should be dealt with as speedily as possible and should receive the personal attention of the Minister.  Different views will be expressed as to what type of changes, if any, are desirable in the District Court organisation <Col N="410" /> in the city and county areas.  I think it will be generally agreed that some changes are necessary and I would suggest that the Minister, as soon as he can, should take the opportunity of seeing that the matter is put under active consideration in his Department.</P>
    <P>While I wholeheartedly agree with the remarks made by other Deputies regarding the Minister's predecessor in office, Deputy Everett, nevertheless I find myself in the unusual position of agreeing to a large extent with the remarks made by Deputy Moran in connection with the increase in stamp duties which was imposed last year.  I think the increases imposed were definitely too much.  While some increase could have been expected and while it is true that in many cases no increase had been made for a very considerable number of years, nevertheless I feel that the increases which eventually were decided upon were too high.  Deputy Moran criticised these increases strongly.  I must say I have some sympathy with his point of view.</P>
    <P>I want to remind Deputy Moran that he is now in a strong position to get this matter rectified.  He is a member of a Party which, without consultation with any other Party or group in this House, can introduce whatever measures are necessary to alter the position in relation to these fees, and I hope that between now and this time next year, Deputy Moran will have used his efforts and influence in the Government Party to bring about some change.  There is no point in Deputy Moran or anyone else on the Fianna Fáil Benches criticising the action which was taken, if, when they are in a position to remedy the position, they do not make an effort to do so.  I have no doubt that Deputy Moran will himself make the effort and I hope that the Minister will lend him a sympathetic ear, and that if the Minister will not do so, that Deputy Moran will be able to mobilise sufficient support for his point of view among the Deputies sitting behind the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to touch on very briefly is the suggestion to establish a force of women police here.  The Minister was asked a question with regard to it yesterday and I think I <Col N="411" /> am correct in saying that his reply was to the effect that this matter would receive his attention whenever the opportunity arose.  I pressed the Minister to say that he would make an early opportunity of considering the matter and he did not seem inclined to go with me on that.  I merely want to bring this point again to the attention of the Minister because this subject has been hanging fire, if you like, for a number of years.  There is a definite volume of opinion which feels that the establishment of women police here is necessary and that it would, in a number of ways, be beneficial. I think all Parties in the House have had, within the past three or four years, an opportunity of giving the proposition some consideration and I do not think that the Minister should delay unduly in arriving at a decision one way or the other.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy McQuillan said with regard to votes for members of the Garda Síochána.  That is another matter on which I think there is no disagreement among the Parties in the House.  It was discussed in the last Dáil&mdash;I think it was on a motion by Deputy McQuillan&mdash;and that motion was accepted by the then Minister for Local Government.  I think it had the approval of every Deputy who spoke.  I assume this is a matter which does not lie directly within the bailiwick of the Minister for Justice, but, as the member of the Government charged with the direction of the police force, I would ask him to urge on his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, the necessity for implementing what I believe was the decision to give the members of the force votes in general elections and to do that as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the present Minister on a speech he made quite recently&mdash;I think it was on the occasion of the passing-out parade of some new members of the force&mdash;when he referred to the paramount importance of courtesy in the discharge of their duties.  I think the Minister put it this way&mdash;I do not claim to have his exact words and I have not got his speech in front of me&mdash;that when all was said and done, the most important words for the Garda to use were the <Col N="412" /> words &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;.  I think the Minister was quite right in emphasising the necessity for courtesy in the discharge of police duties.  I want to say that, in my own experience, the members of the force, certainly those with whom I or any other member of the public comes in contact, do fulfil in a very full measure the ideal which the Minister set before them.</P>
    <P>I find that, by and large, the members of the force are exceedingly courteous and patient in dealing with the public and carrying out their duties generally, whether it is on traffic duty, in connection with the detection of crime, or dealing with court prosecutions or such matters.  They are very courteous and very patient and it is only right that tribute should be paid to them.  I think it is also right to point out that one short-tempered member of the force can ruin the reputation of the force.  If one member of the force is a bit testy or touchy and inclined to become impatient in dealing with members of the public, a completely false impression of the force as a whole may be given by that one individual. Consequently, I think the Minister was quite right in the line he adopted when addressing the new members of the force.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by joining with other speakers in paying tribute to Deputy Everett's work as Minister for Justice in respect of the various matters of law reform which he undertook and dealt with during his term of office.  I think the Minister will agree with me that the nature of the work which his predecessor undertook was complicated; it was work that was necessary but work which could very easily have been shelved for another few years.  Every member of the House should be grateful to Deputy Everett for the manner in which he dealt with that work during his period of office.</P>

      <P>I wish to say only a few words in relation to the system under which persons are called to serve on juries.  We all know that but for the fact that discretion is exercised by those in authority, very frequently many persons who are called to serve on juries would be obliged to incur both hardships and expenses which <Col N="413" /> could be regarded as very unreasonable, in addition to the fact, of course, that persons so called are frequently excused for health reasons.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to suggest that some system could be adopted whereby persons well fitted to serve could be called, such as retired persons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have many persons who retire at a comparatively early age who would be only too glad to give that service to the public by attending and acting on juries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to hold the House very many minutes.  There are just one or two points I should like to bring before the Minister.  While in the course of my remarks I may appear to be somewhat critical of the methods by which the Garda carry out some of their duties, I should like to preface my remarks by stating quite clearly that, as a police force, I believe our Gardaí are second to none and that on the whole they carry out a very difficult and arduous task in an excellent manner, but my attention was drawn to the fact that in connection with lorries of a certain weight there is a limit of some 30 miles an hour.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that it appears that on the Naas road there are a good many of our police force occupied in following lorries which, because of their new construction and being modern vehicles, cannot be driven in top gear at any lower speed than 40 miles per hour.  These are trailed by police on cycles, waylaid, and, an offence having been committed, are brought into court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that until that law is amended as it will have to be in the near future&mdash;it may not be the business <Col N="415" /> of the Minister to amend it and it is not for me to advocate amending legislation here&mdash;the Minister should instruct the police force to turn the Nelson eye, as it were, to such offences which it is almost impossible not to commit in the present modern lorry.  It is impossible for the ordinary driver to carry on his business successfully without going at least in ordinary top gear which is not, in my opinion, a danger to road traffic at all, but rather the reverse.  If you go slow, you will cause jamming and trouble.  I believe the Minister should use his position to intimate to the Garda that offences of that nature should not be dealt with by prosecution.</P>
    <P>Speaking of road traffic offences, I feel that the Garda are inclined to blame the motorist all the time.  As a motorist of not very long standing, some eight or nine years, I found that most of the accidents or near accidents one observes are caused not so much by motorists themselves as by pedestrians or pedal cyclists.  They seem to believe that they can stand in the middle of the road, or at any corner, or in groups and expect you as a driver to pull out of the traffic lane and usually involve yourself in an accident.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Still they rarely knock down motor cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but just the same they get themselves knocked down and it is the motorist who has to pay fines, insurance and increased premiums due to their carelessness.</P>
      <P>Very rarely have I seen a prosecution brought against a civilian.  It was my good fortune on an occasion to draw the attention of the Garda to a cyclist who almost insisted upon committing suicide by driving across my track.  I asked the Garda to carry out their duties and they did so.  That was one of the very rare occasions upon which a cyclist was fined.  If we had a good deal more of that, we would have more safety on the roads, which is being cried out for by the newspapers but which is not being achieved at all, due to the carelessness of the pedestrians and especially the pedal cyclist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> There is just one other thing I should like to say, in connection with film censoring.  I am altogether of the opinion that we should have a grading of films&mdash;one grading being the adult film which the film censor would consider suitable for adults, but with no admission for children.  There should be a grade one film or a grade A film. I myself would suggest a grade A film, &ldquo;A&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;adult&rdquo;, which would be for adults only.  Let the other films be suitable for adults and children.  In that way, we would impose no hardship on the children.  It would be for their good and I believe they would get better value.  It is a waste of time and money, as well as being morally bad, for children to go in to see passionate love scenes acted by American, British or Irish actors or actresses. Something should be done by the Minister with regard to the grading of films.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself at variance with Deputy Rooney in regard to jurors.  I do not think it would be a good thing to summon only the elderly or retired.  I think there is an analogy between the duties of us all to participate in the administration of justice as there is a duty upon those of us who go into public life.  I sometimes ask myself when I speak at a fair meeting, what am I doing here or why am I thumping a tub and asking the public to vote for me?  It struck me that those of us who undertake that laborious assignment in the sphere of legislating are discharging the same duty as a juror discharges when he participates in the administration of the law.  The juror goes so that we shall have the right to be judged by our peers&mdash;just as a parliamentary candidate goes so that he will make his contribution to secure election in order to avoid the danger of being governed by little men.  Therefore, I think we should all accept the common duty of helping in the administration of justice, substantial as the sacrifice may on occasion be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Really, my primary concern now is to mention two matters relating to children.  I want to second what Deputy Costello said in regard to Marlborough House.  My memory in <Col N="417" /> this matter goes back a great deal beyond that of Deputy Costello.  I began to worry about this business when such children were in Summerhill.  We have made some progress since the famous day when I persuaded the present Taoiseach to go down and pay a visit to Summerhill.  I remember that when he came back, he said that, if his son were a delinquent, he would be very happy to see him in Summerhill.  I could not help feeling on that occasion that he was stretching his conscience a bit, but suffice it to say that, having formed that interesting conclusion, he closed up Summerhill and we moved a step forward into the more commodious premises of Marlborough House.  But premises do not matter so very much. If you have premises of gold and personnel of wood, you are very much worse off than if you have premises of wood and personnel of gold in connection with an institution of that kind.</P>
    <P>Children of all sorts are sent to this remand home.  It is supposed to be a remand home, but a practice has grown up in the children's court that, where the district justice does not believe the circumstances would justify the sending of a child to an industrial school or a reformatory for a protracted period, he adopts the procedure&mdash;legally doubtful, in my opinion&mdash;of sending the child off for a week to Marlborough House. I suppose that, technically, it is said that the child is on remand but, in fact, it is coming to be used as a method of disciplinary action for juvenile delinquency.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sentimentalise this problem.  I can only conceive of a district justice removing a child of tender years from the control of its parents in the event of his being satisfied that remonstrance and rebuke had in the past proved futile.  I cannot imagine a child, guilty of a first offence, being taken from the custody of its parents and sent to Marlborough House or to an industrial school or a reformatory.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that there is strong evidence from our own experience as parents that if a child is turning up repeatedly in the district court, it is highly unlikely that you are not faced in his case with some degree of <Col N="418" /> psychiatric disturbance.  Therefore it behoves the State if it is constrained to remove a child from parental control&mdash;which the State should be very slow to do&mdash;to satisfy itself beyond all doubt that there is not some psychiatric factor in the case which requires correction, so that the child may be delivered from its tendency to delinquency.</P>
    <P>We have in the city at the present time one excellent child guidance clinic and an experienced Order of religious in the Order of St. John of God&mdash;and there may be others&mdash;who concern themselves with psychiatry and child guidance.  Is it unreasonable to suggest that some arrangement should be made whereunder there should be regular examination of the children in Marlborough House by responsible child psychiatrists of that kind, so that where the district justice is dealing finally with the disposition of a child, he will have at his disposal the report of a competent psychiatrist as to the state of the child's mind and, possibly, advice from such an experienced person that the fault is not in the child, him or herself, but in some domestic circumstance which has upset the child and precipitated him into a course of conduct which is bringing him into conflict with the law?</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister to reply categorically to this suggestion now.  All I would ask him to reply to categorically is this.  Would he give an undertaking that at an early date he will ask permission of his colleague, the Minister for Education, to visit Marlborough House&mdash;because the fantastic fact is true that while the Minister for Justice sends the children there, it is the Minister for Education who is responsible for them?  I have no doubt that if the Minister for Justice asks leave of his colleague to visit Marlborough House, it will be given.  I may be wrong, but I look upon the present Minister for Justice as a commonsense type of man, with a humane approach to problems of this kind.  If he would visit the institution himself and examine this problem sympathetically, I feel his influence in the future administration of this establishment would be salutary and good.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" /> The other matter in relation to children is this.  Deputy Larkin spoke of the menace to traffic of the wandering horse.  The wandering horse is usually associated with the tinker encampment.  This is a problem that has confounded more Administrations than one, but I make no more formidable requisition on the Minister than this.  My apprehension is that, if tinkers habitually camp on the side of trunk roads where fast traffic normally passes, the danger to their own children is appalling.  You have a camp fire set and three or four toddlers rambling around it.  Motor cars are passing at high speed.  At any moment these babies may toddle out on to the road and be killed.  I agree that there is a very considerable problem in rural Ireland about the itinerant animals that accompany tinker encampments and the depredation they do on gardens, farmyards, crops and so on. The representation I am making to the Minister for Justice will not abate that nuisance.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister for Justice to remind the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána that he undertook, on more occasions than one, to require tinkers to pitch their camp on by-roads and to abstain from setting-up camp at the side of trunk roads.  The question of dealing with them generally is a complex one.  That is a simple matter.  For two or three years, by a process of tactful persuasion, and perhaps something stronger, the tinkers were persuaded to abstain from setting-up camp at the side of trunk roads.  In the last two or three years the practice of camping by the side of trunk roads has manifested itself very strongly again to the grave danger of the tinkers own children and to the great anxiety of passing traffic.  I would ask the Minister to direct the attention of the Commissioner to that fact and to suggest to him that the Guards be asked once more to persuade these people, when they camp, not to camp at the side of main roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with Deputy Everett in the tribute he paid to the Governor of St. Patrick's Home on the North Circular Road to which <Col N="420" /> the borstal boys from Clonmel have been transferred.  Wonderful work is being done in that institution.  It was not possible in Clonmel, because of the small number of inmates, to give the training in technical education it was originally intended to give to these boys.  There were not enough inmates in Clonmel to enable the establishment there to be run on the lines on which it should have been run.  Most of the boys committed to Clonmel were from the cities, mainly from Dublin City, and a grave hardship was imposed on parents who were forced to journey to Clonmel, at considerable expense, to visit these boys.</P>
      <P>In relation to dealing with boys, especially boys remanded to Marlborough House, I would like to inform Deputy Dillon, who raised the matter, that justices in the District Court and in the Children's Court are entitled to have the children who appear before them examined by a psychiatrist.  They can have that examination carried out as often as they deem it necessary and the State pays the fees involved. From that point of view the children's welfare is reasonably safeguarded.  The necessary advice is available and the recommendations of the psychiatrist are always implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a distinct recollection over a long number of years of the Deputy debating this particular question.  I remember Deputy Boland having many a discussion with the Deputy across the floor of this House.  Indeed, it may have been as a result of these discussions that the Borstal was eventually established in Clonmel.  I think I am right in that. Within the last few days I have myself seen evidence of the magnificent work that is being done in relation to the boys incarcerated there: I have seen letters commending the head of that establishment, letters from the parents of boys who have been released and who have been put into excellent employment.  The parents are deeply grateful to the head there because of the change that has taken place in these children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a case made in regard to law reform.  Within the limits of time, and so forth, I will do all that is possible in that regard.  There is quite a volume of legislation almost ready for presentation to the Government.  Until the opportunity arises of presenting that legislation, we cannot get on with the drafting of the Green Paper.  I have seen three different Bills ready for presentation.  I am concerned with the fact that I have introduced, or, rather, reintroduced a Bill in relation <Col N="422" /> to reversionary leases.  That Bill, I have been informed, got its Second Reading and was then committed to a Special Committee.  That Special Committee met once or twice at most. That Bill has now been reintroduced. It is quite possible that will mean another Special Committee.  If that Special Committee is appointed and I am to be present at it, it will mean the giving of more valuable time as far as I am concerned.  Until that gets through, I cannot see a whole lot of use in securing the First Reading of the Bills to which the Deputy has referred.</P>

      <P>I do say that I recognise, not only the necessity, but the desirability of doing whatever we can in respect of that reform and I can say that as far as I am concerned I will do everything that I understand the other Minister was also prepared to do.</P>
      <P>The question of the vote for Gardaí was raised.  I would venture to say that if it were a question of putting that to the House there would almost be unanimity in respect to it.  If it rested with me to give the Gardaí a vote, I could see no reason why they should not have a vote.  The members of the Army have a vote and they are as strong a force as the Garda.  From the point of view of their official duties, I personally cannot see any reason why they should not have the vote and if it were left to me to give them the vote it would be almost assured.  I do not know who would be responsible for making that provision or whether legislation would be necessary but, as the matter has been raised, I will take the opportunity of bringing it before the Government with a view to finding out who is responsible and if they will be prepared to change the present position to what in my opinion it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan started his speech by picking out one of the sub-heads&mdash; sub-head K&mdash;which he described at some length and rather dramatically, I would say, and referred to £40 which is provided for the purpose of providing <Col N="423" /> a hangman.  The position is that so long as capital punishment is part of the criminal law of this country it will always be necessary to provide that sum and we cannot do it secretly.  If the Deputy wanted us to take it out of the Estimates and find the amount out of secret service moneys or something else, that cannot be done.  There-fore, as long as capital punishment is in operation in this country it will be necessary to provide that sum in the event of its being necessary.</P>

      <P>If Deputy McQuillan would use his best endeavours to prevent people murdering other people, then we could easily eliminate the particular sub-head, but until we reach the happy stage that we will not have to try people for that crime I am afraid the sub-head will have to appear unless, of course, the House decides, as it might, that capital punishment should no longer operate here.  Until that day comes the sub-head will have to be retained.</P>

      <P>The fact that we have been able to close at least three prisons is a step forward for this country.  We should pat ourselves on the back for that fact.  I do not suppose there is another nation in the world that is in the happy position of being able to close prisons.  If there has been an increase in crime it is the type of crime that does not involve capital punishment.  It is quite possible <Col N="424" /> that crime comes in waves or cycles and it is hoped that the volume of crime, which is more of the larceny type than any other dangerous type, will also abate.  As far as the Garda Síochána are concerned, they are fully aware of the desirability of preventing a development of crime and are applying themselves to bringing about a reduction in that type of crime.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan raised the question of the Teevan Report.  I have not got that report.  I have not seen the report.  Until the report is submitted to the Government, Deputies will realise that I can do nothing about it.</P>

I do not know whether my predecessor saw it or not. I could not say whether he did or not. I am merely telling the House what the actual position is.  Deputy McGilligan is anxious to know what is happening in respect to it and what action the Government are taking, and I am just making the statement now that I have not seen the report and that, therefore, it can hardly have been presented to the Government.</P>

      <P>The question of reorganising the district court circuits was also raised.  Deputy Moran raised it and it was supported by Deputy O'Higgins.  Is that right?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are taking up the question of the reorganisation of all circuits with a view to reducing the number, in other words, extending the present circuits and reducing the number of district justices.  That is being gone on with at the present moment.  It will take some considerable time.  Numbers of people will have to be consulted and advised, and so on, and asked for their views and that sort of thing and until that is completed, which will probably take a period of some months, we cannot do any more. That is the position in regard to the reorganisation of the District and Circuit Court districts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran referred to the alleged corruption of the Gardaí.  All I can say on that is that if I get evidence I will have it inquired into.  A mere statement in the House is not sufficient for me to take action.  If the Deputy is prepared to give me concrete evidence that such a thing is taking place, we can have the matter examined with a view to taking action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moran also referred to the delay in the discharge of equities.  The work in connection with the discharge of equities has improved and the applications on hand on the 31st December, 1955 numbered 870.  In 1956 they numbered 820&mdash;that was a reduction&mdash;and on the 31st March, 1957, it had been reduced to 140.  That should satisfy Deputy Moran that some improvements are being made.</P>
      <P>On the matter of legal aid, I think Deputy Costello raised that question. I understand that this matter has been taken up on a number of occasions and it has always fallen down for some reason or another.  I do not know what the reasons are, but it did not appear to work.  I know that there are some charitable organisations prepared to give legal aid to prisoners who are unable to pay for it themselves.</P>
      <P>The question of the increased fees was raised and complaint was made about excessive fees which had recently been enforced.  Personally, I think that all legal fees are excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M. J. O'Higgins Mr. M. J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>These are not legal fees: these are stamp duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only saying that I regard law costs as being very heavy on the ordinary man who has to enter into litigation of one kind or another. Then we have the complaint that the additional fees have added excessively to that.  As far as I can see, the fact is that, from the point of view of the litigant the fees, even though they have been increased, will still represent but a small fraction of the typical bill of costs.  Their impact on the cost of litigation is negligible and from the point of view of the State and the tax-payer there will still be a substantial deficit to be made up.  In the circuit court, for instance, as will be seen on page 155 of the Volume of Estimates, <Col N="427" /> the total expenditure is estimated at £212,000, whereas the estimated receipts, which take account of the new fees, come only to £59,700.  That is a big deficit.</P>
      <P>It is clear, therefore, that the new Fees Orders do not mean a denial of the principle that the cost of litigation, even private litigation, should and must be subsidised by the State. They do represent an effort to strike a fairer balance between the litigant and the taxpayer.  For many years the taxpayer has had to bear the brunt of every increase in the cost of the courts. The litigant is now being asked to pay his share in future.  What he is being asked to bear is still a very small sum compared with the total cost of going to court and certainly would not prevent anyone who would otherwise do so from taking a case to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M. J. O'Higgins Mr. M. J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on what case you are considering.  I do not think you can get a typical bill of costs.  I do not think you could take a bill of costs and say it is a typical one.  It might be typical in relation to a particular sphere&mdash;a running-down action or something of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be agreed that there is a big deficit between the two and that the ordinary taxpayer should not be asked to pay the difference between the two.  While this does not in fact make much impact on the costs at all, it is an effort, I suppose, to get in some extra money towards the expenses of the courts and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position and I do not think that I would be prepared to alter it.  I do not know that it is going to affect matters.  I hardly imagine that it will affect litigation. It is not going to prevent people from going to court or prevent lawyers or solicitors from getting the fees they are getting at the present time.</P>

      <P>The Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare for 1957-58 which I am now submitting to Dáil Éireann are three in number. They are as follows: No. 60&mdash;Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, £474,700; No. 61&mdash;Social Insurance, £3,655,000; No. 62&mdash;Social Assistance, £18,539,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These estimates total £22,668,700. This is £132,500 less than the total provision made for the previous year, including the large Supplementary Estimate for Social Insurance which was taken in this House on the 26th of <Col N="434" /> last month.  This Supplementary Estimate was not completed in time for inclusion in the Book of Estimates for 1957-58.  The Estimate for Vote 61, Social Insurance, for 1957-58 is accordingly compared in the printed volume with the original Estimate for 1956-57. When compared with the total Estimate for that year (including the Supplementary Estimate) the Estimate for Vote 61 for 1957-58 shows a decrease of £72,000.</P>
    <P>The amounts of the Estimates for Social Insurance (£3,655,000) and for Social Assistance (£18,539,000) do not give an immediate reflection of the relative size of the expenditures on the two main types of social welfare services.  This is because the Social Insurance Vote provides only for the State subvention to the social insurance scheme established under the Social Welfare Act of 1952.  This subvention is paid into the Social Insurance Fund, out of which are paid the benefits provided under the Act and the cost of administration of these benefits.  The Vote for Social Assistance, on the other hand, covers the actual cost of the benefits provided by way of old age and widows' and orphans' pensions, children's allowances, etc., under the schemes of social assistance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Estimate for Social Insurance, the estimated expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund on insurance benefits and their administration in 1957-58 is approximately £10,469,000.  This amount is made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>On the income side of the fund, receipts are estimated at £6,851,000 made up of £6,286,000 in employment contributions by insured workers and their <Col N="435" /> employers and £565,000 in income from the investments of the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>The difference between the expenditure of £10,469,000 and the income of £6,851,000, that is, £3,618,000, is the amount that has to be made good by the Exchequer in respect of fund transactions in 1957-58.  To this sum is added a small adjustment of £2,000 due from the Exchequer in respect of late payments under the former National Health Insurance Scheme.  The total sum to be provided by the State in accordance with Section 39 (9) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, to cover the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund for 1957-58 is accordingly £3,620,000 and this is the sum provided in sub-head A of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>In general, the estimates for expenditure and income of the Social Insurance Fund are higher than in the preceding year.  They include provision for a whole year for the higher rates of contributions and benefits introduced in September last under the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1956, while the corresponding provision in 1956-57 was for only seven months.  The provision for unemployment benefit is, however, an exception to this, being lower by £188,000 than the amount provided for 1956-57.  This is due to the fact that some improvement in the employment position is looked for in the current year.</P>
    <P>As regards the Social Assistance Vote, there is a decrease of £100,000 in the provision for old age pensions. This is mainly attributable to the fact that the number of pensions provided for in 1956-57 proved to be too great. The full amount voted for that year was not expended and it is accordingly expected that the amount required in 1957-58 for old age and blind pensions will be less than the amount provided in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions is less by £72,000 than the provision for last year.  This follows the normal trend in connection with widows' and orphans' pensions.  Each year expenditure on the non-contributory pensions normally falls while the cost of contributory pensions increases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> As regards unemployment assistance, the provision for 1957-58 is higher by £131,000 than the previous year's Estimate. The reason for this increase is not that the number of persons unployed is expected to be greater in 1957-58 than it was in the previous year but that the number in receipt of unemployment assistance is expected to be greater owing to the interval which occurs between increased unemployment and its impact on expenditure on unemployment assistance.  The interval arises from the fact that an unemployed worker who is normally entitled to unemployment benefit must first exhaust that right before becoming eligible for unemployment assistance. The effect of this factor on last year's expenditure was to throw the main burden of the cost of increased unemployment on the benefit scheme, while leaving expenditure on the unemployment assistance scheme not much higher than originally provided for.</P>
    <P>In the current year, however, a large number of persons who drew unemployment benefit in 1956-57 may be expected to have exhausted their right to that benefit and accordingly to require unemployment assistance.  For this reason, expenditure on unemployment assistance in 1957-58 may be considerably higher than in 1956-57 without any comparable worsening in the unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>The only other significant change in this Estimate on which I need comment is an increase of £60,000 in the provision for children's allowances.  This is due to a rise in the number of qualified children which is a normal feature of this service for several years past.</P>

      <P>This being the Estimate prepared by the previous Government, I do not think there is much necessity or much use in my speaking at length on it.  When a Minister pays tribute to the staff which works under him, Deputies are inclined to be suspicious and the Minister gives the impression sometimes that he is being put on the defensive.  I should like to place on record my appreciation of the tremendous assistance that was given to me during my short term as Minister for Social Welfare by the secretary, the assistants and every other <Col N="437" /> member of the staff.  Too often our civil servants are subjected to criticism and, I should say, as one who presided over a Department, in the main, unfair criticism.</P>
      <P>In this Department, the Department of Social Welfare, the secretary and the staff are called upon to deal with very intricate personal problems of which I think the ordinary public do not seem to have an appreciation and which they do, not once a day but thousands of times a day in their dealings with many hundreds of thousands of the public.  I want to say that during my short term as Minister for Social Welfare they did their work excellently. In that respect, I might say that many people are under the impression that, if we cut away from the Department of Social Welfare a lot of the staff, we could increase the benefits to a very great extent.  I pointed out in the last three years, and Ministers for Social Welfare before me pointed out, the relatively small costs of administration in the Department of Social Welfare, which is spending this year a total of something like £22,000,000.</P>
      <P>Some of the criticising public do not seem to realise that the administrative expenses are indeed extremely small when one has regard to the total expenditure of over £22,000,000.  I stand to be corrected, but I think the administrative expenses would amount to something like 5 per cent. of the total cost, representing in money something a little over £1,000,000.  I do not think that is bad at all for, as I say, a Department which has to deal with so many hundreds of thousands of problems in respect of the individual, day after day, month after month and throughout the whole year.  Invariably because the Department deals with so many individuals, there will be criticisms about delays and about mistakes which are inevitable, but again I would say that in my experience&mdash; and the Parliamentary Secretary knows this from past experience&mdash;the percentage of errors and delays is very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I noticed particularly in the general election speeches&mdash;I am referring to them because in the <Col N="438" /> general election campaign we are supposed to get some indication as to the general attitude of Parties in respect of different things&mdash; there was a remarkable absence of comment from the now Government Party about social welfare.  It will be no reply to me to say: &ldquo;Well, the Fianna Fail Party were the Party who initiated this scheme, that scheme and the other scheme.  We were the Party who introduced the comprehensive scheme of social insurance in 1952.&rdquo; Granted they did a tremendous amount in that respect, that they did introduce the comprehensive code of social insurance in 1952, that is not sufficient.  I agree that is the basis of social insurance, social welfare and social assistance generally in this country, but there is a demand and naturally will be a demand for increases to be kept in step with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Many Ministers for Social Welfare and other Ministers indeed have had occasion to complain about the way they were treated by the Government, through the Minister for Finance.  Let me say, as a member of the Labour Party, that in the three years during which I was Minister for Social Welfare, I was not treated ungenerously and practically every single section which was dependent on social welfare benefits or social assistance benefited in some way.  The old age pensioners benefited; those who were sick, those who were unemployed, those who were in receipt of widows' contributory pensions and non-contributory pensions, benefited.  I think it would be true to say that in every Budget that was introduced in the three years during which we had an inter-Party Government, there was an improvement made in the social welfare and social assistance services, and I trust that will be repeated.</P>
    <P>The first task was to give the old age pensioners an increase, and that was done.  It was a small increase, but it cost £1,000,000.  I do not feel it is appropriate that we should discuss a Department like the Department of Social Welfare before the Budget.  I assume the present Minister for Social Welfare and the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="439" /> are endeavouring to get from the Government or from the Minister for Finance some more assistance for people who, most of the country believe, deserve it, that is, the old age pensioners.  Of course, it is all very well for Deputies and for members of the public to talk about the old age pensioners.  If we want to do something for the old age pensioners, we should also be prepared to pay what-ever increase in taxation is necessary for the benefit of those people.</P>
    <P>I think I mentioned during my term as Minister that I thought it might be desirable if there were to be a special section in the Budget for these people who are dependent on social assistance, and I stress social assistance recipients. I am not thinking about those who are unemployed, those in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance or sickness benefit, or widows' and orphans' contributory pensions.  I am speaking about these people about whom it is established that they cannot fend for themselves, people who have no income whatsoever, old age pensioners, people who are on the dole and those in receipt of widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions.  If there is a special section in the Budget to raise money for these classes then people clamouring for an increase for old age pensioners will pay the increase in taxation in the knowledge that it will be applied to old age pensioners, widows and orphans and to the unfortunate man who has neither stamps nor benefit and is dependent on unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>People talk about a big increase for old age pensioners.  Some say the pension should be 30/&ndash;, 35/&ndash; or £2.  One must realise, and I know that Deputies do realise, that the miserable 2/6d. costs £1,000,000 and that that represents something like 6d. in the £ on income-tax and a substantial increase&mdash;I think 6d.&mdash;in the price of the packet of cigarettes.  I mention that to give people an appreciation of what it means to give even a miserable 2/6d. to the old age pensioners.  There has been, I think, a deliberate campaign by some Deputies in this House and by <Col N="440" /> a lot of people in the country to carry out an unfair campaign against unemployed people.  They would give the impression that the tens of thousands of unemployed are wasters who would not work if they got work.  My experience is that in the registered number of unemployed we have a hard core who are not alone unemployed but unemployable.  They are people who believe they can work but who would not be accepted by employers.  They are not sick, but they may be mentally sick, I do not mean to say they are insane.  They have not worked for years and as a result they are unemployable. In my opinion there are something like 20,000 of these people.  The vast majority of the rest are people who are genuinely seeking work and who want to work.</P>
    <P>I would say also that there is a certain number of people who are just robbing the Social Insurance Fund, robbing the taxpayer by getting dole under false pretences.  The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary should, and I know they will, with the co-operation of the officials, see that those people will not get away with the loot from either the Social Insurance Fund or the money contributed by the taxpayer that is paid out in unemployment assistance.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is not in a position to answer certain matters which I have raised but I would ask him to try to ensure that the free fuel scheme and the free footwear scheme will be retained.  I fully appreciate that these schemes were introduced as emergency schemes but they have now come to be regarded as essential services for certain families who look forward, in October and November, to the granting of one, two or three pairs of shoes or boots to their families. They are people who are not in a position to pay for the footwear themselves. The free fuel scheme for old age pensioners and widows and orphans has also come to be regarded as a scheme which automatically comes into operation in November.  It was, as I say, also an emergency scheme but is now part and parcel of the economy of these people who are not in a good financial position.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I wish the Minister <Col N="441" /> and the Parliamentary Secretary well in their offices and ask them to continue the improvements which I believe took place in the last three years. There are many things we did not get around to doing.  There is the question of retirement pensions and I know that it occupies the attention of many officers in the Department.  I trust it will not be lost sight of.  I think the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary would find that the introduction of such a scheme would, in a reasonably short time, have the effect of reducing the bill for the payment of old age pensions which is a tremendous sum of money at present and amounts to £10,000,000 or £11,000,000.  The rehabilitation of the blind and the provision of work for people at present in institutions for the blind have also progressed to a certain point.  I see from certain reports in the newspapers that the Minister has more or less decided to carry on and further the initial moves that have been made, in order to provide work for, and rehabilitate these people.  That is all I want to say at the moment because I appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary's introductory speech is purely a factual account of the Estimates now before us.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish has referred to abuses that are well known in regard to stamping of cards in order to get unemployment assistance. He also referred to the work being done in the Department to try to put an end to that.  There have always been certain abuses in insurance and they were very often experienced in national health services in the old days.  To eradicate them completely is a very difficult matter.  We want, in addition to officials doing their best in this matter, the co-operation of the public.  The employers also have a responsibility in handing up cards and seeing that a person produces his card when he goes for employment.  It is very necessary, therefore, for everyone <Col N="442" /> to help to create a public opinion to put an end to the abuses.  When Deputy Corish was Minister, I made a representation in this matter and he was very helpful, but I think it is felt on all sides of the House that unless we create a public opinion to fight these abuses that the help of the officials and the Guards will not eradicate such abuses.  It is in everybody's interest, that of the contributors, the employers and the State to do this.</P>
      <P>Another point which I wish to make is that to stand for economy in this State does not mean that one is against public officials.  We know the value of the Irish Civil Service and of the very high standard that they have brought to bear, and bring to bear, on public administration, but if a Government stands for economy&mdash;and we stand for economy&mdash;it does not mean that we do not appreciate the work done by the Civil Service.  We have to take into account the interests of the people who elected us here and who have to pay for the services and their capacity to pay for them.  Comparative figures for business firms in regard to the cost of administration do not bear on the subject at all.  If we can have these services administered at 2½ per cent. or 2 per cent. we shall do so.  Under a previous Minister for Social Welfare, under whom I served and who introduced one of the most generous forms of legislation in the whole of Europe, we carried out substantial economies and a good investigation into the Department of Social Welfare.  The effects of these investigations and of these economies and of the work done at that time are being felt this year.  If the Minister and the Government find that more economies can be made without hurting anybody, then we shall make them.</P>
      <P>As regards the other point about the increase in social benefits, we have to take into account the capacity of the community to bear the burden.  We have to cut the cloth according to our measure.  That will be our criterion in any approach to this matter.  As the members of the former Government know, the economic position is not a healthy one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have a code of social welfare <Col N="443" /> laws as good as any country in Europe.  We were pioneers in many things before they were known on the other side of the water.  Such things as widows' and orphans' pensions came to Britain only in later years, but I shall not go into that now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the amount of (a) corporation profits tax and (b) income-tax collected from shipping concerns in the last financial year for which such information is available.</P>

      <P>The number of Irish shipping companies is so small that to supply the information asked for would not, I fear, accord with the principle of observing secrecy in relation to the taxation affairs of taxpayers.  For that reason, I regret that I cannot give the information requested by the Deputy.</P>

    <P>The statement does not include (a) one case which is the subject of negotiations for voluntary purchase; it would be a breach of confidence to disclose particulars of it at this stage, or (b) certain cases in which detailed reports have been called for by the commissioners.  Since, in some of these cases, no proceedings may be started, it would be unfair to owners to draw undue attention to them.</P>
