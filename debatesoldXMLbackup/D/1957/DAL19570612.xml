    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Miss Hogan Miss Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the fact that 15,000 tons of least suitable Irish wheat bought at the subsidised price last harvest have been disposed of for animal feed, he will take steps to ensure that flour millers now use more than 66? per cent.  Irish wheat in the grist in order to avoid the danger of a larger surplus next year and to lessen storage difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the wheat crop of 1956 was being harvested, an undertaking was given to the flour-millers by the then Government that, if they bought all potentially millable wheat offered to them, sufficient quantities of imported wheat would be made available to provide a grist suitable for their requirements.  The millers <Col N="555" /> maintain that a minimum proportion of one-third imported wheat must be admixed with wheat of the 1956 harvest to provide a grist of suitable quality, and in view of the undertaking given to them I have not taken any steps to force them to make up a grist which contains a larger percentage of native wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not open to the Minister to request the flour-millers to filter any surplus of this year's crop into the grist next year, as was done in 1955 when a similar situation obtained? Is the Minister aware that, after the bad harvest of 1954, we had to give a substantial quantity of hard wheat in order to carry the damaged wheat of our own harvest but that the resultant surplus was filtered into the grist in the following year and was all successfully used for conversion into flour?  Exactly the same situation obtains at present.  I do not think I am wrong in saying that there was a clear understanding that, while millers would be helped to use the produce of last year's crop, they would be expected to follow the 1955 procedure and filter any carry-over into next year's grist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a somewhat different question.  While it is undoubtfully desirable that the maximum percentage of native wheat should be used by millers now there still will be a substantial carry-over of wheat when the harvest of this year comes in.  It is necessary, in order to facilitate the handling of that harvest, to dispose of as much of the existing stocks of wheat as possible before then.  While I agree that it is open to me to make representations to the millers to use a higher percentage of native wheat, I do not feel I am in a position, because of the undertakings given to them, to make an Order requiring them to use a higher percentage of native wheat of the 1956 harvest than they themselves consider to be practicable.  It should be possible&mdash;indeed, I think it is possible&mdash;to increase the present percentage somewhat but the tonnage of wheat involved, in the period now remaining of the cereal year, would not <Col N="556" /> make a substantial difference to the carry-over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with any understanding entered into with the millers about the percentage to be used in the grist at the present time, there was a clear ancillary understanding that any surplus would be carried over into the next year and filtered into the grist during the next year.  If representations are being made to the Minister to the effect that the millers should be permitted to use a grist, without any ancillary agreement, the represents tions are not correct.  There was a clear understanding that any surplus wheat would be carried over and filtered into the following year's wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In other circumstances that would be a practicable arrangement.  Notwithstanding all the 1956 wheat we can get the millers to use between this and the harvest, together with the disposal of a certain amount of the surplus for animal feeding, there will still be an exceptionally large carry-over which may create storage problems later when the much larger harvest of this year comes to hand.</P>

      <P>For purposes of clarity in replying to the Deputy's question, it is necessary to consider three separate groups of patients eligible for services under the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a patient is admitted to a public ward in an approved hospital at the request of a health authority, the payment made by the health authority to the hospital covers the complete liability in respect of all in-patient services including medical, nursing, pharmacy and X-ray, for such patient. The patient is not liable to the hospital or any member of the hospital staff in respect of any charge.  In the case of patients from Dublin City and County who make their own arrangements for admission to public wards in Dublin voluntary hospitals, and from Cork City who make their own arrangements for admission to public wards in Cork voluntary hospitals, the health <Col N="563" /> authority concerned deem such patients as having been admitted at their request, and they are included in this category accordingly.</P>
    <P>When a patient makes his own arrangements for admission to a public ward in an approved hospital and is not &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to have been admitted to the hospital at the request of the health authority, the hospital is entitled to require such patient to pay to the hospital a sum of 6/- a day and this payment of 6/- a day by the patient, together with the appropriate payment by the health authority, covers the complete liability in respect of all services rendered by the hospital and its staff.  The hospital or its staff is not entitled to recover from the patient any sum in excess of the 6/- mentioned.</P>
    <P>Where, however, a patient does not enter a public ward but avails of semiprivate or private accommodation in a hospital (or in a nursing home), the health authority pays to the hospital (or home) a contribution&mdash;in general 12/- a day&mdash;towards the charges and the patient is liable for the excess of the charges of the hospital (or home). including charges for such items as pharmacy, X-rays, etc., over the health authority payment and for any medical fees involved.</P>

These taxes, it will be appreciated, form portion only of the taxes and duties entrusted to the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  The cost of the Revenue Commissioners' Office is not apportioned over the various items of revenue collected.  Many officers engaged in the administration and collection of income-tax, surtax and corporation profits tax are concerned with other work as well as and accordingly it would not be possible to segregate, from other expenditure, the cost appropriate to these taxes solely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 24, 25 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> Mr. Ó Leannain's resignation was called for because it appeared to the Government, on consideration of the report of the judicial inquiry, that it had been clearly established that his conduct, on the occasion which was the subject of the inquiry, was calculated to bring the law into contempt and was inconsistent with the obligation to uphold the Constitution of the State and its laws which Mr. Ó Leannain assumed when making and subscribing the Declaration set forth in Article 34.  5 of the Constitution, and was conduct warranting his removal from office, in the manner prescribed by Article 35 of the Constitution, in the event of his being unwilling to tender his resignation on being asked to do so.</P>
    <P>That the judge was of opinion that Mr. Ó Leannain's misbehaviour was not such as to warrant his removal from office is beside the point, since it does not rest with the judge appointed to hold an inquiry of the kind to decide whether or not the two Houses of the Oireachtas should be moved to take action as the result of his report, still less to determine, with respect to the misconduct of a justice, whether such misconduct amounts to misbehaviour warranting his removal from office as I am aware the judge himself fully realises.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with the suggestion that it is a waste of time to have the facts judicially determined, where the conduct of a justice is in a question and the facts are in dispute, though I am bound to say that it does not appear to me that there was ever any doubt about the facts in this case as the misconduct occurred in open court.</P>
    <P>Moreover, so far am I from agreeing that confidence in the administration of justice is likely to suffer from the action taken that I think the public mind, which has been greatly disturbed, has been much reassured and that the public would have just cause for complaint if misconduct of this kind were to be passed over or condoned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of creating a standard holding depends primarily on the price paid for the land, the cost of erecting building and the extent to which development is necessary as regard roads, fences, water supply, etc.  These vary from estate to estate and give rise to different constings.  On the other hand, there is seldom much variation in the cst of creating standard holding on a particular estate. Consequently and as the allottees of the holdings in question are readily identifiable, I would not be justified in giving the precise information sought. It may meet the Deputy's requirements, however, to know that the approximate average cost, including adminstrative costs, of creating the 32 standard holding allotted last spring under the Group Migration Scheme was £4,110, of which £683 is repayable be way of annuity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As everyone knows, Land Commission allotments are of substantial <Col N="575" /> value and they are given on moderate repayment terms to the allottees.  To cater for the greatest number with the funds available,, it has been decided to require allottees to co-operate with the Land Commission by making reasonable contributions, in labour and materials, towards the imporvement of their allotments.</P>
    <P>Inclusive of the price of the land and expense of improvements and administration, the cost of ordinary allotments works out, on average, at about £48 an acre of which only £12 is repayable, the allottee's annunity being halved.  In effect, therefore, allottees benefit from the Exchequer to the extent of about £42 an acre.  To minimise expense, it is surely not unreasonable to encourage allottees to help with the improvement works on their allotments.</P>

      <P>The pier at Clogherhead, County Louth, is in the charge of the Louth County Council, which is responsible for its maintenance and repair.  The council has intimated to my Department that the structure is believed to be now unsound and that there may be need for complete reconstruction. In view of fact that there is also a local demand for improvement, as distinct from repair, of the pier, a general inspection of the harbour conditions has been arranged for and will be carried out as early as practicable.</P>

      <P>The regulations for the recognition or continued recognition of national schools require that a suitable fireguard be provided therein for each open fireplace and that adequate protection against burning or scalding be offorded in cases where stoves or other heating apparatus are used.</P>

      <P>A circular was issued in October, 1953, to all managers of national schools requesting them to make arrangements to ensure that all fires in schools are properly extinguished before the premises are vacated for the day.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As members of the House are aware, the main purpose of the Bill is to incorporate in legislation the Financial Resolution passed by the Dáil on Budget and to make ligislative provision, where that is necessary, for the other budgetary proposals announced, apart from those for which separate legislation has been promoted, that is, increase in social assistance payments and in children's allowances and also the increase in certain charges and the imposition of new charges in connection with the health services.  The Bill also contains <Col N="592" /> a number of additional provisions which were not mentioned in the Budget and I shall explain these as I go along.  I propose to go through the sections and, in a general way, to outline their contents and purpose.</P>
      <P>Section 1 is the customary section imposing income tax and surtax for 1957-58 and continuing previous enactments. It corresponds to Financial Resolution NO. I Passed on Budget Day.</P>
      <P>Section 2 increase by 25 per cent. the existing wear and tear rates on plant and machinery (other than vehicles), with effect as from the year 1958-59.</P>
      <P>Section 3 provides a tax relief where a person contracts to make annual payments to a university or college in the State, for a minimum period of three years, for the purpose of enabling the university or college to carry on research.</P>
      <P>Section 4 is designed to give effect to the proposal by the Industrial Credit Company, Limited, that the relief under Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, should be extended to all securities issued to the public&mdash;and, subject to coditions, to securities otherwise issued&mdash;by Irish manufacturing concern since 1932.  The relief, which is a tax remission of 20 per cent. on dividends and interest from the securities to which Section 7 applies, will, in so far as it relates to securities now being brought within the scope of the provisions, be granted with effect as from the 6th April, 1958.</P>
      <P>Section 5 gives effect, for income-tax purposes, to the Budget proposal (a) to increase from 50 per cent, to 100 per cent. the tax relief in respect of profits from increased exports of manufactured goods and (b) to grant an alternative tax relief of 25 per cent. in respect of profits from exports of manufactured goods.  The provisions will take effect as from the year 1958-59.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 empowers the Minister for Finance to direct that interest on stocks which may be issued for public subscription by Bord na Móna may be paid without deduction of income-tax. Tax on the interest will be assessable <Col N="593" /> upon the entitled receiving or entitled to it.</P>
    <P>Section 7 and the Schedule increase the rates of customs and excise duties on tobacco.  The main rate of customs duty on unmanufactured leaf of raised by 3/2 the l. from £2 2s. 9d. to £2 5s. 11d. the lb. and the various other rates are increased correspondingly. The section also provides for an increase in the rates of rebate allowed on hard-pressed tobacco, (viz, plug, roll, twist, coil and bar) from 12/4 to 12/10 the lb.</P>
    <P>Section 8 impose a special excise duty of 3/2 the lb. on duty-paid stocks of tobacco held by tobacco manufactures at 5 p.m. on 8th May, 1957, and provides for deferment of payment of this duty to 1st January, 1958.</P>
    <P>Section 9 increase the customs and excise duties on beer.  The main rate, i.e. the rate of excise duty on homemade beer, is raised from £9 4s. 6d. to £10 5s. 6d. the standard barrel, that is by £1 1s.  The custom rates are increase correspondingly.</P>
    <P>Section 10 increases the rate of customs duty on mineral hydrocarbon light oil (petrol) from 2/3¼ to 2/9¼ the gallon and the rate of customs duty on other oil (mainly diesel) when used in road motor vechicles from 1/8 to 2/2 the gallon but excludes from the latter increase diesel oil used in buses operating on licensed passenger services. Corresponding charges are made in the rates of excise by on petrol and diesel.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for repayment of any custom or exicse duty paid on hydrocarbon (heavy) oils which are received unused by a manufacture of hydrocarbon oil and used by him as material for further manufacture.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides new rates of entertainments duty in the case of cinemas.</P>
    <P>Section 13 makes certain amendmetns, which experience has shown to be desirable, in the provisions of Section 17 of the Finance Act, 1936, relating to the admission free duty of household effects imported on transfer of residence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> Section 14 confirms the three Emergency Imposition of Duties Orders relating to the Special Imports Levies which were made in April, 1957.  These Orders abolished the Special Import Levies on a number of articles and also provided for the grant, in certain circumstances, of licences for the importation of goods free of the levies.  The Orders also provided for certain changes in the duties on unprinted paper and on aggregates of parts of motor cars imported for assembly in this county.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that, in the case of stocks etc. which are now, by section 4 of the Bill, being brought within the provision of Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, the corresponding relief from Estate Duty in respect of such stocks, etc., under Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1956, will not be granted expect in respect of the death of a person dying on or after the 6th day April, 1958.</P>
    <P>Section 16, gives effect, for Corporation Profits tax purposes, to the Budget proposal (a) to increase fro, 50 per cent. to 100 per cent, the tax relief in respect of profits from increased exports of manufactured goods and (b) to grant an alternative tax relief of 25 per cent. in respect of profits from exports of manufactured goods.  The provisions will take effect as from the year 1958/59.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the granting of an investment allowance of 40 per cent. on capital expenditure incurred on or after the 6th April, 1957, on the purchase of a new ship for the purposes of a trade.</P>
    <P>Section 18 enacts that the investment allowance will not be taken into account in computing the annual deductions allowable in respect of wear and tear.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the &ldquo;carry-forward&rdquo; on an investment allowance (or part thereof) when there are not sufficient profits to enable full effect to be given to the allowance in any one year.</P>
    <P>Section 20 is a technical provision defining the &ldquo;basis period&rdquo; by reference <Col N="595" /> to which the investment allowance is to be granted.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for the withdrawl of the investment allowance, and the substitution therefor of an initial allowance, in any casae where the ship is sold without having been used or before the expiration of five years from the day on which it begins to be used.</P>
    <P>Section 22 makes provision for an investment allowance for purpose of Corporation Profits Tax where such an allowance is being made in computing Income-tax.</P>
    <P>Section 23 is a construction section.</P>
    <P>Section 24 authorises the making of arrangements in certain cases for the payment, by way of composition, of the Stamp Duty chargeable on receipts.</P>
    <P>Section 25 is the usual section to provide for the charging of annuities against voted capital services.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment to Section 26 is to postpone by 20 years the date, which is at present 23rd March, 1964, after which the Minister for Finance will become entitled to redeem at per outstanding land bonds created and issued under the Land Bonds Act, 1934, as amended by the Land Act, 1953.  Seeing that bonds of this category are still being issued for the purchase of lands acquired by the Land Commission, it is left that the period left before they become liable for redemption is rather short.  The proposed amendment by which the Minister for Finance may redeem bonds not already redeemed will remove uncertainly as far as holders of these boundsa are concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 27 applies the provision of Section 34 of the Finance Act, 1956 to stocks etc., issued by Bord na Móna, the interest on which is payable without deduction of income-tax by virtue of Section 6 of the Bill.  The effect of this application means that neither the capital or nor the interest on the stocks, etc., will be liable to any taxation as long as it is shown that the stocks are in the beneficial ownership of persons who are neither domiclied <Col N="596" /> nor ordinarily resident in the State; and furthermore, that the interest will not be liable to income-tax asa long as it is shown that the stocks are in the beneficial ownership of persons who, wherever their domicile, are not ordinarily resident here.</P>
    <P>Section 28 is the customary section placing taxes and duties under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 29 is the customary section dealing with the short line, construction and commencement of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not been over-lengthy in his comments on the individual sections.  In fact, he rushed through those section with the minimum of comment, a proceeding which would be very understandable indeed of he were ashamed of the production that he has brought to the House.  Before dealing with the general question of the Finance Bill, with its legislative implications in relation to the Budget and the general picture as disclosed by it and the other discussion we have had, I want to deal with one or two specific points arising on the sections.</P>
      <P>In relation to Part I of the Bill, which deals with income-tax as such,. and particularly in relation to those parts of it which deal with industrial income-tax, I can remember only too well the biting sarcasm of Deputy Lemass, colleague in the present Government of Deputy Dr. Ryan, Minister for Finance, on that fact that last year, when I had only received the Report of the Committee on Industrial Taxation and had had it in my hands for less than a fortnight, I had not immediately implemented all its provisions.  I can remember Deputy Lemass suggesting that the Dáil should adjourn forthwith to enable me to have another fortnight in which the draft amendments to the Finance Bill then before the House and, by so doing, to incorporate all the recommendations of that Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has had a great deal longer than I had.  Many of the provisions of that Report were alreay implemented by me before we left office and the Minister has had ample <Col N="597" /> time and ample opportunity since he came in to make up his own mind on all the implications and recommendation of the Report.</P>
    <P>He has not given us any indication, expect in relation to Section 2, as to what his views are on the remaining provisions of the Report with which I had not the opportunity to deal.  The Minister should at least have indicated what his views are, so that the House, the country and those affected would know what they might expect in the years to come.  I can appreciate that he might feel that he was not in a position to make concession at the moment; but it would surely have been desirable to indicate that he had some mind of his own on this Report&mdash; that is, if he has read and considered it.  I am assuming&mdash;I give him the benefit of the doubt&mdash;that he had the engery, even before became Minister for Finance, to read and consider the Report.</P>
    <P>I am surprised, too, that in relation to the increase in depreciation allowances referred to in Section 2 he has not indicated him view on a problem that was cropping up and which should be dealt with.  I refer to the question as to whether an obsolescence allowance should be granted, even if machinery is not replaced.  I seem to remember one of his colleagues suggesting when I was over there that, if I had given any thought to the problem, I would have been able to dispose of that one in double-quick time.  The Minister has now the responsibility of speaking to his won colleague in the Government and we would like to know whether he has taught that colleague the error of his way, whether he has had an opportunity of considering the problem or has not considered it at all.</P>
    <P>In relation to the income-tax code, the gravest and the most serious objection to this Finance Bill must be the fact that no provision whatsoever is made for superannuation allowances for the self-employed.  That was a problem which we were considering last year and consideration of which was initiated last year.  It is a problem which is a difficult one, but one which, I have no doubt whatsoever, if <Col N="598" /> we had been left as Government, would have been met by certain provisions this year, even if it was only to ensure that one sector of that class, those in society groups, would have superannuation schemes recognised for the purposes of allowance under the Income Tax Acts.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in relation to income taxation must be on saving and it is a grave defect that we have not got in our legislation a provision by virtue of which there is that inducement for saving for superannuation for the self-employed. If the Minister turns back on the files, he can see that even last year,at the time of last year's Budget, we were giving consideration to the problem but that consideration had not been fully implemented at that time.  Twelve months have gone and examination proceeded during the course of last year and the Minister has had almost three months to produce some amelioration in that respect, but there is nothing whatever in relation to it in this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity there was not some recognition of the additional cost that there must be for the middle income group and even for the lower income group, from another point of view, if children, once they have reached the age of 16.  The cost of giving some recognition cannot be very substantial.  In the lower income groups, families suffer if they keep children at school by not having them earning as they would otherwise be earning.  If is tied up, I know, with the question of apprenticeship fees and the allowances that should be made for such fees, by, again, these are problems that have been under consideration for some time and an indication should have been given this year of some approach to their solution.</P>
    <P>We all know that in the middle income goup, once children come to the age of 16, schooling becomes even more expensive, perhaps because of the younger children coming on at the same time.  By a little ingenuity, quite substantial benefits on those lines could have been provided without any great loss of revenue.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has repeated the provision in section 3 which I was <Col N="599" /> anxious to introduce on another Bill and which I was unable to introduce because the matter was brought to my attention only after the long Title of that Bill had been introduced.  it is desirable that our universities and colleges should be encouraged in any way possible to get assistance from private sources.  It is desirable that private sources should be encouraged to assist research of the type that is envisaged in this section.  I think the Minister estimated&mdash;from recollection, it was the figure given to me&mdash;that some £15,000 was likely to be the cost of this concession.  It is, I would suggest, a concession that is well worth while for the benefits that it may bring to reaserch in our universities or in the constituent colleges of such universities.</P>
    <P>The Minister was, I think, sitting on this side of the House last year when his colleague, Deputy Lemass, as he then was, poured ridicule and scorn on the suggestion that I made at that time that an extension of Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, might be a desirable thing.  I want to congratulate him on having shown the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he was then, 12 months ago, talking nonsense, talking through his hat.  I want to congratulate the Minister for Finance on having brought him around to see that the obscurantist, cumbersome method of dealing with relief under that section which he adumbrated from this side of the House was all wrong and that it was not the manner in which that type of relief was ever granted.</P>
    <P>I must congratulate the Minister on being more successful than I was in that respect, but, of course, probably the answer to that is that the Minister, when I was explaining it to him, did not want to understand.  Whether that is the reason or not, the Minister is to be congratulated on having shown the Minister for Industry and Commerce the error of his ways.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Minister is gravely to be criticised for the form that Section 4 now takes.  Last year I introduced a section to extend the provisions of Section 7 to &ldquo;rights&rdquo; or bonus issues arising from the original issues.  By that, I gave what one might <Col N="600" /> terms the children the right of their parents in this world of stocks, but the present section goes entirely in a different direction; it gives an uncovenanted benefit to many issues, to the holders of many issues as well as to the issues themselves.  For what purpose?  I never was able to understand for what purpose.  I know that this suggestion was made to me by another body.  I could not understand why they thought it would have any effect at all.  It does not in any way deal with the case of transfer; it does not in any way make the shares more negotiable.  I think the Minister tried to imply in his Budget speech that it did, but that is not a fact.</P>
    <P>This section will not enable amalgamation of issues in the same way as the &ldquo;rights&rdquo; section of last year would. It merely gives an uncovenanted benefit to the holders of certain stocks and shares in a way which will not increase saving, which will not make shares more negotiable and which is highly objectionable for the reason that the Minister has started with the year 1932.  If this uncovenanted benefit were to be given, there is no reason whatever why it should not be given to every stock or share issued since 1st May, 1923, the date upon which there was the transfer of financial functions to the Irish Free State. There is no justification whatever for restricting the issues to 1932, except a political one, and I would have hoped that the Minister in the introduction of a Finance Bill would not have descended to political motives of that sort.  However, we shall have an opportunity on Committee Stage of dealing with that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given, in Section 5 in relation to income-tax, and in Section 16 in relation to corporation profits tax, certain inducements for exports.  I am glad he has done so.  I only wish that the Minister and the Government were consistent in giving inducements to export.  I wish that this Bill represented a consistent policy of pull in one place and push in the other, but the removal of the levies, which is confirmed in Section 14, is in one direction, and this export inducement is in the other, while, at the same time, last week <Col N="601" /> we had evidence of the Government's policy acting in a different direction when it proceeded to impose a tax on salmon exporters.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of discussing a matter appropriate to the Fisheries Department in relation to the export tax on salmon, but it seems to be quite fanciful and quite farcical for one Minister of State to be bringing in an inducement to export and for another of his colleagues sitting further down the way&mdash;perhaps the fact that the gangway divides them is the reason they do not speak to each other&mdash;to be introducing at the same time a tax on exports when exports are available. That is the type of contradiction which makes the people wonder if the Government knows where it is going.</P>
    <P>In the farming of Section 5, as I understand it, the Minister has also put a brake on the possibility of exports for the current year.  I appreciate, of course, that in relation to the type of trade that is being carried on by a company of this nature, it will be taxed on the profits of the preceeding year and that, therefore, in the case of an existing company the fact that the concession does not arise until 1958-59 will not make any difference.  As I understand the situation, the more they frame their basis of operation this year on exports the move it will benefit them in 1958-59, but in respect of a new company, there is quite a different situation.</P>
    <P>A new company starting to trade for the first time in the current financial year will be assessed on its actual profits during this financial year and will not, as I read Section 5, get the benefit of the concession in relation to that trading for this year.  Therefore, if my reading of the section is correct, it would seem to me that any company would be wise for its own sake to defer the commencement of any export business or any business at all, until 6th April, 1958.  Frankly, I do not think that is an eventuality or a situation the Minister would desire, but it does seem to me that must arise in respect of the new company.</P>
    <P>In the case of the existing company, <Col N="602" /> it will be assessed on actual profits for the current year, 1958-59, and therefore anything it does towards increasing exports or to increase its profits this year from exports will benefit it next year.  A company, however, set up as from to-day must be hit in the way I have suggested and therefore would find it more advantageous to wait until next April.  I take the view, and I think the Minister will agree with me, that it is vital that we should increase our exports, not next year but at once, and therefore any phraseology or any farming of any section which has such an effect is very much to be deplored.</P>
    <P>I wonder, also, is the same effect likely to occur in relation to Section 2 where the changing of the five-fourths depreciation allowances to next year might, perhaps, have the effect in certain cases of making people defer their modernisation and their purchases of new machinery.  We must make a real effort to modernise our production in every shape and form and anything that assists that modernisation is to be welcomed and anything that suggests it is in the private interest to defer it, is reprehensible.</P>
    <P>In Part II, we have the sections covering the changes proposed in the Budget, As regard Section 7, I would suggest that we are arriving at an extremely unhealthy tax structure.  I want to make it quite clear that I accept the agreement that the Minister expressed with my view of taxing, where the tax is necessarily on expenditure rather than on income, but we have a situation in which the proportion of our tax revenue derived from tobacco is somewhat frightening when one realises the manner in which the whole revenue structure of the State would be affected by any change in taste in that regard.</P>
    <P>Very roughly, 25 per cent. of our tax revenue comes from tax tobacco and cigarettes.  If it were believed by the public, whether it is a fact or not, that smoking had the somewhat deleterious effect that some doctors in various parts of the world suggest, the effect on revenue here in Ireland would be quite disastrous.  Personally, no matter what the doctors say, I am afraid as far as I am concerned, I shall go <Col N="603" /> on smoking, and if I should be persuaded to stop, it would be more injurious to the nerves of all those with whom I come in contact than it would be beneficial to my health; but other people may not look on it in that way, and if the situation does arise in which there is any change in public taste for tobacco and cigarettes, then I am afraid the task of whoever is sitting over there will be more unenviable than ever.</P>
    <P>I can remember only too well a former Minister for Finance and a colleague of the present Minister waxing satirically vicious on the subject of the taxation of beer without any increased taxation on whiskey and wine.  I remember Deputy MacEntee on two occasions speaking in a village at the same time as I was speaking, and on each occasion, curiously enough, the theme of his speech was that the wicked Government which I was supporting had not increased the tax on whiskey or wine, on the one hand, and on the other hand, had remitted the tax on wine imposed by the Supplementary Budget of 1947.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the Minister has done exactly the same time.  He has increased the tax on beer but has not imposed any additonal tax on whiskey or wine.  Let me say straight away I agree with him completely that he was wise not to impose any additional tax on whiskey or wine.  Wine, as a source of revenue, is only beginning to recover from the unbelievable stupidity of the Minister for Finance in 1947, Deputy Aiken, when he introduced his Supplementary Budget.  The trend in whiskey consumption is such that I am quite certain it has reached the point of no return from the point of view of revenue, so that an additional tax on that commodity would mean less revenue.</P>
    <P>I shall not therefore, adopt the irresponsible attitude of the Minister colleague.  I shall content myself with expressing surprise that the Minister, in Section 9, did not give some consideration to the position of the smaller breweries, some of which, even at the old rate of taxation, were finding it difficult enough to carry on.  With additional burdens on their industry, <Col N="604" /> an increase in duty must bring about a position that will make it almost impossible for them to carry on.  The Minister would have found it well advised to case that burden as I did in the Budget of 1955.</P>
    <P>The tax on petrol and hydrocarbon oils included in Section 10 is one the effect of which permeates throughout our whole economy.  It is, if you like, a tax on expenditure, but at the same time it is a tax on a vital source of distribution.  The days are gone when petrol and purchasing of petrol can be in any way considered as a luxury.  It is a necessity, part of the essential cost of distribution, and I think the Minister was most unwise to impose this additional tax of 6d. a gallon.  I grant that it is an easy way of picking up a large sum and that the ability to pick up a large sum in taxation by one single operation must always be tempting to any Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister should, certainly in this respect have avoided that temptation.  There were plenty of other ways available to him in which he could have made, if not the whole required amount, at least a substantial part of the amount.  It will affect every business throughout the country: it will affect the cost of distribution of raw materials for industry and will affect the cost of living in a general way quite apart from the specific impact to which reference was made in the Central Statistics issue the other day.  It will have a considerable effect on the tourist trade, a trade which is the equivalent of an export.  Altogether, I think, it is extremely unwise economy to impose an additional 6d. a gallon on petrol haphazardly in this way.</P>
    <P>At the time of the Budget, I referred to the fact that the Minister had not given any relief from this additional tax to farmers who utilise petrol for their tractors.  We shall have another opportunity of discussing that on Committee Stage, but it seems to provide further evidence of the manner in which the Minister in one breath speaks about increased production and in the next proceeds to tax the means of that production.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed also that the <Col N="605" /> Minister did not, in Part II of the Bill, make the small concession&mdash;very small indeed from the point of view of money &mdash;which was requested of me in the last month or so of my term of office, in respect of amateur films made by members of the International Amateur Film Association, that these films should be free from entertainment duty when they were being shown here.  It does not arise very often; it arises very seldom indeed.  It is the only means by which these amateur bodies have an opportunity of covering their expenses for one or two showings each year.  It should have been quite feasible to have provided an exemption in the case of films made by affiliated members of the International Amateur Film Association.  It would have been a very small thing but would probably have meant the difference between survival and extinction to these societies.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything at this stage on Section 14 which involves matters that we might discuss in a more general context.  I have already made it clear that it seems to me the Minister cannot go on saying that the balance of payments equalisation which we obtained was precarious and, at the same time, knock out the props from under our scheme, wiping out completely the hire purchase restrictions as he has done.</P>
    <P>I relation to Part V of the Bill, I notice that the Minister has&mdash;I presume, deliberately&mdash;provided that the investment allowance is not to apply to secondhand ships.  The investment allowance which i introduced last year did apply to secondhand ships.  I gave the concession last year in relation to such ships because it was stressed to me at the time that most small Irish shipping companies did not buy any but secondhand ships.  The smaller companies very often have not got a sufficient coastal trade to provide the finances necessary to buy new ships. They are threfore forced to buy secondhand ones.  I can, of course, understand that it is essential in any such arrangements that there should be provision so that a shipowner, having got an investment allowance for the purchase of a ship, would not then re-sell it to another <Col N="606" /> owner, who might again get an investment allowance.  I am thinking of ships bought outside Ireland and brought into Ireland under the Irish register. There is a great deal to be done in relation to our shipping code.</P>
    <P>When I had the honour of being Minister for Finance I felt, in relation to the various types of codes we had, that the first it was necessary to deal with was the mining code.  The House is well aware of the very substantial alterations made in that code 12 months ago, and last November.  The tax code I would have liked to tackle in the same way was the shipping code, if circumstances had permitted me to do so.  I believe there is a future fro us here to build a shipping register.  I believe that owners in other parts of the world are no longer satisfied with the flags of convenience that they got so easily from Panama and other South American Republics.  I believe that, if we had a shipping code of taxation here that was more in keeping with modern requirements, we might be able to do something quite substantial in that respect.  I admit it is a difficult problem and I accept that the Minister has pointed some distance towards that problem in Part V of the Bill.  However, I am afraid that if he is to achieve anything worth while in that respect he will certainly have to tackle it in a very much more radical manner.</P>
    <P>There would also be a very strong case for the Minister to tackle the problem of death duties in a more radical manner.  Unless we are to ensure that we shall have an expanding revenue year by year we are going to be in financial difficulties.  We might get such an expanding revenue if we could take steps to ensure that our position was better comparatively than that of other countries.  The law relating to death duties is one of the cases in which a comparison with other countries is not so very good.  Anybody considering coming here, and examining our position with that in Northern Ireland, will find that there is nothing very much from a death duty angle to induce him to do so.</P>
    <P>I must confess, quite frankly, that I was very surprised to discover the discrepancy in rates between here and the <Col N="607" /> Six Counties.  It was only in the last six months or so that I discovered it. I am talking of a discrepancy in the small estate rate rather than in the large estate rate.  For example, on an estate of £2,000 to £3,000 we charge 1 per cent.  In Britain and the Six Counties no estate duty whatsoever is levied on such estates.  On a £3,000 to £4,000 estate, we charge 2 per cent, but the rate charged in the Six Counties and also in Britain in respect of such an estate is 1 per cent, higher than ours.  When we go into the rates on estates from £10,000 up to £20,000 and £25,000, the medium estate, we find our rates vary from 1 per cent, to 4 per cent higher than the Six County rates.</P>
    <P>That is a situations we have to change.  It is a situation which I admit any Minister for Finance must find some difficulty in changing because of the immediate loss that would be involved but, in the long run, there would not be a loss.  On the contrary, it is more likely that there would be a gain by the effect of additional money coming in and, with that additional money, easing nor merely the current revenue problem but also part of our problem arising from shortage of capital.</P>
    <P>I should like also if the Minister when he is replying would give some indication as to whether or not he has considered the effect of the current British Finance Act as regards export allowances.  Is there any danger that the effect of this Act would be to influence British parent companies of subsidiaries here to switch production back to Britain in order to get the export allowances provided for in the British Budget?  If it is not clear beyond question that this ACt cannot react adversely on subsidiary companies manufacturing here, then for the sake of the employment and productive content we must take steps to rectify that position at home.</P>
    <P>At this time last year a problem was raised in relation to the British Act and insurance companies.  I think it was adequately disposed of at the time but I should like an assurance that is so.  There was also a question on the <Col N="608" /> Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act last November in relation to gypsum, the position being that neither the Mining Tax Act of February 1956, nor the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of November, 1956 gave relief for unmanufactured gypsum exports.  I gave an undertaking at that time that I would look into that matter, consider the operations of those Acts, and make sure that the companies mining gypsum here were not unfairly treated.  I hope that has been done and that the companies concerned have been satisfied in that respect.</P>
    <P>It does seem to me that a possible gap might be created between the effect of the Mining Tax Act of February, 1956, the Finance (MIscellneous Provisions) Act of last November, and this Bill so that certain mining concerns may fall between the three stools.  Perhaps that is a matter we might discuss more carefully on the Committee Stage but I take it that the Minister would be adverse to that occurring and that his anxiety would be the same as mine to ensure that any company concerned would at least be able to claim under one od the three statutes in question.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, this Bill is the technical measure for the implementation of Budget policy.  I would have thought that there would have been since the Budget speech, some more clear indication of the policy of the Government.  The Minister, when he was replying to the Budget debate, made a speech quite adequate for a cross-roads.  In fact, if one likes one particular type of cornerboy cross-road speech it was an excellent one, but it was a speech sadly lacking in the guidance, judgment, realism and discrimination that this House and the country as a whole has a right to expect from a Minister for Finance.  He was much more concerned with Party politics than he was with the economics of the country.  I would have thought when he chose that line, no doubt deliberately, on the concluding stages of the Financial Resolutions, that he would have given us to-day in his opening speech some indication of further economic policy <Col N="609" /> and some indication of the policy which he proposes to adopt.</P>
    <P>There were one or two serious problems to which I drew his attention when speaking in that Budget debate. They are problems to which it is not I who wants an answer; they are problems to which the country wants an answer; they are problems to which those who are employers, those who are manufacturing and those who are working require answers; and they are problems in respect of which there cannot be any real progress unless we have a firm line which the Minister will keep, whether it is right or wrong.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came into office, we have seen a variety of chops and changes.  We are inclined to wonder whether they intend to go in the same direction or whether they are having a tag of war among themselves. Anyone who reads the Budget speech of the Minister for Finance and contrasts it with the removal of the levies on motor cars and on other types of luxury and semi-luxury goods; anyone who reads his warning&mdash;a correct warning&mdash;that our balance of payments equilibrium is a tenuous thing which we have achieved with great difficulty &mdash;let me add we achieved it for him&mdash; and which must be kept, cannot reconcile that warning with the action, no doubt motivated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of removing levies and wiping out every type of hire purchase restriction.  Anyone who noticed the fact&mdash;and all of us noticed it&mdash;that one day the Government in the Budget of the Minister for Finance announced bread decontrol and within two or three days came along and imposed it again&mdash;anyone who sees that type of contradiction must wonder whether the Government knows where it is travelling.</P>
    <P>Let me be quite specific.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce was right to reimpose control in the second instance, but where I think the Government were sadly lacking was that they have not made any effort to foresee where decontrol was likely to lead them in the circumstances in which they announced it and the manner in which they announced it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> We had certain indications from the Minister for Finance in this Budget speech about what might be the effect if the measures employed by him in the Budget were followed by other measures.  I would have expected some calm, deliberate and sound contribution by the Minister on that subject, whether at the conclusion of the Budget debate or at the opening of this debate.  There is no subject that is more fraught with difficulty in the national interests and no subject upon which a lack of a positive lead could be more harmful.  I am sure all of us are anxious at times to indulge in a little wishful thinking.  Many people are inclined to think that we in Ireland will be able to attain the standard of living we desire merely by saying so. I think the Fianna Fáil Party have a great deal of responsibility in that regard by their propaganda right from the beginning in 1932, but whether it is the fault of that side of the House or of this side of the House, the sooner we all realise that it is not a fact, the better for the country as a whole.  The sooner we all realise that our standard of living will depend only on our current output and only upon what we produce, the better it will be for all of us.  The sooner we get away from wishful thinking of the type I indicated a moment ago, the more chance we have of achieving realism.</P>
    <P>The people decided on 5th March that I was not going to have the responsibility of framing this Budget. Let me be quite categorical when I say that the Minister is wrong when he says his method was the only way to frame the Budget and to meet these problems.  There were other methods that could have been used.  There are other methods that probably I would have used but whoever is Minister for Finance has ultimately the task of deciding the method and, having decided that method, then it becomes the property of this House.  The divisions in the House on Budget day and at the termination of the Budget debate made it clear that this House, as the Parliament of the country, decided that was the manner in which the problems were to be met.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister was mistaken&mdash;<Col N="611" /> I think he was grievously mistaken&mdash;in scorning this stability, as he did scorn it, in winding up the Budget debate.  I think he approached the problem of framing this Budget entirely the wrong way by such scorning of stability; but, having said that the Minister was in my view, wrong and totally wrong, I want to make it quite clear that two wrongs do not make a right.  If the mistake made by the present Government is followed by another mistake, then the position will be very substantially worse.</P>
    <P>Ten men employed at £6 per week require approximately £3,000 to pay their wages in the year.  That is not quite an accurate calculation, but it is near enough.  If the wages and the salaries of those men are increased, then the £3,000 is not going to be adequate to carry those people.  Either of two things has to occur: nine men only will be employed for the same £3,000 or the £3,000 will have to be augmented.  If, therefore, the initial and serious mistake of this Government in jettisoning the stability we had brought to hand is followed by a second mistake on the part of other people by seeking wages and salaries beyond current production, then only one of two things can happen: either we will have to provide more funds to employ the same number of men or provide the same amount of money to employ fewer people.</P>
    <P>Either of those alternatives will be extremely bad for the country.  On the one hand, it might bring a worsening of our balance of payments equilibrium, a disequilibrium in our balance of payments such as we had in 1952, and, on the other hand, it might bring with it more unemployment and worse unemployment than there was in 1956.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that the initial mistake&mdash;the crass mistake&mdash;made by this Government will not be followed by a second mistake which will have even worse effects and that, instead, we can travel along the line of ensuring that the mistakes made by the Government will be rectified in the best possible manner by reducing costs and by ensuring that there will be an expansion of employment, rather than <Col N="612" /> the difficulties to which I adverted.  I know that that is not a popular thing to say but there are times when people in public life, whether it be popular or unpopular, must say what they think.  I am quite certain from my knowledge of the situation&mdash;it is not exhaustive: I do not pretend to claim it is exhaustive&mdash;that any move in that direction, any excess of current production, will inevitably bring difficulties and a real economic crisis.  If it does, the responsibility will be that of the Minister because he had handed over to him a stable position in that regard &mdash;a position in which our trade excess was being matched and more than matched by our invisible receipts; in which our savings were coming back to the optimum level; in which the bogey of inflation from internal causes had been met and broken and in which that confidence was beginning to come to pass which would be the real basis and the essential need for an expanding output.  I hope the mistakes made by the Minister and this Government in the type of Budget they introduced and in the manner of its introduction will not upset that and cause the difficulties to which I have adverted.</P>

      <P>This Finance Bill which we are discussing to-day is to give effect to the budgetary proposals of the Minister for Finance.  As such, one would expect from the Minister, now that they have been some months in office and have imposed these heavy burdens on the people, a more distinctive exposition of policy.  I do not think anybody will dispute that if you take an extra sum of money from the taxpayer and tell the taxpayer you are doing so for the purpose of expanding your economy it is reasonable for every member of this House to expect to hear from one of the principal Government speakers what that policy is to increase production and reduce unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few decades, the City of Dublin has been growing.  More people have been coming into Dublin and the main basis of employment in the city has been building.  In the first flush of victory, when he was being interviewed by journalists and a remark was passed to him to the effect <Col N="613" /> that he had a difficult situation with regard to employment to deal with, the Taoiseach said he had no specific plans but that he thought building would meet the question.  I submit that vast employment has been given in Dublin over the past couple of decades in building and that the policy, as far as it relates to employment in this city by the present Government, is to continue building&mdash;not only building houses but building boulevards leading into the new building sites or estates that are being set up in different parts of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>They are spending money.  We are under the impression that these taxes have been raised for the purpose of expanding employment. I submit that the employment they are giving in Dublin is by building and nothing else.  I shall finish with the subject soon.  I simply want to say that you can go on building houses in Dublin and you may employ people by doing so but that that is of no economic benefit to the Irish people when the houses are not being occupied.  I shall pass from that now, in view of the ruling of the Chair.</P>
      <P>With regard to the expansion of our economy, we have frequently heard from the Fianna Fáil benches about the expansion of agricultural production. At present, agricultural markets are going through perhaps one of the biggest revolutions they have been through in modern times.  It is the duty of the Government to aid, foster and improve these markets.  Were they able to do so, I think we could all accept it as reasonable that we would not have any more economic difficulties.  If you provide markets&mdash;not only agricultural markets but industrial markets as well &mdash;all your difficulties will be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always maintained that our future expansion lies in Europe.  Up to this, we have had the majority of our eggs in one basket.  We buy extensively from Britain.  Admittedly, we have certain benefits out of Commonwealth preferences but, at the same <Col N="614" /> time, O.E.E.C.&mdash;an organisation to which we belong&mdash;gave the advice in their report that Ireland should go out and seek markets elsewhere as it is dangerous to be engaged entirely in the one market.  Action must be taken in order to procure markets and, as I have said on other occasions, it must be taken at political level.  Deputy Cosgrave and myself asked a question here last week with reference to the sale of sheep and mutton and lambs generally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In order to reduce unemployment you must put people into productive employment.  I am trying to show that the Government have no policy for putting people into productive employment.  I submit that if I had been talking about industry, the Chair would probably not have ruled me out of order.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to taxation generally.  I understood that the total taxation the Minister takes out of the Irish people is £184,000,000. <Col N="616" /> In any event, he is taking a sizeable sum, shall we say, from the Irish people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there should be some definite statement from some responsible Minister as to what their policy is in relation to the over-all economic changes taking place in the world to-day.  It is necessary for a Government to cite a policy, and on a Finance Bill, when we are providing for all this taxation, we are entitled to have a statement of policy from the Minister or from the Government as to what their actual policy is.  Deputy John A. Costello, speaking here after the Government were first elected, stated that one of the most closely-guarded secrets of the modern political age was the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We, on this side of the House, are all in the dark as to what that policy is.</P>
      <P>I submit that, in the potentialities which exist at the present moment for increasing our trade, the Government should do something.  I am not satisfied that the Government are really doing anything about it.  We are told that at the present moment there are discussions going on in Europe with regard to the potentialities open to us amongst the different nations there, in particular the group of six known as the Common Market Group.  I am told &mdash;I only know what I read in the papers like anybody else&mdash;we have got a representative negotiating for us there on behalf of the Government, in which the Minister is the Finance Minister and has over-ruling and controlling guidance of the finances of the country.  We have the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce out negotiating an agreement for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without wishing to refer too much to agriculture, I should like to stress this point.  Surely, in an entirly agricultural country such as Ireland, it is reasonable to ask the Minister who has to make money available in this Budget for the procuring of markets&mdash;and I presume that is contained in the Finance Bill&mdash;to have some other representative negotiating on behalf of the <Col N="617" /> Government other than the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce?</P>

When the previous Deputy was speaking, he wanted to know the policy of the Government and what the Government intended to do about the relief of taxation, the expansion of industry and the expansion of production.  Surely he knows very well these things cannot be done in six weeks or three months.  Surely no one in Ireland expects such a miracle.  I hate to be sarcastic, but our position results from the mismanagement by the inter-Party Government and we will have a hard fight to get out of these bad economic conditions.  We are anxious to see increased production and full employment and we are taking all practical steps we can for that purpose. We are not anxious to bring hardships on the people, but unfortunately we were left in this awkward position and we must try to keep the ship floating.  Deputies on the other side had the very same opportunities during the last three years and succeeded not alone in bringing the country to where it is to-day but in destroying the confidence of the people. We are trying to rectify that and to increase production in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out the sheer hypocrisy of Deputies opposite in trying to put it over that they are defending the rights of the Irish people now, when they destroyed the economic rights of the Irish people during the last three years.  They are expecting us, inside a few months, to make everything in the garden lovely and to pat the former Minister on the back for the work he carried out.  Our economic conditions are bad and it will take the very best brains in the country to put them right.  There is not a man sitting on these benches, from the Taoiseach to the back bench Deputies, but is very <Col N="619" /> anxious to see that everyone will be employed.</P>
    <P>We received a legacy from the last Government of an emigration figure of 100,000 in two years and 90,000 unemployed. Deputies here do not seem to be able to face realities and only continue petty abuse across the floor of the House.  The people of Ireland are weary listening to this sort of thing and want practical suggestions.  They have been deceived long enough, but will be deceived no longer.  They realise now that the economic position is serious and they realise also that we, as a Party and as a Government, are doing everything we can to right the ship of State again, to attack the evils of emigration and unemployment and to expand production.</P>

      <P>This Bill imposes an extra £3,000,000 in taxation.  The items to which the Minister has asked the House to agree, in respect of which extra taxes will be imposed, amount to approximately £3,000,000.  That is the length and breadth of this Bill.  We have an opportunity on this occasion to discuss the financial policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The first point which occurs to me is that, when the Minister finds it necessary to impose an extra £3,000,000 taxation on the public, in addition to the extra cost of bread, butter and sugar, amounting to approximately £7,000,000, we should ask to what policy we are contributing this money.  Have we had an announcement of any policy?</P>
      <P>The present Government did not announce a policy before or after the general election.  They have left the people still guessing.  They complained that there was a high percentage of emigration during the term of office of the previous Government.  There was; but they offered no remedy to the people for it, before or after the election.  They said they intended to reduce unemployment, but they did not.  They have announced no policy likely to reduce unemployment.  They talked glibly about the unemployment figure of 90,000 persons.</P>

      <P>The only point I made <Col N="621" /> was this, and it was a reference to the 90,000 unemployed.  I began to question the Government on that very point, as to their policy at the present time. In relation to financial policy, can we learn from the Minister why, in these difficult times, hire purchase restrictions have been remitted?  Will the financial position of the country not be aggravated to an even greater extent by remitting some of these restrictions? Similarly, a number of the levies were abolished.  They were designed by the previous Government as a positive and effective financial policy to put the finances of the country right.  Those levies have been abolished and we now have a position where the adverse trade balance, which had been unproved by £25,000,000 in less than 12 months, is going to be aggravated again by these steps of the Government in encouraging the importation of non-essential goods.</P>
      <P>On this question of financial policy, I should like to ask the Fianna Fáil Party why did they operate a policy. which resulted in the expenditure of £20,000,000 in eight months, in 1951&mdash; £20,000,000 of the American Counterpart Fund?  If we examine the manner in which that £20,000,000 was spent, we will find that it included expenditure on the importation of mousetraps, gramophones, records, Japanese pencils and other such goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the spending of £20,000,000 of the American Counterpart Fund in the space of eight months by the previous Fianna Fáil Government.  I am bringing this point out to show that they have no organised, positive and effective financial policy.  I pointed out also that the levies introduced last year by the previous Minister for Finance improved our trading in less than 12 months to the extent of £25,000,000.  That action caused a fall in business and a certain amount of unemployment, and it remains to be seen whether it would not have been better to maintain a <Col N="622" /> measure of those restrictions which did ensure that at least our trading balance would be kept right.  In my opinion, it was a mistake to abolish the levies and particularly to remove the hire purchase restrictions because many of the hire purchase agreements are for the purchase of non-essential articles imported into this country, and this has the effect of upsetting our trade balance, in so far as imports are related to exports.</P>
      <P>In this Bill, the Minister proposes to take £1.1 million from tobacco smokers, in addition to the large amount already being contributed by them.  The Bill also proposes to take £620,000 from the consumers of beer in addition to the heavy tax already being contributed by them.  The Bill also asks us to adopt a proposed extra tax of 6d. a gallon on petrol which is to bring in £1.15 million.  There are many people who do not take the trouble to examine what service the people get from petrol or who do not examine the purpose for which a car is used or the service its owner is giving to the community in general. They do not realise the heavy consumption of petrol in commercial vehicles, either in haulage lorries or lorries used by their owners for the collection on delivery of their own goods.</P>
      <P>Those lorries are giving a service to the community in the collection and delivery of various classes of goods to the consuming public, in addition to the general carrier who is available for hire to carry goods and who gives that service to people engaged in the manufacturing business or owners of livestock. Similarly, the petrol used in vans or lorries for the collection or delivery of goods is giving a service. The vehicles of such people as commercial travellers and agents are also giving a service to the community. Generally speaking, the private car is used for pleasure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The detail I am going into is designed to show on what <Col N="623" /> exactly the tax is being imposed, but I will depart from it, if the Chair insists. When the man in the street hears of a tax on petrol, he immediately concludes that the ordinary private car is used mainly for pleasure outside working hours; otherwise, one could take it that the private car is giving a service.  A tax of 6d. per gallon on petrol is a tax on every service given by each type of vehicle I have mentioned and in the long run it is the consuming public, therefore, who will be obliged to pay.</P>
      <P>There is, too, a proposal in this Bill to put a tax on diesel oil.  The fruit of that tax, mainly £120,000, will be contributed mainly by farmers who use diesel tractors in the cultivation of their land and the production of food thereon.  It is, in other words, a tax on agricultural production and that tax will eventually have to be met by those who consume the produce from the land.  This is a direct tax of £120,000 on tractor users.  In addition, there are a few diesel lorries and trucks. Possibly there are a few diesel buses, but, generally speaking, diesel oil is used by the farmers and it is the farmers who will be obliged to pay this £120,000.</P>

      <P>As against that tax, there is a proposal in this Bill to relieve vehicles licensed under the Road Traffic Act of some £110,000. That relief will be given mainly in respect of buses used in public transport and, in the long run, therefore, it will be borne on the shoulders of other sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there have been some reliefs in relation to income-tax, the income-tax code itself has not been changed, although those affected have been clamouring for a long time for fair play.  It is only fair play they ask for, these people who are taxed on their earnings, their enterprise and their work.  A committee was set up to examine into the income-tax code, but we have no report of progress from the Minister.  Neither have we any report from the Government in relation to income-tax, except the minor reliefs which have been given under the existing structure, a structure which is regarded by many as completely out of date and in drastic need of being brought into keeping with modern conditions. Only about 5 per cent. pay income-tax and that small proportion contribute £20,000,000 per year.  These people are beginning to wonder why there has been no announcement from the Government of a change in the systems.  That £20,000,000 represents a substantial part of the revenue.  People living on fixed pensions are beginning to wonder why they should be asked to pay income-tax on these pensions and at the same time pay the increased <Col N="625" /> prices for bread, butter, sugar and flour.</P>
    <P>This Bill, like most of the Fianna Fáil policy, contains promises.  There are always the promises.  I have not counted the number of times the date, 6th April, 1958, appears in this measure.  The provisions will take effect as from that date.  It is strange the Minister did not advert to this in his speech&mdash;perhaps procedure requires that it should be done in this way&mdash;but surely the Minister should have declared that, for technical reasons, it was necessary for him now to make certain provisions in relation to income-tax as from 6th April, 1958.  Instead of that, however, the Bill was presented once more as a carrot to entice the Fianna Fáil donkey, the Fianna Fáil donkey who is prepared to believe the Fianna Fáil Party promises.  This is a promise that, all going well and nothing adverse occurring in the meantime, as from 6th April, 1958, certain revisions will take place in the income-tax code, particularly in relation to the scale of tax which will be applied to profits from exports.</P>
    <P>When this promise of a revision in the income-tax code which is to take place on the 6th April, 1958, was announced, it was mentioned that this change was intended to encourage employment and enterprise amongst persons engaged in the export business. For the reasons indicated by Deputy Sweetman when he was speaking, it is obvious that certain firms will not gain advantage from this proposal and I was wondering whether the Minister would consider introducing amendments on the Committee Stage which would give effect to Deputy Sweetman's suggestion.</P>
    <P>When we are considering remission of income-tax on profits from exports we ought to consider the origin of the goods exported because then we shall be able to decide whether in fact the remission is being given in return for services rendered instead of a remission for the export of raw materials which originated in this country.  There are some firms, unfortunately too few of them, who are highly efficient in the manufacture of certain classes of goods with the results that they are able to <Col N="626" /> import the raw materials, process those materials here and export them to other countries.  In the long run we are only exporting a service.  We are not encouraging the manufacture and processing of native materials and native goods in addition to the export service given by our people in the factories engaged in the processing of the goods which are manufactured.  We ought to examine to what extent this tax remission will be a remission in favour of those who are giving a service as against a remission in favour of those who are engaged in the production of goods and their export.</P>
    <P>When the Minister asks the House to give him this Bill which will increase taxation by £3,000,000, we should remember that he came into this House a few weeks ago asking the people to pay for the loaf 7d. more than it was as a result of the Fianna Fáil Budget of 1952.  Similarly, butter to-day, under the Fianna Fáil Budget, is 1/7 dearer than it was under the Fianna Fáil Budget of 1952.  The price of flour has gone beyond calculation.  I think it has increased by something like 3/- a stone.  These extra costs have been deliberately imposed upon consumers in addition to the extra taxes now proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Burke brought up the question of financial policy when he was contributing to this debate.  When the Minister is replying to this discussion, I should like him to indicate whether his Party is asking for this money to enable them to implement a positive policy.  We were treated to the suggestion that the building trade would be improved in order to absorb our unemployed.  That remains to be seen, but it is doubtful whether a trend in the direction of increased building will have any lasting economic benefit for the country.</P>

If it is not designed to implement a policy which will give more employment, can the Minister say when we can expect an announcement from him regarding any kind of policy from the Government and from the Fianna Fáil Party which will result in increased employment?  The recent figures have shown a backward trend instead of an improvement in relation to previous years.</P>

      <P>The House has listened to a very confused speech. The Deputy who has just spoken is an expert in this House in trying to create a smokescreen but it is generally so thin that it is transparent. He is asking what is the Government's financial policy.  The previous Government has got this country into such a state of depression and stagnation that the policy is to try to get the country out of it. The previous Government presented the bills to the country and, consequently, to the incoming Government, so that the policy for the incoming Government is to devise ways and means hurriedly to get out of that situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacCarthy would not know the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy omitted the word &ldquo;balance&rdquo;.  However, even if I concede that, it does not necessarily contribute to an improvement in our national position or in our trading, because the levies hold up essential industries and create unemployment, thereby causing a general state of depression where both imports and exports are reduced and consequently the country is endangered.</P>
      <P>If levies are imposed as a temporary measure, that must be done with some kind of planning which, in my judgment, the previous Government did not sufficiently examine.  If the supply of transport fuels is reduced, the production of tyres, garage work and all the rest are reduced and the whole industry is depressed.  If supplies of essential stocks are reduced, that does not even show an improvement in trade balance.  That is what happened: essential stocks were diminished and, consequently, there was a general air of depression because unemployment was rife in many essential industries, including the building industry.</P>
      <P>If the import of timber is stopped, houses cannot be built and, consequently, the man working in the sandpit, the man making concrete blocks, the man making tiles becomes unemployed, and the building industry gets into the position in which we found it when we came into office.  At that time there was no building of any consequence being carried out except the building that the local authorities were trying to carry on on overdrafts and on promises by the Government for the future, which the country saw they were not in a position to fulfil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rooney spoke about the loaf. The cure of the last Government was to give a smaller loaf.  Neither the subsidies nor the levies saved many people in the City of Cork whose families have been engaged in the bakery industry for generations, from the monopolist.  When you have a depression in a country, it always happens that the man in a small way, <Col N="629" /> who is trying to make ends meet, is eaten up by the monopolists; his business goes to the wall.  That has happened during the past year in the South of Ireland and, I presume, elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is not a bed of roses for the Government to have to face a situation of that kind created by the ineptitude of the previous Government who failed to face the situation and created a state of economic chaos that it would be difficult for any Minister to remedy. The bills were presented by the previous Government.  This Government has to get the means of paying them so as to restore the economy of the country and enable progress to be made.  Local authorities, public bodies, private enterprise did not know from day to day what was in store for them.  They faced one disaster after another.</P>
    <P>Five or six big bakeries whose names were associated with the industry in Cork for generations have been eaten up by one big monopolist.  The entire production of the loaf, big or small, is now in the hands of that monopoly and the distribution of that essential commodity to the people in the second city of the State is at their discretion. That was a very undesirable thing to have happened.  If those bakeries could have seen, during the period of office of the previous Government, with the loaf big or small, either with levies or subsidies, that they could preserve for their families the businesses that had been built up over generations, they would not have allowed that situation to develop.</P>
    <P>In the same way all the main industries were held up, people were going abroad and a general state of depression existed.  There was stagnation in industry.  That is what we have set out to remedy.  That is what this Bill sets out to make provision for in the coming year.  In the short time at the disposal of the Government the whole position could not have been adequately examined, but there was sufficient staring them in the face to make them see that remedies had to be applied quickly.  This Government had the courage to face that situation.  The country realises that and have <Col N="630" /> accepted the decisions of the Government with good grace.  A feeling of confidence is being restored because when the Government is prepared to examine and face the situation and has the interests of the people at heart, the country can go forward with the confidence that the Irish nation always had in facing difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The most controversal item of this year's Budget was, of course, the abolition of the food subsidies. The debate on this matter, which took place in this House over the past few weeks, was confined to a fairly narrow issue.  The Government's case on the abolition of the food subsidies was based on the simple principle that they had no alternative to cutting the subsidies in order to balance the Budget.  The Opposition denied that.  The Opposition stated that it was possible to balance the Budget without cutting the food subsidies.</P>
      <P>It is of very great importance that the House and the country should have very clearly before them these two issues because if the view which we on this side of the House took was correct then the very grave hardships which our people are being asked to bear, the very grave difficulties which the weakest sections in our community are being asked to bear, the economic difficulties which will come about as a result of that decision would not have been necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's case was based on the proposition, as I say, that it was necessary to cut the subsidies in order to balance the Budget.  Let me remind Deputies of what the Opposition suggested could have been done this year to obtain the funds necessary to balance the current Budget.  Deputies will recall that the amount of savings on the food subsidies this year was £7.1 million and that compensatory payments had to be made by the Government to members of the uncalled social assistance class, amounting to £1.95 million and that the total sum which the Government gained as a result of cutting the subsidies and giving the increase in the social assistance payments was £5.15 million.  That <Col N="631" /> is what the Government gained this year by their action and their action brought in, in relief of the Exchequer, £5.15 million.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made by the Opposition speakers as to how that sum could be obtained was that if the Government had retained the import levies and if, instead of putting them into the capital account, they had put them into the current account, there would have been enough from the import levies to have balanced the Budget this year. What are the import levies?  Indirect taxes, customs duties, but they were called something special last year. They were referred to as import levies and the proceeds were put into a special Capital Fund and special legislation was passed last year to ensure they were put into capital account. Those were the import levies for last year brought in by the previous Government.  The first group of levies was brought in in March and that group was subsequently increased in July, and on neither occasion was a division challenged by the then Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the case made by the then Opposition was that the steps we were taking were inadequate to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>The Government facing the problems of last year had very difficult decisions to take and one of those decisions was to put the proceeds of the import levies into capital account rather than into relief of taxation.  That was done for several reasons.  It was done because of the shortage of capital; because of the dangerous inflationary trends of the time, creating an excess of imports over exports.  The Government's action was accepted by the Opposition of that time and again there was no division challenged on this matter of financing the capital programme by import levies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me remind Deputies of this the import levies were put on at a time of very grave national difficulty.  They were put on, as was stated, for exceptional reasons and it was also stated that they would be of a temporary <Col N="632" /> nature.  That being so, it is interesting to see the argument which the Minister put forward in his reply to the Budget debate a couple of weeks ago when he dealt with this aspect of the case made by the Opposition against the Budget. The Minister said two things about this Opposition argument.  First of all, he described the proposals of the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy McGilligan as borrowing, and he said, at column 2101 of Volume 161, No. 15:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Suggestions by Deputy Costello and Deputy McGilligan which amounted to balancing the Budget very borrowing ....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Earlier, he referred to them in the same volume, at column 2085:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They advised that borrowing should be done, borrowing for the Budget, which would put us back in the bad old days of Coalition Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is not correct that the Minister should be permitted to make a statement like that without being contradicted. The suggestion which we made on this side of the House that the revenue from the import levies, which are indirect taxes like many others from customs duty, should be put into the current Budget, is not, by any stretch of the imagination, borrowing. We suggest that current taxes should be put into current revenue and should be used to balance the Budget.  To describe that suggestion as one alleging that we are borrowing for the current Budget is, to my mind, not being open and fair with the House and the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister, however, had a second defence for his action in not doing what the Opposition suggested he should do.  In the same volume, at column 2093, the Minister referred to the fact that his predecessor had made provision in the Central Fund Act last year by which the proceeds of the import levies were to go into capital account, and after referring to this very correct action he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They were created as capital and if we had done what Deputy Costello and Deputy McGilligan advocated we would have to change that Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> May I pause there for a moment?  Is there anything extraordinary in changing the Act or amending the Central Fund Act?  Would the Minister bring in a Bill next week amending this year's Central Fund Act?  He goes on, however:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not saying that is impossible but it just gives the House an idea of the Fine Gael Party who this time last year passed an Act of Parliament to make them capital and they now come along and blame us for not turning them over to current expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a comment on the Fine Gael Party which the Minister is entitled to make.  I do not think there is any point in going into detail on that aspect of it now, except to say that we believe that last year it was correct that these revenues should be put into capital account, but we suggest this year, in view of the extraordinarily difficult circumstances, in order to avoid the disastrous consequences of cutting the food subsidies, we would be justified in changing them and putting them into current account.  The Minister, as I say, is entitled to comment on the attitude of Fine Gael, but let me remind Deputies of that very significant phrase in his remarks, &ldquo;It would have been possible&rdquo;.  Why did he not do it?</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply, gave no reason why he did not put the revenue from the import levies into current, instead of capital account and so avoid cutting the food subsidies.  Will he not give it now in his reply to this debate? Let him not satisfy himself by saying that it amounts to borrowing for the current Budget, because it does not.</P>
    <P>Let me say straight off there would be difficulties in doing that; let me admit quite fairly that the Minister, by doing what we suggest, would have difficulties.  He would have difficulties on the Capital Account because of the shortage of capital and also in regard to industries on which the remainder of the import levies will be placed; but if that is the argument, let us have it, and we can debate the matter because we do not believe that the difficulties which the cut in subsidies will causes are commensurate with the difficulties <Col N="634" /> which would be caused by taking the levy revenues away from where they are at the moment.  The whole future economic policy of this State for several years to come is at issue here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the whole lives of many people in the community are being affected by the Government's decision.  We have spoken on this side of the House, and members on the other side have accepted the position in regard to the hardship that the cut in the food subsidies will cause to the very weakest sections of the community. I suggest to the Minister and his Government that any steps would have been justified, or almost any steps, to avoid taking the action which they took at the beginning of last month.  We have suggested one way of avoiding that and the Minister, I suggest, has not answered our argument.</P>
      <P>When the Minister is replying, he may perhaps point out the difficulties involved in keeping on the import levies at the level at which they were before he cut some of them, and changing them from capital to current account.  He may point out, as he did in his Budget speech, that by leaving the imports levies on, he would create difficulties, for example, in the manufacturing industries and the assembling industries, such as the radio industry. These are arguments in favour of cutting the import levies.  They are arguments for giving reliefs to certain sections, but I do not think they outweigh the argument for keeping the levies and putting them into current account, because it is agreed on all sides of the House that this is a difficulties year for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a choice between the economic chaos which will come about as a result of the withdrawal of the food subsidies and the imposition of temporary difficulties on certain sections, I know which way a Government which had the interest of the community at heart would decide.  We do not suggest that Deputies opposite liked cutting the food subsidies.  I feel sure they would have liked to have increased them.  We are agreed they did not do it for sadistic reasons.  The <Col N="635" /> Deputies opposite are past masters at the political art and they know the political effects of what they are doing.</P>
    <P>I think they did it out of incompetence. The action of the Government clearly demonstrates that they have not got the proper approach to the economic and financial difficulties of the country.  I believe any other Government would have taken any steps other than the cutting of the food subsidies.  However, it is done now. Deputies on this side of the House know what is happening in the case of old age pensioners whose extra shilling a week does not last them until Wednesday.  We know what is happening to people who were in receipt of tuberculosis allowances or home assistance.  I wonder is it too Utopian to think the Government might change their minds.  Perhaps it is too much to hope that the Government might set here are other ways of balancing the Budget besides cutting the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>May I suggest that the Minister for Finance bring in a four or five line Bill next week amending the Central Fund Bill?  We will support such a Bill; he will not have any difficulty in getting it through.  Such a measure would involve the reimposition of the import levies, which might cause difficulties in the industries concerned, but let us weigh that against the social effects and the economic effects of what the Government are doing.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we have naturally been concerned to discover the well-kept secret of the Government their financial and economic policy.  We know they had to review the situation when they got into office. However, they have had more than the month of six weeks referred to by Deputy Burke; they have been three months in office now and all they have produced is the Budget.  We would like to know what their financial and economic policy is.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will answer this question: does he believe that cutting the food subsidies is a disinflationary move, or does he believes that, by cutting the food subsidies, by increasing prices and taxation he will bring <Col N="636" /> about conditions of smaller demand, conditions which will reduce the demand for our industrial goods, consequently reducing the demand for labour and bringing about more unemployment? Does he believe that his policy, as enshrined in the Budget, is one likely to inflate the economy?</P>
    <P>I want to say that I believe in a policy now aimed at inflating the economy.  Indications of a fall in employment, of smaller industrial production and the fact that we have the balance of payments in equilibrium, all indicate that a policy aimed at inflating the economy is now justified. Does the Minister agreed?  If he does, where are his financial proposals and when is that policy to be put into operation?  Just as every Deputy on the opposite side wants full employment and a higher standard of living, so do we.  There is no use arguing about it.  We are all agreed, but we disagree on the means by which these ends are to be achieved.</P>
    <P>We particularly disagree when the Government come in and say they are in favour of bringing about conditions of greater employment and of increased industrial production, when at the same time they take steps to produce the opposite effects.  I believe that is what is being done in the Budget.  Last year, the action of the Government solved a very difficulty balance of payments problem.  Consequently, the present Minister is not faced with that problem.  In 12 months very grave difficulties were overcome and, in the first quarter of this year, there was considerable expansion of our exports, particularly our agricultural exports. This Government have got an economy which should be inflated, requiring the pumping of more credit into it.  The people and the resources are there and all the country needs is the inflation of its economy.</P>
    <P>It should like to know if the Minister agrees with that proposition.  I oppose the measures taken by the Government in this year's Budget, not just for social reasons, for the consequences which will flow to the weakest sections of the community, not just because the weaker sections are being asked to bear greater burdens, but also for <Col N="637" /> economic reasons.  I think it is high time there was a statement by the Minister as to what he believes is the best type of policy at the present time &mdash;whether a disinflationary one or one likely to inflate the economy.  Secondly, I should like the Minister to tell us which is his policy and how it is to be borne out by his financial proposals. I feel quite sure that the results of the Minister's Budget this year will be of a disinflationary character and that, far from relieving the situation of which we all wish to be relieved, it will aggravate it.</P>
    <P>The Government have had three months now in which to make up their mind.  They were a long time in office previously, so that the affairs of Government were not new to them on this occasion.  They have had two and a half years in Opposition during which to lay their plans.  Some members of the Government told us of their plans when in Opposition.  I should like to know now where these plans are and what they are.  Perhaps the Minister would let the House and the country know.</P>

In this respect, many of the Deputies on the other side seem to be living in the clouds.  In 1923, the Government that came in here were faced with civil war.  When Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932, they were faced with the economic war in which our agricultural production was negligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 2, line 32, to add after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;: &ldquo;provided that no person shall be refused any specialist <Col N="638" /> service on the grounds of mere inability to pay such charge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have tabled this amendment, on this stage of the Bill, to the first section of the Bill.  The reason for this amendment will, I think, be apparent to Deputies who took part in the debate on the Committee Stage.  In order to explain the reason for it I think I should remind the House that under this Bill the Minister proposes to interfere with the principle upon which the Health Act of 1953 was accepted by Dáil Éireann.  That principle was that, under the Health Act of 1953, all eligible persons would henceforth be entitled to free specialist facilities.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind Deputies that, under that Act, little or no charge was intended to be made in regard to the provision of free medical services for the poorer sections of the community.  A big departure was the provision in the Act that each family doctor, attending an eligible person under the Health Act, would have available on behalf of his patient the full range of specialist facilities in our leading teaching hospitals, without any charge whatsoever.  Of course, as Deputies will remember, the Bill having become an Act towards the end of 1953, it was brought into operation by the then Minister for Health, the present Minister for Finance, who left office without having devised a means whereby these free specialist services could in fact be provided for eligible persons.</P>
    <P>It then became my responsibility, as his successor, to see in what way such services could in fact be provided.  On 1st April, 1956, just some 15 months ago, I was able to make the necessary Orders, providing that these facilities would henceforth be available to each eligible person enumerated and specified in Section 15 of the Health Act of 1953.  I regarded that as a step forward in the provision of necessary services for those in need.  I regarded it as an important step forward in the diagnosis of ailments, individual ailments of different people who might be suffering, and an encouragement to the family doctor to give improved treatment to his patients.  The steps taken provided the full ranges of the specialist <Col N="639" /> services in our lending teaching hospitals for each eligible person.  If an X-ray were required, the person merely had to present a reference from his family doctor and whatever was required in that connection was provided without charge.</P>
    <P>If the patient required to see a consultant physician or any other consultant on the staff of any teaching hospital, he was entitled to do so, again merely on the reference of his family doctor.  In making this provision, I was fulfilling a pledge which I made to Dáil Éireann on the occasion of the passage of the Health Bill of 1954, a pledge by which I undertook to see as quickly as possible that all the services envisaged in the Health Act of 1953 would be provided in fact and not merely on paper.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I felt some concern that my successor as Minister in a Fianna Fáil Government should have brought in a proposal whereby the idea of free specialist services for needy persons would be destroyed.  I felt some concern and dismay that a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, after the passage of less than four years, should come into this Parliament pleading the case that the Fianna Fáil Minister in 1953 had acted unwisely and wrongly and that it was in some way wrong to provide for the needy sections of our people necessary specialist services, unless some payment were made for them.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will recollect, we debated on the Committee Stage the merits of the proposal to impose a charge contained in this Bill.  During the course of that debate, I and Deputy Dr. Browne and other Deputies raised the question of what would happen if the person needing and seeking this specialist service was, in fact, unable to pay.  I think it was Deputy Kyne who queried the Minister as to whether it was his attention, to be translated into regulations, that the charge sought would be paid before or after the service was provided.  The Minister informed the Dáil that it was his intention, so far as he could make it operative, that these charges would be paid in advance and, accordingly, the position confronts this House that <Col N="640" /> it is the Minister's intention to provide, when empowered, on the passage of this Bill, by resolution, that no person needing the services of a specialist may get such service unless, first of all, he planks down the money.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputies that whatever differences we may have with regard to the best means of providing health services for individuals in this State, surely there should be no disagreement amongst us that a person in need financially should always be provided with the medical aid he requires. In countries which we have been inclined to regard as being somewhat backward in the provision of social services it is, nevertheless, recognised that a sick person must, first of all, be treated before any question for payment can arise, but not, apparently, under the present Fianna Fáil Administration.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister, these services will not be provided, if he can prevent it, until, first of all, the charge specified in the regulations is paid. Not only do I think that wrong, but I think it a most unfortunate, retrograde step.  Further, whatever regulations may be made, whatever ministerial policy may be laid down, whatever directions may be issued, I am quite certain that the innate kindlness of our people will ensure that necessary services will, in fact, be provided whether or not a payment can possibly be made.  It is in order to ensure that we should not have on our Statute Book such a retrograde section of an Act of Parliament that I propose this amendment.  I am certain that there is no Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party or in the House who will cavil in the slightest at the amendment I suggest.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there be added to this section, agreeing as we must, since the House has decided, that the charges shall be imposed, a provision that no needed service shall be refused merely on the grounds that the person seeking the service is unable to pay.  I will exemplify what I have in mind only by reminding Deputies of cases within their own experience.  A person has some health trouble, perhaps a pain or an ache or something of that kind and he eventually summons up courage to <Col N="641" /> go to his doctor.  His doctor, having examined him, says: &ldquo;You are all right, but I think it might be wiser to have an X-ray examination, just to put your mind at case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the present section is not amended and such a person finds himself unable to provide the sum of 7/6, then it is the Minister's intention, as he said on Committee Stage, that such a person will not get the X'ray examination he requires.  I think any of us would say that that is wrong and all of us will agreed, if we were free to do so, that no needed specialist service of any kind can be refused by any health authority merely on the grounds that the person is unable to pay.</P>
    <P>If we are to accept the principle of imposing a charge, we can well understand a health authority, speaking through the county manager, saying: &ldquo;That person could well provide 7/6, if he ceases smoking for a day or two, if he did not go backing horses or dogs, or if he did not drink pints with his friends in the &lsquo;local&rsquo;.&rdquo;  There may be a case in which the inability to pay does not arise merely from lack of means.  In my amendment, I give to the Minister the right still to say that in those circumstances the person is not deserving, if the Minister wants to adopt that line, I would not agree with it.</P>
    <P>What I propose is the very minimum, the smallest provision that can be made.  Whatever the rights and wrongs of individual conduct may be, no health authority should be entitled, merely on the ground of lack of means, to refuse a medical service which a doctor thinks a patient of his requires. I urge on the Minister as strongly as I possibly can that an amendment along these lines should be accepted.  We should not permit this Bill to pass from this House containing the possibility, no matter how small it may be, that an official of a health authority may be empowered, merely because a person a needing a medical service has not the means at the time, to refuse such service.  It would be wrong that that should happen.  My amendment is reasonable.  It in no way impairs or takes from the change the Minister seeks to impose in the operation of the <Col N="642" /> Health Act, 1953, but it preserves the rights of a person who, temporarily, may be unable to pay.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and, if the Minister is unable to agree, I would appeal very sincerely to Deputies in his Party to regard this amendment not as something tabled by an Opposition Deputy to a Minister's Bill, but as something which we should incorporate in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister does not appear to consider it worth his while to contribute to this discussion.  If I am wronging him, I shall give way and let him speak.  The Minister should consider an amendment of this type seriously. On Committee Stage, an effort was made to tone down to some extent the wording of this section by allowing the section to become permissive rather than mandatory.  That was rejected by the Minister and, on a vote, it was subsequently rejected by the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister is simply being asked to accept this amendment or an amendment on similar lines which will safeguard the position which may arise in possibly only one case in 100 or in 1,000 where a person is genuinely unable to pay for the particular services.  As the Bill stands at present, together with the indication the Minister gave on Committee Stage of his mind on the question of payment, it would seem that payment should be made before the service is provided. That being so, it must be clear to Government Deputies that there may be an occasional case, particularly a hard case.  It may arise only once every now and again.  Even if it arises only once in every two, three, four or five years, it seems to me that we should make an effort to meet that case and provide for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I bow to the Minister if he wants to make the case that it is unlikely that a person will not be able to pay, or borrow, or earn the necessary three half-crowns.  However, maybe there will be a cases of a person who genuinely has not got and cannot get the 7/6 to put down in advance in order to get the service.  We are pleading that in that case&mdash;it may happen only one in five years&mdash;we should <Col N="643" /> make provision in this Bill so that that person will not be left without the service through being unable to raise the money.</P>
    <P>If the Minister sees any objection to incorporating that provision in his Bill, I suggest he should give the House the benefit of his views and the benefit of whatever arguments may exist against the amendment.  The Minister should not simply use his parliamentary majority to turn down an amendment of this kind, without giving the House even a word of explanation.</P>

      <P>This Bill concains certain novel measures and has been piloted through this House by a Minister for Health who is obviously ashamed of its contents.  It certainly must be rare that a Minister is so ashamed of his Bill that he is unable to defend it on an important stage in  passage through this House.  The Minister is afraid of what is in this Bill and was unable to stand on his feet five minutes ago to say anything in defence of it.  This is a Bill in which a Fianna Fáil Minister for Health reverses the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party and says <i>Mea culpa</i> on behalf of every member of the Fianna Fáil Party to the people for this country. This is a Bill in which the spurious election campaign of 1954 is demonstrated to have been worthless.  It is a Bill piloted by a Minister who is tongue-tied with shame, who cannot find words to defend its contents.</P>

    <P>I pity the Minister for Health.  He <Col N="644" /> sits there silent, reflecting on the speeches be made about health services in the general election of 1954 I pity him when he thinks how he and Deputy Dr. Browne pirouetted on the same stage three years ago.  No wonder he is silent.  No wonder he cannot find words on the Report Stage of the Bill to defend what is in it.

Under this Bill, if he is not in hospital but if he requires the services of a specialist, an X-ray or if he wants to see a physician or have a consultation with a surgeon, he must pay the appropriate charge.  The health authority has no right not to charge him because it is mandatory under this Bill that these charges shall be imposed.  In addition, if he has not the money to pay, under this Bill it is the Minister's intention and policy that he will not get the medical service he requires.  No wonder the Minister is silent.

I wonder do they know what is being done on their behalf and because they sit silent, ready to walk behind the Minister into a Division lobby?  Through this silent gentleman here, the Minister for Health, they are now passing into law a provision that henceforth, if you have not three half-crowns in your pocket, you cannot get an X-ray.

      <P>Do Fianna Fáil Deputies know further that, under Section 2, henceforth two-thirds of the patients in every mental hospital in the country can be charged 10/- per day for so long as they are there?  I am sure Fianna Fáil Deputies have constituents who from time to time suffer from mental illness.  In fact, I have no doubt they have.  They probably know of cases in which an unfortunate person gets ill and has to go to the district mental hospital, often maybe for the rest of his natural life. Under this Bill provision is made whereby the health authority may charge a person or his family&mdash;perhaps, the unfortunate wife who may be struggling at home&mdash;10/- a day, £3 10s. a week or £180 a year, year in and year out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Deputies also have suggested a modification in this and have implored the Minister to have second thoughts, at least to ensure that such appalling charges would not fall on the estate of a person in a mental hospital when, if they did fall, the manager of the hospital could be compelled under his obligation to sell out a small farm or a business in order to realise the maintenance charges lawfully due.  The Minister was adamant, the lash of the Minister for Finance has seared his <Col N="647" /> back and he must provide this money. A sum of £180,000 has to be provided from the sick people of this country, in order to pay money to the Turf Club, to the master bakers and to enable less good wheat to be disposed of.</P>

      <P>It is in the Budget and this is part of the Budget. This is all done in a Bill styled the Health and Mental Treatment Bill, 1957.  We have had Healths Bills in the past.  The policy of all of them was to improve someone's health.  It might have been a matter for question and disputation as to whether that aim would be achieved, but that was the object and policy of Health Bills in the past.</P>
      <P>We have had Mental Treatment Bills, too, again to make better provision for the treatment of the mentally ill.  Here is a double-plumed bird&mdash;a Health and Mental Treatment Bill, the policy of which is to deny health service to those who have not the money to pay and to provide that the mentally ill will pay more for the treatment.  This is in a Bill designed by the Fianna Fáil Government, supported by every Fianna Fáil Deputy and which the Minister himself could not defend on its Report Stage here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the point is that it is dear to be instance these days.  It costs too much&mdash;as the people found out on the 5th of March.  Deputy Davern might bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, I rise to remind Deputies&mdash;it is the last opportunity we shall have in this part of the Oireachtas&mdash; as to what is proposed in this Bill, what is sought to be done.  I tried on the Committee Stage and on the Report Stage, and other Deputies tried also, to improve in some way the provisions of this Bill, to ensure that it would not have the dire results which we foresee.  The Minister remained <Col N="648" /> seated there as if made of adamantine rock, as cold and silent as a rock.  He would not concede any amendment; he would not even permit the Bill to read that a health authority &ldquo;may&rdquo; impose those charges.  No, it had to be &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, not because the Minister for Health would agree with that but because the Minister for Finance cracked the whip and it had to be &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The money had to be got, because, of course, if it was not obtained the poor master bakers would have to go without.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be something on the conscience of every Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party, who might have done something at Party meetings or might have made some approach.  I know it is no good approaching the Minister for Health, but they might have made some approach to the Minister for Finance, who after all, should not have disowned the Health Act of 1953 in such a singular fashion.  They did not do so and here the poor Minister for Health, who as Minister for Finance sanctioned the Health Act of 1953, is put in this absurd position, that he is driven at the point of a bayonet to strangle the Health Act of 1953 and, of course, he does so as any other stranger would do it&mdash;silent, brooding, unable to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of the Labour Party in this matter is known to everyone.  Whatever differences we may have an political Parties, at least we gave our full support to the Fianna Fáil Party, then in Government, when they introduced the Health Act.  I did not think then we would come within a few years to the stage of deciding not to go further forward in the improvement of health benefits for the people, but instead would take a retrograde step&mdash;and this is the first step in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the present Government should decide so quickly on that line of approach.  I am not interested in throwing points at the Minister or the Government as to what they decided to provide money for in the Budget.  What I am worried about is the line of approach of the <Col N="649" /> present Government in health matters. There are Deputies here who&mdash;as I know from their approach to those matters when speaking down the country &mdash;would certainly consider it their hast wish to decide on this retrograde step.  It has been said that those with medical cards are not affected.  We know that; but we know also that in every county there are numerous borderline cases.  Members of every political Party on the local council know that, even when they approach the county manager or local officials, the decision is given against these people, although often their circumstances are such that if a little more sense prevailed in local affairs in relation to the giving of these cards, much could be done to relive the problems of such people.  However, the county managers and the local officials are acting within their rights; they are not doing anything they should not do; they are doing what they are entitled to do by law.</P>
    <P>It is because so many people have been denied the benefit of a medical card and so many of these people are now to be called upon again to pay extra&mdash;whether in the case of maintenance in a general hospital, maintenance of a person in a mental institution, or providing 7/6 for an X-ray&mdash;that this will be a very bitter problem for the people throught rural Ireland, as well as in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>It seems quite obvious from the approach of the Minister to the whole discussion that he has no interest in any proposal or amendment that might be put down by any Party.  I have to finish on the note of saying to the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;and I say it as one who can claim friendship with many of them in the country&mdash;that I am very sorry, after the Labour Party gave its full support to the important measure which the Fianna Fáil Government introduced in the 1952-53 period, that the division is now being caused by a member of the Government who, in 1952, realised the necessity of providing these advantage for the people, but who now, unfortunately, sees fit to take from these people some of those advantages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make <Col N="650" /> my position clear in regard to this Bill. I oppose the Bill and, as I said on a previous stage, I consider it a disgraceful Bill.  It is disgraceful because it is a departure from the fine tradition of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to health legislation.  The experience and the magnificent results of the provisions of the 1947 Health Act are there for the Minister to see. Nobody knows more intimately than the Minister the valuable advantages that have flowed from the Act in the different spheres of health with which it dealt and, in particular, in relation to the provision of services free of charge.</P>
      <P>In the light of the benefit which were brought to the sick people of this country by the elimination of charges of one kind or another, the improvements in the health services, the improvement in the health of our people, the reduction of disease and the reduction in deaths that followed from the provisions of that Bill, it seems extraordinary to me that a responsible and conscientious Minister interested in promoting health services should introduce a Bill which is a departure even from the relatively moderate provisions of the 1953 Health Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that a Bill like this, which is a tax-gathering Bill at the expense of the sick, no matter what the Minister may choose to call it, will reduce the standard of treatment and increase the amount of pain and suffering which many will have to submit to because it will make good health services more difficult to get. There is no doubt about that.  All this additional hardship and suffering which this Bill will ensure during the months and years in which it is in operation is put on the people, the sick and the under-privileged in our society, and is all done in a context in which the Government asks for restraint on the part of these people on whom it will impose severe hardships in every aspect of their lives. Because of that fact, I know, as a doctor, that this type of Bill can only cause a deterioration in the standard of treatment the people will get because I also know that the correct <Col N="651" /> and the only possible health service which will give adequate treatment is one with no means test and free of charge.  I have, therefore, no hesitation in opposing this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am not giving way.  Of course, I will ask as many questions as I like.  The Deputy is sunburned, but I will make him blush. The Deputy has the hardihood to come here and hypocritically criticise what is in this Bill and impugn the motives and sincerity of the Fianna Fáil Party. He is the Deputy whose very first legislative action was to suspend the operation of the 1953 Act; whose first administrative act was to deprive those persons who are covered by Section 15 of the benefits of the 1953 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He would have us believe he was genuine and sincere in his hypocritical attempts to amend this Bill.  I am not entitled to speak on anything except what is in the Bill. And what is in the Bill is a principle which, I think we all agree, is at least an equitable and just one in relation to a great many services.  The principle is that those who enjoy the benefits of the services should contribute when they can to the cost of them.  We do that in relation to transport. We do that in relation to electricity supply and I do not see why we should not do it in relation to medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne, who is at least consistent in his attitude in this matter, has described this as a disgraceful Bill.  I can see noting disgraceful in asking a person, who is in a position to do so, to contribute a moderate sum towards the cost of his unkeep and maintenance if he should happen to be confined in a hospital which is supported by public funds, supported out of taxation which is contributed in large measure by people who cannot afford to contribute to the cost of institutional treatment.  This Bill does not affect these people.  What is in this Bill relates entirely to Section 15 cases, to the people who can afford to contribute something.  But the principle was accepted by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins when he was driven <Col N="653" /> at last to putting the 1953 Act into operation.  We are merely saying now that, in the light of changed circumstances, where a person can reasonably be expected to contribute more than 6/- for institutional treatment, then it is only fair and equitable to everybody that the local authority should be able to ask him to do so.</P>
    <P>Let us take the other case, the case of the person who avails himself of specialist services on the advice of a general medical practitioner and who is asked to pay 3/- or 2/-, whichever may be the appropriate charge, when he goes to see the specialist.  I cannot, of course, refer to the fact that there was the absurd proposition, and there has been the absurd case made against this Bill, that a person who has not got 3/- or 2/- will be compelled to pay. In fact, if a person has not the 3/- or the 2/- he is then properly classifiable as a person who is a member of the lower income group and as such entitled to free specialist services.  The same applies in the case of the person who requires an X-ray.</P>
    <P>I cannot conceive of any person who is clearly outside the lower income group finding any difficulty in providing 7/6 for an X-ray examination, or a series of X-rays.  That certainly does not appear to me to warrant the application of the word &ldquo;disgraceful&rdquo; to the measure, and that was the word Deputy Dr. Browne used.  It is purely a question as to whether it is reasonable to ask a person who us undergoing an X-ray examination and who, again, is in a position to pay something, to contribute 7/6 towards the cost of that x-ray.  There is nothing disgraceful and there is nothing unreasonable in that.</P>
    <P>There is no question that under this Bill people will as a general universal rule, be compelled to pay 10/- per day even during the period when they are undergoing instituional treatment. That is the maximum that can be charged.  What they ought to be charged is left to the discretion and judgment of the local authority.  I do not believe that any local authority will act rigorously, unjustly or unfairly in assessing a person's ability to pay.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be very much more to be said.  We have had <Col N="654" /> long speeches on this Bill.  We have had long speeches designed mainly to cover up the doubtful past of the Deputy and his Party in regard to health services.  Just as they have changed their views on a number of other matters, they also appear to have changed their views in relation to this.</P>

He forgot to add it had been accepted by Dáil Éireann in face of the unrelenting and, indeed, irresponsible opposition of the Fine Gael Party. But that was the whole tenor of Deputy O'Higgins's speech.  I accept the ruling of the Chair, but I am certainly amazed at the hardihood of the Deputy whose speech took that form and was constituted in that way, in rising and asking the Chair to say that it was only what was in the Bill should be discussed.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment I was dealing with the position that obtained in the years when we had to go through an economic war followed by the Great War, and the emergency that arose from it and the expense of all that.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government and the Fianna Fáil Government combined, during those 25 years, left a total dead weight debt for the services of which we had to pay £4,200,000 a year.  That was the dead Party Government came into office.  In three and a half years, that dead weight debt was increased, after the spree of the Party opposite, to £10,000,000 odd per annum.</P>

In reply to a question I asked the Minister for Finance a fortnight ago, I was informed that the dead weight debt to-day is £15,500,000, after the second spree of the inter-Party Government. That means that, no matter what Government is in power, the unfortunate people of this country will have to find each year £15,500,000 to pay for two inter-Party sprees.  The facts are there.

      <P>Deputy Corry, on the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That dead weight debt is something that cannot be avoided. The second large bill that we have to face is also due to the action of the inter-Party Government.  I mean, the making permanent of 4,300 temporary civil servants who were recruited during the emergency.  They were made permanent in 1948, as soon as the inter-Party Government came into office.  At that time we were paying about £7,500,00o per annum for civil servants; to-day we are paying £17,000,000.  That is something the Minister for Finance should get to work on.  In view of the Minister's statement here, I was amazed when a constituent sent me by post last week a public advertisement issued by his Department if further recruitment of civil servants, and I call his particular attention to it.  The increase in the interest that must be paid for borrowed money represents £11,350,000 a year over and bove the 1948 figure. That, taken with the increase in the cost of the Civil Service, amounts to an extra load of taxation of £17,000,000 a year before there is a penny for anything. Before they pay for anything else, the people must find £32,000,000 a year for interest on borrowed money and for the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy D. Costello talking glibly about temporary measures, Yes; there were many temporary measures taken.  There was a temporary measure taken when some £4,000,000 of the Road Fund that should be in the pockets of the local authorities remained due.  The money from the Road Fund for 1954-55 was not paid to the local authorities on 20th March, 1957.  None of the money for the 1955-1956 period was paid to any local <Col N="659" /> authority for that year.  The Minister for Local Government had to stand up here and tell us that there was £2,600,000 due on the 1954-1955, 1955-1956 period and the local authorities, in order to continue employing the road workers, bad to borrow the money from the bank and pay interest on it.</P>
    <P>There was £40,800 of the amount for the year 1954-1955 due to Cork County Council on 20th March, 1957.  That £40,800 was forwarded by the Minister for Local Government, after he came into office on 30th March.  There is still due to Cork County Council, £200,000, money that has been spent in giving employment to road workers in Cork county and money which we had to borrow from the bank and on which we are paying interest.  That genius, owing that money, last year borrowed £500,000 from the Road Fund to pay God knows what.</P>

I suggest to the Minister for Finance that the first means he should take to <Col N="663" /> lighten the burden on the people is to stop recruiting for the Civil Service immediately.  I should like to hear from him when he is concluding what employment he has found for the staff engaged on the subsidies.  Where have they gone and what are they doing? Are they still being continued in employment and if so what work are they doing?  A certain number of the workers of this country produce wealth but there is a large number of unproductive workers as well.  Unfortunately we have got into a position here where we are being ruled not by the Government, not by the elected representatives of the people, but by the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>Let us get down to bedrock. We have a big leeway to make up.  I consider it my duty to point out ways and means by which this leeway can be made up, purely within the terms of this Bill.  There are certain items of expenditure over which we have no control.  We have to find £15,500,000 every year to pay the interest and sinking fund on borrowings of the last Government.  We could put a stop to Civil Service recruiting. The Minister said we could save £250,000 there.  I would not sack anyone. I would let them go at the age of 65 and gradually get down to the 1948 level when the Coalition Government appointed 4,300 permanent civil servants in one day.  There is that number of unwanted men and women in the Civil Service to-day.  That is a burden for which the country cannot afford to pay.</P>

That figure stood at £4,000,000 in 1948.  The two sprees of the Coalition Governments made up the balance. I have no intention of holding the House.  I rose to give these few facts, facts which have already been given in reply to questions asked in the House.  Deputy Sweetman borrowed £500,000 from the Road Fund. Why did he do that?

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In opening my remarks, I was referring to the fact that Deputy Corry made statements <Col N="669" /> here in the course of his contribution that have not, to my knowledge, ever been supported by any Minister in the Government or any member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He comes into this House to criticise the capital development programme of the previous Government and to refer to the debt which the country now has to bear in consequence of the investment of these moneys.  I should like to know from the Minister for Finance whether or not he considers it important to invest the money that was invested in land reclamation housing development rural electrification and other projects? That investment was initiated by the predecessors of the present Government and, during the previous period in which the work of the inter-Party Government was interrupted for a short time, the Fianna Fáil Party did not drastically curtail the schemes that were operated under the capital developments programme of the first inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>It is true that the land reclamation scheme or the Dillon scheme&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;was to some extent curtailed, but not drastically.  There were other schemes that were not pushed ahead with the same virity with which their originators introduced them and which were later brought to complete fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask Deputy Corry or any other rural Deputy whether he objects to the expenditure of the millions that went into rural electrification or whether he thinks it proper or improper that this generation should be called upon to pay for that development? What is or was it not good development? Would they have preferred if rural electrification, the erection of sanatoria throughout the country or telephone development had to wait until current revenue could do it?  Was that ever the policy o the Party opposite?  Is it its policy?  If it is not, how can they sit there silently, permit Deputy Corry to perform as he did and quote time and again that these moneys were lavishly spent and wasted without ever going into the details of how the moneys were spent? He never pointed to the hundreds of lives saved because of the capital <Col N="670" /> investment in the erection of sanatoria in this country.</P>
    <P>How can Deputies stand over that kind of conduct by one of their own colleagues when they k ow that he is completely wrong and when they know and appreciate the benefits that flowed from the investment of moneys over the past ten years in this country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The sanatoria moneys come mostly from the Hospital Trust FUnds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not most of it. In fact, the schemes to which the Deputy refers were also at one time described by his Party as a white elephant.  The Deputy will recall that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then Deputy Corry lashes out at Marshall Aid.  It is true, of course, that £26,000,000 of Marshall Aid was left in the coffers by the first inter-Party Government.  That money came in quite useful for the present Taoiseach when he spent it from July, 1951, to January, 1952.  Can any Deputy deny that?  If it was wrong to have accepted Marshall Aid why was it that the £26,000,000 was not returned whence it came?  The Government cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>Deputies on the opposite side, including Deputies Burke and MacCarthy, spoke of the bills that have to be paid.  They said that the impositions in the Budget had been caused because of the misdeeds and neglect of the previous Government.  I would ask Deputies MacCarthy and Burke, what Government preceded the Government which was in office in 1947?  How long before was there a Government other that the Fianna Fáil Government and why was there a need for a Supplementary Budget in that year amounting to £7,500,000? Who had they to blame in those days? Was it not the constant policy of those opposite to increase taxation on the people and is not this Finance Bill putting still another load on the taxpayers of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach points out that we have reached the point of diminishing <Col N="671" /> returns and his regret is that he cannot impose additional taxes because, if he does so, the returns will be reduced since we have reached the point where if we put on more taxation we will not get the revenue estimated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government in the Budget and now in the Finance Bill seek legislative authority for the principles in the Budget.  At this stage, the House is in a much better position to assess the consequences of the Budget than it was a few months ago when it discussed the Budget proper because by now very many people will have brought to the attention of Deputies on the opposite side of the House how seriously every family and home have been affected by this Budget.</P>
      <P>The House is now being asked to give legislative authority to the proposals to increase taxation and to wipe out the food subsidy.  It is only a few months since the people were faced with a very confident proclamation. &ldquo;Let us get cracking,&rdquo; it said. There were no obstacles in the way. The only thing needed was to vote them into power, give them the authority and allow them to &ldquo;get cracking,&rdquo; The Government &ldquo;got cracking.&rdquo; and what have they done? If they had indicated to the electorate it was their intention to crack down as they are, would any Deputy opposite think that the electors would give him authority to sit on that side of the House?  How many Deputies are sitting there because of the criticism they levelled at the inability of the last Government to achieve wonders and because they led so many people to believe that all that was necessary for the country to experience wonderful results was a change from one side of the House to the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the result, the Minister for Finance attempted to put it across that he was faced with no other alternative than to wipe out the food subsidies since he had passed the point of no return in relation to taxation, <Col N="672" /> as the Taoiseach indicated.  What effects are already beginning to flow from his action in wiping out the remainder of the food subsidies?  The only authority the Government Party had to do it was that the country was forewarned and the electorate ignored the warning.  Consequently, there are many thousands of people who are heart searching because of the fact that they did not heed the warning which, if they had taken it to heart, would have brought about far different results.</P>
    <P>We are now experiencing the consequences of the enactment of these budgetary considerations.  We find an attempt being made&mdash;and I stress the word &ldquo;attempt&rdquo;&mdash;to compensate the poorer and weaker sections of the community for the impact upon them of the increase in the cost of living&mdash;a compensation which is pitiably and completely inadequate.  There was no provision whatever for those unfortunate people still in our community who have got to exist on home assistance. I know of specific instances where people are not on the point of desperation in consequence of the charges they have to meet, not for television sets, not for betting on the tote, but to purchase bread, butter, sugar and tea.</P>
    <P>They are facing difficulties they never envisaged or never expected they would have to encounter a few brief months ago but it does not stop there.  How many people are faced with increased problems?  How many escaped the impact of the Budget?  The better classes escaped it.  It is very clear that people who enjoy meat three times a day are not concerned about the price of butter or bread but those in the middle income group, those who work in the open and those engaged in physical labour realise it.</P>
    <P>What effect will it have on the rates? Already the despised public officials, about whom Deputy Corry speaks so disparagingly, have been working to ascertain what the impact will be on the cost of running the very many public institutions in the country arising out of increases consequent upon the withdrawal of the food subsidies. I can recall in respect of one <Col N="673" /> institution of which I was a governor the impact of the partial withdrawal of the food subsidies way back in 1952. It was serious but it is as nothing to the bill the South Charitable Infirmary in Cork will have to bear in consequence of the complete withdrawal of the food subsidies.  It is not a very big institution.  What will be the effect upon mental hospitals and every hospital throughout the country?  How can the Minister contend that he was made a complete saving as a result of the withdrawal of the food subsidies when these charges must be borne by the local authorities and to some extent by the Exchequer?</P>
    <P>It was pointed out by other Deputies that the best kept political secret of modern times is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party and Government.  It is not enough, as week follows week and month follows month, to say that the Government are newly in office that there is time enough and that they will indicate in the dim and distant future what their policy is in relation to problems affecting the country. When they ask this House and this country for such a for midable bill this year, we expect and the country expects, the Leader of the Government, An Tánaiste or the Minister for Finance to indicate to the House and, through the House, to the country what proposals the Government have to deal with the problems which they say so seriously affect our community.</P>
    <P>What do we see consequent on the Government's accession to office in relation to some indication of their assessment of the situation and the probable changes that would emanate? We see £1,750,000 of levies remitted, an easement in hire purchase&mdash;the roof is off.  It is again possible for people to get what may not be absolute necessities on a very accommodating hire purchase system operated, in the vast majority of cases, by companies and firms based outside this country.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister or the Government think that in difficult times for the securing of capital it was wise to ease the hire purchase regulations?  I shall give a specific instance.  I discussed the problem with a trader in a small town last August.  I thought he would feel <Col N="674" /> extremely sore with the inter-Party Government for the effect which the tightening-up of hire purchase facilities would have on his business.  He was engaged in the retail sale of electrical equipment, motor cycles, and so on, in a rural town.  For from being critical, I found he felt that the Government's action was long overdue and that the hire purchase restrictions were absolutely necessary.  He spoke of the difficulties which he experienced.  He told me of men with insufficient means who used to come to his shop and, by putting down a deposit fo £5, walk out with a motor cycle.  The unfortunate shop owner used to have the job of tracing many of these persons all over the country in order to recover the remaining instalments.  His lot has not been eased because the roof is off again and there is n restriction left on hire purchase.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government and the country appreciated the vital necessity of speeding up the savings campaign and of bringing home to every person the necessity for saving in view of the capital problems with which we had to contend.  In face of the disequilibrium of our payments abroad at that time, there was strong need for the pursuance of a very prudent policy in relation to savings.  The organisation set up by the last Government did much good work and no doubt it is an asset to the country at the present time.  It inspired many wage earners to set aside a portion of their earnings in savings.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Budget, the Taoiseach, in passing, said he did not think there were very great problems in relation to small savings as there was a good response on that score.  His concern was more in relation to the inadequacy of the larger sums invested in the various loans floated by the Government in recent years.  In the circumstances, I wonder if it was prudent to ease up in any way on the active programme of propaganda, speech-making and appeals and of availing of every opportunity to bring home to our people the vital necessity of maintaining our capital programme by the investment of our money in this country?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> When the levies were imposed last July, the country was faced with a problem.  That was why the then Government introduced them.  The only criticism at that time from the Party who are now in Government but who were then in Opposition was that the action taken by the inter-Party Government was inadequate.  Time has proved the adequacy of that action.  There are many people who think it would have been wiser for this Government to retain the levies.  There was no indication that any Gvernment would not alone impose additional taxation in a Budget but would wipe out the existing food subsidies because of a situation which they claimed existed.  If the situation were as serious as all that, why did this Government not retain the levies and avail of the £1,7500,000 which they gave away to assemblers and which they gave away for the purchase of goods which were not necessities&mdash;radios, gramophones, television sets, high-powered cars, and so on?</P>
    <P>Levies may have been imposed on certain items in respect of which a case could be made for their prudent removal or for an easement.  There may be a case for the removal of a levy and we may see that when the levy is removed there is absolutely no reduction to the consumer who buys the item in question.  It would be interesting to investigate that matter and to discover who avails of the benefit when the levy is remitted.  Who gains from it?  The consumer, whom the removal of the levy was ostensibly intended to benefit, does not gain.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned with the chaos now resulting in the dairying industry in consequence of the remarkable reduction in the consumption of butter by reason of the withdrawal of the subsidy.  Any creamery ociety in the South will tell the Minister or any interested person that the reduction is grater than anything that was estimated. I am sure many persons in the industry feared that this would occur at some time or other and estimated what the impact would be on sales but they never at any time anticipated that they would be as adversely affected as <Col N="676" /> they have been by the remarkable reduction in butter consumption in recent weeks.  Creamery butter is selling in Dublin at a much lower price than down the country.  That creamery butter was not made in the Republic of Ireland.  It is being slipped over the Border by the ton every night.  It is displacing Munster butter.  Every lb. of butter of displaced Munster butter will have to be exported and will carry a subsidy of 1/3½, to pay the British to eat the butter which we will not give to our own people.  That has been well described by Deputy Sweetman as the economics of a madhouse.</P>
    <P>The Government are building up a new problem for themselves.  Perhpas I should not use the expressing &ldquo;new problem&rdquo;, as the problem was there already&mdash;the problem of the exportable surplus of butter.  However, that prpblem was intensely aggravated when many homes must now watch carefully the amount of butter which is put on a child's cut of bread.  Margarine will have to be brought into the house perhaps for the first time in memory.  Even in rural villages, shops are now stocking margarine and displacing the products of our Munster dairying industry.  That is one adverse result from the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  Where, either in the Finance Bill or in the Budget, is there provision for the subsidisation of butter for export?  How much will it cost the Exchequer this year to pay the foreigner to eat the butter which we would not give to our own people?</P>
    <P>Before I pass from reference to the capital development programme, I want to refer to Deputy Corry.  He spoke in his customary fashion, in sarcastic and cynical terms of the fact that one private concern in this country saw fit to have enough faith in the future of the country to advance £500,000 and invest it in a concern that would reduce our imports and give employment.  If they desired to be associated with this concern, all credit to them.  Is it not a pity we had not more firms of their calibre prepared to do as much?  If we had, perhaps the problems facing the country to-day would be far fewer.  It was a discreditable <Col N="677" /> performance on the part of Deputy Corry to cast aspersions on the magnificent achievement of getting such a firm to advance such a colossal amount of money and to put it to such effective use.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with Deputy MacCathy that the Government now in office finds itself hurriedly embarking on a programme.  That Government had two and a half years in opposition.  No doubt they were vigilant in opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy MacCarthy shed tears, which I fear were crocodile tears, about the monopolistic firms that were buying up small bakeries in Cork. Deputy MacCarthy is fully aware that he voted for a Budget which gave a] gratuity of £230,000 to the very monopolies to which he refers.  He is aware that the case made for the payment of that £230,000 to the master bakers was that they had incurred <Col N="678" /> certain expenses in relation to increased wages awarded to the bakers in their employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last Government were adamant in rejecting the recommendation that these master bakers were entitled to these concessions. It would be interesting for Deputy MacCarthy to inquire whether the firms that were given £230,000 were the firms that actually paid the increased wages and to inquire how much of the retrospective compensation is being paid, has been paid or will be paid to the poor, unfortunate, small firms that were wiped out and about which Deputy MacCarthy expressed so much concern.  Perhaps he would find to his amazement that the combine that bought out these small bakeries and was later compensated for the impact of increased wages on the firms they put out of existence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacCarthy was rather firm in his conviction that much of the improvement in the balance of payments has been secured at the expense of running down essential stocks.  If that is true, it is an astonishing thing that the Minister to whom he gives allegiance took the levies off £1,200 cars, radiograms and television sets, and allowed the levies remain on goods in the category to which Deputy MacCarthy referred.  Surely the Government which he supports could discriminate? If what Deputy MacCarthy alleges is correct, surely it could have been rectified before the Government gave back £1,750,000 to the motor assembly people, the radio manufacturers and the radiogram dealers&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have discussed it with the workers and I would advise the Deputy to be a little timorous before he approaches many workers in <Col N="679" /> this country or in his constituency at the moment.  Of course, there is no doubt that the industry to which Deputy MacCarthy, Deputy Booth and many other Deputies referred&mdash;the motor industry&mdash;has been hit very hard in this Budget.  It has been quoted in the daily Press, and has not been controvereted, that there has been a reduction in motoring in consequence of the additional impost of 6d. per gallon on petrol.</P>
      <P>How then could anybody sit behind the present Government and shed tears over the impact of the levies on £1,200 motor cars when they trotted into the Lobby and voted for an additional 6d. a gallon on petrol, which hits every section of the community, people who never had or never will have a car?  When distribution and delivery costs are afected so seriously, not alone by the 6d. a gallon on petrol but by the earlier action of the Minister's colleague in allowing insurance rates to rise as they did, there is no doubt that in time the pocket of the ordinary consumer will be affected.</P>
      <P>I think hat exhausts the remarks I have to pass in relation to this Bill.  I shall conclude by again asserting that, as day follows day and as week follows week, since this Government introduced the measures in this Budget, which the House is now called upon to confirm, the people of the country have grown daily more conscious of the impact on their lives of the retrogression in business, the general dissatisfaction and, above all, the general discontent caused by the introduction of the harsh measures in this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that, when in opposition, Deputy Lemass put it on record that an Opposition were not obliged to tell the Government what they would do if in Government&mdash;he said it was soley the duty of the Opposition to flay the Government in all its policies and that they were not obliged to put forward alternative proposals&mdash;alternative proposals were put forward from this side by Deputy Costello, the former Taoiseach, and by several who followed him, advancing one means by which the Minister could <Col N="680" /> have balanced his Budget.  That was in relation to the implementation of the levies to their fullest extent and by some other measures.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance replied to that lengthy Budget debate and completely ignored most of the observations made in the course of it.  I am a member of the House for many years and during that period no Minister sitting on that side ever ignored the criticisms offered of his Estimate or of his Budget in the manner in which the present Minister has done.  Even his predecessor, now the Minister for Health, would at leas have given us an histrionic performance to make up for any lack of content in the remarks made.  On this occasion, Deputy Dr. Ryan, in the course of his speech did not, I am afraid, either in the manner in which it was delivered or in its content, indicate to the House or the country that the circumstances were so serious or that such drastic steps had to be taken that everybody in the country, except those people looked after so well in the Budget, would have to tighten their belts. Then, to add insult to injury, we had Deputy Corry and others saying this was merely the first instalment.  If this is the first instalment, may God help the country when the people get the remaining chapters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing which strikes me about any discussion of this Budget is the immense and terrible gloom which descends on the Deputies opposite. We had it already in the Budget debate and again here to-night in this debate.  At least half the Deputies opposite know in their hearts that if they had been frank with the electorate &mdash;they personally or their leaders &mdash;they would not be sitting in this House to-night, as the country would have rejected any Party which told them frankly that they would find it necessary to impose these terrible restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Never once during the General Election campaign was there any intimation to the country that, if Fianna Fáil were returned to power, £9,000,000 would be taken out of the pockets of <Col N="681" /> the working classes and every man and woman who voted for a Fianna Fáil candidate would pay tribute for the next five years.  I am quite certain in my heart that, but for the fact that in the policy which they put before the country they never once indicated that the subsidies would be withdrawn if they were returned to power, the Fianna Fáil Party would not be sitting over there in government.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in a matter to which Deputy MacCarthy and Deputy O'Sullivan referred.  In the Budget debate I asked the Minister to indicate to the House and to the country&mdash;and in particular to the constituency in which I am interested, as also is Deputy MacCarthy&mdash;the whereabouts of the £230,000, roughly £250,000, which the Minister proposes to pay out on the basis of the Flour and Bread Commission recommendations. There are certain doubts in the minds of every Irish man and woman as to the whereabouts of that £250,000. It is proposed in this Finance Bill to pay out to the bakers £250,000 of the taxpayers' money, on he basis that certain increases in wages were allowed in the past which must now be recouped to the bakers.</P>
    <P>In the constituency which I represent Cork City&mdash;I think Deputy MacCarthy will be at one with me on this&mdash;certain bakeries have since been assimilated into a large combine. During the Budget debate I asked the Minister to whom the £230,000 was being paid out&mdash;was it being paid to the small bakeries who had to pay those increases, or to the large combines who had since assimilated those small bakeries?  In other words, were the taxpayers paying out to large combines money, which those combines had not to pay?  There has been no satisfactory answer so far.  I trust and hope that on this Bill, before the Minister asks us to vote in favour of it, some satisfactory explanation will be forthcoming on that point.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will assure the House that those smaller bajkeries which have been assimilated did not just pay not money which now will be collected by the larger combines which <Col N="682" /> have since assimilated them.  I am surprised and grieved that some indicaion has not been given already about this.  If the Minister remains silent on it now, I and other Deputies, including Deputy MacCarthy, and the country in general, can only presume that that money is being paid out to sources which the Minister is not anxious to divulge.  At a time like this, when the pocket of every wage earner is being plundered by the Minister and the Party he represents, £250,000 is a fair amount of money.  I implore the Minister, in his own interests and certainly in the interests of good government, to divulge where that money is going. What is its destination?  It is important that he would answer that.</P>
    <P>In voting for this Finance Bill. Deputies opposite are not just voting for the sums which patently appear on the face of the Bill.  They are voting for an increase of the rates in every local areas in which they reside, since it is inevitable that if the prices of bread and butter go up, the cost of administration will do likewise.  In the South Charitable Infirmary of Cork, to which committee of management I belong, like Deputy O'Sullivan, the costs will go up also.  Again, in addition to paying higher prices for tea and bread consumed in such institutions, it is likely there will be demands for increased wages.</P>
    <P>I would like to warn the Minister&mdash;I do not hold him personally responsible for it&mdash;that I have been told, and I believe, that this Budget is to be used by subversive elements to stir up a form of strife which we have not seen for many years.  It will be found, throughout the next few months, in many constitunecies, that a Party describing itself as the &ldquo;Unemployed Party&rdquo; will importune the public, pointing out the failure of the present type of Government and in some way trying to encourage strife.</P>
    <P>I believe, and have reason to believe, that that agitation is coming not from this country, but is being fomented not by real Irishmen but by so-called Irishmen sent back from England.  I know personally of at least two men who came back to this country, who have been residing here for the last <Col N="683" /> three months, without any employment, who have not signed on at the Labour Exchange and who are here purely to foment strife, on the basis that intolerable burdens are being placed on the unemployed and working classes.</P>
    <P>I merely mention that to the Minister so that he and this House and the country may be made aware of the fact that there is at the moment in process of evolution a new Communist assault upon this country.  I have no doubt about it myself and those who have heard the same stories as I have, have no doubt about it, that there is in this country a conspiracy to point the finger of scorn at all forms of native Government.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the country that that is inspired not purely from across the Channel, from the age&mdash;old enemy, but is being inspired by elements which are even further removed from us. I wish the Minister well in combating those elements.  Finally, I would refer again to the fact that, in imposing this intolerable burden brought about by the taking away of the subsidies on bread and butter, the Minister has opened the gate to criticism of that nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of speakers already have referred to the problem in relation to the food subsidies.  It is only natural that we in the Labour Party should be primarily concerned with the difficulties imposed on the workers, owing to increases in the prices of necessary foodstuffs because of the removal o the subsidies.  As well as affecting the homes of the workers, increased prices of foodstuffs will also affect every local authority hospital and every voluntary hospital in the country.  The Minister and the Government may tell us that, by the abolition o the food subsidies, so much money is being saved, which, in turn, may help to keep down taxation; but it must be equally true to say that, with increased costs for food in every hospital in the Twenty-Six Counties, an added burden will be imposed on the people who are qualified as ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem confronting the workers <Col N="684" /> at the present time is an enormous one, owing to this added burden.  The Minister may say that, if we consider the overall position, any recompense which the workers may get through increased wages would meet the difficult situation.  It is my view that the removal of the subsidies has completely upset the present balance, has destryed the hope of maintaining prices at a fairly normal level and of holding the wage structure on an even basis.</P>
    <P>There is no need to speak for long on this Bill because we have already expressed our views on it.  Nevertheless, it is important that we should draw attention to a few matters. Deputy Corry excelled himself to-night in his usual practice of drawing a red herring across the trail.</P>
    <P>I know that much of what he said was not correct and everyone in the House knows it.  It makes no difference because if Deputy Corry can appear as a warrior in defence of the Minister and his policy, then he is welcomed by his own Party and comes to the forefront to defend them in their houre of need. Indeed, if I wished to embark on a discussion of some of his statements, I would waste a long time and it would be boring to many members here.</P>
    <P>Suffice it to say that, while keeping within the ambit of the Bill before us, I wish to refute something which he said about the Cork Country Council. The problems mentioned by him existed many months back and there was no difference in any of them.  The only difference is that while members including Deputies Corry and MacCarthy, were vocal for many months in regard to some of these problems in relation to the holding up of housing, and so on now seem to have as their fall back when the same line of approach is being adopted by a different Government, the excuse: &ldquo;It is not our fault; it is the fault of the Government before us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In 1947 when the Fianna Fáil Government found it suitable to adopt very drastic measures, through the introduction of a Supplementary Budget, they could not blame a Government that had been in office before them, because we all know they had been in <Col N="685" /> office for many years.  It is ironical to have to admit that the policy introduced in the late autumn of 1947 is identical with the policy reintroduced in 1952 and again within the past few months, except for the fact that the longer it goes on, the more drastic it seems to be.</P>
    <P>It would be much more advantageous for us if we could try to get to the root of the problem confronting us.  I am not worried about what may be said about the last few months or about circulars issued during election time, quoting or misquoting statements of' opponents in the House last December. Deputy MacCarthy and others may recall some of that literature.  Let them now realise that whatever may have been gained by such an approach, the same problems confront them now as those which confronted the previous Government.  What strikes me most forcibly is that while that Government had decided on somewhat stringent efforts to relieve the financial problems which existed at the time, the difference between that Government and the present Government is that this Government insists on one policy and one only.  That policy is a complete cut-back, financially.</P>
    <P>I am sure that whatever side of the House we may belong to each and every one of us is faced, from time to time, with the problems of unemployment and emigration and I believe that every member of the House is anxious to see these twin problems solved.  Yet the line of approach in this Budget, the first Budget of the present Government, seems to me to be one of a cut-back on financial policy.  The present Minister and the present Administration are not correct when they tell us that they have a key to solve the existing problems.</P>
    <P>I am not worrying about the £100,000,000 that Deputy Lemass spoke so freely about some months ago.  I am not worrying when they tell us that they hope to solve unemployment and emigration within a certain period.  So long as they continue the present financial policy, a policy somewhat akin to that in operation in a country not far removed from here, but in which conditions are completely <Col N="686" /> different and in which over-employment rather than lack of employment seems to be the difficulty, surely the Minister and his Government must admit that we are moving in the wrong direction in our efforts to find a solution for these two problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry spoke about lack of finances.  Admittedly, heavy interest has to be paid for money secured by way of loan for the benefit of the people as a whole.  It is the collective responsibility of the Government to implement a progressive policy.  In the years from 1932 onwards, Fianna Fáil introduced measures which gave certain benefits to the people in rural Ireland.  They did that in the years when the Labour Party supported them.  Knowing now how often they themselves have got into financial difficulties, they must appreciate that the one solution is to bring us back to a sense of reality as to the direction in which we are going in order to secure the financial assistance which seems to be the only hope for the economic salvation of the country.</P>
    <P>We all remember the Act passed setting up the Central Bank.  The Central Bank is no use, unless it has the proper powers.  If its powers are limited, its activities are equally limited.  I remember Deputy Lemass in Opposition stating that, in his opinion, the powers of the Central Bank were either limited or else they were not being utilised to the fullest possible extent.  If that is so, and apparently he believes it is so, the only advantage will lie in the Government striking out on a bolder policy, a policy which will relieve the overall deadweight of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>I believe, as do my colleagues in the Labour Party, that the present aproach is not the right approach. We deplore the fact that there is such a deadweight of national debt. Considerable sums of money are] invested outside this country.  In order to secure even a modest loan, the Government has to offer the most attracative and most advantageous terms to induce or own people to invest their money at home.  We are not living in <Col N="687" /> a fool's paradise, we know that there are people who prefer to invest their money outside the country because the options look a better proposition and because they have their own personal welfare at heart rather than the welfare of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The members of the present Government have had many years of experience and they should make a bold attempt now to strike out along the one road which will lead to national recovery, rather than cut down on food subsidies, giving small benefits to some sections in the hope that these small benefits will mean increased employment. Last December&mdash;some people misquoted me subsequently when it suited them&mdash;I asked the then Government, on behalf of the Labour Party, to announce their policy.  Some Deputies will remember that.  Some Deputies went so far as to say that we wanted to join with Fianna Fáil.  We are a small Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are a small Party, but we believe in progressive Government for the country.  People may be genuine in the promises they make during election campaigns.  It is patently obvious now that the one hope for this country is not a continuation of the old policy.  As I said last December, the last Government failed in a certain degree because they were not prepared to strike out and implement a more forward policy in relation to our major problems.  If the present Government continue on a policy of cutting back, we shall find, at the end of their term of office, exactly the same problems confronting the people, the same pockets of unemployment all over the country and the same high volume of emigration from north, south, east and west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that proves to be the case, then we shall have to admit that democratic Government offers no solution.  It is not alone essential to-day to speak of a new look; it is even more essential to dress in new attire and to strike out in a different direction in, so far as <Col N="688" /> financial policy is concerned.  No Government can do great deal in a week, in a month or even in a year.  There is no excuse whatever for a Government when that Government and its responsible Ministers know that a certain policy has proved a dismal failure in the past and yet persist in offering that same policy to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>We are still discussing the Budget and many of u have had to sit here and listen to the people who have just left office asking a number of questions.  One of the things that seem to annoy the Opposition is that we did not announce our programme and our policy during the election campaign.  What exactly should we have done?  Should we have gone about, as the Coalition Parties did some five or six years ago, telling the people that every commodity that goes on the table woud be cheaper, that there would be better times for everybody and more money in everybody's pocket?  But, prior to the last election, we had the experience of these people swallowing their own words and talking about the difficult times that lay ahead and the difficult problems that faced the Government. It was an entirely different tune from the one we used to hear these Parties sing during previous election campaigns.</P>
      <P>To-day, when we are in office and faced with trying to balance a Budget that was left unbalanced by the outgoing Minister, we have to sit here and listen to the ex-Minister and the ex-Taoiseach who told us in the past 12 months that the people must work harder and there must be a greater output from industry; we must take off our costs and put our shoulders to the wheel in order to try again to build up prosperity in this country, prosperity which was taken away by whom?</P>

      <P>By those people across there who represent the Opposition. Why the Deputies who have made speeches from that side of the House did not go and read a very small document I have in my hand I do not <Col N="689" /> know.  It is the Report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee.  That committee was established by the previous Minister for Finance.  That committee met for the first time on the 30th November, 1956.  The Minister attended the first meeting, we are told, and stated that &ldquo;The immediate problem was an expected deficit in the capital Budget of 1957-58.  He indicated that it would be desirable if the committee were in a position to furnish a report on which decisions could be taken by the Government in relation to the framing of the Budget.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Did the former Minister go to the trouble and expense of setting up this committee for fun or did he want to get something valuable from them, something that he would take into consideration when he would be framing his Budget, as he hoped to be framing the Budget we had to bring in a shot time afterwards?  That committee went into this matter in detail and we have their recommendations.  I am quite satisfied that, had the Coalition Parties been returned to power and had Deputy Sweetman again been Minister for Fiance, not merely would we have the subsidies on bread and flour removed, not merely would wee have full effect given to the other recommendations that were made by this committee, but that the rebate on agricultural land would have been removed as was recommended.  I am also saisfied that the Land Commission expenditure would have been cut down as was also recommended by that committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is inconceivable that the members of Fine Gael, having considered all aspects of the financial position&mdash;because they are the people who dictated to the rest of the Coalition Parties&mdash; having examined this question in detail, seet up a committee to inquire into this problem just for the purpose of having a report and do nothing more about it.  I believe that the Minister for Finance and at least the other front benchers in Fine Gael know very well that had they been given the chance of another term in office we would not merely have had the removal of those subsidies but the implementation of the other recommendations also.  We would need to have, <Col N="690" /> because the position was deplorable. That report tells us the position in relation to our external assets and gives a number of details in relation to matters that must be looked into by the Government. The situation in regard to the vast majority of these matters has been brought about by the previous Government not facing up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>One of the most disastrous results of the Government's policy came from their handling of the unemployment situation.  Day after day the numbers on the labour exchanges grew with no notice being taken of it.  Every sensible man in the country realises that the most essential thing in any country in the world to-day is full-time employment in so far as it can be made available.</P>

      <P>I am merely saying it is the duty of the Government&mdash;and this relates to the Finance Bill&mdash;to try to give full employment to every man and woman willing and able to work. I do not think I am overstepping the mark in saying that.  It is one of the things the Coalition Parties completely neglected, and Labour sat blindly and idly behind while the other Parties were doing that.  If we do not do something quickly to provide employment there is no hope of a speedy recovery or of any recovery.  It is most essential, wherever you find money, to find it and put people into employment.  That is part of the effort we are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position we have found is that there was no money available for housing, that there are thousands and thousands gone to other countries looking for jobs.  We found the Road fund had been plundered, that county councils had a big problem in relation to road works.  To quote an example from my own county, not merely did the Government owe a large sum for housing to Galway Country Council, of which I have the honour to be a member, but the Government owed us by way of grants a sum of over £300,000 for which we had to pay 6 per cent. to <Col N="691" /> the banks.  I am sure that we in the Galway Country Council never visualised that when we were striking our estimate two years ago.</P>
    <P>All these debts were coming down on top of us and creating a bigger responsibility every day for the local authorities all over the country.  We saw the relief schemes cut down considerably last year and they were cut down further in the Estimates this year.  These relief schemes helped very much in my constituency and I am glad the Minister saw his way to give us an additional £250,000 this year for these schemes.  In regard to the much talked about Corrib scheme, it is gratifying that we were able to get an additional £100,000 to go ahead with the work so as to have some relief given before the coming winter.</P>

      <P>I am referring to these matters because work on them was at a standstill.  Land Commission work was at a standstill.  Land reclamation was also at a standstill.  In fact, in relation to every Department you look at there was a drop in anything in the way of help for the community.  We listened to statements made during the election campaign.  One of the most ridiculous statements made by the former Minister for Finance had reference to finding £2,400,000 out of the coming Budget.  That was purely an election bribe.  The Job of finding the moneys to do all the work in relation to all the promises has fallen on the shoulders of Fianna Fáil.  Now when Fianna Fáil have made an honest-to-God effort to get this country back into the stable position in which we had it when we handed over to the Coalition Parties, we find criticism <Col N="692" /> from people who know very well that their criticism is not justified.</P>
      <P>From Parties such as those that formed the lst Coalition Government, we are entitled to get some useful criticism, some helpful suggestions.  I have been long enough here not to expect those things from Fine Gael, but, at least, they might give us an opportunity.  We have been in office for about three months.  In 12 months, a Government could not possibly make even a decent effort at cleaning up the mess that was left to us and at getting things going again.  We should get useful criticism from the people opposite, or else they should give us an opportunity of going ahead with the work that so urgently requires to be done.</P>
      <P>I listened the other night to a rather painful effort by the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  He quoted a speech made by a Labour leader in Tuam.  It is very easy to quote speeches made by Labour leaders at this moment, but I remember a time not so very long ago, when the unemployment position in the Tuam and North Galway area was getting out of hand, when Labour leaders asked that individual to meet them for discussion and he refused point blank.  On several occasions, they asked him to meet them and he refused point blank.</P>

      <P>This Bill in some respects could be described as the keystone of the Government's budgetary policy, or as the principal vehicle by which that policy will be carried into operation.  In relation to the scope of the debate on this Bill, I was glad to find that it is possible to discuss the Bill by comparing the financial policy being pursued by the present Government and the financial policy of the previous Government.</P>
      <P>I do think that there is a very definite difference between the financial policy of the present Government and the financial policy which was operated by the inter-Party Government.  The most glaring difference which has become apparent is in relation to the Government's decision in connection with the food subsidies.  I can well believe that the Minister for Finance must have found himself up against difficulties in persuading even his own Cabinet colleagues that, for the Budget of this year, the decision should be taken to abolish the food subsidies.  I can well imagine that there must be within the ranks of the Fianna Fail Cabinet a number of Ministers who felt that that policy was not the right policy to adopt and who must have strongly opposed the Minister for Finance in his decision to abolish the subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister for Finance indicated that that was the position and that a number of his colleagues felt strongly opposed to the action of abolishing the subsidies.  I think the Minister, not only indicated that, but stated it in more or less definite terms in this House in the debate on the Budget.  I want to be quite fair to the Minister.  I am not suggesting that he indicated, or, indeed, that the position now exists, that he finds himself in sharp disagreement with his colleagues on that question.  What I am saying is that he must have had difficulties in persuading them that it was the correct decision to take.  The Minister, when speaking here on 28th of May, did say, <Col N="694" /> at column 2084, in relation to the food subsidies:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not overstating the case when I say that there was a fair amount of objection to the withdrawal of the food subsidies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That remark had reference to the general debate in this House, not to his Cabinet colleagues.  He then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not objecting to the Opposition opposing that.  It was opposed by members of my own Government in the beginning until they saw what the position was.  The members of the Government to which I belong, at any rate, knew that the Budget should be balanced and when they saw that there was no other way of doing it, they agreed, but Fine Gael and Labour condemn it, although they see no other way in which it can be done and did not even suggest any way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that within the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet&mdash;and I assume that the same difference of opinion must have existed more generally in the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;there was a difference of opinion, a difference of approach to this question of whether or not the food subsidies should be abolished.  That decision was taken.  Whether it was a decision of the Minister for Finance or a decision originally prompted by any other Minister, I do not know, but, whoever first made the suggestion, that decision triumphed, and we are now facing the situation where every Deputy must have regard to the consequences which flow from the decision taken by the Fianna Fáil Government and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be interpreted in any way as urging that anything should be done which would in any way disturb the economy of this country or hinder the prospects of a speedy remedy for the ills which beset us, but I do think that, as far as the Government are concerned and as far as the Party supporting the Government are concerned, they are walking on very thin ice.  I hope that the wage <Col N="695" /> earners will respond, as I think they will, as patriotic Irishmen and women to the call for sacrifice and that they will be prepared to overcome the difficulties the country is facing and going through, by making their own sacrifices. I feel that many, or most of them, will be prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken the risk, in its decision to abolish the subsidies, of upsetting the stability which had existed and was being maintained by the inter-Party Government.  I do not want to say very much more with regard to that point but, on a general comparison between the policy of the previous Government and the policy of this Government, it is fair to point out that this is the second occasion within half a dozen years that the Fianna Fáil Government has attacked the subsidies. It is true to say for the inter-Party Government elected to office in 1954, that not only did they maintain the food subsidies which they found there when they took office but they increased them to the extent of £2,000,000 a year by the subsidy for butter.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in 1952 had their first crack at the food subsidies.  They did that, if my memory serves me correctly, in the very first Budget after regaining office in 1951.  In that Budget they attacked the food subsidies, slashed them, and be the deliberate and positive action of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet in 1952 the cost of living was forced up.  It is significant that, now in the year 1957, again in the first Budget after regaining office, the Fianna Fáil Party having gone to the country on the slogan &ldquo;Let us get cracking&rdquo; gets cracking on the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>I want to make that comparison between the policy of the two Government. I should like to refer to a speech made by Deputy Major de Valera here on May 12th, 1955, which I think rather emphasises the distinction between the policies of the two between the policies of the two Governments.  At column 1384 on the 12th May, 1955, Deputy Major de Valera had this to say when talking of the general financial resolution of that year:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> The Government have not been able to reduce the cost of living, by and large, at all; in spite of them it has gone up.  Why?  I would be just as dishonest as some of the Minister's colleagues when they said that the previous Government did these things deliberately if I said the present Government did that deliberately. I do not think it is right to try to fool the people by saying that the Government has deliberately put up the cost of living with malice aforethought.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I acquit the present Government of putting up the cost of living with malice aforethought but I cannot acquit them, and no Deputy in the House or nobody outside it can acquit them, of putting up the cost of living by deliberate, positive action.</P>
    <P>In reply to parliamentary questions here some weeks ago the Minister for Finance pointed out that as a result of budgetary proposals the cost of living would go up something like 4½ points. That is being done by the deliberate positive action of the present Government. That is a big distinction between the financial policy of the present Government and its predecessor. Deputy Major de Valera speaking in 1955 adverted to the fact from these benches that it would not be right to claim that the inter-Party Government had deliberately forced up the cost of living but it would be right now, and let us remember this, to say of the Fianna Fáil Government that they have deliberately pushed up the cost of living by their Budget proposals.  I do not think there can be any doubt of that.  They did the same thing in 1952. The inter-Party Government retained the subsidies; they increased them by the subsidisation of butter to the extent of £2,000,000 a year.</P>

      <P>I think possibly the last time Deputy Briscoe and <Col N="697" /> myself spoke of the loaf would have been in or about 1952, and at that time the price of the 2-lb. loaf, before Fianna Fáil &ldquo;got cracking&rdquo;, was 6d. It went up, under the Fianna Fáil Budget of 1952 to 9d. or 9½d., and it now goes up, under the 1957 Budget of Fianna Fáil, by another 3d. or 3½d. That is the Fianna Fáil record so far as the loaf is concerned.</P>

      <P>I do not care what devices they used.  It is undoubted. that no matter what inter-Party Government was in office it demonstrated in every way and&mdash;if you like to have it, I make you a present of it&mdash;by every device, its sincerity in endeavouring to keep down the cost of living.  If they were not able to do that they endeavoured to cushion the people, and particularly the poorer sections, against rising prices.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe, however, was engaged elsewhere during most of the Budget discussion and I shall not chide him for not taking part in the Budget debate, but he has an opportunity now of contributing his quota to the discussion on the Finance Bill. No doubt Deputy Briscoe was performing a useful service on the other side of the Atlantic when we were discussing the Fianna Fáil Budget and its consequences but if he wants me to bring himself up to date as to what was said on both sides of the House in regard to this Budget I shall have great pleasure in assisting him to do so.  In case he may have overlooked what was in the Budget I should just like to summarise it for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Fianna Fáil Budget which Deputy Briscoe no doubt would have supported in the Division Lobby if he were here, the price of tobacco, beer, bread, butter and petrol are going up. The cost of hospitalisation under the 1953 Health Act is going up or may go <Col N="698" /> up from 6/- to 10/- a day. The same applies to people requiring mental treatment.  In addition a charge of 7/6 is being imposed under the Budget which Deputy Briscoe is supporting for specialist services.  There are some concessions in the Budget.  I think the Turg Board and the master bakers are getting concessions.  That is as concise a summary of the Budget of Deputy Briscoe's colleague, the Minister for Finance, as I can give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Fianna Fáil Budget.  That is the Budget which will be operated through this Finance Bill.  Fianna Fáil Deputies are possibly entitled to make the case that they did not have a great deal of time in which to consider the position before they brought in the Budget.  I do not think that is a good case; I do not think it is a wise case to make because, in so far as it is made seriously, the conclusion which can be drawn from it is that the actions taken by the Fianna Fáil Government in introducing the Budget did not get serious consideration.  In any event, while it may have been an unprecedented step to take, it does seem to me that the Government could have postponed the introduction of the Budget for a month, two months or even for three months if they felt they required extra time in which to consider the various factors involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, concluding the debate on the General Financial Resolution, seemed to me to chide Deputy John A.  Costello and Deputy Sweetman in connection with their remarks regarding the decision of the inter-Party Government not to increase the figure in the Book of Estimates beyond a particular sum.  I have not got the figure but I think it was about £96,500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister that the Government of which he was a member in 1953 took a decision, as I understand the position, that as far as they were concerned taxation would not rise beyond the 1953 level.  As I understand the position, that was a definite decision taken by the Minister and his colleagues in 1953 and <Col N="699" /> announced in this House by the present Tánaiste who, as Deputy Lemass, occupied a seat in the Opposition when, speaking here on May 8th, 1956, and reported in the Official Debates at column 49 of Volume 157, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1953, the Fianna Fáil Government of which I was a member took a decision that taxation in this country had reached the danger limit. We announced that we had made up our minds on that fact and that, so far as we were concerned, there would be no increase in tax rates above the 1953 level.  We made it clear that, if any Budget difficulty arose, that difficulty would be met by a reduction of expenditure and not by increasing the burdens on the taxpayer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the Minister for Finance, no doubt with Deputy Briscoe's support, brings in a Finance Bill asking this House, as far petrol is concerned, to increase the rate of taxation not merely above the 1953 level but by 6d. per gallon above the 1956 level.  Fianna Fáil Deputies who occupied these benches last year put their views on record regarding the increase in the price of petrol brought about by last year's Budget.</P>
    <P>Under the last inter-Party Budget the price of petrol was increased by 6d.  per gallon.  At the time most of the Fianna Fáil Deputies gave their views with regard to that increase.  I do not think it worth while putting those views on record again.  Twelve months later the price of petrol has not been reduced to the 1953 level but has another 6d. per gallon tax imposed on it under the Finance Bill which the Minister is now asking the House to pass.</P>
    <P>I can foresee a number if the results that will ensue from that, In one way or another this new tax will lead to widespread increased charges.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance or his colleagues made any calculations in relations to this added tax, whether they made any calcula-t tions as to how much of it could be described as a tax on luxuries, how much of it will be a tax on industry, <Col N="700" /> how much of it will be a tax generally on productive work as distinct from luxuries.  I do not know whether the Deputies opposite have formed any views as to the extent petrol is used in this country for what might be described as purely luxury purpose.</P>
    <P>I should imagine I would be putting it fairly finely if I said that petrol consumption for luxury purpose went as high as 15 per cent. or 16 per cent. That may be putting it a bit on the high side.  If that figure is accepted&mdash; I want to confess I am simply guessing since I have not at my disposal the means of arriving at a definite conclusion &mdash;it would mean that approximately 85 per cent.  of the petrol consumption in this country is for industrial and other useful productive purpose.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance or any of his colleagues would claim that this tax is a contribution towards the solution of the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to add another 6d. per gallon to the price of petrol.  When, in 1956, the inter-party Government imposed a similar tax they were criticised at length by members of the Fianna Fáil Opposition.  The inter-Party Government, however, took other steps in relation to the financial position of the country among which was the imposition of import levies.  I think it will be agreed that, by and large, the levies imposed by Deputy Sweetman as Minister for Finance were on articles which could be described as non-essentials.</P>
    <P>I think it will be agreed that many of the articles on which the levies were imposed would and could be described as luxury articles.  Deputy Sweetman, when announcing the introduction of the levies, if my memory serves me aright, did state that the levies were the nearest approach we could arrive at in this country to a purchase tax. I think it was a sensible policy.  It was the policy of a Government that had in mind the necessity of dealing with non-essentials and luxury articles in this way rather than articles which were more necessary to the people or which were actual necessaries.  The Fianna Fáil Government have made some alterations in the levies, about <Col N="701" /> which other Deputies have spoken, and I do not intend taking up the time of the House in repeating what has been said already on that score.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the decision of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1953 not to allow taxation to exceed the rates obtaining in that year.  I do not want to be taken as adopting the attitude that, because that decision was taken in 1953&mdash;whether or not it was a formal decision by the Government or simply a kind of gentleman's agreement amongst themselves, I do not know&mdash; and I have no doubt taken with a sense of responsibility and in good faith, thereafter the Fianna Fáil Party must always be tied to it.  I recognise, and I think any Deputy will recognise, that conditions and circumstances may alter from time to time.  Deputies on all sides of the House will recognise that the condition which came into existence to threaten us in 1955 and 1956 were conditions that could not readily be foreseen by any Government.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government, under the leadership, as far as financial policy was concerned, of Deputy Sweetman, were concerned, of Deputy in a vigorous and straightforward way, and even their most severely critical opponents will not deny the fact that the steps taken by the inter-Party Government had the effect of remedying the situation which had come into existence and which, I think, was described by Deputy Sweetman as Minister for Finance, as a threat to our national solvency.  That threat was faced squarely by the inter-Party Government and overcome by the steps the inter-Party Government took to deal with it.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increase in the price of petrol which has been implemented in this Bill, the other tax increases on beer and tobacco are contained in this Bill.  I do not intend to give my views on this.  All I want to say is that I personally am not particularly critical of the Minister and the Government in relation to the increases either on tobacco or beer. As far as petrol is concerned, I should like to hear from the Minister what calculation, if any, he made with regard to the break-up of the use of <Col N="702" /> petrol as between luxury use, on the one hand, and productive, commercial and industrial use on the other.</P>
    <P>I think, quite apart from any increase which may take place in wages&mdash;leaving that aside entirely-that quite a number of increases will flow from the implemention of the Government's Budget proposals and the passing of this Finance Bill.  I believe, rightly or wrongly, that the rates of this city and generally throughout the country are very likely to increase as a result of the Budget of 1957.  I believe that school meals will cost more and that the cost of maintenance in local authority hospitals and institutions is likely to increase as a result of it.  That will reflect itself in an increase in rates.</P>
    <P>I believe that various other rises are likely to take place, even inside Government Departments.  The Department of Justice and the Department of Defence are likely to find themselves faced with increases as a result of the proposals in this Bill to increase the price of petrol.  Increases of one sort or another will take place and Deputies on the other side of the House should recognise that, and that these increazses, when that take place, will be the responsibility of the Fianna Fáil Government and of the Deputies supporting it.</P>
    <P>At this hour, I am not going to discuss whether to not the result of the General Election might have been as it was if Deputies on the opposite benches, led by the Minister for Finance, had indicated, prior to the date of the General Election, that if they were returned as a Government, they would complete the job they started in 1952 in relation to the food subsidies, that they would complete the abolotion of food subsidies.  That is a matter which, no doubt, the Deputies opposite are concerned with and will find their constituents and their organisations concerned with.  I leave it to them to discover the views of their constituents through their own organisations.</P>
    <P>Deputies on this side of the House have been critical of the Minister's proposals and critical of this Bill, as I <Col N="703" /> think we are entitled to be critical of it.  We are entitled to point out firmly the difference between the policies of the present Government and of its predecessor, and we are entitled to claim that the people, particularly those who were dissatisfied with the results achieved by the inter-Party Government, but at the same time were not willing to vote into office a Fianna Fáil Government, and who refrained from voting at the General Election, are now regretting their inactivity on polling day.  If they were to get an opportunity oce more of coming to a decision by means of a General Election, I have very little doubt&mdash;I think Deputies on the opposite benches have very little doubt &mdash;as to what the decision the people would take.</P>

      <P>I thought that, as a result of all that was said upon the Budget, the Minister for Finance and the Government would take advice in the matter and reconsider some of their proposals before submitting them in the from of this Finance Bill.  We know, of course, that the Finance Bill is the legislative machinery that has to go through this House in order to give effect to the Budget Resolutions. Looking over the debate on the Budget and the proposals, I am struck more than ever with the audacity of the proposals.  I know well that Fianna Fáil are very determined and sure of their strength and that they have a majority in the House which must bow their heads, follow meekly behind the Whip and carry out whatever policy the Government decides, whether they approve or disapprove of it.  The first thing that strikes me in this Bill is that for the third time Fianna Fáil has taken the line of imposing practically the same taxation as in 1947.</P>

      <P>I shall say something for the young Deputy who was not here then which may be of intense interest to him.  If he would take a <Col N="704" /> word of advice from a person like myself it might do him no harm were he to peruse Volime 108 of the Official Report for the year 1947 and therein read Deputy Aiken's speech, as Minister for Finance, on the Finance (No-2) Bill of that year.  I shall read it before I finish but not until the appropriate time and when I am ready.</P>
      <P>This is the third time that Fianna Fáil has imposed this taxation with a illing majority behind it.  When they brought in a similar Bill, described as the Finance (No. 2) Bill of 1947, there was no inter-Party Government to blame then.  They could not say that there was a Government before that which had made a complete mess of everthing an had so misspent the nation's revenue that they had to impose fresh taxation.</P>
      <P>I would ask the young Deputy to procure volume 108 of the official Report for the year 1947 and read the contribution of Deputy Frank Aiken, Minister for Finance, at column 398. The Deputy is not long enough in the House to have the volume himself but he can get it on request and it will be of immense value to him because here are some of the reasons why the then Fianna Fáil Government had to impose the taxation contained in the second Finance Bill of 1947.  When you look at its provisions and the provisions of to-day's Bill you will see practically no difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We said then that there was no necessity for that Budget.  We further said that if we were elected and got the opportunity we would remove these provisions forthwith.  We got the opportunity in 1948 and we removed them and Fianna Fáil were as mad as hell.  They never got over it and they are trying from that day to this to explain why they brought in that Budget.  Then in 1952, when they got the chance, they reimposed the taxation but instead of giving the reasons I am going to give now they blamed the inter-Party Government for having left an unbalanced Budget and a mess behind them.  What a mess!  The sum of £26,000,000 was left on the table for the Fianna Fáil Government and the Minister for Finance.  It was a lovely mess for any Minister or any Government <Col N="705" /> to put their hands on but they had that.</P>
    <P>Here are some of the reasons for the 1947 Budget of Fianna Fáil.  I quote form column 398, Volume 108, of 1947, Where Deputy Aiken, Minister for Finance, is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Here at home this general situation is reflected in our domestic life and trade relations.  During the last year a number of important commodity price rose steeply: sirloin beef 6½d. per 1b., leg mutton 8¾d.  per lb., eggs 6¾d. per dozen, milk (retail) 1d.  per galon, butter 4d. per 1b., potatoes 7¼d.  perstone, tea 1/2 per lb....</P>
    <P>Some other factors regarding our economy which must be noted are: (1) Our imports in the first six months of this year were £52.7 million and our exports £15.9 million....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our exports were £15.9 million after 15 years of a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that truthfully I hope but not on this Bill.  I shall avail of the appropriate time to do so.  Our exports were £15.9 million after a world war.  Deputy Aiken said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our imports in the first six months of this year were £52.7 million and our exports £15.9 million, showing what used to be called an unfavourable visible trade balance of £36.8 million but representing to our people, who suffered severely from shortages of all sorts of goods and equipment for nearly eight years, a very welcome supply of the things they were eager to buy.  The deficit in visible trade was made good as to £26,000,000 by the favourable balance in our visible trade, for our external assets only fell by £11,000,000 in that period.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13th June, 1957.</P>

      <P>The number of <Col N="584" /> arrivals in the State by sea, rail, road (motor omnibus services) and air (excluding transit passengers) for each month from January, 1949, to March, 1957, are shown in the appended table.</P>
      <P>The figures refer to all incoming passengers by these routes and, therefore, include Irish residents returning from places outside the State as well as visitors to this country. The figures do not include persons travelling across the northern border of the State in private motor vehicles or on foot. Estimates of the number of arrivals by private motor vehicles in each of the years 1952 to 1956 are as follows:&mdash;</P>

It must be observed that these latter estimates are based on a sample inquiry and are therefore subject to a sampling error.  The figures are derived from a count of the vehicles and estimates of the average number of person in each vehicle, obtained in the passanger card inquiry.</P>
