      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing by country of origin the quantity of muriate of potash imported in the half-year ended 31st March, 1957.  Imports are not brought to account by reference to port of shipment and to extract this information from the original import entries would entail a considerable expenditure of time and labour.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that 80 council cottages are required in the Lucan area.  Following a joint examination of the housing position in this area in July last by officers of the council and the Department, it was agreed that the provision of 40 houses would meet the urgent requirements of the area and that the position could be re-examined when these houses had been completed and let.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission have not entered into purchase negotiations under Section 27, Land Act, 1950, in respect of any lands in the counties mentioned. Efforts made to purchase under Section 27 three holdings in County Meath which were offered for sale by public auction were unsuccessful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The counties I have mentioned specifically in the question are the counties where the fine land is available or should be available for the relief of congestion.  Is it not a fact that, since 1950, no effort whatever has been made by the Minister for Lands or the Department of Lands to solve congestion by the utilisation of Section 27 of the 1950 Act and, therefore, is not the whole Act a sheer bluff as far as the congests and uneconomic holders are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of the grant has been such that the application of this section has been confined to the congested districts counties, the policy being that the money should be used to pick up easily-got properties for cash that would help in rearrangement. There has been no effort to extend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state, whether, when this Act was going through this House as a Bill, there was any question that it would be confined solely to counties where congestion exists?  Is it not a fact that the Act was to embrace any part of <Col N="617" /> the country where suitable land could be found?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not well known to anyone who understands the subject of land tenure and purchase in this country that the provisions of this section were designed for the acquisition of small holdings in congested areas which would normally be disposed of by free sale and that the traditional and appropriate procedure for large holdings in Meath, Westmeath, Kildare and likewise, is compulsory purchase where that is socially or economically desirable?

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Expenditure on the purchase of land for forestry purposes in the years in question was as follows:&mdash; 1954-55&mdash;£90,372; 1955-56&mdash;£104,584 and 1956-57&mdash;£120,000 (approximately).

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

      <P>Many different types of badges are used by the Army and most of them are obtained from Irish manufacturers. An order was, however, placed with a British firm some months ago for supplies of an infantry badge of new design which I assume is the one the Deputy has in mind.  The order for these badges, imports of which are subject to a levy of 60 per cent, full (40 per cent. preferential), was placed following general competition in which the Irish manufacturers capable of producing this badge were included.  The Irish manufacturers will continue to be given opportunities of tendering for these requirements and I hope that the prices quoted for future supplies will enable the orders to be placed with them.</P>

      <P>I can trace only one case of the kind the Deputy appears to have in mind.  In that, the proposed transfer of an auxiliary postman from one office to another was cancelled.  The officer concerned had been appointed to his present office on the condition&mdash; which he had accepted&mdash;that he would reside within a reasonable distance of it and he asked for the transfer on the grounds, in effect, that he had not complied with that condition and was residing near the other office.  In the circumstances, I decided that the claims of local unemployed men should be given first consideration and the employment exchange is being approached to submit names in the usual way.</P>

      <P>Section 6 of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, provides that the Advisory Committee shall include two members being persons who held high rank in the Forces before the 11th July, 1921.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> In regard to the second part of the Deputies' question, it is not necessary for any of the refugees to apply to my Department for permission to go to Canada, United States or any other country.  They are quite free to leave at any time.  We have simply given them asylum here for the period that circumstances compel them to remain with us, and already 31 adults and 13 children have left for other countries, their fares being paid by the Irish Red Cross.</P>
    <P>In answer to the last part of the Deputies' question, it must be realised that we cannot unduly press other countries to admit refugees.  It is for the Government of each country to decide whom they shall admit.  In fact, however, the Governments of the United States and Canada are fully aware that a number of refugees here have expressed the wish to enter their territories, and the refugees have been kept fully informed through the Red Cross of the situation since their reception in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that they have asked to see some member of the Government on the matter but the Deputy will realise that they have been kept fully informed by the Red Cross authorities all the time.  The Red Cross tried to impress upon them what the situation is more or less on the lines of the reply I have given the Deputy.  In order that there could be no possibility of any doubt on the matter, we have sent down a couple of representatives from the Department of External Affairs and from the Department of Justice to explain the situation to them personally.</P>

They have never received any guarantee&mdash;or will the Minister say that they did?&mdash;that they would get employment and they are free to return to Hungary any time that they so wish.  Further, will the Minister inform the Hungarians that while they are living in this country they will have to behave themselves in a reasonable manner?</P>

Unfortunately, we are not able to remedy the situation at once.  We are doing our best to try and remedy the situation as far as they are concerned but they must be patient.

      <P>I want to address myself to the question at issue on the Vote from two points of view.  One is on the question of the actual moneys allocated in this financial year and the <Col N="632" /> other is the question of policy in regard to our whole educational system, ranging from the primary school to the university.  On the question of the moneys allocated under each sub-heading, the Minister has told us he is not accepting any responsibility for the figures, that they are not his figures and that accordingly he is offering them to the House as they stood prior to the General Election and the subsequent change of Government.  That would be all right if the Minister had left it at that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, it is not the policy of the Minister to allow any kind of criticism either of his speech in content, form or anything else. However, with your permission, Sir, and within the rules of the House, I propose to criticise the Minister's speech on this Vote under two headings, namely on the figures and on the policy.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education in the first instance is charged with joint responsibility or by way of partnership &mdash;I will have something to say about this later in relation to the Minister's speech&mdash;for the education of the children of this country.  The vast number of these children never pass the national school.  Therefore, I think it is to the national school most consideration should be directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the Minister's proposal in the opening words of his speech not to deal profoundly with the various Votes having regard to what he says later concerning his brief intimacy with this Department.  In fact, it might be said in fairness to the Minister that he has another Department tacked on which, in my opinion, would preclude his taking the same interest in both Departments as is their merit and due.  I can understand the desire contained in the second paragraph of the speech under the heading &ldquo;Office of the Minister for Education&mdash;Vote 39&rdquo;<Col N="634" /> to cut down administrative costs. Where will you get a degree of efficiency if the hub of the machine is faulty in some respects?  Any Department not adequately staffed must be faulty.  Under the heading of faults I include delays.  If the delays in the reaching of decisions so prevalent in the Department of Education are in any way due to this reduction in the number of staff not replaced, then it is not a good reduction and the saving on it is not justified under any heading.</P>
    <P>It is good to see an increase of £53,750 in the Primary Education Vote over last year's figure.  It is true that the Minister says all this increase is accounted for by increased provision for teachers' salaries and superannuation. I do not think that is a wrong thing.  I think it is a good thing.  I think the people who are responsible jointly with parents for such a grave undertaking as the instruction of the big majority of our children who never receive any other instruction are people who should be adequately remunerated and for whom adequate superannuation provision should be made.  There should be no quarrel with that.</P>
    <P>The selection of sites for schools is a task delegated to the Board of Works. At the risk of criticism, in view of the shortage of land about which we hear so much, I suggest, as I have suggested previously with all sincerity, that greater portions of land should be acquired for school sites.  We should adopt the long term view&mdash;a view probably outside the orbit of dealing with school children&mdash;of having an adequate playing field not alone for children during playtime but a playing field which would well become the social and physical training centre of the area served by the school.</P>
    <P>I do not think there should be any great difficulty about it.  After all, the acquiring of a site for a school is, relatively speaking, a negligible part of the cost.  I see no reason why that attitude could not be adopted by the Department of Education in regard to the acquisition of school sites; indeed, in regard to existing schools, efforts should be made to provide playgrounds, particularly in the West, where the <Col N="635" /> schools have large tracts of commonage around them.  Land for school playgrounds should be acquired everywhere to replace the usual walls surrounding those buildings.  These walls invariably do not last too long, due to the spirit of the youngsters and from sheer lack of playing space.</P>
    <P>A noteworthy fact in the Minister's speech, mentioned on the first page, is that the number of children on the rolls of national schools is increasing and that, on the 30th June, 1956, there was an increase of 5,731 on the previous year.  I am not a statistician, but it would be an interesting statistical compilation and survey to relate the increase in the number of children on the rolls of national schools with, on the other hand, the numbers who are emigrating according to reliable statistics &mdash;the children who are going away with the other members of their families.  The same is true of the secondary schools.  The numbers continue to be maintained and have grown substantially down through the years.</P>
    <P>I often wonder whether speaking in this House and offering suggestions, be they good, bad or middling, is worth while because I have the feeling that the Department of Education, and those responsible for administration generally, take the view that the people who speak in this House on education are cranks who have got something to say about some particular instance and who have some particular bogy of their own.  Accordingly, very few of the suggestions so made are examined.  From the second part of the Minister's opening statement, I think we cannot expect any other view from him by way of direction of policy. However, that is a criticism I propose to offer at a later stage.</P>
    <P>On the question of primary education, the need for good, warm, well-heated buildings is important.  Side by side with that, I repeat that sufficiently large playing grounds are necessary. As I pointed out earlier, it should not be too hard to get them and the cost should not be too great.  In dealing with policy in relation to primary education, I take it the Minister was <Col N="636" /> referring to education as a whole and including primary education when he said, on page 8 of his speech:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We find fault with the results of the teachers' work in this field or that and we argue from particular instances, but is there in fact in this country any informed criticism of the schools or of the system?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that is a suggestion that there is no informed criticism of the schools or of the system in this country and that the Minister accepts that as a fact.  Only last Eastertide, the Minister had the advantage&mdash;I say &ldquo;advantage&rdquo; with respect&mdash;of attending the Congress of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation at Killarney where he must have heard, at least in the president's address, some criticism of the schools and the system.  But perhaps he did not accept the president of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation as a person sufficiently competent or informed on the subject.</P>
    <P>Speaking in this House on 7th July, 1955, and reported at column 410, Volume 152 of the Official Reports, I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Another matter to which I would refer in all sincerity as a matter of some urgency is that of speech training. It is not very long ago since we in this country were renowned for a very long time previously, principally abroad and to some extent at home, as a nation of orators and as people who could not alone be heard but could be understood.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on in the same column I asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;How will we go about it?  We must, first of all, start with the primary schools, and starting with the primary schools, we must of course immediately go to our training colleges wherein are taught the people who will later teach in the primary schools.  I am told that elocution is a subject on the programme of the training colleges for primary teachers.  I am also told that as it is taught at present it is a complete waste of time.  If it is not taught in a proper manner it cannot have any beneficial effect upon the <Col N="637" /> teacher and consequently it cannot have any beneficial effect upon the pupil, who will be at the mercy of a teacher who has not benefited as he should by his training in the training college.</P>
    <P>How can we except our children to be taught to speak properly if the teacher has not been so taught?  I would suggest in this respect that we are not making the use we should of modern ideas and inventions in our educational system.  I would advocate the installation of the wire recording system as essential equipment in every training college because nobody can fully appreciate his defects in speech, and everybody has got them since nobody is perfect, until he hears his own voice played back to him.  I think the installation of a wire recorder in every training college would be a very good thing because then prospective teachers could get some idea of where the faults lay and set about repairing these defects.  Such defects could be ascertained through the medium of a piece of selected reading or through the medium of a recorded conversation between two or three people.</P>
    <P>The wire recorder could also be used to give potential teachers the proper blas.  It could be used to advantage in the secondary schools for the teaching of modern languages, because modern languages could be brought right into the classrooms in schools situated in the most remote parts of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in 1955.  In all humility, I say that that is informed criticism of a system of education.</P>
    <P>Speaking on 24th April, 1957 and reported in the <i>Evening Mail</i> of that date, Mr. Hardiman addressed the Annual Convention of the Association of Secondary Teachers at Galway. Mr. Hardiman dealt with several matters affecting our educational system.  But then, if we are to take the Minister's question seriously&mdash;&ldquo;is there, in fact, in this country any informed criticism of the schools or of the system?&rdquo;&mdash;I suppose the President of the Association of Secondary Teachers is not to be regarded as a <Col N="638" /> person competent to criticise or as a person who would be properly informed.</P>
    <P>In the course of his address, Mr. Hardiman turned to the proper speaking of English and he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Ireland we are inclined to pay too little attention to the oral side of education.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that respect, I notice the Minister says it is his intention in the intermediate examination to have an oral examination in Irish.  Why confine it to one language?  Why not have it for English; why not have it for French or any other language the pupil may be taking in that examination ? At any rate, Mr. Hardiman continued, as reported:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some attention is given to oral Irish; in English, the proper speaking of the language is generally neglected.</P>
    <P>To remedy that I propose that much more time should be devoted to elocution, to the drama and to debates.  These exercises can be of the greatest value in enabling the adolescent to express himself fluently and pleasantly and are indispensable in providing that self confidence in which our young people are deficient in comparison with their contemporaries elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps that is not informed criticism. The Minister doubts, as given at the bottom of page 7, the success of any crusade against unwarranted emigration if it were led by politicians or teachers.  He doubts if those two classes of people would be the best to lead it.  I would like to hear, the House would like to hear and I am sure the country would like to hear what view the Minister holds as to the inadequacy of the politician or the teacher to lead that crusade in particular or any other crusade in general. If he finds, and gives the reasons for so finding that politicians and teachers are not the right kind of people to lead crusades of that kind, then he might tell us who he has in mind or what class of persons he has in mind who would best achieve the result he desires to see achieved, namely, the <Col N="639" /> curbing of unwarranted emigration&mdash; that is, as he says, people leaving positions in which they are already remunerated in this country.</P>
    <P>Nowhere, of course, does the Minister suggest a remedy.  He says that we are suffering, that &ldquo;at the core of things there is a spiritual <i>malaise</i>, a loss of morale&rdquo;.  What is the remedy? The Minister might tell us what he thinks the remedy or remedies might be, or even the suggested remedies. We want a lead in this kind of thing. At least, if he thinks the politicians are not suitable to lead, I am prepared to be led by the Minister for Education in educational matters, once he satisfies me that he has searched into every avenue for the defects and that, as a result of that search, he has an adequate remedy for each and every defect he has found; or if he has not found a remedy, let him say so.</P>
    <P>I come in this speech to rather startling propositions which, to my mind, will not be rated as great contributions to educational thought or educational advancement, but nevertheless I am sure they will stand out on the records of this House as startling observations on what education is and what a system is.  The Minister says, as given at the top of page 8:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When I refer to what might be achieved I am not thinking at all of teaching of skills or of academic lore.  These have of course their place, and a very important one it is, but for the moment I am thinking of the cultivation of an attitude. An acquired skill, if not accompanied by a contentment of mind, will only the quicker enable the possessor to escape from his environment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree to some extent, not a very great extent, that education is in its result the cultivation of an attitude&mdash; but only in its result.  I would like to think that what the Minister means by a &ldquo;contentment of mind&rdquo; which must, he says, accompany the &ldquo;acquired skill&rdquo; is what we probably refer to in the old-fashioned way as the vocation which goes side by side with the aptitude and suitability for a particular calling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> Not very far from here&mdash;I have not got the quotation&mdash;the superior of Synge Street School at a meeting of the Past Pupils' Union the other evening made a comment on this.  He said, and in my opinion very properly said, that the sooner people realised in education that teaching was not a job but a vocation, the more progress would be made.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a point on the selection of our teachers for primary schools that should be giving, if it has not given already, some food for thought to the Department of Education. I refer to the preparatory school system.  I do not think it is fair to ask a boy or a girl at the ages of 13½ to 15½ to decide at that time that they want to be teachers, because that is the manner in which the vast majority of primary teachers have to decide.  It is true that there are some limited vacancies through open competition, on the one hand, from the leaving certificate examination and, on the other hand, from honours graduates of certain standing and certain academic qualifications.</P>
    <P>How can the child of 13, 14 or 15 decide he or she wants to be a teacher and nothing else?  An administration and a policy such as that can force upon people in poorer areas, and in circumstances where no other choice is open to them, the roadway to teaching alone.  It is true that at the end of the secondary school course in the preparatory colleges a limited number of scholarships is offered to pupils from those colleges to universities, in competition, of course, with the other secondary schools, but the bulk of our primary teachers are people selected by examination and interview.</P>
    <P>At these ages to which I refer, they leave their native place and go with people of the same kind into a preparatory college to spend four years. When they depart at holiday time, they see their people at home, and then they are back with the same type of boys and girls again.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with that company, but the vision that is open to people from a limited environment must of necessity be limited, too.  After leaving <Col N="641" /> a preparatory college, pupils go on to some training college, where again for two years they are with the same people, and if I might say so, in passing&mdash;and I know of a particular example of it into which I do not propose to delve here&mdash;an environment like that can make people the subjects of prejudices which remain with them all their lives, and, I hasten to add, not political prejudices.</P>
    <P>If it were possible, I would like to see university accommodation made available as a solution to this problem. If you are going to preserve the preparatory college system, I would like to see the training colleges, as I said before in the same debate, used solely for the mechanics of teaching, and some course, probably a limited one, provided in the university nearest to the training college.  I referred to this before in 1955.  The members of the Church of Ireland Training College have that system and I think it is an excellent one.  In that way, you learn the mechanics of teaching&mdash;in the training colleges where discipline is not as relaxed as it would be in university life, but through the university course you would be giving people the advantage of meeting university people, university students and professors, the advantage of broadening their outlook, having a more liberal approach and of going back to their respective districts or to similar places elsewhere, for no place is very different from any other, full of a liberal approach, as people who had met other people of different kinds, of different outlooks.  They would then be able to approach their position in that frame of mind, instead of coming back to the school as somebody who has moved on in years but very little otherwise.  That is a system which is not the fault of the teacher but the fault of the administration.</P>
    <P>Let me go on to page 8 to the next startling observation, where the Minister says that he refuses to believe when we consider the character of the teaching personnel which we are so fortunate to possess in each of the various types of school, that our system of education is not a good one.  &ldquo;No one need tell me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that a system of education is good or bad as <Col N="642" /> a system.  It is good or ill according to the character of its teachers, and a glance at Irish history is sufficient to make that clear, for under a very alien system, the teachers handed down to the children a fine national tradition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me deal with the last observation first.  They did hand down a fine national tradition, but how did they do it?  They did it by departing from the system which had been imposed upon them from an alien source at that time, and many of them did it under the pain of dismissal and the pain of severe penalty, the pain of loss of livelihood. It was not because it was an alien system that they were able to do it but because they departed from it.</P>
    <P>If the champion ploughman or the Queen of the Plough is let into a good field, in which there are no obstructions, with perfect ploughshares, good tyres, everything seemingly in order, but there is a defective bearing somewhere or some belt goes out of order or slips, something happens to render the ploughing ineffective.  Let the perfect plough and the champion ploughman go into a field, on the other hand, which looks good but in which there are rocks and hidden obstacles that blunt the blades; in that case the work of the ploughman is also rendered ineffective. Is that not the system?  The Minister seems to think that if you have a team of experts, with no facilities, or very inadequate ones, and no method by which they can work either suitably or properly in a given instance, one can surmount the difficulties.</P>
    <P>What is happening?  The proof is in the practice of our teachers.  Some of them hold on to their jobs because they have a vocation, and I would like to think they would be the majority; others hold on to their job because they have no choice; still others are leaving, either emigrating or changing occupations at home, because they have not got the vocation or because, having the vocation, they feel so futile under the system in which they have to work.</P>
    <P>There are primary teacher Deputies in this House who may possibly not like to speak with the same critical approach to the Department that supervises their work.  They may say that it is easy for me because I am not <Col N="643" /> subject to inspection and I am not subject to departmental rules and I am not affected in any way by this partnership, to which the Minister refers, wherein the Department does not hold all the stakes.  I speak here on this subject of education as somebody who has taught in every branch of our educational system, primary, secondary, vocational and university.  In addition to that, I speak as one who has had&mdash;possibly some people would say too long; I would say too short&mdash; three to four months' experience as an administrator, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>I would not like the Minister to adhere steadfastly to the view that if you have good teachers with a vocation for teaching, they should be asked to retain all through their careers that quantum of mental and physical capacity to plough the stony fields of an awkward system, which often results in broken men and broken women, reputations lost through no fault of their own but merely because of a faulty system imposed upon them by people who are pleased, on the one hand, to accept what has been handed down through the years, with minor modifications, or, on the other hand, are devoting no thought to the subject at all and making no provision for the future or for changing times.  I agree with the Minister when he says that our teachers, from primary to university level, are doing a good job. They are doing more than that: they are doing a tremendous job, having regard to the difficulties that stand in their way.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in his opening speech that &ldquo;the teachers are, I believe, giving to the country's youth &lsquo;a faithful message&rsquo;.&rdquo; Now, &ldquo;a faithful message&rdquo; is in inverted commas. What is the &ldquo;faithful message&rdquo;?  One can imagine all kinds of messages.  One can speculate from particular view-points, but it would be a waste of time to start going through them all until we hear what exactly the Minister means by a &ldquo;faithful message&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want now to couple the remark about there not being enough informed <Col N="644" /> opinion or enough informed criticism with the Minister's statement that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The teachers are telling the pupils and all of us daily, in the words of Thomas Davis, &lsquo;Gentlemen, you have a country,&rsquo; but as in the days of Davis, that apostrophe is being negatived by the cynicism and certain demoralising influences that are at work among the public.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose, if one puts those two together, people like myself who offer criticism which cannot, according to the Minister, be informed criticism, fall into the category of cynics and demoralising influences.</P>
    <P>I come now to another problem to which I referred in July, 1955.  I refer to the problem of the backward child. Let me get this clear: I am not referring to the sub-normal or the mentally defective.  I am referring simply to the backward child whose development is slow and whose capacity will never be as great as the averagely intelligent. At column 413 of Volume 152, I said then:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no aspect of education in this country which should be looked into with greater speed than the question of the teaching of backward children.  I am not referring to abnormal children or to mentally defective children but to the ordinary backward child whose development is slowed and retarded and I think it is high time that, in the larger centres at any rate, specially trained teachers should be got to deal with them&mdash;with the kind of children to whom Deputy Derrig referred.  You meet them quite often in the juvenile courts&mdash;the fellow of 15 or 16 years of age and sometimes the girl who is not able to read or write because her development was slow.</P>
    <P>These children cannot properly be attended to in large classes and consequently are left behind in the programme of to-day which is really a programme of the survival of the fittest.  If you put those mentally slow children into their proper places with properly trained teachers, you will eventually get them their right place in the life of the nation and you will relieve the lot of the <Col N="645" /> teachers in the classes from which they have been taken so that their progress will be even faster and the progress of the other ordinary pupils greater indeed.  I would impress upon the Minister the importance of taking cognisance of that particular point in relation to backward children. He should have his Department examine it with a view to taking steps towards an early solution of the problem because it is a problem whether we like it or not.  We are not all as advanced as we would like to think ourselves and the development of a proper system of education related to the people's needs is absolutely essential, because a satisfactory system of education presupposes a reasonably contented body of teachers and reasonably happy school lives for the children.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am a cynic.  Perhaps I am a demoralising influence because that is what I must be if I am not accepted as informed.  I am not alone as a cynic or a demoralising influence according to the Minister.  In the <i>Irish Times</i> of November 28th, 1955, Mr. John Brosnahan, N.T., a former President of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, addressed a meeting of the Graduates' Association of the National University of Ireland, reading a paper entitled &ldquo;The Sins of Our Primary Education System&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that the system is all right.  There can never be anything wrong with the system.  Once your team of horses is all right it does not matter what class of land they have to plough.  They will go through rocks if they are strong enough.  As you will notice, here is a national teacher, a former President of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, reading a paper entitled &ldquo;The Sins of Our Primary Education System&rdquo;.  He did not say &ldquo;omissions in the primary education system; hardships in the primary education system or anomalies in the primary education system.&rdquo; He did not use any of those lighter words that might imply neglect, omission or default.  He uses the word &ldquo;sins&rdquo; and sin, if our moral concepts are still awake, is a strong word.</P>
    <P>Mr. Brosnahan, addressing an important body of people whose very calling <Col N="646" /> would make them people likely to affect public opinion and educational opinion generally, thought fit to refer to backward children in November, 1955.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Another great fault lay in the callous disregard for sub-normal and backward children, who were written off as a &lsquo;bad debt&rsquo; in the largeclass system.  The existence of these children did not seem to have impinged itself greatly on the official mind which spoke of children as units in a school.  The Irish National Teachers' Organisation had drawn attention to the problem of the backward child, but so far little or nothing has been done.  He asked: &lsquo;Will you, as responsible and influential people, help us to do something for those who by their very limitations are unable to fight for their rights?&rsquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Brosnahan said that in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland special committees had surveyed the problem of the backward child and recommendations had been made.  It was time for the problem to be investigated in the Twenty-Six Counties; in so doing, much unhappiness and tears would be eliminated from the schools.  Answering his question, &lsquo;What can be done?&rsquo; he suggested arousing the public conscience, establishing a committee of inquiry, reduction of size of classes and that a considerable modification of the ordinary curriculum be made in the case of backward children.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps Mr. Brosnahan is a cynic; perhaps he is a demoralising influence. Before I leave that, I want to refer again to a report in the <i>Irish Times</i> of April 25th, 1957.  It is an account of the proceedings in Killarney of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation at which the Minister had the privilege and the advantage of attending.  There I find, in addition to whatever I have already said about speech training, at the secondary education meeting in Galway, no less an authoritative person than Dr. J. J. Stack, Medical Director of the Child Guidance Clinic, Dublin, who went to that conference to read a paper on the problems of childhood, saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" />&ldquo;That in London recently an eminent educationalist and psychiatrist had stated that a survey had shown that one person in 20 would one day be treated in a mental hospital, and one in ten would be so crippled emotionally before reaching 18 that he would be a burden on the community.  The figures were about the same in America.  He did not think that there was any reason to believe that in Ireland they were any lower.  In his experience, the incidence of serious mental illness in children was far too high.</P>
    <P>A lot of the difficulty with the handicapped child was that the parents, through the kindness of their nature, did not stimulate that ordinary independence which was so necessary for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apart from mental illness altogether, Dr. Stack&mdash;I suppose he would not be regarded by the Minister as a person competent to offer informed criticism &mdash;dealing with defects of speech, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There were about 5,000 stutterers among the children of the country, while there were facilities for treating only a few hundred of them.  One-third of our juvenile delinquents were permanently backward children.  Delinquency would always be with us as long as we had such economic and social conditions as we had to-day. Twenty per cent. of the children attending our schools were educationally sub-normal and 5 per cent. were mentally defective so that they could not benefit from ordinary educational techniques.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are the opinions of people that I want to submit to this House as informed opinions, people competent to judge and who cannot be dismissed as cynics or as people described as demoralising influences.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks of thoughtless criticism of such a state of affairs. He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thoughtless criticism of such a state of affairs takes the easy way <Col N="648" /> out by demanding that the State take over the system and impose the views of the critics.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us, if we can, pin the Minister and his Department to some sort of policy in relation to education generally or in relation to the particular aspects of it. He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thoughtless criticism of such a state of affairs takes the easy way out by demanding that the State take over the system and impose the views of the critics.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why should the State not deal adequately by way of a proper system with the educational treatment of backward children?  I am not dealing now with mental defectives or sub-normal children.  I make a special plea, as I did two years ago, for the backward child in the big class who is generally untended and who leaves school at 14 years, or perhaps under that age, illiterate and not able even to write his name.  Let us face the fact that that happens.</P>
    <P>The Minister continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is sometimes forgotten that at least in this country the system of education is a partnership in which the State by no means holds all the stakes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What are we to take from that sentence? Is it a reply to the people who offer criticism, be it informed or illinformed? Is it a reply to them thus: &ldquo;Why do you criticise us?  We are not responsible in full for the education of the people of this country. There is a partnership&rdquo;?  The partnership, I take it, must in the primary school be none other than the managerial system.  In the secondary school it must be the vast number of secular clergy and lay teachers who so adequately, with the means at their disposal, and so reasonably and so economically, financially, make such an excellent job of our secondary education.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister saying to us who criticise: &ldquo;Ask the managers about the primary school, as well as asking us.  Ask both the religious and the laity, who run the secondary schools, <Col N="649" /> because they are in partnership with us and they must accept responsibility.&rdquo; Is that what he means or does he mean: &ldquo;Do not blame us because we are not responsible for this partnership&rdquo;? Does he mean: &ldquo;We do not like this partnership&rdquo;?  Does he mean that if this partnership did not exist he would be able to do some of the things which he would like to do without let or hindrance from any of the partners?</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The corollary of such a proposal would, of course, ultimately be that schools or parents who would not bend the knee to a State system would be at first financially penalised and finally brought to surrender.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a proposal, however academic or academically posed, in the preceding sentence about the partnership. I should like to see that that would be clear.</P>
    <P>It is true that we would like to have more money to do all of the things we should like to do.  I maintain that we have sufficient money from which some small portion at least could be devoted towards helping the backward child, on the one hand, and the removal of speech defects on the other hand.  I am happy to see that recently in Dublin, as a result of voluntary effort, we have a school for, I think, mental defectives.</P>
    <P>Action has often been urged upon the Minister and the Department of Education by what I maintain is informed opinion&mdash;the President of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, Presidents past and present, the President of the Secondary Teachers' Association, the President of the Association of Vocational Teachers.  All of these things must be taken into account.  Some cognisance must be taken of them.  Things cannot go on from year to year with the same old story of treating schools as buildings that cost money, equipment as something that costs more money, sites as places that must be sufficiently small as not to cost too much money and children as mere ciphers or figures on a roll book or on forms returned from <Col N="650" /> time to time to the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In secondary education the time is fast approaching when we must lay greater and greater stress on technology and early specialisation.  We must lay greater stress on modern languages. I read in one of the papers within the past few days that somebody said that, with the possible advent of a free trade area, continental languages will become more and more important.  May I say, without being accused of being a pessimist or an enemy, that the advent of such an era will make the job of restoring the Irish language a much more difficult one?  I do not think it is very necessary for me to try to impress upon the Minister, the House or the country how difficult that job is and how little success has attended it down the years in relation to the financial expenditure and the tremendous physical and mental effort that has been put into the process.  People everywhere are clamouring  for two things&mdash;a modern language which is much in use and, on the other hand&mdash;and possibly more important when you take it in conjunction not alone with the desire but the necessity for greater production&mdash; technology and early specialisation.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind that, of the percentage of pupils who go to secondary schools, only a small number ever reach the university, where they might specialise. In passing, I might say, on the subject of the selection of teachers or professors in secondary schools, that due regard should be had to a correct relationship between the academic qualifications of the candidate and the subjects he or she is being asked to teach.  In the British and Northern Ireland systems and, indeed, in other systems, the honours graduate in Classics will teach Classics.  He will not be brought in to teach Classics for a few hours and then fill in a few more hours with a subject he is not qualified to teach.  The same should apply to the honours graduate in Irish, French, German, Mathematics or any of the applied sciences.  There should be a correct relationship between the subjects of his qualification and the subjects which he is asked to teach and <Col N="651" /> is being paid to teach and, possibly, in many cases, being returned as teaching.</P>
    <P>That situation does not obtain, so far as I know, in this country.  In my own personal experience, only very rarely&mdash;only twice&mdash;in my rather short teaching career was I able to get a job teaching the subjects of my degree, but I had no difficulty in getting jobs to teach subjects of which I hope I knew something but in relation to which nobody had satisfied themselves of my knowledge in advance.  I do not think the necessity for teaching of science and kindred subjects can be too strongly stressed, when you find people of the stature of Dr. McLaughlin of the E.S.B. speaking on 28th November, 1955, as quoted in the <i>Irish Press</i> of that date saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The purpose of this is to assist the secondary schools of Britain to give better education in pure and applied science and mathematics.  Many of those firms are doing business in this country and I thought something similar would happen here.  I think it must, if we are to keep up with the times.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to add:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was a great tragedy that U.C.D. had not bigger scientific schools and no time should be lost in providing them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit the view of Dr. McLaughlin with regard to technology and to the sciences generally as an informed view to this House.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy said there was a great lack of marine education.  I think it was Deputy Brennan of Donegal who said that and he also made one statement with which I agree whole-heartedly  when he said that education in this country, apart from its general cultural value, an attitude of mind or an educational result or an examination result, for the people who never go beyond primary school education, simply means that they must be equipped for whatever walk of life they follow in whichever country they can be received.  Taking West Donegal along with North Mayo and West Galway, we find many constituencies where <Col N="652" /> there is mainly the small holding and almost invariably a big family.  Only one or, at the most, two of that family can wait at home; the others must go somewhere else, whether in this country or abroad, and surely they are entitled to an education that puts them on a par with their competitors in whatever country they seek work and in whatever sphere they seek work.</P>
    <P>In the field of vocational education, too little use is being made of the national schools and too little use also of the actual vocational schools themselves during the long holiday periods. I think national school pupils of senior classes could, if they show aptitude&mdash; no compulsion about it&mdash;be brought into the vocational schools on Saturday mornings and there given lessons in the ordinary rudiments of everyday activities.  With the advent of rural electrification, it is essential that every boy and girl should understand the various little technical matters in connection with electricity and the working of it.  There should be instruction as regards minor engineering, motor cars and lawn mowers&mdash;it is the season for them&mdash;and that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, you have the secondary pupils with long summer holidays in the big centres where they do little more than wander idly about, and I think if certain summer courses were provided in the vocational schools on a vocational or technical basis, in relation to the subjects I have mentioned, for secondary school pupils, we might then have some chance of lessening the tendency that is rapidly growing up here for secondary school pupils &mdash;certainly at the more mature ages&mdash; to seek work not alone abroad but in this country, in an atmosphere which leaves much to be desired.</P>
    <P>Regarding marine education, there is an excellent centre at Galway and it is to be hoped it will get every assistance&mdash;as I am sure it will&mdash;in making the improvement it seeks to make in marine education.  As a matter of fact, at the moment, through the offices of the Department of Lands and Fisheries, a couple of men are being trained as skippers, first of all, on boats, and the Galway school is so well recognised as a marine centre that these men on completion of sea training <Col N="653" /> will come to Galway and, as one of them rather naïvely put it to me, &ldquo;go to school again for two months&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not trespassed too long upon the time of the House.  I look forward to something being done&mdash;if I might recapitulate in conclusion these two things&mdash;regarding the backward child and speech defects.  I have pointed out methods whereby something can be done about them.  My methods may be the wrong ones, but at least a discussion of wrong methods may bring about the situation where somebody will discover the right ones. Out of difficulties come solutions to great problems and the greater the difficulty, the greater the solution resulting from the harder work.</P>
    <P>If I have been in any way hard on the Minister, I have been hard deliberately and if I have divorced his activities from direction of policy, on the one hand, to the operations of his Department, on the other, I have done so deliberately.  If I have succeeded in making him ask one simple question as a result of this speech, I shall regard myself as being justified.  If he asks his officials in relation to any of the matters I have raised: &ldquo;Has anything been done about this, that or the other; if not, why not, and when do you propose to do it?&rdquo; I shall be satisfied.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos is mian liomsa ag labhairt ar an Meastachán seo, traoslú don Aire Oideachais mar gheall ar an obair tabhachtach atá idir lámhaibh aige. Meastachán mór é seo&mdash;£13,500,000 ach tá díombádh ormsa, a mhéid is atá sé, go bhfuil laghdú £27,289 ar Mheastachán na bliana seo caite.  Ní maith liomsa, maraon le Teachtaí eile, an laghdú sin d'fheiceáil agus aontaim leis na Teachtaí a dúirt i mbliana agus sna blianta eile roimhe seo nach maith an rud é, má tá aon airgead le sábháilt nach ceart é shábháil sa Roinn Oideachais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an mBun-Oideachas, tá baint agam fhéin le 22 blian leis an mBrainnse sin ag múineadh ins na bun-scoileanna.  Bhí baint agam le Mean-Oideachas agus le Gairm-Oideachas freisin.  Táim ar Choiste Gairm Oideachais Conntae na Gaillimhe <Col N="654" /> le 12 blian anuas.  Ach, mar dúirt mé, is leis an mBun-Oideachas atá an baint is mó agam agus labharfaidh mé air sin i dtosach.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú £53,750 sa Mheastachán seo le haghaidh na Brainnse sin ach, mar dúirt an tAire agus an Teachta a labhair romham annseo, tá níos mó páistí ann.  Tá méadu ins an líon páistí ins na bun-scoileanna agus tá níos mó airgid le caitheamh ar tuarastál agus pinsin i mbliana ná mar a bhí.</P>
    <P>Tá laghdú, ámhthach, ar an dá Brainnse eile&mdash;An Meán Oideachas agus an Ghairm-Oideachas agus 10 fá'n gcéad d'ísliú san deontas ceanntsraithe fé ndear an laghdú atá sa Mheán-Oideachas agus in óráid an Aire innseann sé dúinn go bhfuil 6 fá'n gcéad d'ísliú sa deontas bliantúil dos na scoileanna Ghairm-Oideachais.</P>
    <P>Do chuir sé sin díombádh orainn i gContae na Gaillimhe nuair chualamar é.  Do chuireamar é fá bhrághaid cruinniú den Choiste agus ní rabhamar sásta ar chor ar bith leis an ísliú sin mar bhí obair leagtha amach againn&mdash; obair thabhachtach&mdash;go mór mór sa Ghaeltacht agus i scoileanna eile i nGleann na Madadh atá' mo cheantar fhéin, agus i gCorrandula agus i mBaile Atha an Ríogh.  Bhí gach rud réidh againn chun na scoileanna ghairm-oideachais nua sin a thógáil agus bhí ráta 1/2 sa £ leagtha amach ag an gComhairle Contae i gContae na Gaillimhe i gcóir Gairm-Oideachais, an ráta is mó atá in aon contae in Eirinn. Tá muid an-bhuidheach den Chomhairle Contae mar gheall ar an ráta sin a thabhairt dúinn ach nuair thánamar go dtí an t-iar-Aire fuaramar amach go rabh laghdú sa deontas agus ní rabhamar i n-ann dul ar aghaidh leis an obair sin.  Deir an tAire go ndéanfaidh sé a dhicheall an bhlian seo chughainn é sin a thabhairt thar ais. Tá súil agam go mbeimíd i nGaillimh Thuaidh i n-ann dul ar aghaidh le tógáil na scoile i Gleann na Madadh mar níl aon iar-oideachas le fáil ag an líon páistí ins an áit sin mar níl aon chathair mhór in aice na h-áite sin.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile mar gheall ar an ollscoil i nGaillimh.  Tá fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil a lán ollamh agus múinteoirí Gaeilge annsin agus tá súil agam go dtabharfar breis deontais dóibh san <Col N="655" /> Ollscoil sin mar gheall ar an Gaeltacht mhór atá i gContae na Gaillimhe.</P>
    <P>Chualamar an rud céadna arís i mbliana faoi 'n Gaeilge éigeantach. Níl fhios agamsa an fáth go mbíonn an rá sin againn annseo gach blian mar níor cuireadh iachall ormsa, agus tá mé 22 blian ag múineadh i scoil náisiúnta, níor cuireadh iachall orm an Ghaeilge do mhúineadh thar aon adhbhar eile.  Caithimid Béarla do mhúineadh agus uimhríocht agus na h-adhbhair eile agus ní thuigim an fáth go bhfuil an rá nó an phrase &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo; á thabhairt amach nuair a bhíonn daoine ag labhairt ar an Meastachán seo gach blian.  Cuireann sé daoine in aghaidh na Gaeilge a bheith ag eaint mar sin.  Ach, do thárla rud aisteach im' chontae fhéin le déanaí mar gheall ar an mBéarla agus tá súil agam go bhféachfaidh an tAire nua isteach ann.  Nuair bhí scrúdú ar siúl le h-aghaidh príntíseach sa Bord Soláthair Leietreachais cuireadh iachall ar phríntísigh as Gaeltacht Chonnamara serúdú do dhéanamh i mBéarla agus b'in Béarla éigeantach dá chur isteach síos an muméal ar dhaoine go raibh an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga aea.  Bhí rud éigin le rá againn ag an gCoiste Gairm-Oideachais i gContae na Gaillimhe mar gheall air sin agus tá mé cinnte go bhfuil sé sin ós coir an Aire fá láthair agus mura bhfuil ba mhaith liom go bhfeiefidh sé isteach air.</P>
    <P>Iarraim arís ar an Aire gan aon rud a dhéanamh cúis na Gaeilge nó cúis muintir na Gaeltachta do chur siar. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an onóir mhór seo ag an Aire agus tá fhios agam nach ndéanfaidh sé aon dochar ach go ndéanfaidh sé gach maitheas do chúis na Gaeilge agus do chúis mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should like to speak also about the building of national schools.  I wish to compliment the Department and the Board of Works on the design of the new national schools they have erected in recent years.  We were fortunate in the area in which I teach in having a new school erected.  I must say that all the modern amenities of water, sewage, sanitary arrangements and so <Col N="656" /> on have been installed in that school and in other schools which I have seen erected in recent years in rural Ireland.  It is time that was done and I hope it will continue to be the policy.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that I agree with the Deputies who say that there should be more planning with the Land Commission, or those concerned with the site, and with the local authority in the area, to ensure that sufficient land is acquired to provide proper playgrounds for the children.  In my own school, where rural science is being taught voluntarily, I would not like to have the whole village playing there every evening.  I would also be a bit uneasy about the windows of the school.  I would have the playground for the children all right and give them plenty of space in which to play their games.  The local authorities should ensure, when putting in water, that pumps are sunk in the proximity of new national schools.</P>
    <P>We heard, yesterday evening, a Bill introduced in this House to ensure proper cleanliness, sanitation and so on in offices throughout the country in which five people are working.  Where there are crowds of children gathered together in the early and formative years of their lives, it is more important to have for them these facilities which it is proposed to give to five people.  It is very necessary to ensure that the children will have these amenities for cleanliness, sanitation and so forth, during their early years. I hope that this work will be expedited in regard to those schools, and I am sure there are plenty of them yet in the country, which have not got these facilities.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have spoken on a matter of extra subjects.  So far as I am concerned, rural science is being taught and it is an easy matter to teach it when one has the facilities. Implements are given by the Department of Education and the Board of Works and seeds are supplied, but if one has not got the proper amount of land attached to the school, I do not see how rural science can be taught. I would say to leave things as they are and not to have any compulsion about the subject.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> The national school is called the bun scoil.  We have the word bun cloch or foundation.  It is there that the foundation is taught, no matter to what trade or profession the children may go afterwards.  I would urge the Minister to cut out the frills in the programme for national schools and have only the essentials taught there in our own language and in English, and also the three R's and history and geography.  Anything else can come afterwards.</P>
    <P>After 22 years of experience in teaching, I think it is time that we had properly graded textbooks, and we should have them in Irish and English.  Nowadays, a new textbook comes out and is put on the official list from which one must buy.  It is there for a year or two and is taken off and then another book comes out, so that the teachers really do not know where they are.  I have been speaking to old people, some of them old age pensioners, and they can quote even to-day from some of the textbooks from which they learned under the old National Board of Education.  They had Book I and Book II graded upwards. I have not seen any of them, but I have heard them quoted and one of them, I think, was called &ldquo;Reading Made Easier&rdquo;.  They were well bound and could be handed down from one pupil to another in a large family.  If there is a family of five or six children, all going to the national school at the same time, they all have to buy books and it costs a good deal of money.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should look into the question of setting up some sort of board composed of experts which could bring together all the parties concerned, the publishers, teachers' organisations and Department officials, and get down to the problem of having textbooks properly graded and properly bound, so that they would last for a good number of years.  I give that advice to the Minister and ask him to look into it.  When these books are being compiled, they could have lessons on agriculture, our main industry, and lessons on civics.  The board would know what different things could be printed in these books, in both languages, so that the teachers <Col N="658" /> could expand on the material before them.  They would then have standard textbooks of a very high order in their possession.  The great majority of the people have had the experience of the penny Catechism and if they did not understand the meaning of every word of it when they were being taught, they had it off by heart and did not forget it.  Later on when they grew older, they could understand it.</P>
    <P>We have the same thing in history as we have in Irish and English.  In the ordinary two-teacher national school, one may hear, as we have heard sometimes on Question Time, a child who has left the national school not knowing the names of the signatories to the Treaty.  That may happen through the system under which history is being taught.  In the ordinary national school, the history programme is divided into two parts.  In the first year it covers the period from the earlier times, the stone and other ages, in which the majority of children are not interested up to the time of Brian Boru and the Battle of Kinsale.  The second part moves from that time up to the present day.  Children may leave the national school before coming to the most important part of history.  I would suggest starting at the Young Ireland movement and moving on to the 1916 period.  If this board was set up to go into the question of textbooks, these are some of the things which they should consider.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to join with the Deputies who made a plea for the teachers who resigned before 1950.  Those pensioned teachers were in the language movement and the Gaelic League in the old days.  After all their days of service, they now get a different pension because they retired at a certain time.  I know that the Minister understands the figures well and knows that, after all their years of service, some of them have very low pensions indeed.  They are entitled to a better reward from the State and I would ask that their case be gone into again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to wish the Minister well in his new office.  I want to make it quite clear that I know he has just taken <Col N="659" /> over and consequently I suppose we must assume that is the reason why this policy speech is such a thin one and contains very little which is in any way likely to advance us from our present very serious position in regard to education.  I hope for better things next year.  I am sure the Minister will do everything he can to get a good grasp of the subject and, when he appreciates fully the size of the problem, give us really live solutions for the many problems there.</P>
      <P>I regret to say I feel that the Department of Education is one of a fairly large number of State Departments which have been terribly badly handled over the years since the beginning of the State.  I do not think the very serious consequences of that fact can be estimated&mdash;the consequences on the products of our educational system, the uneducated, semi-literate children we send out year after year as young boy and girl emigrants to the different countries of the world.  There are three quarters of a million of them. The vast majority of them end their education at the age of 14 years.  In that way, we have imposed a disability on our children that they can never overcome, no matter how long they live.  I suspect the Minister will have quite a lot of support from his colleagues in attempting to clear up the onerous task facing him in the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago, Deputy Moylan said that the system of education was started by the Conservative British Government of the time with the general idea of turning out labourers and more labourers and that there would not be any appreciable change in the structure of a system wherein the majority of the people were labourers and would continue to be content to be labourers.  The sad thing is that, in my opinion, there has not been a substantial change in the fundamental structure of our educational system since that time.  Certainly, I believe there has been no change in the objectives it lays down for itself.  I think it is still true to say that the vast majority of our children are educated to the labourer standard, and no <Col N="660" /> further.  At least that is so if they have not got the wealth which can provide them with secondary or higher education as good as can be got anywhere.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the different aspects of the Education Estimate in order to try to point out what I believe are its major defects.  I hope to be of some assistance to the Minister in putting a point of view which may help him to come to decisions which will improve the educational system, as it badly needs that improvement. Take the school building programme. I asked the Minister questions recently concerning our schools.  The facts are particularly depressing.  The total number of national schools in the country is about 5,000.  The number which required re-building or replacement in 1947 was 600.  In 1953, the figure was 643.  When I asked a question the other day, the answer given was that the figure in 1956 was 822.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Minister and the Department have not succeeded in overcoming the grave defects of inadequate, cold, damp, insanitary, unhygienic and overcrowded school buildings in which many thousands of our children are trying to get an education and in which so many of our teachers are trying to give them that education.  The position is that out of a total of about 5,000 schools nearly 1,000 require to be replaced.  The answer I was given contained a phrase that &ldquo;the replacement needed for new schools is comparatively non-urgent.&rdquo; I do not know what that means.  Possibly the Minister might tell me what is the definition and what are the detailed considerations which together are non-urgent in assessing the desirability of replacing a school or providing a new school?  In 1952, Deputy Moylan put it very much more bluntly when he said there were 460 schools practically derelict and 1,000 unfit for occupation.  I am sure he knew what he was talking about.  Presumably the 1,000 schools which, in his opinion, were unfit for occupation could not be said to need replacement for comparatively non-urgent reasons.</P>
    <P>The rate of replacement is unbelievably <Col N="661" /> slow.  I cannot understand the complacency with which the former Minister prepared these Estimates, knowing all the facts as he did extremely well, because he has had considerable experience of this, and his acceptance of the present rate of progress in the provision of new schools.  I tried to get the exact figure for the rate of new school buildings per annum.  No doubt the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  I think it is fair to say that the average figure is about 50 per annum.  The average figure for the eight years between 1947-48 and 1954-55 was 46.  There are 1,000 schools unfit for habitation.</P>
    <P>Let us take the Department's own figure, if you like&mdash;822.  At the rate of 50 new schools per year&mdash;no increase on that figure has been suggested&mdash;it would take 16 to 20 years to replace these unfit, derelict schools.  Surely it is not permissible that we should accept that situation calmly.  I am not criticising the Minister now; the responsibility is collective.  Surely we cannot accept that this type of building should be allowed to dawdle along at this completely unrealistic figure, with the formidable prospect of young children having to try to work in overcrowded conditions in schools unfit for habitation.  Is it fair on those children who must attend those national schools because they cannot afford to go to others?</P>
    <P>Is it fair that we should accept this figure of 50 per year?  In addition, it is true to say that the average life expectation of a school is 100 years.  It has been emphasised by the Minister's most recent figures that at the moment we are hardly even keeping up with the replacement of redundant schools, not talking at all of the schools that are nearly derelict.</P>
    <P>That clearly demands a radical reassessment of the school building programme. I hope the Minister agrees with me that it does, that is, if we are to think of these problems in terms of human feeling in relation to the children who are a very special responsibility in any society.  It is quite clear that even if we were to provide 100 new schools per annum, more would still be needed in order to make up for redundancy <Col N="662" /> and to provide something like a reasonable figure for extensions and replacements of derelict and unfit schools.</P>
    <P>There is a special schools division in the Board of Works which is responsible for school buildings, and I understand there is a tremendous accumulation of work in that division.  I do not blame civil servants for these arrears: that is our responsibility.  We must accept that responsibility.  According to figures which I have, there is something in the region of £2,000,000 worth of work in arrears.  I wonder if that high figure is correct.  If so, it seems to me to add further weight to the suggestion that the Department at the moment in control of the system of building schools is totally inadequate.</P>

      <P>In so far as they build schools for the Department of Education, I think the Minister will find, on consideration, that he must speed up the present school building programme, and the suggestion I would make to him in order to do that is that he should set up a special section, rather on the lines of that set up in 1945 by the Department of Health to deal with the building of sanatoria.  In that way, I think it would be possible to get a very substantial improvement in our school building programme.</P>
      <P>In passing, may I join with Deputy Kitt in paying a tribute to those responsible for the standard of building of our new schools, for the quality of the building; and could I pay a particular compliment to those responsible for the very beautiful school in Carraroe in the West of Ireland?  Some people might call it too grandiose; I do not think so.  I think it is a beautiful school.  It would be worth anybody's time to go there and have a look at it.  It is a great credit to those responsible for its design and building. The same can be said of many of our newer schools.  The only pity is that they cannot be provided at a very much faster rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> Another point I should like to take up is the question of the size of classes in schools.  I know this is a hardy annual and I also know that the overall average number of pupils per class is relatively low.  However, in the city areas, the figure is abnormally high.  I wonder if the Minister thought of the possibility of reducing the overall figure to that recommended by the Council of Education.  They recommended 30 as the optimum figure. Admittedly, they went on to discuss the effect of such classes on the national economy.  I do not think I am particularly interested in that reflection of theirs.  My main interest would be in their advice as experts on education, and their recommendation is that the average class should number 30.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that in dealing with classes of 60 or 70 pupils, the unfortunate teacher, working often in bad surroundings, is in the position of finding that all he can do is keep some kind of order in the school, without any hope of educating children.  In addition, of course, there is the fact that there is no hope at all for the child, particularly for the backward child referred to by Deputy Lindsay. The backward child&mdash;not the mentally defective child&mdash;can get very little help from the teacher because the teacher has not the time to give the personal attention that is required.  I think it has the consequence that a considerable number of our children do not reach the sixth standard in the national schools and that very many of them leave school without having got the primary school examination.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to assume that a higher percentage of our children are in any way less gifted or talented than the children of any other society.  I believe that, given proper conditions in the schools, they would be able to benefit from them.  A reduction in the average number of pupils in a class would also mean very important changes in policy on the part of the Minister.  Clearly, the Estimate not having been increased to any extent means that the teachers necessary for a reduction in classes cannot be provided. I understand that, in order to <Col N="664" /> reduce the size of a class to an average of 30, an additional 4,000 new teachers would be needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give very serious thought to this important majority recommendation of the Council of Education.  I understand that all the educational authorities are agreed that 30 is the best size for a class, in order to give the teacher a chance to educate the child and to give the children a chance to assimilate the knowledge which the teacher is putting before them.</P>
    <P>On the question of the training of teachers, it is quite clear that the training schools provided fall far short of the number needed.  The number of trained teachers is 10,000 odd; the number of untrained teachers is 3,018. Does the Minister intend to do anything about the question of the untrained teacher?  Is he satisfied that the children should be taught by untrained teachers?  There is a simple answer.  If he is so satisfied, then there is no point in having trained teachers.  Presumably, he is not satisfied with the whole problem of untrained teachers.  Does he intend to lay down some kind of rule that by a certain time all our teachers shall be trained?</P>
    <P>Now, 3,000 in 10,000 is a very high proportion.  Of those 3,000, I understand a very high percentage&mdash;something  like 60 per cent.&mdash;have been teaching for something like 13 years or more&mdash;untrained for all that time.  In fact, I know a number of untrained teachers who are very talented and gifted and who have learned a lot in their years of experience and who are probably good teachers.  I am not criticising them in any way.  At the same time, the principle is a bad one and we should expect that the children would be taught either by trained teachers or by untrained&mdash;and, naturally, trained teachers is the decision to arrive at.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister accept the suggestion that the untrained teacher who has been teaching for 10 or 12 years, or whatever period the Minister likes to fix, would be accepted, as from a certain date, as a trained teacher?  The <Col N="665" /> Minister could then lay down a specific period&mdash;five or 10 years&mdash;during which time the rest of the untrained teachers must become trained.  That would eliminate the problem without creating undue hardship for those who have been teaching over the years in our schools&mdash;and some of them doing it extremely well.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to do this, it would create problems in the training colleges, which are grossly under-numbered  and grossly inadequate.  If he were to try to deal with the untrained teacher problem and at the same time reduce the classes to the optimum number suggested by the Council of Education, he would need, I suggest, an additional 4,000 teachers. He would have to provide training colleges also for those people who are untrained, who would have to get their training in that 10-year period or other arbitrary period fixed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The total number of teachers turned out by our training colleges is in the region of 400 to 500 per annum, I understand. It is clear that to provide the 4,000 who are required and to deal with the problem of the untrained teacher who requires training now, at least three or four more training colleges would be needed.  Like the school building programme, the training of new teachers hardly meets the present demand which is created by the redundancy or the annual wastage of teachers, which I understand is in the region of 400.  I understand that the number turned out each year by the training colleges is about 500 and that approximately 400 leave the teaching profession because of wastage, due to retirals, and so on.  Consequently, the 4,000 required to reduce the size of the classes to 30 would simply take a fabulous time at the present rate of output from our training colleges.  It seems to me, therefore, that this Minister or the last Minister, or whoever is responsible, grossly underestimated the need for the provision of training colleges.</P>
    <P>There is one consideration about which I should like the Minister to think, in order to try to improve the number of teachers.  I have an open mind on this point and would like the <Col N="666" /> Minister's views.  It is the question of the ban on married women teachers. That ban always seems to me strange in one way and understandable in another.  I would like to hear the Minister's views, as its removal would be a simple way of increasing rapidly &mdash;though I do not know to what extent &mdash;the number of teachers and the only way to reduce the size of the class without waiting for the training colleges.</P>
    <P>It is clear that many of these ladies, when they get married, have had a fair period of teaching and consequently most of them are gifted, valuable and experienced teachers.  It seems to me a shame in one way that they have to give up their work just when they have become so experienced as to be particularly valuable in the school.  Then, of course, there is the fact that a married woman with a family is particularly valuable in the handling of children, as she would have experience from her own children, and would have an understanding of children and their behaviour.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any reason why they should not be allowed to continue teaching.  I cannot see any reason why the ban should not be lifted&mdash;except one reason I have in mind, that probably a woman's first responsibility is to her own family.  That is the only argument which would weigh with me. I do not know if the Minister shares that point of view.  That is the only point which would weigh with me, because, outside that, a lady does not change her teaching qualifications merely because she gets married&mdash;she is just as good a teacher afterwards as before.  Would the Minister give us his view on that question of the ban in relation to married teachers and say whether he would consider using this suggestion as a reasonably rapid way of providing himself with more teachers as quickly as possible?</P>
    <P>There is another consideration in the whole question of the teaching profession.  It is a difficult one and has been referred to in passing by most Deputies.  It is the question of salaries for the profession.  You always have the people who dismiss teachers, the nursing profession and sometimes the medical profession as people with <Col N="667" /> a vocation and somehow or other they believe that once a person has a vocation, he does not need to eat or to provide his children with a reasonable standard of living or with a reasonable education.  The vast majority of teachers do as good a job as they possibly can in the circumstances. There are a number of dedicated people with an absolute vocation towards their profession but, as Deputy Lindsay says, there are a number of them teaching because it is a reasonably satisfying job; they get what they think are reasonably good conditions of vacation and a chance to mould children's minds, which appeals to some people.</P>
    <P>At the same time there is no doubt that in present circumstances, considering the present value of money, they are not treated as generously as the community has a right to treat them.  I understand that the salary for a married teacher at the end of his career is something in the region of £800 odd a year and the single teacher has something around £600 a year.  I do not think that is an adequate salary for a man after 15 or 20 years' work in such a terribly special work as teaching is.  The whole behaviour and pattern of living of future generations to a considerable extent lie with the teachers.  A good teacher is a satisfied teacher and that is reflected in the children's behaviour and in the diligence and dedication with which the teachers do their job.</P>
    <P>A comparison with other salaries and other jobs of persons doing similar work, in my view not so important work, such as insurance, even the Civil Service or bank officials, shows that the teacher is not as well paid as are these people.  A bank official, I understand, who gets no promotion at all throughout his life gets something over £900 a year, and it is very much less exacting work, I should imagine, than the difficult job of teaching in some of our schools.</P>
    <P>One other point in relation to salaries is the disparity between the secondary and primary school teachers. I wonder would the Minister accept it that a primary teacher who is as well <Col N="668" /> qualified as a secondary teacher deserves to be paid at the same rate. Again it is a question of the attitude one has to education.  I do not think there is any period in a person's life which is more important than another in the way it is handled by the teacher, whether it is university, secondary, primary or vocational school.  If a child is badly handled between the ages of four and seven it may be marked for life psychologically. The handling of the child the whole way through its life is important.  Its education is just as important, no matter what phase is taking place.</P>
    <P>I would make a plea to give the national school teacher parity with the secondary school teacher or that where two teachers have not got identical qualifications, the disparity between the two should be reduced.  There is a very good case from every point of view for increasing the salaries of national teachers.  First of all, we should look at it from the teachers' point of view.  We should try to make them more content, more satisfied with their work, and ensure that the person coming into the teaching profession comes into it saying: &ldquo;This is a satisfying job and I am reasonably well paid for it.&rdquo; I do not think they should be penalised because they happen to have a vocation.</P>
    <P>If the teachers are satisfied then you will get the response in the children. You will see the reaction in their care and attention to the children and the fact that they are paid well means that the highest possible standard of entrant will continue to come into the teaching profession.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister if he would give that matter some thought.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the question of continuation education.  I tried to find out from the Minister what the position was in regard to the number of children who get post-primary education.  I am afraid the figures I got were not satisfactory.  I wonder will the Minister correct me if the figures I have here are wrong.  I understand that about 20 per cent. of children after the age of 14 go to secondary schools and about 11 per cent. go to vocational schools.  If those <Col N="669" /> figures are correct, they mean that about one-third of our children get some kind of education when they leave the primary schools, and also that at least two-thirds of our children get no education at all after they leave the primary schools.  That seems to me to be a very high proportion and it is very close to the figure given here by the Minister, that about 30 per cent. of children are at school at the age of 17 or 18.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would give very careful thought to this problem because this is the whole nub of the educational system of any society.  If there is a system of education whereby a considerable percentage of people end their education at an early age such as 14, the consequences to that whole society must be very serious indeed. That is leaving out the consequences on the child.  The child who leaves school at 14 goes out into the extremely competitive world to-day to try to make a living with nothing but, say, a primary certificate if he is lucky.  Some of them do not have a primary certificate; some of them do not get to the sixth standard.  It is not because they are less gifted than the children of other nations.  They are just as gifted but a very high percentage of our children get very little education after the age of 14.</P>
    <P>I think that is one of the saddest things in the whole gamut of life here. Our educational system is content to rest on that as an achievement&mdash;an achievement to turn out so many children illiterate.  Certainly they are turned out with very little skill and with no craft or ability to win a place for themselves in competition with children who have the luck to be born into wealthy families, or in competition with the children in Great Britain to-day, who have the benefit of secondary education, technical education and university.  All these forms of education are now available to the children of other countries in the welfare State.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister's suggestion that people should not bend their knee to a State system.  I would gladly bend the knee to such a system if it meant that, under it, our children <Col N="670" /> would be better educated.  I do not, of course, quite know what a State system means, but if it means that children will be more fully educated and better equipped to earn a living in competition with those children who have had a better opportunity in life and the good fortune to be born into wealthy families, then I will accept that system. As a Minister of State, I do not see why the Minister should be ashamed of providing a State system.  We have such a system in primary education. Why not apply it to secondary education, too?  It would be a tremendous step forward if we extended the opportunity for children to receive a higher education, both vocational and secondary.</P>
    <P>I understand that the number of scholarships at the moment is in the region of 500.  That means that less than 4 per cent. of all children attending secondary schools are holders of scholarships.  That is a pathetic situation. It really means that the child of the average man and woman cannot get a good education.  If we believe in education, as we do for ourselves and for our own children, then we should not settle for less for the children of those who are dependent on us collectively as a State, or as a Government deciding on a future way of life in a society to which it is responsible.</P>
    <P>The child at 14 years of age should have three choices.  If he is not very bright, he should have an opportunity of remaining on in the primary school until 15; in other words, the school-leaving  age in the primary schools should be raised to 15.  Secondly, he should be given an opportunity of passing on to a vocational school. Thirdly, he should be given an opportunity of going to a secondary school. I think that is the least we can do to eliminate privilege from education.  At the moment, it is a grossly privileged service.  There has been very little change over the years.  We still adhere to the tradition the British laid down. Let it be said to their credit that they have now changed that tradition for their own people.  That tradition was that the educational system would be dedicated to the creation of a vast number of labourers to make life easy <Col N="671" /> for the wealthy minority.  Here, we have not radically changed that system, certainly not for the high percentage of children sent out from our schools to compete against those who happen to have a better education because their parents can pay for it.</P>
    <P>The pathetic aspect of this matter is that our people are going across to England to become, in the majority of cases, labourers&mdash;coolies.  That is what most of them are.  That is the work most of them do&mdash;digging the ditches, excavating the tunnels and making the roads, work that the British worker will not do, or allow his children to do. But our people do it; we ship them out in their thousands to do it.  We ship them out to compete against the unfortunate West Indians for the coolie labour available and for the &ldquo;skivvy&rdquo; domestic service.  That is all our boys and girls are trained to do.  That is not much of an achievement in 37 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister has it in his hands now to change that position.  I beg of him to think seriously of this matter.  It is one of the greatest importance.  He has the tremendous privilege of being Minister for Education and he has in his hands the unique opportunity of advancing the cause of these children and giving them a better chance in life.  In support of that plea, I should like to quote, with the greatest respect, the Bishop of Galway, Most Reverend Doctor Browne, who spoke on this subject recently&mdash;slightly to my surprise. He spoke on 25th April and he said, quite rightly, that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the State had not undertaken the responsibility of giving scholarships to all boys and girls to enable them to attend schools and buy textbooks. The contrast with the North in this matter was very pointed and is not such as to attract the people there to join with us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He referred then to the</P>
    <P>&ldquo;lack of support that secondary education received from the State and practically none from the local authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said also that the two serious problems confronting secondary education in the Republic were</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a proper extension of facilities for <Col N="672" /> secondary education and the maintenance of proper standards.  The principle of providing facilities for secondary education within the reach of every boy and girl willing to avail of them had been accepted in the North and in England but not in the Republic.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think he regretted that fact; I hope he regretted it, anyway.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the percentage of scholarships available to the average working man, with four, five or more children is altogether inadequate. Indeed, these scholarships are miserably endowed, relatively speaking, and it is a tremendous hardship on the average working man, with four or five children, to allow a gifted or talented child to take such a scholarship. It calls for a tremendous sacrifice.  To the credit of many working-class parents, they make the sacrifice and do everything they can to give their children a higher education. Not only is such a parent deprived of the few shillings a week that such a child could earn as a messenger boy or a domestic servant, but he has to feed and clothe the child.</P>
    <P>These are additional burdens on a man with four, five or six children.  I think he has too many burdens.  The man who has to earn his living with his own brawn and muscle cannot be blamed if he has not got the wealth to provide his children with the education he was denied because of an inequitable system.  That inequitable system has remained largely unchanged up to the present day.  The children of to-day will grow up and, in their turn, they will find it impossible to give their children a higher education if the present system continues. It is a desecration of a God-given  talent to deny a child the opportunity of a higher education; it is a desecration not to develop talent to the full; it is a desecration not to put the whole resources of the State behind every child endowed by God with an intellect capable of development. Because of the lack of wealth on the part of its parents, however, the child cannot avail of higher education.</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister would have a lot <Col N="673" /> of sympathy with such a proposal.  I would ask him to give serious consideration towards ensuring that one or other of these propositions is made available to the child after the primary school certificate has been passed, that is, to stay on at school until 15 years&mdash;extend the school leaving age &mdash;then go to a vocational school and, finally, go on to a secondary school.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the parents should be encouraged to send the child to one of the latter courses&mdash;the vocational school or the secondary school, as being the most valuable. That may be looked at from the point of view of the child and from the point of view of the parent who has a gifted or talented child and who cannot give such child the education he would like because of lack of wealth.  It must be looked at from the point of view of our national economy.  We are carrying too much weight because people are not advanced to the highest possible technological skill in modern society.</P>
    <P>Were we to do that, as I think we ought, the natural corollary must be to extend the same opportunities to children in university education.  I asked a question about the scholarships available to children in universities and was told they were something under 400 in number.  About 7 per cent. of the students at universities hold scholarships. Yet we talk about equal opportunities and about cherishing equally all the children of the nation.  Is all that not made so much humbug by this position, not only in relation to the secondary schools but in relation to universities?  It is said that it is more difficult for a rich man to enter Heaven than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle.  It is impossible for the child of a working class family to go into a university with the exception of a tiny handful of children who go in by means of these few scholarships. There are four or five thousand people in the universities and under 400 of them go in by way of scholarships.</P>
    <P>I believe that is quite wrong in a democratic Republic with the objects which our people had 30 or 40 years ago.  Any child who has talent should, I think, be allowed to develop that <Col N="674" /> talent to the full; it should not be penalised merely because its parents have not got wealth, which is what we do at the moment.  The Minister should give consideration not only to the secondary and the vocational school problems but to the problem of extending university scholarships.  He should see to it that the scholarships are adequate to provide proper living conditions for these children.  It is no good giving an inadequate scholarship to secure which for his child a man would give his eye but because the child could not survive on it he has to pass it up and give it to somebody else who has a little more wealth.  They should be facilitated in regard to getting an education at the university rather than be completely denied as they are now.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I think we should guard against encouraging children to go into what I consider the relatively futile professions&mdash;I am not denigrating them in any way&mdash;as far as our society is concerned, professions like medicine, architecture and others of which only a very few are needed in any community.  If the Minister were to encourage local authorities to extend university scholarships, he should do so with an eye to slanting the grant in favour of the student who decided to take up some form of agricultural training, dairy science, agriculture, veterinary medicine or any other allied science which would be of help to us as a society as well as to the person who is going forward in that profession.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that we are educating far too many professional people of the doctor, lawyer and architect type when we cannot possible absorb them into our economy.  We are subsidising the universities to educate these people to go abroad.  I do not begrudge it to them but at the same time we have a very great need for highly skilled personnel on the agricultural side of our economy.  The extension of these scholarships is badly needed.  The Minister should bear that point in mind.</P>
    <P>The other point that, I think, he would have to bear in mind, in relation to the extension of the secondary <Col N="675" /> scholarship scheme, would be to provide some grants for school building in the secondary sphere.  I understand that at the moment the religious Orders and others who provide secondary schools have to do so entirely out of their own resources.  I do not know if I am right there but I think that is so.  It seems to me that that is a very serious burden to place upon them.  I doubt if it could be continued were there to be an extension of the secondary schools education through the extension of scholarship facilities to children who would avail of them.  I would suggest that any grants made would be conditional upon the slanting of education away from the present trend in all secondary schools.</P>
    <P>The Department's lists of subjects is, I understand, irreproachable but because of the fact that too many of our secondary schools tend to have their minds upon the child going to a university eventually, the educational system in the secondary schools is determined to a considerable extent by the syllabus for the matriculation examination.  In that syllabus it is necessary for a child to pass in one or other modern language and in Greek or Latin.  Because of that, the secondary schools, in order to try and get its pupils into the university&mdash;it is quite understandable&mdash;attempt to concentrate upon the classics, the dead languages like Latin and Greek, to the exclusion to a considerable extent of science.  It is absurd, I suggest, at this time that the level of science teaching in the secondary schools should be so low.  I think the record of passes in the leaving and intermediate certificate examinations in science in the secondary schools is lower than that of any other major subject.  The number of persons getting honours in science is very much lower indeed.</P>
    <P>I am not in any way criticising the authorities of the secondary schools for that at all.  It is a system that appears to have drifted on and the main affecting factors appear to be the position in the university in relation to matriculation.</P>
    <P>I wonder if it would be possible for the Department to remedy that position <Col N="676" /> by suggesting, in relation to certain subjects, that if a person is going to a university for subjects other than classics&mdash;not subjects, possibly, such as medicine, that needs Latin, but subjects such as engineering or agricultural science, for example&mdash;it would not be necessary for the person to pass matriculation and get Latin in it but that he could take some other subject such, particularly, as science in the secondary school.  In order to facilitate secondary school authorities to provide for extended classes in science, it should be possible to help with grants towards the provision of the very expensive equipment needed in order to teach it.</P>
    <P>I think these are considerations which would enter into any thought the Minister would give to the extension of secondary school opportunities and university opportunities to children through the means of scholarships.  An agricultural bias is very badly needed, indeed.  The technological slant or bias and the agricultural slant or bias in our educational system are completely missed, as far as I can see.  I asked a question on that matter the other day.</P>
    <P>An infinitesimal number of schools teach rural science or nature study.  I do not think it is either wise or healthy that in the secondary schools very little attention is given to trying to make a child&mdash;we are in a largely rural society&mdash;have some understanding of the whole tremendous importance of agriculture in our economy.  I know it is a very unpopular thing to suggest to the teaching profession to add anything to the curriculum, but, for the reasons I have given, the Minister should seriously consider the desirability of adding rural science or nature study to the subjects taught. It is a very important consideration.</P>
    <P>We have drifted much too far away from our roots on the land and our understanding of the importance of the land and the importance of agriculture in our whole society.  Therefore, I feel that in the primary schools and in the secondary schools, the Minister could do very much more than has been done in the past to see that the education provided for our children is more in keeping with the type of life <Col N="677" /> we must lead as a large rural society with relatively small urban communities.</P>
    <P>There is one other side of the educational system which appears to be neglected and to which I should like to refer briefly, namely, the agricultural schools and colleges.  The total number of agricultural students in these colleges in 1953-54 was, I understand, 260&mdash;under 300.  Clearly, that is a completely inadequate figure.  The whole way from the primary schools, through the secondary schools and on to the universities, agriculture as a subject, as the most important aspect of our life in our society, appears to me to have been practically neglected.  I would ask the Minister to bear that in mind in order to try to remedy that defect which I think can easily be remedied as a result of changes in the curriculum for the primary schools and the secondary schools and in attempting to popularise it.  The extension of agricultural education&mdash;rural science and nature study in the primary schools and agricultural science and dairy science in the secondary schools&mdash;would help to condition the minds of the children to go to the agricultural colleges and take higher study in agriculture when leaving school.  At the moment, when a child leaves the primary school it has but little education and, on leaving the secondary school, its whole educational slant has been towards the classics or modern languages, but away from what is most needed, I think, in Ireland to-day.</P>
    <P>The vocational committees on the whole have done a very creditable job through the years in the various areas in organising vocational education.  If it were possible to extend vocational education in the way I have suggested, it is clear that the vocational committees would have to be asked to draw up schemes for their areas to be put into operation over an extended period of from five to ten years, so that it could be done without unnecessary disruption of existing services.  It would be desirable to consult the vocational committees and ask them to draw up schemes suitable for their own areas.</P>
    <P>As I have suggested, I would give three different choices&mdash;staying on in <Col N="678" /> the national school or going on to a vocational school or secondary school. It is clear that you could not do that or extend compulsorily the education of children to 15 years if they had passed the primary certificate at 13 years unless you were prepared to facilitate the child, if it went on to the vocational school, by allowing it to have completely free education there. I know that the cost of these courses is very small, but, at the same time, it is a consideration in itself.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the sacrifice the parent must make, if he or she is to permit the child to deny itself the chance of making a few shillings or some money in some sort of unskilled job.  There is also the point that the parent has to feed and clothe the child and deny himself the income that the child could make if it did not go to the vocational school.  Therefore, the least that could be done is to provide completely free vocational education to children who choose to go to vocational schools.</P>
    <P>I want to talk now about the use of a radio schools service.  I see nothing in the Estimate in that connection and I wonder if the Minister has given any thought to it.  One of the dullest things in the world at school is, I think, history, and yet, I suppose, one of the most exciting subjects in the world must be history.  My recollection of it is one of unrelieved gloom for weeks and weeks on end, trying to assimilate the information which the teacher was doing his best to impart.  I feel that, more than anything else, radio offers tremendous opportunities for the dramatisation of historical events, and this has now become a platitude of truth because of its use in very many countries.  Why have we not developed the use of radio in the schools, using the magnificent actors and dramatists we have to dramatise, as Deputy Kitt said, the events leading up to 1916, and even earlier?  It could be done in a very much more effective way than by the appalling business of opening a dull class book, starting at page 1 and reading through to page 5,000&mdash;at least it felt like that when I did it.</P>
    <P>I have listened to schools broadcasts in Great Britain, not only on history <Col N="679" /> but on other subjects.  There is no doubt that radio means a tremendous advance in the education of children. An even greater advance still has been brought about by the use of television but I suppose it would be too much to hope that the Minister would consider that at the moment.  Would he, however, give some thought to the question of providing for the use of radio for the education of children in the different subjects which can be put over incomparably well on the radio, much better than any harassed and overworked teacher can do it?  This is so particularly in the case of history, which I had in mind, and also in the case of literature, poetry, science and various other subjects in which you can get a person who is a complete expert at putting across a point of view to put it much more convincingly than the average, overworked teacher who has tried to master so many subjects&mdash;he has mastered some of them but he cannot be master of them all.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very remarkable gap in our whole educational system. I would ask the Minister to try to devise with Radio Éireann programmes for dissemination to the schools and provide wireless sets for those schools which would care to use them.  In addition there is great need and great demand for the use of travelling film units for schools.  Again, the use of films in schools is old in many countries; the film as an educational medium is an incomparable one but we hardly use it at all.  I would suggest that the Minister consider the question of trying to provide film units which would go round to our schools with films, in Irish I suppose, preferably made here at home, dealing with different subjects, scientific and geographical, and subjects of interest of all kinds, which are available in the National Film Institute.  There is a tremendous library of films available there and I am surprised that there is no mention of an attempt to extend the magnificent educational media of the film and the radio in the departmental Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the language in his speech but so far as <Col N="680" /> I can see, he loved it and left it.  He said something about: &ldquo;We have for example thrown most of the weight of the restoration of the Irish language on the teachers....&rdquo; He did not go on to do anything to remove the weight of the restoration of Irish from the teachers, so far as I know.  I do not think he made any useful suggestions as to how the Irish language could be revived.  Possibly that is due to the fact that he has only had a very short time in office and has not had time to give it as much thought as he would like to give it, and will have given it by this time next year.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the revival of the language.  As Deputy Lindsay said, or implied, the language revival movement&mdash;I would prefer to take responsibility for the statement myself&mdash;has been a complete failure.  I say it has been a complete failure; I think I can honestly say that, in so far as I am only concerned with and interested in it, as Davis, Pearse and these other people were, as a spoken language.  Irish is not the spoken language nor is there any chance of its being the spoken language, I think, under existing circumstances for the foreseeable future, if you like to use that lovely phrase.</P>
    <P>I believe it is true to say that the national language is not spoken among the ordinary people in their everyday work.  I think that statement cannot be controverted.  I would go further and say that among a very high percentage of our people the language is not loved.  That is very strange because it is a very beautiful language, probably one of the loveliest languages in the world and the most beautiful one I have heard.  It is rather unnatural that a nation does not love its own language.  I say that not because I think we are in any way abnormal or unnatural.  We should try to find out why we do not love the language and, through the Minister, try to remedy that situation, try to create a desire to speak the language among the children.  It is clear the revival can only be successful when the children speak the language after leaving the schools.  I do not want to appear to be deriding the efforts of people who <Col N="681" /> have tried to revive the language; I think practically every one of them has done everything in his power, genuinely intending to revive the language, and the reasons it has not been revived are very difficult indeed for anybody to ascertain.  I suppose each one of us has as much right to put forward his point of view as the other.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent, I believe it has to do with earlier days and the antinational attitude of many people towards the language.  That is largely gone, although there may be a vestige of it remaining in people who would be hostile to anything like the language. I think there is a certain element of that hostility present still but it is very much weaker now than it used to be.  In fact, I wonder if it were a bit stronger and if there was some open hostility would the language not be stronger too?</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for the failure of the revival but I think some of them are concerned with the curriculum in primary and secondary schools.  Among the obvious reasons is, of course, the fact that a language is a terribly difficult thing to teach to children when the children do not learn to speak it at home.  A child learns Irish for a few hours a day and then goes home and hears nothing but English, and this makes it terribly difficult to get the language across to the child.</P>
    <P>Again, a number of teachers, through no fault of their own, have not complete control and understanding of the language in many cases and it is an effort to them to teach.  At least it is not as easy for many teachers on this side of the country as it would be in Clare or Galway and, consequently, the difficulty they may have is reflected in their attempts to teach the children. Another point is that so many of our children must emigrate&mdash;I believe the figure is one in three&mdash;and the practical parent feels that if a child is going to emigrate&mdash;750,000 have emigrated&mdash; what on earth is the use of learning the language?</P>
    <P>I know that is a practical approach to the matter and does not leave room for emotion or sentiment but the average parent is primarily conscientious <Col N="682" /> about the child's ability to earn a living.  He consequently feels that the language interferes with the amount of time spent on other subjects and that the time spent on the language is time spent learning a subject which might be of no use to the child afterwards.  That, I believe, is misinformed to a considerable extent, but it happens to be true in respect of so many children.  It is understandable that parents should feel that the child is learning a language which will be no use to him later on because he must emigrate.  We have been told that many children must emigrate and that it is a good thing that they should emigrate; consequently, an intelligent parent will say: Why should the child learn Irish which will be of no value to it afterwards?</P>
    <P>There is the other consideration&mdash; Deputy Kitt referred to it slightly and there is confusion about it&mdash;that is, the question of compulsion in relation to the language.  I agree with Deputy Kitt that effectively there is no compulsion in relation to the language, but there has grown up a feeling that there is compulsion, in this way, that a certain number of posts, Civil Service posts, local appointments, and so on, are subject to the language test.  Over the years, many thousands of people have gone forward for these posts and were not successful.  They were not successful, for the perfectly good reason that they were not the most suitable persons for the job, but a feeling, or spirit, or idea, or whispering campaign has grown up that the reason they did not get the job was that they did not know Irish.  It is a lovely, simple explanation for their own inadequacy in many cases.  That idea has gone around and has become very much stronger.  It may be true in a minority of cases but, broadly speaking, I do not think it is true. That does not weaken the point that, many children having to emigrate, the intelligent parent may say: &ldquo;I do not think he should know the language.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I very much regret that fact as a person who has a deep regard for the language, but it is a fact and it has to be faced.  Of course, it goes outside the scope of the Minister's Department <Col N="683" /> because the only solution to that aspect of the problem is the ending of emigration and I shall not put that responsibility on the Minister; but, while that is there, it is an important factor in colouring the views of people on the language.</P>
    <P>In relation to the primary curriculum and its effect on the language, teacher Deputies here will bear with me if I give my views as a layman on the question of the curriculum in educational matters.  I fully appreciate the limitations that a layman must have in discussing these matters, but, for what it is worth, I believe that the curriculum of the primary schools is very satisfactory in relation to the language question right up to the last hurdle, that is, the primary certificate. Up to that, I understand, most of the teaching of the language is oral teaching. Most of the work done is oral work of one kind or another.  There are reading and writing, but the emphasis is placed on facility to speak the language. I understand that that is so.</P>
    <P>When the teacher and the child are faced with the primary certificate, they are faced with a written examination in Irish and it is quite clear, therefore, that if the teacher is to try to get his pupils through the primary certificate, he has to concentrate on the written side of the language, to the detriment of the oral teaching of the language. That is probably true.  The Minister will correct me if it is not true, but I think it is.  There comes then this awful obsession with this primary certificate, and with Irish in the primary certificate in particular and the child has the frustration of sometimes a very large class, the difficulties of the teacher, the fact that only English is spoken in the home&mdash;it is all right in the Gaeltacht areas&mdash;and Irish then becomes a terribly difficult subject to try to write.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the only way to learn a language is by the ear.  That is an outrageous statement for a complete amateur to make, but that is my own belief, that the easiest way to learn a language is to go to the country where it is spoken and to listen to it.  However, I think it is <Col N="684" /> broadly true that oral explanation of a language or education through oral methods in a language is the quickest way of picking up a language.  One might not be able to write or even to read it very well, but one could speak it reasonably well and that is the thing we should aim at, to speak the language and, in addition, to love the language because we will not speak it unless we do love the language.</P>
    <P>We should not lose sight of that fact, and, because of that fact, I would suggest that we lose sight of the necessity or forget the present necessity to have a written test in the primary certificate and eliminate that written test altogether.  I know there are people objecting to it and it is said that they object to the whole idea because they are against the language. That is not true.  It is because I am on the side of the language and want to see the language grow stronger that I suggest that we must accept that the present system is wrong and needs some radical change.  I suggest that the subject should be dropped from the primary certificate, that we should have an oral test in the language and that the oral test should not be associated with the primary certificate at all.  I know that that is a suggestion which may appear to be rather radical and unacceptable, but again I come back to the point that the people must love the language.</P>
    <P>I have heard people speaking Welsh in Wales and they speak it, just like they sing, because they love the language and are pleased to speak it. That is not like us.  The antipathy towards Irish stems from the method of trying to teach the language in the primary schools.  Why I would urge the removal of the language from the examination altogether is that if the child, first of all; goes to the stress of any examination&mdash;which we all know is a great strain on any individual&mdash; and goes through the examination and finds that he fails in Irish, in the written Irish in particular, then the child visits his resentment, just like the adult visits his resentment when he loses a post, on the language and blames the language because of his inadequacy in some other way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> Because of that, I would suggest that the language should be taken away from examinations.  The whole emphasis should be on the relaxation that the language lesson is during the day. The idea for the half-hour or hour or whatever the class may be that is devoted to Irish should be: &ldquo;We will relax now and we will talk the language,&rdquo; instead of: &ldquo;We will get down and flog this into them and they will learn the genders and the past participles&rdquo; and all these things which, no doubt, have to be learned by people doing a serious study, but for the child whom you just want to get to speak the language, it seems to me that they are not necessary.  It would be much wiser to remove the stress that is associated with this competitive element of examinations and try to create the attitude: &ldquo;We are teaching you the language; it is a wonderful heritage and in the Irish class all the stress disappears.  We learn it because it is a very lovely language and a great treasure which you must be very proud to own and to hold and to promote.&rdquo; I would remove the language from the examination altogether and have simply an oral test.</P>
    <P>Another reason for removing it is that if you have an oral test and you have an examiner going around the schools, if the child is a shy child, the stranger coming into the school and trying to talk to him in any language at all is likely to frighten the child, and consequently a child who is shy but possibly very good at the language might fail at the language, although he spoke the language very well indeed.  I would suggest that the Minister should bear that point in mind and abolish the written paper altogether, except, of course, in the Gaeltacht areas where it is no trouble to them at all.  The primary school has that defect and it is still in the secondary schools.  It is possibly even worse in secondary schools from what I can gather.</P>
    <P>In the secondary schools, there is little or no emphasis on spoken Irish at all.  I understand that in the intermediate or leaving certificate, a person could get high honours in Irish and not speak a word of the language.  It seems <Col N="686" /> an extraordinary state of affairs to me and it seems to go back to the curious emphasis we place because we insist on teaching the language as if it was mediaeval history.  We are doing more damage to the language movement by this wrong approach to the teaching of the language than was ever done in the years before we took over the educational services ourselves.  It is depressing, but I do not wish to be taken as being in any way superior or criticising people who have made a mess of things.  I think everybody has been genuinely anxious to revive the language and I am not suggesting I have a monopoly of suggestions on how to revive it.  I am merely suggesting that these are considerations which might be important ones in helping the Minister to make up any policy which he might devise for the restoration of the language during his years of office.</P>
    <P>The odd thing is that apparently in the Six Counties one must, in order to get the senior certificate, pass an oral test which is compulsory for all modern languages and for Irish.  That is an interesting speculation.  I think the subject of the revival of the language is a terribly complex one, and, as the Minister said, it has some of its roots in education and emigration, in so far as so many people do have that shadow over them.  Consequently, the movement towards the revival of the language really encompasses every Department of State.  The only work in which the Minister has responsibility is in relation to the curriculum in the primary and secondary schools.</P>
    <P>I wonder would he consider restoring the old idea of the Fainne for children who can speak fluent Irish?  I remember in my own school days it seemed a tremendous incentive to us to try to secure the silver Fainne and the gold Fainne.  Then, it was more of a competition and more a pleasure to try to wear these badges and to show that one could speak the language.  There was none of the resentment which seems to be current to-day amongst so many children towards the language.  It is difficult to generalise about all these things, but, broadly speaking, it is true that there is a current of resentment.  It <Col N="687" /> may be transmitted from the child to the parent, or perhaps from the parent to the child, or it may be transmitted from the teacher to the child where classes are too large.  To try to remedy that situation is another of the wonderful opportunities which lie with the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is only one other question which I should like to deal with very briefly, that is the question of punishment in the schools.  It is a matter to which the Minister will possibly have to give some thought.  I am probably in a considerable minority in my attitude to this question for I hold the view very strongly that corporal punishment is an utterly mediaeval and barbarous practice.  I say that both as a parent and as a doctor, and not as a specialist in those subjects, but as a person who has gone through school.  I suggest that it is a very wrong thing for an adult to beat a child which is, in effect, what we do in our schools.  I am not talking about the brutal beating that takes place occasionally, but about the normal chastisement which is allowed by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I think it is wrong for a number of reasons.  I think it is always wrong for an adult to beat a child, for a grown-up to beat somebody smaller than himself.  The odd thing is that among adults we accept the principle that a bigger person should not hit a smaller person, but at the same time we have adults hitting children.  I do not know why it is done and my feeling always has been that if one has a rational intelligent child and puts an argument forward to that child that this is the correct pattern of behaviour, if it is correct behaviour, the rational child will accept that.</P>
    <P>If the child refuses to accept what is a rational argument from the teacher, then there can be only one of two explanations: first of all, that the teacher has not put his point of view clearly and has not been able to convey the idea behind his argument to the child and the child misunderstands the case that the individual is making. The alternative is that the child is not a rational individual and is in some <Col N="688" /> way intellectually substandard, and has some emotional disturbance in the background which makes it particularly recalcitrant; but the emotional circumstances in the background and the inability of the teacher to make his argument clearly understood are not justifications for beating the child.</P>
    <P>If one has not been able to persuade the child of the wisdom of one's argument, how can one hope to explain one's point of view merely by hitting the child across the hand with a stick or beating the child?  Is it not clear that it is complete futility and completely wrong and an abuse of our position as adults <i>vis-à-vis</i> the child ? The inarticulate child cannot defend himself and is unable to put its own point of view to the adult.  For that the adult beats the child.</P>
    <P>I may say that my antipathy to beating children extends to parents as well.  I would not like to seek to deny the right of teachers to beat children, without equally saying I do not think any adult, parent or teacher, should beat a child.  Possibly in time I may be able to persuade more people to my point of view.  Many other countries have accepted that point of view.  In most books now, educational authorities sum the whole thing up by calling it a barbarous practice.  The difficulty indeed, when reading into the question of corporal punishment, is to find an average modern book on child education which recommends the beating of a child as an aid to education. To me, it is so clearly absurd that I cannot understand why it is still retained. I know that most of us were beaten at one time or another.  I do not think that justified the retention of the evil from one generation to the next.  I have been told &ldquo;I was beaten and look at me&rdquo; by people who believe in the thing.  I do look at them and I wonder are they the same people they think they are.  Is this anxiety on their part to beat a child not one of the consequences of vindictive retention of hostility to an adult which they are now trying to pass on to the child ?</P>
    <P>It seems to me it is very difficult to make a case for the beating of a child. If the child is not a rational being, <Col N="689" /> then it is a medical case.  It is a case for the doctor or the psychiatrist, as was mentioned here by Deputy Lindsay.  Magnificent work is being done by the psychiatrists in the upgrading of children, in upgrading the substandard child to fourth-grade, the fourth-grade child to third-grade, the third-grade child to second-grade and the second-grade child to a higher degree.  Equally, the child who has some emotional disturbance in its background is again a case for the psychiatrist, the doctor and medical attention.</P>
    <P>The beating of a child may be explained, but cannot be excused, as being the only way in which order can be kept in big classes.  That is an understandable argument from teachers trying to prevent bedlam breaking out in 60 to 70-pupil classes.  However, it cannot justify our beating the child for something the child is not responsible for, that is, providing teachers with classes they can control.  Many investigations have shown that, in the majority of cases, the recalcitrant child in school comes from a home where there are difficult domestic circumstances of one kind or another. These are circumstances over which the child has no control.  Inarticulate teachers, its own inadequacy, domestic circumstances in the home, overcrowded classes, difficult, insanitary surroundings&mdash;these are all conditions over which the child has no control whatever.  Consequently, it would seem to me that the whole question of punishment for children in the schools should be&mdash;and I hope will be&mdash; radically reconsidered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>For the life of me, I cannot see how, if a person has failed to put across his point of view by rational argument, he is justified in taking a blunt instrument to get that idea into the child's head. That is what it more or less amounts to.  Imagine ourselves as politicians if we were to adopt that attitude. Suppose if a person did not or would not see our point of view or refused to acknowledge our point of view, how would we feel if we were to walk across the House and start beating one another over the ear or over the head, taking violent action against our <Col N="690" /> opponents because they could not, would not or did not accept our point of view?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give this whole question serious consideration. I know it is a complicated subject.  I may see it too simply.  To me, it is so simple that I find it difficult to understand any rational background for continuing that practice.  As I say, it comes to the point with me that, if you are going to hit anybody, then choose somebody your own size; do not choose a child.</P>
    <P>In sum, I hope most of the points I have referred to will be of help to the Minister in the terribly difficult problem ahead of him.  I think he should get a lot of sympathy from a number of his colleagues in the Government because they have at different times expressed themselves in sympathy with the idea of improving the educational system generally and expressed themselves in sympathy with the idea that we should not have a preferential educational system, a system in which preference is absolutely rampant, in which the child of poor parents is penalised because of the lack of wealth of its parents.  One of the Minister's colleagues described our educational system as one of the worst in Europe.  I have not sufficient experience of educational systems in Europe, but I would be prepared to take his word for it, because he is a person who has a fair knowledge of these things.</P>
    <P>I would suggest then to the Minister that what he should aim at would be an educational system that, first of all, gives a child, no matter whose child, the same chance as he would expect for a child of wealthy parents &mdash;the open sesame of the cheque book to our secondary schools and our universities.  The aim of the men in the 1919 Dáil was to provide a democratic programme, cherishing equally all children in the nation.  The Minister now has a magnificent opportunity of redeeming that great pledge made on behalf of the men who sacrificed so much 30 or 40 years ago in order to establish a militant democratic Republic, of putting an end to a system established by the British <Col N="691" /> régime and which we have retained practically unchanged in its fundamentals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I followed with great interest the speech of Deputy Browne. He went into the various phases of education very minutely.  I am sure that if all the points he put forward in such great detail concerning primary, secondary, vocational and university education could be carried into effect, we could say we had the ideal system of education in Europe.</P>
      <P>I have only one or two observations to make.  They arise more or less from what Deputy Browne has said.  If we had an ideal programme in the school and if we had well qualified teachers&mdash; this applies equally to primary, secondary, vocational and even university education&mdash;I can assure you we could leave the rest to the teachers, provided that these are well equipped, good schools with all the amenities necessary in modern society.</P>
      <P>Many views have been put forward here by Deputies from year to year and quite recently by the various organisations&mdash;the national teachers, the secondary teachers and the vocational teachers.  I feel sure the Minister and his officials must realise fully what would be good for the welfare of education.  They have been told all the difficulties and have been given suggestions on possible improvements.  The blame for any of the difficulties in the present educational system cannot be laid at the door of the Minister.  He has not been sufficiently long in office; but as his term of office goes on, we will be in a position to criticise him for what he did not do and to praise him for what we hope he will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest difficulties in the present system is the lack of co-ordination between primary, secondary and vocational education.  I will not deal with university education because those who can afford to send their children to a university will be all right.  I am speaking now of our educational system in so far as it affects children who at the present <Col N="692" /> time cannot get secondary education, or even vocational education.  I think it is necessary in this modern age that our children should not only be well educated mentally but also that they should be taught how to use their hands.</P>
    <P>I may put forward two suggestions through which our children could get good primary education, secondary education to a certain extent, and then vocational training.  You must either bring the children to the schools or the schools to the children.  We know very well that, in remote rural areas, where the schools are long distances from the homes of the children, it is utterly impossible for most children to get any secondary or vocational education, unless such instruction is made available close to the rural national schools.  If possible, we should have attached to the rural national schools a separate department where children could continue their education after the age of 14 years&mdash; something on the lines of what I might call higher primary education.</P>
    <P>Of course, such a system would require specially qualified teachers who would be able to instruct the children up to the intermediate certificate stage.  Then, having reached the age of 16 years, the children could be given vocational education.  At present most children leave school at the age of 14 years.  Some of them leave before that because there is no compulsion in respect of children who have to travel long distances.  Perhaps my suggested system would be the ideal thing.  The only alternative would be a certain degree of centralisation, which would mean the provision of one big primary school, secondary school and vocational school in the same place.  The children could be brought to this centre by some system of subsidised transport.  C.I.E. buses might be made available and the fares subsidised by the State.</P>
    <P>It is only in one of these two ways that we will succeed in getting our children properly educated.  It is in one of these two ways that we will have any hope of reviving the Irish language.  Up to the age of 14 years, a child learns against his will.  Perhaps that is why corporal punishment has to <Col N="693" /> be resorted to.  I do not at all agree with what Deputy Browne has said in connection with corporal punishment. I think corporal punishment is essential to a certain degree.  Reasonable corporal punishment is necessary in the home; it also occasionally becomes necessary in the school.  I agree that corporal punishment should not be used after a child leaves the primary school.</P>
    <P>My suggested system would also make provision for what I would call the retarded child.  Every teacher has experience of such children.  It is very difficult to make proper provision for them under present circumstances, because, under our present system of inspection, a teacher, being human, will always give the greatest attention to the intelligent child and has no time to devote to the individual attention needed by the backward child.  Various views have been put forward as to how backward children should be dealt with in our schools.  Special teachers might be provided for them, if that is possible, in special classes.  Under the present system, they are kept back in classes, but I do not think such treatment has the desired effect, as it may give such children inferiority complexes.</P>
    <P>Backward children have been known, when given proper vocational training, to have become very skilled in such arts as carpentry.  These children would have excellent opportunities if we could provide a system of higher primary education and subsequent vocational training.  I should like to give an example of how successful a backward child can become if given the proper opportunities.  In my school, there was a very dull boy.  He was a very fine fellow otherwise, and as a dull child always comes to school unwillingly, so did this fellow.  I often told him that unless he came to school more regularly and endeavoured to learn, he would be forever a hewer of wood and a drawer of water.  That boy went to England at the age of 18 or 19 years.  He remembered what I told him.  He went to a technical school in London and became an architect.  I can tell the House he was one of the head men in the erection of the beautiful <Col N="694" /> building in Kildare Street, the Department of Industry and Commerce. To-day he is one of the leading contractors in Dublin.  That is an example of what can be done by vocational education.</P>
    <P>All that will require money.  The ideals of Deputy Browne would require millions of money.  That is the whole trouble in a country like this where we have not got the money.  Everything should be done to give the children that type of education.  Then, whether they stay in this country or go to another, they can regard themselves as skilled workers.</P>
    <P>As one who was a teacher and who is a member of a vocational education committee, I regret very much, and we all did I am sure, the cuts in the grants for vocational education.  Perhaps it could not be avoided and I was glad to see in the Minister's opening statement that, while there can be no hope this year of renewing these grants, they may come back next year. Committees, of course, had their schemes laid down for the work and they had to review the schemes for the vocational schools.</P>
    <P>As regards school buildings, heating and cleaning, I am sure that vast improvements have been made in the erection of new schools and the renovation and improvement of existing schools.  The Department of Education and the Board of Works have done their best to carry out all those very necessary improvements, having regard to the financial resources which were placed at their disposal.  The system of heating and cleaning is not satisfactory. There are various views put forward by the teachers about it, but there is one thing certain, that teachers do not want to make any change in the present managerial system and the managers are really responsible for the heating and cleaning.</P>
    <P>Anyone will understand that, after all, the manager has no funds to carry out these requirements.  There is a grant given to managers for heating and cleaning in accordance with the average of the school, but of course that is a wrong system because there <Col N="695" /> may be a pretty large school with a small average, where you have to keep two fires and you require just as much for that as you would for a still larger school.  The only solution is to increase the grants to the managers.  If the grants are increased, I am sure managers will do their duty with regard to heating and cleaning.</P>
    <P>In various places, the parents help wherever they can and, by the way, it was my experience that even the poorer parents were just as helpful and anxious as the wealthy parents to see the school properly heated.  The poorer parents are always very anxious about the education of their children.  They are willing to scrape everything to try to get them as good an education as possible.  One need not bother about the children of wealthy parents as they will be well looked after.</P>
    <P>Like some other Deputies, I should like to finish up by saying a word for the pre-1950 pensioned teachers.  I need not dwell at any length on the case which can be made in their favour, because past Ministers, Deputies and Senators have given their views and they have been put forward here. When Deputy Mulcahy was Minister for Education from 1948 to 1951, he increased the pensions for all pensioned teachers up to that stage.  That was one good thing in favour of Deputy Mulcahy.  When the former Deputy Moylan was Minister for Education from 1952 to 1954, he came to the rescue of those pre-1950 teachers to a certain extent.  At that time, I think it would cost about £1,000,000 to give the gratuity which had been given to all teachers who retired after the 1st January, 1950.  He gave them one-third &mdash;something like £350,000.</P>
    <P>There is still two-thirds due to those teachers.  I am afraid that in the meantime many of them have passed away.  I hope that, as Deputy Mulcahy made provision for all pensioned teachers at one stage and as the former Deputy Moylan made some provision to help pre-1950 teachers, the present Minister will, as soon as the financial situation allows it, pay those pre-1950 teachers the remainder of the <Col N="696" /> gratuity.  Even if he cannot pay the whole amount, which would be something in the neighbourhood of £750,000, perhaps he could pay them one-third in one year and another one-third the year after.  I am sure those pensioned teachers would be quite agreeable to that and I understand they would be, so long as they eventually get the whole amount which is really due to them.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland, all the pensioned teachers get the gratuity away back, no matter from what period they retired.  I hope now that the Minister will see that that will be given also to the pre-1950 teachers in the Republic of Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies criticised me for the <Col N="698" /> fact that I was unable to enunciate in my statement what the policy of the Department of Education should be under my ministry.  Personally, I think I would have a cheek to come in here after one month in the Department and try to promulgate a policy that should be followed, so far as education is concerned.  It would be rather presumptuous of me to put across Deputies, many of whom are teachers, some changes which apparently many of them desire to have put into effect. I prefer, having given a general intimation of my broad approach to the problem of education, to examine the points that have occurred to me in the light of expert advice, in the light of non-expert advice, and particularly&mdash; and I am sure no Deputy would wish that I would do otherwise&mdash;to have regard to what the Deputies themselves put forward for my consideration. I believe that is the best approach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, in particular, accused me of being complacent.  I am in no way complacent about our system of education, but I will repeat that I think the system we have is a good one.  I will not deny for a moment that it has its defects.  Any system that has so many branches and is of such magnitude as the educational system could not but have its defects, and, so far as I can and in the time at my disposal, I hope to contribute to the eradication of those defects.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was also made by Deputy Norton that we ought to establish some form of inquiry into the question as to whether or not we were getting full value out of our system of education for the money the nation is pouring into it.  In the next breath, Deputy Norton asked me what had the Council of Education done in that respect.  The sequence of his remarks indicated to me that when he was making his suggestion about the establishment of such an inquiry, he forgot that while he was Minister and Tánaiste in the first inter-Party Government this Council of Education had been set up, and when he was Tánaiste in the second inter-Party Government, the council had made a report on the system of education of <Col N="699" /> our young people up to the age of 12.  I believe that they were fairly representative of the community as a whole and I am sure that to set up another committee of inquiry would be redundant, futile and certainly would be a sad reflection on the work the Council of Education has done to date.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also criticised the standard of education the average young person has on leaving school, particularly the primary schools, at the present day, and like many another person went back to the good old days. I often wonder were the good old days as good as they are painted.  I am tired of people telling me that people in particular spheres, whether in education or sport, nowadays are not half as good as the men in that sphere 50 years ago.  I say that from the educational point of view, they are a great deal better than the men of 50 years ago, especially having regard to the fact that there are so many attractions with which the young person attending school nowadays has to contend as a distraction from his course of learning in school.  For one thing&mdash; I am sure Deputy Norton will agree with me&mdash;the degree of illiteracy that existed 20, 30 and 50 years ago was far in excess&mdash;in fact I am sure it is wrong for me to make any comparison, but I will be generous to those of the old days&mdash;of what it is at the present day.</P>
    <P>I wish to make another comment on something that is too often repeated, that is, the cliché of &ldquo;illiteracy in two languages,&rdquo; as suggested by Deputy Larkin.  I do not know why people repeat that cliché so often.  Possibly it sounds funny and it may seem a good argument to put across, but I have yet to be convinced on that point.  I have not been very long in charge of education, but, as a layman, I have yet to be convinced that the teaching of Irish has in any way dulled efficiency in our schools, whether they be primary or secondary.  I have yet to be convinced that it has in any way affected the ability of children, irrespective of age, to learn English.  I agree with some Deputies that if we had perhaps more spoken English, as well as spoken <Col N="700" /> Irish, the standard of English would be generally higher and our method of expression would reach an improved level, a level that it would be desirable to reach.  But until such time as someone can prove to me in a practical fashion that the teaching of Irish has resulted in this dual illiteracy, I refuse to be convinced by the type of argument put forward here; I refuse to be convinced that either the learning or teaching of Irish has done any damage to the general standard of education here.</P>
    <P>Reference was made yesterday by a newcomer to this House, and I am sorry that I have to contradict him so early, to the fact that there was so much dissatisfaction amongst our teachers that they are emigrating at a very fast rate.  He suggested that in the past year 60 teachers emigrated to Canada.  I have taken the trouble to find out exactly how far correct that statement was.  The statistics and returns available to the Department show that three men and 12 women went to Canada last year.  There were four other instances of emigration to other parts of the world, bringing the total to 19.  To suggest, therefore, that 60 emigrated to any one country, much less to any place abroad, is completely false.  It is time that people stopped repeating these falsehoods.  For what purpose they repeat them, I do not know.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne spoke at great length.  He obviously went to a great deal of trouble in preparing his arguments.  I agree the school buildings programme at the present time is not nearly adequate to replace the existing substandard schools and to provide against annual wastage.  The present figure is somewhere in the region of 50 per annum.  Over 800 schools need replacement, some not as urgently as others.  With other schools coming in, which are not at the moment scheduled for replacement, we shall, I am afraid, have to strive for a higher target than 50.  My target would be something in the neighbourhood of 75.  If that is not sufficient, we shall have to strive for a target of 100 per annum.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the size of the classes.  That is, as he himself <Col N="701" /> suggested, a hardy annual.  I agree that the problem there has a direct relationship to the problem of backward children but, as Deputy Palmer rightly observed, in order to achieve the objectives put forward by Deputy Browne we would require several million pounds.  I am advised that to reduce the size of classes to the desired number&mdash;Deputy Browne suggested 30 &mdash;would require 4,000 new teachers.  To increase the school leaving age to 16, would require 400 to 450 extra teachers.  Taking one with the other, I do not have to impress on anybody, I am sure, what the cost would be. Nevertheless, irrespective of what the cost would be, it is a goal at which we should aim; it is a target we should endeavour to achieve in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>That, again, has a direct relationship to the question of untrained teachers and married women teachers.  Deputy Browne asked directly what my attitude to married women teachers is; I can tell him offhand that I think it is a great waste of teaching power that women teachers, on marriage, are obliged to retire at the present time. I have not had sufficient time to examine the problem any more closely than that.  I know there are several points of view, apart from the one which he himself suggested and which is, apparently, the only one that would commend itself to him, namely, that a married woman's place is in the home. I am sure that, as a doctor, he realises there are many other considerations.</P>
    <P>I shall not deny for a moment that the number of scholarships available to secondary schools and universities is very, very small indeed having regard to the numbers who attend these establishments.  In so far as I can achieve it&mdash;I do not know what my powers are in relation to persuading local authorities to increase both the number and the amount of scholarships&mdash;I shall do everything in my power to bring about some improvement in the position.  I assure other Deputies who spoke on this matter that I agree that the agricultural and scientific slant ought to be part and parcel of the allocation of these scholarships.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> To deal with all the points made would be rather laborious and would make for a very disjointed offering from me.  With regard to vocational teaching, however, I agree whole-heartedly with the suggestions made by Deputies on both sides of the House that the time has come when we shall have to get more and more deeply into the technological field. Having regard to automation, to the improved standards required in industry and agriculture and the new techniques in factories, it behoves us through our system of education to equip, so far as we can, our young people with the knowledge and technique to compete with other countries in the economic sphere.  We can only do that by giving our vocational education a technological slant and our university education a scientific and agricultural slant.  In that way we shall ensure that our people will be in a position to compete successfully with people abroad and will be in a position equally to live in their own country instead of going abroad to try their skills.</P>
    <P>It was Deputy Browne who suggested that certain faculties in our universities seem to be overcrowded, which rather suggests to him it is a waste of our time and money to a large extent to educate doctors and architects, who cannot possibly be absorbed at home, for service abroad.  The benefits of that service will never be got in this country.  It is some satisfaction to us to know that those who are obliged to go abroad, having equipped themselves with medical or architectural training in this country, are able to take their place properly in whatever country they go to.  Having regard to the virtual starvation in regard to technical and scientific knowledge, I think our efforts should, in so far as we can channel them, be directed towards making that knowledge, which we so badly need, available to our factories and farms instead of for the benefit of other countries&mdash;there is plenty of scope for that, particularly in view of the fact that we are criticised in relation to our lack of technical skill in our factories and on our farms by many people who come here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> I was going to correct another Deputy&mdash;Deputy Brennan&mdash;who suggested that we should have marine instruction in our vocational schools, but some other Deputy did it for me by saying that we had that type of marine instruction under some of our western vocational education committees. I can assure the House that it was with the greatest regret and reluctance I had to accept the 6 per cent, reduction imposed on the vocational committees in the current year because I felt that 6 per cent, could be utilised very well by these committees on such extensions of that type of instruction and on certain types of mechanical instruction which in these ever-changing times would be quite suitable, and not only suitable but essential to the people in the rural areas, particularly in the West of Ireland, to help them in their way of life.</P>
    <P>I want to express my appreciation of the action of my predecessor in making a decision such as he did in that respect&mdash;a decision which was by no means a popular one&mdash;within a short time of his leaving office.  It was a decision he might have left to somebody else.  It appeared there was some indication of it in the Book of Estimates, as far as I know.  Nevertheless, it was something for which I, at least, admired him for, that he was able to live up to that unpopular decision when it was necessary.  It was necessary in the light of the financial situation.  I regret he found it necessary, but I regret more so that I found it impossible, in the light of the financial situation, to restore that cut.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the 10 per cent. cut in the capitation grant to secondary schools but, as I said in my opening statement, personally I shall leave no stone unturned, and I hope the opportunity will not be denied me, to ensure that these cuts will be restored and that they will be able to go ahead, particularly the vocational schools, with these very essential schemes they had planned and which, in some cases, they had to abandon in the current year.</P>
    <P>I think it was the ex-Tánaiste who said, in relation to our expenditure of money on education, that we were too <Col N="704" /> poor a country not to expend more on education.  I think it was Lord Hailsham, the new British Minister of Education, who said that they could not afford to expend less on education. That is very true of this country also.</P>
    <P>I want to take advantage of this occasion to mention something that has been suggested to me which ought to form part of our school curricula but, having regard to the facilities available, I find it would be practically impossible for most of our schools to do anything about it.  I think this time of the year particularly opportune to mention the subject of life-saving.  Life-saving cannot, under present circumstances, be taught in our national and secondary schools but it is well to remind teachers that life-saving classes are organised by the Irish Red Cross from mid-June to the end of August. They have instructors whom they send around to different centres and they have, I believe, three sessions daily which will suit practically all types of individuals, young people, adolescents and grown-ups.  There are morning, afternoon and evening sessions.</P>
    <P>I am told that anybody over 14 is eligible to take instruction in these classes.  During the last warm summer we had, in 1955, there were almost 150 people drowned in this country and of these I am told a very high proportion were double drownings.  In other words, the obvious reason is that people went to the assistance of the drowning people not knowing the fundamental technique of life-saving, and they also suffered the same fate. In the same year there were upwards of 70 people saved by more elderly people who had got instruction from the Irish Red Cross.</P>
    <P>In these classes, too, artificial respiration is taught, I am told, and artificial respiration applies not only to people who have been taken from the water in a drowning condition but also to people who have suffered from electric shock.  In these days, when rural electrification has expanded to such an extent, instruction in artificial respiration is most useful and is certainly a very desirable subject to be learned by the average person.  I would commend that not only to the people generally but to the teachers in <Col N="705" /> particular.  I know that their time is well taken up already but since there are alternative methods of acquiring the necessary rudimentary knowledge, I think the teachers ought, in so far as they can, whether it be inland or at seaside areas, impress on their pupils the desirability of learning the fundamentals of life-saving and artificial respiration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Beegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to follow the practice of previous years by taking Votes 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>Vote 8 bears the salaries and expenses of the administrative, executive and technical staffs of the Office of Public Works, which is the office responsible for the administration of Vote 9.</P>
      <P>Vote 9 provides the necessary funds for the purchase of sites and buildings for State purposes; for the erection, maintenance and furnishing of Government offices and other State-owned premises; for the erection and improvement of national schools; for the erection of major military buildings; for arterial drainage and other engineering works; for the maintenance of State-owned parks and State harbours and for a number of other activities.</P>
      <P>There is a decrease of £13,400 in the Estimate for Vote 8 compared with the sum voted for 1956-57.  This is due chiefly to reduction of £11,550 in the provision for salaries, wages and allowances and £2,800 in the provision for travelling expenses.</P>
      <P>As regards sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;it will be observed from the details that there is an increase of £8,450 in the gross provision; this is attributable mainly to normal increments and to improved salary scales for certain grades of professional and technical staff.  Based on past experience of recruitment, however, a credit of £20,000 is taken in respect of probable vacancies during the year and this results in a net reduction of £11,550 on the sub-head. There is a slight reduction in the total personnel provided for in this Vote.</P>
      <P>Sub-heads B&mdash;Travelling Expenses&mdash; and C&mdash;Incidental Expenses&mdash;show decreases of £2,800 and £250 respectively, corresponding with current expenditure trends and the contemplated works programme.  There is an increase of £300 in the provision for sub-head D&mdash;Telegrams and Telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decrease of £900 in the estimated receipts under sub-head E&mdash;Appropriations in Aid&mdash;is the net result of a number of variations in the amounts <Col N="710" /> of the items making up this sub-head. Increase occur under items 2, 4 and 7. They include an increase of £6,000 in the estimated fees payable in 1957-58 under the Local Loans Fund regulations, and estimated increases amounting to £5,700 in expenditure recoverable from Vote 9 and from the Vote for Transport and Marine Services in respect of staff employed on arterial drainage construction and maintenance work and on harbour works respectively. The amount recoverable under item 9 as Expenses of Management of the Local Loans Fund is the amount of the expenses incurred in the preceding financial year, less the fees, etc., received in that year.  An increase of £8,000 in the offsetting receipts from fees on loans made in 1956-57 accounts for the reduction shown in this item. There are also decreases in the estimated recoupments under item 3 in respect of repayments for agency services, chiefly for the telephone capital service and the British Ministry of Health which are reduced by £2,000, and decreases amounting to £2,600 in the amounts expected to be recovered under items 5 and 8 from the Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes and the National Development Fund respectively for services in connection with marine and drainage works.</P>
    <P>With regard to Vote 9, the Estimate of £3,760,200 for Public Works and Buildings shows a net increase of £220,200 on the original Estimate for 1956-57.  The figures for 1956-57 shown in this year's Estimate Volume do not however, take account of the Supplementary Estimate for £25,500 which, as Deputies will be aware, was passed at the close of the financial year and the net increase over last year's total Vote is, therefore, £194,700.  The Supplementary Estimate provided a Grant-in-Aid of £500 for the River Shannon navigation under sub-head H (2) and an additional £25,000 under sub-head J (2)&mdash;Arterial Drainage&mdash;Construction Works.  The voted provision for 1956-57 for these sub-heads as given in the volume should be read as amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>The largest individual sub-head increase in the Estimate is that of £193,200 in the provision under subhead <Col N="711" /> B for New Works, Alterations and Additions; and there are increases amounting to £106,000 in the provisions under sub-heads A, C, E and F for Purchase of Sites and Buildings, Maintenance, Rents and Fuel.  There is a decrease of £41,000 under sub-head J (2)&mdash;Arterial Drainage&mdash;Construction Works, and a decrease of £71,000 under sub-head K for the Purchase and Maintenance of Engineering Plant and Machinery, and Stores.</P>
    <P>In their order of sub-heading, the variations from the sums voted last year are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sub-head A&mdash;Purchase of Sites and Buildings&mdash;is increased by £13,000 to provide for a balance of expenditure on the purchase of a residence at New York for the representative to the United Nations Organisation.</P>
    <P>In sub head B&mdash;New Works, Alterations and Additions&mdash;there is a net increase of £193,200.  As an analysis of the bulk provisions for Departments shown in the printed volume is given in the statement which has been circulated to Deputies it is scarcely necessary for me at this stage to refer to any of the details save perhaps to the provision of £1,550,000 for grants for national school building and improvement schemes, which represents an increase of £200,000 over last year's figure.  I do not suppose that any Deputy will take exception to additional provision for this very desirable service.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C&mdash;Maintenance and Suplies&mdash;shows an increase of £50,000 to meet cost increases and some maintenance arrears.  The provisions under sub-heads D (1) and D (2) for Furniture and Fittings and for the Central Furniture Stores respectively are unchanged.</P>
    <P>The increase of £13,000 under sub-head E&mdash;Rents, Rates, Etc.&mdash;includes provision for renting of office accommodation and temporary residential accommodation for the representative to U.N.O.  Other provisions included in the increase relate to accommodation for the Department of the Gaeltacht, for the petrol rationing section <Col N="712" /> of the Department of Industry and Commerce and for additional accommodation for the central engineering workshop of the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F&mdash;Fuel, Light, Water, Cleaning, Etc.&mdash;shows an increase of £30,000 due to increases in the prices of coal, coke, gas, electricity and oil fuel.</P>
    <P>The requirements under the minor sub-heads G, H (1) and I do not call for any comment.  Under sub-head H (2), provision is made for a grant-in-aid of £4,500 for the Shannon navigation. The expenditure on the operation and maintenance of this extensive undertaking is ordinarily met from a fund which is sustained by rents and the tolls derived from traffic.  Traffic has been falling for a number of years, while costs have risen, and the tolls, which were increased to the maximum rates permissible as from 1st October, 1956, and other revenue were insufficient to meet outgoings last year.  The balance of the investments held on behalf of the fund were sold to assist in keeping the fund in credit, but there was still a deficit for which a grant-in-aid of £500 required to be voted last year by way of Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The provision for sub-head J (1)&mdash; Arterial Drainage Surveys&mdash;shows a decrease of £1,200 because, while the survey programme will be of the same order as last year, a saving is expected in the outlay on attendant labour and materials.</P>
    <P>The provision of £400,000 for sub-head J (2)&mdash;Arterial Drainage&mdash;Construction Works&mdash;when account is taken of the supplementary provision of £25,000 in 1956-57, is £41,000 less than last year's total Vote.  This year's provision is based on the requirements as known when the Estimate was prepared. The following are the main variations shown in the Estimates Volume in the provisions for the individual drainage schemes.  Additional provision amounting to £100,000 is made for the Corrib-Clare drainage scheme, work on which will expand further this year.</P>
    <P>The Nenagh scheme, which is in full <Col N="713" /> swing, requires an increased provision of £6,000 and a sum of £32,000 is included for the Maine catchment drainage scheme in the expectation that it will commence this year.  It will be noted, of course, that the commencement of this scheme is subject to compliance with the requirements of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, as regards exhibition and confirmation. The Feale and the Glyde and Dee drainage schemes are nearing completion and the provisions for these schemes are reduced by £152,000 in all.</P>
    <P>Sub-head J (5)&mdash;Arterial Drainage&mdash; Maintenance&mdash;has been increased by £4,000 to meet expenditure on the Glyde and Dee drainage scheme in respect of which a certificate of completion is expected to be issued in the course of this year.  Expenditure under this sub-head is recoverable from the county councils concerned.</P>
    <P>The decrease of £71,000 under sub-head K&mdash;Purchase and Maintenance of Engineering Plant and Machinery, and Stores&mdash;is for the most part due to a reduction of £61,000 on the item, Purchase of Engineering Plant and Machinery, as it is not necessary this year to purchase any new heavy plant such as excavators, etc., for the arterial drainage schemes in progress or in contemplation.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head L&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;variations in the estimated receipts under the headings listed in the printed volume account for a small net decrease of £750.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Parliamentary Secretary did not follow the example of the Minister who moved this Estimate, the Minister for Education, who, for the convenience of Deputies circulated a copy of his speech as he was rising.  If the Parliamentary Secretary was ever on these benches in the last three years and did not get that courtesy when I was over there, I regret it, but I think it is a courtesy that assists Deputies on all sides of the House and one which we might agree, no matter who is on that side of the House or on this, should be carried out in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very briefly I want to ask a few <Col N="714" /> question in relation to these Votes and in regard to certain aspects of them.  It is welcome that there is a reduction in Vote 8 of £13,400 in administrative expenses and that at the same time we notice also in that Vote a small reduction in personnel. I am unable, however, readily to see the reason for the reduction in Vote 9, in sub-head E of the Appropriations-in-Aid. The explanation of that reduction does not come readily to hand and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary when replying might expand a little bit more on that point.</P>
    <P>I have a little difficulty because I have a cold at the moment in hearing the Parliamentary Secretary clearly. I know he did refer to the matter but I was not quite clear how it dropped to an amount of one-third.</P>
    <P>In Vote 9 it will be noted that the Estimate as a whole shows a big increase. In my view it is desirable that in considering the expenditure that there is over the country as a whole, one should consider the amount that is to be expended under Vote 9 and Vote 10 as a total.  In Vote 9 the expenditure is of a more productive nature than in Vote 10 and although we are not discussing Vote 10 at the moment I think it is relevant on Vote 9 to say, as far as I am concerned, that I believe the increase in expenditure should be on the productive side rather than on the less productive Estimate.</P>
    <P>The increase in this Estimate is to a very large extent due to the provision that has been made for schools.  There is an increase of £179,000 in the amount provided for works for the Department of Education.  That amount, which was determined of course by the previous Government, is the highest sum that has ever been set aside in the history of the State for the provision of schools and it is a very substantial one indeed.  Certainly, the provision made by us when we prepared this Estimate for this year does great justice to that important work and is a real contribution towards working off the backlog, the arrears that have piled up.</P>
    <P>In relation to arterial drainage I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give me a little information.  I <Col N="715" /> should like to know what surveys are actually under survey&mdash;I suppose that is the correct phrase&mdash;at the moment; what surveys have been commenced; how far have they gone; when are they likely to be completed; what new surveys will be started during the current financial year, so far as it is possible to estimate that at this stage.  I am not quite clear as to whether the word &ldquo;survey&rdquo; covers, not merely the work that is done in the field, but also the preparation of plans in the office after the field work has been completed, but, if it does not cover what I may term the plan preparation, I would also like to know what field surveys are now being examined in the Department and when it is hoped that what I may call the drawing-board results of these field surveys in respect of the particular rivers that are under examination will reach the point at which they can be presented.  I presume the first presentation is to the Minister for Finance of the day.</P>
    <P>So far as the actual construction work is concerned, as the Parliamentary Secretary indicated, the Brosna is complete and the Glyde and Dee are expected to come to completion during the current year.  The Feale is also coming to an end and I had arranged that the machinery that was in use on the Feale would be transferred to the Maine as it was winding up on the Feale.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary propose to continue that decision or does he propose to make any change in policy in that respect?</P>
    <P>I should also like the Parliamentary Secretary to give the House the total estimate, both in terms of time and in terms of money, for the Maine.  I assume that he is in a position now to indicate that, even though I appreciate that the exhibition provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act and the periods for objection have not yet been finally exhausted.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned, the House is providing this year an extra £100,000 for the Corrib. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us an indication of how long more it is anticipated the Corrib will take and what is likely to be the <Col N="716" /> trend of expenditure on that river during the years ahead.  Last year, we had considerable difficulty there, due to the extremely wet summer.  The work in Galway City is work that could only be done at low water, and, as a result of that, the whole programme was somewhat thrown out.  Weather permitting and the level of the water, therefore, permitting, will the work that it is necessary to do between the lake and the sea be completed in the immediate future?  If it will not be completed in the immediate future, is there any danger that, before the work from the lake, by the weir in the city and so forth, is completed, the additional outflow that would come from the work being done higher up would make the situation worse at that outflow?</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, whether this is the appropriate Estimate on which to raise arterial drainage work that is being done by the Office of Public Works under National Development Fund allocations or on what Estimate one raises that.  I am in your hands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to ask for some similar information on that.  I know Rossmanagher is one case which is proceeding under National Development Fund allocations.  I think it is almost coming to a conclusion and in that respect there was a question of making a survey of some additional land that might be affected, if a further length of embankment was not repaired. I should like to know whether that survey has yet been made or whether the Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to indicate whether or not it is prudent to continue to do the work on those additional embankments, <Col N="717" /> which, roughly, are on the right bank going downstream of the river from Bunratty Bridge out towards Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, another work that was done under the National Development Fund by the arterial drainage section of the Office of Public Works was, of course, the Rye River between Kildare and Meath.  That is drawing very near to a conclusion, if it has not been concluded already, and I should like to pay a tribute to the manner in which that work was carried out.  It is an excellent job and, indeed, quite apart from the land that was improved, if it had not been done, there would have been very serious trouble this year in both Kilcock and Leixlip, and the buildings in the towns thus protected should be taken into account, in addition to considering the value of the land improved.</P>
      <P>I cannot recollect offhand whether there are any other cases of work being done under the National Development Fund other than the Deale and Swillyburn, to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred in his opening remarks.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask one specific question.  As Deputies are aware, the previous Government, following the floods of Christmas, 1954, requested the American authorities to let us have from America an expert who had experience in relation to flood prevention and the utilisation of flood waters. Colonel Rydell came here and, after a visit, made, first, a preliminary report, and following that preliminary report made a final report last year.  That final report required various further explorations, if I may use the phrase. Further surveys were carried out and I am aware that those surveys and explorations are, or were, in the course of being examined by the Departments and subsidiary State bodies concerned. Does the Parliamentary Secretary propose to publish that report at any stage?  I appreciate that that may not be a question for the Parliamentary Secretary himself and he might not like to answer it without consulting the Government.  Therefore, if he feels that he does not want to answer that question at this stage, I shall quite understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> I take it without question that the work of collating the information, the various statistics and the various hydrometric data and so forth, that Colonel Rydell deemed necessary for the full consideration of the matters to which I referred has been going on and will continue to go on, until the necessary data on which a final decision can be taken are available.  I want to make it quite clear that I am not expecting the Parliamentary Secretary to have come to the House at this stage with a cut-and-dried solution for that problem; I am more reasonable on this side of the House than he was when he was here.  The problem is an intricate and a difficult one and I would not expect him to produce a solution within six weeks, but when we come to a discussion of it at a later stage, then I will feel that I will be more entitled to have his answer to the problem after he has had the opportunity to consider it.  I would ask him, however, specifically to consider at some stage, not necessarily to-day, as to whether or not he is going to publish the report.</P>
    <P>I felt that it was desirable that the collation of the information that Colonel Rydell required should proceed for a while, at any rate, before publication.  I do not know how far that collating of information has progressed. The final report, as far as I remember, was received on 20th August, 1956 and appropriate steps were taken since then.  The nature and extent of the problem is such that it is desirable that as much information as possible should be given to the House, and, through the House, to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand one thing in the Appropriations-in-Aid on Vote 9. As I understand the situation, the Brosna certificate has been signed and I think I heard a moment ago that it was expected that the Glyde and Dee certificate would be signed during the current year.  That was my expectation. If that is so, why is it that there is a decrease in the Appropriations-in-Aid for arterial drainage maintenance?  I would have thought, having regard to the recoupment provisions that exist in the 1945 Acts, that when a second scheme is coming into that stage, we would have had an increase in those <Col N="719" /> appropriations this year.  If the appropriation had been exactly the same, then I would have said that it was the same because it was the same for the Brosna alone, and that the Glyde and Dee were dealt with on the basis of a recoupment in one year for work in the preceding year; but it does not seem to me to be operating on that basis, and perhaps we could have some little assistance and enlightenment on that figure.  The actual number under sub-head L is 7 and the decrease is from £24,500 to £21,000.  I would have thought, with the additional scheme coming in this year, that there would have been an increase rather than a decrease.</P>
    <P>Only for the fact that I want to spare the Parliamentary Secretary's blushes, I might have regarded this Estimate as being one of the Estimates on which we were entitled to think that there would be action now.  I am referring to the bulletin that was published by the Fianna Fáil Party during the course of the election.  It was not to be action this year, next year or sometime.  It was to be action now and this would be one of the Estimates on which we would be entitled to expect action, but perhaps that might be more suitable for a wider sphere.  I did pick up a copy of that bulletin in South Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I am glad to see that there is an extra £100,000 provided for the Corrib this year.  I hope and I am confident that it will be spent in a slightly different manner from the manner in which money has been spent by the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor.  I hope and the people in my constituency where the major portion of the work in the Corrib catchment is in progress, have reason to believe, that people will no longer be getting employment there through political influence.  From now on, they hope and expect that it will be the people who are really deserving of work who will get work there.  I trust that the Parliamentary Secretary will see to it that this will be given effect to immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I want to say that there is an enormous amount of machinery <Col N="720" /> engaged on the Corrib work and an enormous amount of waste.  There are machines working there which cost anything up to £140,000.  On average, they are working from six to seven hours each day.  I could not picture any firm having a contract anything like that for the Corrib scheme, bringing in machinery worth something like £1,000,000 and allowing it to stand idle for two-thirds of the time.  I see no reason why those machines could not be engaged on shift work.  I think it is very foolish to spend so much on machinery which is working for only eight hours a day.  Every machine should be working 24 hours a day.  They are too expensive to have them idle two-thirds of the time.  I hope some effort will be made to get a better output from these machines than we are getting at present.</P>
    <P>I know that work along the Corrib at present has to be done in patches. All the machines cannot be put working together.  However, a number of hardships are inflicted by the fact that the water is relieved in one particular place and taken at a much faster rate to another place where there is no outlet. As a result, there is flooding and undue hardship in the areas to which the water is brought.  I am referring particularly to a place called Clonmore. As a result of the work there, people in that place have had land flooded this year which has never been flooded before. I trust some effort will be made to reduce the flooding caused there.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if there is any hope of having a survey made of the remaining portion of the Corrib.  I am referring to the Black River.  This is where very severe flooding was caused in my constituency a few years ago. People were marooned and very grave hardships were inflicted.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to have the survey carried out so that we can get on with the completion of the Corrib at that end before moving on to some place else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter of drainage schemes, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to expand work on the Corrib scheme towards the west of the area.  Practically all the work done so far has been on the eastern part around North Galway and at the mouth of the river itself.  I would like to know if any survey has been made of the little rivers and streams running into the Corrib from Glann, Cornamona and Maam Valley areas. There have been several complaints by the people of the district about their land being flooded.  They are unable to get potato crops and oats crops on these lands adjoining the Corrib because of the flooding.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to have the matter seen to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other drainage areas besides those in Galway.  There are two in County Wexford, Cahore and Kilmore.  When last in office the Parliamentary Secretary promised that they would be next in order.  I should like him to give attention to those areas.  They will not cost anything like the considerable sums that have been spent on the large rivers in the Midlands.</P>
      <P>Some few years ago, when there was considerable flooding on the Shannon, an American expert was brought over to advise the Government on the problem. We never saw any report published of the advice he gave.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us if that report was ever made and, if so, when its findings will be put into operation to relieve the serious flooding that takes place there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see further provision for schools.  Despite the fact that there has been a vast improvement in the condition of schools over the years and that a number of new schools have been built, a lot of work remains to be done.  We hear of schools up and down the country which it is proposed to replace, despite the fact that they appear to be reasonably good schools. Is it a fact that all the bad schools in the country have now been replaced and we are on to the not-so-bad schools?  In my constituency there is an outstanding example of a place <Col N="722" /> where a new school is needed.  It is the Christian Brothers' school in the town of Gorey.  I do not know whether money has been allocated for it or not this year.  The children have to be accommodated around the town in any building that can be found.  They cannot find sufficient buildings; they are crowded out.  There are 80 to 90 pupils in one class in one small room. There have been numerous complaints from parents.  I would like to know if an effort will be made to have the school built in the present year.  It is one of the most urgent cases I know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's attention has been directed to the West and the South; I should like to direct it to the North.  What can be done in regard to the River Erne?  It is a bone of contention between North and South.  The people in my constituency want to know if the Parliamentary Secretary will provide money to have that work done this year.  Practically no work on the land project and such schemes can be done in this big catchment area because of flooding.  One thousand pounds has been devoted to the Corrib and Deputy Killilea has stated that the area is swamped with machinery. We would not turn down the prospect of having some of that machinery sent northwards to do drainage on the Erne.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman who was the first to speak, I am sure has a very good idea of how a Book of Estimates is made up.  Perhaps there would be something more in the Book of Estimates, if the financial position permitted.  I think the former Minister for Finance vetted that book himself very thoroughly before it was sent to the printers and circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister said at the outset that he thought it would have been better form if the leaders of the Opposition Parties had been given advance copies of the opening statement on the Estimate.  I was in Opposition for a few years and can say it was not customary for the then Government to make copies of the statement available in advance.  I shall keep the observation in mind.  I see <Col N="723" /> nothing wrong with the suggestion and shall ask my Office to have extra copies prepared in future years and circulated to the leader of each of the Opposition Parties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman mentioned the provision for schools and observed that it was the highest ever.  That is so. There has been a gradual increase during the past five or six years in that respect.  Of course, the increase in the present Estimate does not mean there will be a very accelerated school building programme as far as new schools are concerned, because a considerable portion of the money is to meet expenditure on works that were in progress in January, 1957.  The figure is £1,175,000.  Provision for contracts yet to be placed is £300,000 and the balance not yet allocated is £75,000.</P>
    <P>On several occasions, there have been suggestions from Deputies representing rural areas that these areas were not getting fair play in the apportionment of moneys.  There were suggestions that all the money is being spent in the larger areas such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and elsewhere. I have here an analysis of the geographical distribution of the amount spent, which is as follows: country boroughs, £623,000; other urban areas, £246,000; rural areas, £606,000.  I think that is a fair apportionment.</P>
    <P>All Deputies who spoke on the Estimate mentioned arterial drainage.  It is a very important programme, being carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.  I expected that that item would be referred to by nearly all Deputies, particularly Deputies from the rural areas, so I propose to give a full statement on the position as far as drainage is concerned.  In regard to the Brosna catchment which was completed in December, 1955, the total estimated cost of the scheme was £1,180,00.  The total estimated expenditure to 31st March, 1957, was £1,179,000.  For the Corrib-Clare scheme&mdash;the total estimated cost was £2,120,000 and the total estimated expenditure to 31st March, 1957, was £770,000.  The approximate date of <Col N="724" /> completion is 1965&mdash;eight years from now.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Feale, the total estimated cost was £1,200,000 and the total estimated expenditure to 31st March, 1957, £1,160,000.  The approximate date of completion is the summer of 1958.  For the Glyde and Dee, the total estimated expenditure was £1,040,000, of which £1,020,000 was expended up to 31st March, 1957.  The approximate date of completion is the summer of this year.  For the Nenagh minor catchment scheme, the total estimated cost was £271,000, of which £120,000 had been spent up to 31st March, 1957.  The approximate date of completion is the summer of 1960.</P>
    <P>There were other schemes carried out from moneys provided from sources other than the Arterial Drainage Act. Some of these were financed from Land Reclamation Act moneys and from the National Development Fund.  I also propose to give a detailed statement on work being done from such funds. On the Boyle River, the total estimated cost of a drainage scheme was £55,000. The scheme was completed in 1953 and the estimated expenditure up to 31st March of this year was £55,000.  For the Rye River, the estimated cost of the scheme was £55,500, of which £53,000 had been spent up to 31st March, 1957.  That scheme is virtually completed.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Owenogarney embankments, the estimated total cost was £100,000, of which £51,000 had been spent up to 31st March last.  The approximate date of completion is the summer of 1958.  A scheme for the drainage of the Deale and Swillyburn, in Donegal, will be financed from the National Development Fund.  The scheme has been exhibited and is about to be submitted to the Minister for Finance for confirmation.  The estimated cost of the scheme is £190,000.</P>
    <P>A provision of £32,000 is included in the Estimate for expenditure on a scheme on the Maine in Kerry.  It is now doubtful, however, if expenditure of this order will materialise this year as the engineering reports are still under examination.  For the minor catchment of Clareen, in Tipperary, a scheme estimated to cost £35,000 has <Col N="725" /> been prepared and, subject to the necessary authority of the Minister for Finance and compliance with the statutory requirements, could be undertaken before the Nenagh scheme concludes.  A draft scheme for Akeragh Lough-Banna in Kerry is nearing completion by the Engineering Branch.  In regard to the Inny in Counties Cavan, Longford, Meath and Westmeath, the design of a scheme is well advanced, but estimates of cost, the area of land to benefit and the annual improvement value are not yet available.  The design of a scheme for the Moy&mdash;Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo&mdash;is well advanced, but estimates of cost, the area of land to benefit and the annual improvement value are not yet available.  An engineering survey is virtually completed for the Suck, affecting Galway, Mayo and Roscommon; the survey data are being studied with a view to the design of a scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen mentioned minor catchments in Wexford at Ballyteigue.  This area has been surveyed and the design of a scheme is in hands.  In regard to Cahore, County Wexford, a minor catchment, this area has been surveyed and the results are being studied.  In regard to catchments under survey and on which it is proposed to put a survey staff during the current financial year, they are as follows.</P>

      <P>A survey of the Boyne was commenced in 1956.  It will not be completed for a further two to three years.  A survey of the Broadmeadow minor catchment, Counties Dublin and Meath, has just been commenced.  The next scheme for survey is the Killimor River, County Galway, which will be undertaken as soon as the staffing position permits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> That is the position as far as arterial drainage is concerned.  It is a very big question.  Staff is also a problem. When a staff is on the field survey, it takes considerable time and then when the designing and plotting are being taken, some of the staff has to be taken to the office in Dublin.  That covers a considerable period, too.  Then there is all the routine connected with exhibition and, of course, the most difficult of all is to get the confirmation of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked, in regard to the Corrib, whether the work between the lake and the sea would be completed in the near future.  I cannot give him that information.  He asked whether, if not, the release of the water from the upper reaches would aggravate the position.  That is information I cannot give him at present.  I have not made any inquiry as to that because, as he knows and as Deputy Geoghegan should know also, the work is in charge of a resident engineer.  It is being carried out according to plan and design.  I expect that the resident engineer and his assistants are doing their best and doing it in the proper way and with the least possible injury to anybody. I am sure that that is going to continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman also mentioned something about the Rossmanagher embankments.  That work is in progress. I explained the amount of money which had been expended and the amount of money which was estimated towards the carrying out of that work.  I have also given an explanation of the position regarding the Deale and the Swillyburn.  The Rye is also nearly completed.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputies Sweetman and Allen if the report of the American expert would be published.  Deputy Sweetman was quite correct in the date on which the final report was received, the 20th August, 1956.  I have been informed that the Government have decided to publish the report and place some copies of it in the Library, but I do not think it will be distributed here, there and everywhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is expected.  Further than that, I cannot state what the outcome of it will be. That is as much as I can say.  I am thankful to Deputy Sweetman, who did not press me on the matter.  He said he did not believe it was my function, that it had to be decided at a higher level.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned something about Appropriations-in-Aid on Vote 9 and asked why there was a decrease. Last year's figure of £24,500 for 1956-57 and £3,500 balance for the year 1955-56. This year's Estimate contains only £21,000 for 1957-58.  Any expenditure on the Glyde and Dee in 1957-58 will not be recoverable until 1958-59.  I am not in a position to state when the Blace River or the tributaries mentioned by Deputy Killilea will be undertaken, if these have not been included already.  I just have not all the details of the scheme.  I would need to have a map or something like that in front of me in referring to it, to be able to give all the particulars but I am sure it will be taken into account.  The fact that the main scheme, according to the date on which it would be completed, will take until 1965, despite all this massive machinery and this huge fleet we hear is on the Corrib, gives some idea that the Black River and some of the tributaries will have to wait a while.</P>
      <P>Deputy Geoghegan talked about drains.  Again I would need a map to know whether they are included in the design or not.  I think it would be too much to expect the State, after the expenditure of £2,120,000, to do every drain in the country.  I shall not make any promise on that score.  There are other ways and there are grants under the land reclamation scheme and other schemes which I think could be availed of in many instances, perhaps without asking for any State grant.  Some of the drains which some people would expect to have done, in my opinion they should try to do themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly mentioned the Erne. I am sure the Commissioners would be delighted if they could undertake <Col N="728" /> the Erne, but that is a Border river and there is some big difficulty there. I suppose there would be a good deal of negotiation involved.  As far as I know, this Northern Government is not as inclined to spend a big amount of money on drainage as we have been, nor have they done anything like what has been done on this side of the Border so far as drainage is concerned. I do not think there are any other points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, in recent years anyhow, but I think there were some negotiations in respect of other rivers.  How they have worked out I am not at the moment in a position to say.  I am not very long back in 51 Stephen's Green, but I shall make inquiries and shall let the Deputy know.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Allen regarding schools in Wexford, as he is aware, it is the Department of Education which provides the plans and designs of schools to meet local requirements. The Board of Works actually is only the agent to carry out the job. As far as the Christian Brothers' school is concerned, I shall make inquiries and I shall let the Deputy know how the matter stands.</P>

      <P>The Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes makes provision for the annual programme of employment schemes to give work to men in receipt of unemployment assistance in urban and rural areas of the country; and for other services such as bog development schemes, rural improvements schemes, and miscellaneous schemes, for example minor marine works and archaeological excavations. Provision is also made for the salaries, travelling expenses, etc., of the staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office responsible for the administration of the Vote.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this Estimate, it is usual to give a brief résumé of the work done under the Vote in the preceding year; and, although I was responsible neither for the work of last year, nor for the provision in the printed Estimates for 1957/58 at pages 51-53 in the volume in the hands of the Deputies, I shall endeavour to give as accurate a picture as I can of last year's activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vote is for employment and emergency schemes, and the year 1956/57 might, I think, be said to be very much an emergency year in so far as the Special Employment Schemes Office is concerned.  When introducing the Estimate last year on the 3rd May, 1956 (Volume 156, column 1445) my predecessor said that, adding the unexpected balances of National Development Fund grants from previous years of £248,400 to the Vote provision of £731,200 in the Estimates Volume, there was a total sum of £979,600 available for expenditure last year.  He went on to say that decisions had not then been taken regarding the possibility <Col N="730" /> of additional money being made available; and that the Estimate was being submitted for approval on that basis.  Closing the Estimate debate after the Budget statement on the 8th May, 1956, as at column 152, he said that the figure of £979,600 was all the money that he could hope to get in 1956/57.</P>
    <P>A programme to absorb the proposed alternative expenditure of £979,600 was duly prepared in the Special Employment Schemes Office and submitted to the then Minister for Finance for his approval; but, before the Minister approved of this alternative programme, further events intervened; and, as Deputies in the previous Dáil will recall, economy cuts, amounting to approximately £5,000,000 were decided on at the end of July, 1956.  In these economy cuts, the Special Employment Schemes Office was directed to work to a reduced programme, so as to secure that the gross expenditure, including National Development Fund expenditure would not exceed £805,500; a drop of almost £175,000 on the £979,600 figure mentioned by my predecessor in last year's Estimates discussion.  These Deputies will also recall the restoration at the end of November, 1956, of £1,000,000 of the cuts previously decided on, of which the Special Employment Schemes Office received the sum of £150,000, bringing the permitted expenditure in the financial year, including National Development Fund balances, to £955,500.  The function of the Special Employment Schemes Office is to spend any money they get.  The actual expenditure in 1956-57 amounted in round figures to £893,000, so that on behalf of my predecessor, I think I can anticipate him in congratulating the Special Employment Schemes Office on the results produced by them in the emergency year of 1956-57.  They have, however, left me in the position that, instead of a balance of £248,400 available for expenditure from the National Development Fund sources, I have only £45,000 left to spend.</P>
    <P>With the explanation I have just given of the many changes in the provision for the year, there is little purpose in referring to the printed Estimate provision for 1956-57, which <Col N="731" /> Deputies will find side by side with the 1957-58 provision at page 51 of the Estimates Volume.  To give the best comparative picture possible of the operations of the Special Employment Schemes Office last year, I give particulars of the expenditure under the <Col N="732" /> various sub-heads of the Vote in 1954-55, 1955-56 and 1956-57, against the printed provision for 1957-58.  In addition to the provision in the printed Estimates for 1957-58, there is the £45,000 unexpended National Development Fund balance, to which I have already referred.</P>

    <P>At the peak period of employment last year, in December, 1956, employment was given to a total of 4,348 men, of whom 979 were employed on urban schemes and 3,369 on rural schemes.</P>
    <P>The amounts of the grants for urban employment schemes, rural employment schemes and minor employment schemes are related to the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each area; and a census is taken annually on the third week of January by the Special Employment Schemes Office of the number of such men in each urban area, non-urbanised town and rural electoral division in the country.  The census includes, in addition to the men drawing unemployment assistance, persons who were formerly in receipt of unemployment assistance and were actually working on Special Employment Schemes Office schemes during that week.  The date of the census in January was decided on, to correspond as nearly as possible with the peak period of unemployment. Last year&mdash;columns 1339 to 1341, Volume 156 of the 3rd May&mdash;my predecessor was fortunate enough in dealing with the Estimate to be able to refer to an over-all drop of 11 per cent. in the unemployment assistance figures for January, 1956, compared with January, 1955, following a reduction of 16 per cent. in 1955 compared with 1954.  The reduction in the urban areas was 17 per cent. following a drop of 22 per cent.  For the rural areas the drop was 8½ per cent. following a reduction of 13½ per cent. in 1955 compared with 1954.  I do not find myself to-day in that fortunate position.  On the contrary, I find that the unemployment assistance figures for the four county borough areas, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, <Col N="733" /> and Waterford, increased from 5,693 in January, 1956, to 8,148 in January, 1957, an increase of 43 per cent.  Including all urban areas, the figures are 7,698 in January, 1956, compared with 10,819 in January, 1957, an increase of 40 per cent.  In rural areas the figures increased from 22,255 in January, 1956, to 24,334 in January, 1957, an increase of just over 9 per cent.  Taking the country as a whole, the figures were 29,953 in January, 1956, compared with 35,153 in January, 1957, an increase of 5,200 or 17.4 per cent.  These figures relate to men in receipt of unemployment assistance only, and do not include persons in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit for whom employment schemes are not intended to cater.  I might mention here that the unemployment insurance benefit figure for the whole country increased from 35,982 in January, 1956, to 49,141 in January, 1957, an increase of 13,159 or almost 37 per cent.  Taking unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance benefit together, the figures were 65,935 in January, 1956, and 84,294 in January, 1957, an increase of 18,359 or almost 28 per cent.</P>
    <P>With this comment, I propose to deal with the various sub-heads of the Vote and to explain in some detail for the benefit of the new Deputies in the House the services available under the various sub-heads.  Sub-heads A to E provide for administrative expenses such as salaries and travelling expenses of staff and office expenses.  The figures are the same as in 1956-57, except for a small increase of £50 in sub-head D, which is due to increased charges for the telephone service which came into operation in July, 1956.  The details at Part III of the printed Estimate for salaries, wages and allowances show an increase of £1,530, but this increase is offset by a deduction in respect of posts likely to be vacant for part of the financial year, and the provision for sub-head A in the printed Estimate is identical with that for the preceding year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F&mdash;Urban Employment Schemes&mdash;is intended to finance employment schemes in the four county borough areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the borough <Col N="734" /> of Dún Laoghaire and such of the 55 other urban districts in which there are sufficient numbers of unemployment assistance recipients to form gangs of economic size.  The schemes are administered by the local urban councils concerned, through the Department of Local Government; and grants are conditional on the local authorities submitting suitable work schemes for approval by the Special Employment Schemes Office, and making a contribution towards their cost.  In recent years the contribution in the Dublin County Borough area is 20 per cent.  In Cork and Limerick it is 17 per cent., in Waterford 14 per cent. and varies between 5 per cent. and 17 per cent. in the other urban areas, the average last year for other urban areas being about 13 per cent.  With the exception of the county borough areas, these works are carried out only in the winter period, from October to March. In Dublin, works are proceeding the whole year round.  At the start of the financial year, there is, therefore, a certain volume of work necessarily already authorised for execution, and the commitments for works not yet carried out in urban areas as on the 1st April, 1957, amount to approximately £185,000, compared with a carry-forward of approximately £270,000 last year.</P>
    <P>The position of Dublin dominates the whole unemployment problem, in so far as urban areas are concerned.  As I said earlier, the January, 1957, census showed that there were 10,819 unemployment assistance men in the 56 urban areas and four county boroughs; and of these 5,889 were in the Dublin County Borough area.  The corresponding figures for January, 1956, were 7,698 in all urban areas, of whom 3,937 were in the Dublin County Borough area.  There is, therefore, an increase of almost 50 per cent. on the unemployment assistance figure for Dublin in the 12 months under review.  The average number of men employed in Dublin on the Special Employment Schemes Office works during the financial year ended the 31st March, 1956, was 237, of whom 173 were unemployment assistance recipients.  Each man gets 12 weeks' employment and as the gangs are rotated every three months, <Col N="735" /> approximately 700 unemployment assistance recipients got a spell of employment in the financial year 1955-56. The comparable figures in the year 1956-57 were an average of 220, of whom 146 were unemployment assistance recipients, so that approximately 600 unemployment assistance recipients each got a spell of three months' employment in the financial year 1956-57. On the 1st April, 1956, there was a balance of uncompleted schemes in the Dublin County Borough area representing approximately £206,000 State grants.  To this should be added the Dublin Corporation contribution of 20 per cent., or almost £250,000 worth of work.  New schemes costing £127,360, of which the State grant proportion was £101,888, were authorised during the year, and the State expenditure on works in the borough area in 1956-57 amounted to £164,000.  The new schemes included the concreting and breezing of lanes, the resurfacing of footpaths and various roads, as well as the completion of some new works, such as the Memorial Park road at Island Bridge and the improvement of the harbour road in Howth, between the east and west piers&mdash;the total cost of the road works being approximately £117,000.  Amenity schemes on parks, etc., costing £10,000, were also included. The figures mentioned represent the gross cost of the schemes and include the contribution from the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The normal provision which the State makes for the unemployed takes the form, of course, of either unemployment insurance benefit payments in the case of temporary unemployment, or unemployment assistance payments where unemployment is prolonged, and where the stamp benefit of the individual has been exhausted. At best, only a fraction of the unemployed can be dealt with on the basis of employment schemes.  Firstly, there are not sufficient work schemes available in the City of Dublin to absorb almost 6,000 men; and, secondly, there is the question of cost.  It may come as a shock to the members of this House when I say that to give a male unemployment assistance recipient employment <Col N="736" /> in Dublin City, taking into account the wages of skilled, semiskilled and other persons necessarily engaged on the work and the cost of plant and materials, costs the incredible sum of £25 per week, of which one-fifth is paid by the Dublin Corporation and the other four-fifths by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  In round figures, therefore, it can be taken that it would require £1,000 to give an unemployment assistance recipient a year's employment in Dublin City at his weekly wage of £7 7s. 2d.  As the individual men are rotated in employment at the end of every three months, it can be said that four Dublin unemployment assistance men each get a spell of three months' employment per £1,000 of the Special Employment Schemes Office money spent in the Dublin borough area.  The cost is so very high because of the fact that modern equipment and plant have reduced the unskilled labour content of the types of works that are available; and in the result, there is only a small percentage of the total cost which relates to the actual wages of the unskilled unemployment assistance men employed on these schemes.</P>
    <P>The other side of the picture is that the unemployment assistance recipients in Dublin may be regarded as the casualties of our whole social system. As unemployment insurance stamps are payable in respect of most employment in the city, these unemployment assistance men are persons who have exhausted the benefit which they would get as unemployment insurance benefit claimants, and who have reverted to the unemployment assistance rates which are payable in the county borough areas.  Excluding children's allowances, a married man with a wife and two or more children on unemployment assistance in the City of Dublin would draw £22 16s., over the 12 week period.  Apart from the physical and mental improvement in his outlook following the 12 weeks' spell of employment which he receives under these urban schemes, he will have received for his family, at a weekly wage rate of £7 7s. 2d., the sum of £88 6s., instead of £22 16s. had he remained on unemployment assistance payments.  The 12 weeks' employment <Col N="737" /> will put him in the position that he is physically and mentally able for any alternative work that is available in the city.  It is this social aspect of the unemployment problem that must be set against the incredible cost of £1,000 to rehabilitate four fathers of families who have been on unemployment assistance in the Dublin area.  I refer specifically to the fathers of families, as the sums that can be made available for schemes in the Dublin County Borough area by any administration can, at best, provide for those unemployment assistance recipients who have those responsibilities, and who are physically capable of doing the pick and shovel type of work that is available on employment schemes.</P>
    <P>In the foregoing review, the actual value of the work done has not been taken into account.  Looking around the city, there is abundant evidence of the value of work done under these schemes over the years, e.g. the new road on the south side of the Grand Canal linking Inchicore with Leeson Street, the long mile road in Drimnagh area, the Blackbanks coast road to Howth, the development of Howth at the harbour and amenities on the Head, the concreted lanes throughout the whole city, the improvement of the Dodder banks, the improvement of city parks, e.g. Ballyfermot, Sundrive, Blackquiere Villas, Bangor Circle, Tolka Park, Blind Lane Park, Ventry Park in Cabra, etc.</P>
    <P>The problem of finding suitable works with a high unskilled labour content to absorb the unemployment assistance recipients is not, of course, confined to Dublin.  It applies also to the other borough areas; and, in fact, although to a much lesser degree, to most of the larger urban areas.</P>
    <P>The £45,000 unexpended National Development Fund balance is available to meet part of the expenditure on the commitments of £185,000 which are carried forward in respect of uncompleted works in urban areas as on 1st April, 1957, so that the whole of the Vote provision of £140,000 would almost be required to meet the balance of the commitments. Even allowing for a substantial carry-forward at 1st April, 1958, the provision in the printed Estimate <Col N="738" /> will obviously provide for only a very small programme of new works for the unemployed in urban areas in 1957-58.</P>
    <P>Employment schemes in rural areas under sub-heads G and H form a joint programme of works.  Sub-head G grants are for works on county roads towards which the county councils concerned contribute one-quarter of the cost; and they were formerly authorised in (a) non-urbanised towns in which there were sufficient unemployment recipients to form gangs of economic size and (b) in rural electoral divisions in which the numbers of unemployment assistance recipients were so high, that unless works on county roads were undertaken there was a risk of exhausting all available suitable works on accommodation roads. Minor employment schemes, sub-head H, are for works on accommodation and bog roads in rural electoral divisions with sufficient unemployment assistance recipients to form economic groups. Both schemes are carried out only in the winter period&mdash;November to March.</P>
    <P>The provision in the printed Estimate for sub-head C shows a reduction from £60,000 to £35,000, but only £28,000 was in fact, spent last year.  Sub-head G schemes were confined last year to non-urbanised towns with a population of 200 and over, such as Cootehill in County Cavan; Kilkee and Milltown Malbay in County Clare; Bantry, Passage West, etc. in County Cork; Ballyshannon, Carndonagh, Killybegs, etc., in County Donegal; Balbriggan, Lucan, Skerries, Ballinteer, and other suburbs in County Dublin; Kilronan and Tuam in County Galway; and Ballyheige, Dingle and Fenit in County Kerry.  I mention these towns as examples and Deputies in other counties will appreciate the areas that are in question.  A sum of £20,000 was divided last December in these areas.</P>
    <P>There are some 357 non-urbanised towns, and the numbers of unemployment assistance recipients and unemployment insurance beneficiaries in these areas from 1954 to-date were as follows, according to the census taken in January of each year: unemployment assistance, 1,253 in January, 1954, 1,041 in January, 1955, 906 in January, 1956, <Col N="739" /> and 1,204 in January, 1957; unemployment insurance beneficiaries, 2,739 in January, 1954, 3,014 in January, 1955, 2,920 in January, 1956, and 4,388 in January, 1957.  Totals 3,992 in January, 1954, 4,055 in January, 1955, 3,826 in January, 1956, and 5,592 in January, 1957.</P>
    <P>There is an increase, as will be seen, of almost 33 per cent. in the unemployment assistance figures in 1957 compared with 1956; an increase of 50 per cent. in the unemployment insurance benefit figures, and an overall increase of 46 per cent.  The impact of unemployment in the economy of these small towns is very much greater, concentrated in these small areas, than the effect similar numbers would have spread over a wide area of rural Ireland.  Moreover, unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance benefit payments are the same for the individual man in both instances.  The man with a wife and one child getting £2 13s. weekly, or £3 1s. for two or more children, in the rural parts of the country, having, as he has in almost every case, in addition at least a quarter acre of land, poultry, vegetables and milk available to him either free or for a nominal sum, is much better off than his comrade in the small town with the same weekly income as an unemployment insurance beneficiary.  It is these two considerations which justify making some special provision for these non-urbanised towns, while it is not possible to make similar provision for rural areas.  I propose, therefore, to utilise the sum of £35,000 under sub-head G to make provision for the unemployed on county council road works in these town areas, provided the county councils submit suitable works schemes and are prepared to contribute one-quarter of the cost.  I do not propose to extend this provision for county council works to any other parts of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H provides for grants for works on accommodation roads to farmers' houses, lands and bogs, for which a sum of £130,000 is provided in the printed Estimate.  The unit of distribution of these funds is the rural <Col N="740" /> electoral division, of which there are some 2,875.  This unit was selected, the boundaries of which are geographically well known in the local areas; and representing from about eight to 12 square miles, it has the advantage that works situated therein are within walknig distances by the persons for whom the work is provided.  The expenditure on these schemes in 1954-55 amounted to £159,000 and in 1955-56 almost to £152,000.  Last year, the figure was £133,000 and a provision of £130,000, as already stated, is available for 1957-58.  These works are carried out only in the winter period, and they are confined mainly to areas formerly known as the congested districts.  They are available only in 12 of the counties; and, in fact, only in parts of these 12 counties, representing only about one-sixth of the 2,875 electoral divisions already referred to.  I am giving particulars of these in some detail, so that there will be in the records of the House, available to all Deputies, a general outline of the areas in which these grants are available.  It is wasting Deputies' time and the time of the Special Employment Schemes Office to ask for full cost grants for accommodation roads in any areas other than those which are now going to be enumerated by me.</P>
    <P>I do not propose, of course, to list the individual electoral divisions, but I will give a brief outline of each of the 12 counties in which these full-cost grants are available:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The number of unemployment assistance recipients in these rural areas has not varied very much in recent years. The figure was 26,800 in January, 1954; 23,219 in January, 1955; 21,349 in January, 1956; and 23,130 in January, 1957, an increase of 8 per cent. on the 1956 figure.  The unemployment assistance recipients in these areas are entirely a different social problem from the unemployed in town and urban areas.  They are mostly under-employed rather than unemployed, and consist in the main of cottiers or farmers with very small, uneconomic holdings. Employment is limited to the individual to a maximum of six weeks on any of these schemes; but it is rarely that it is possible to give a spell of six weeks' employment out of the sums available for distribution.  The farmers concerned who will benefit by the work by having a good road to their houses, lands and bogs, are required to give materials free, if they are available on their lands, for these schemes.  I regret to find that in last <Col N="742" /> winter's programme of works, a number of instances arose in various parts of the country where ill-advised farmers refused to give their consent to these works being proceeded with, unless they themselves or their sons were guaranteed employment on the works. I want to emphasise again that these are full-cost grants, and the purpose of making the money available is to provide employment for persons in receipt of unemployment assistance. Unless the farmer whose lands are benefited by the work is so poor that he is in receipt of unemployment assistance and his unemployment assistance weekly payments are on the highest scales in the locality, he cannot get work on these schemes.  The lists of workers are submitted by the local office of the Department of Social Welfare; and the practice in recruiting unskilled labour for these works is to take the names of the men on the top of the list who have the highest weekly payments and, accordingly, are the persons with the greatest responsibilities in the area.  Unless, therefore, the farmer is on this list from the local employment office of the Department of Social Welfare, he cannot be employed on the work.  The withholding of his consent to the work being proceeded with unless he or some member of his family is employed on the scheme will, therefore, simply have the effect of stopping the work, and giving no benefit to him.  These minor employment schemes grants are, as rural Deputies are aware, very popular in the localities which secure them; and from the point of view of increased agricultural production in these areas, it could perhaps be said that it is to an extent an advantage that non-directly productive employment on these roads should be distributed during the winter period among the producing agricultural members of the community in these districts, rather than that a limited number of men would be employed the whole year round doing the same work.  I should perhaps add that the areas concerned include practically all the electoral divisions in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas enumerated in the Gaeltacht Area Order, 1956.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head I&mdash;<Col N="743" /> Bog Development Schemes&mdash;is for the repair and reconstruction of roads and drains to facilitate the production of hand-won turf by landholders and other persons for their domestic needs, and for sale in neighbouring towns. These are full cost grants; but, in a few instances, contributions are required in the case of privately-owned bogs which are let annually to a substantial number of tenants, and where the owner's income from such lettings is so high that it is only reasonable to expect him to give some help towards providing reasonable facilities&mdash;road and drainage&mdash;for his tenants.  The expenditure last year on this service was £101,000 which is considerably less than the figure of £169,600 in 1955-56, £150,700 in 1954-55, and £132,000 in 1953-54.  Some 745 new works were sanctioned in the year, 394 of which were drainage works, representing an expenditure of approximately £40,000, the other 351 being road works at a cost of £52,000.</P>
    <P>A provision of £115,000, as Deputies are aware, is made in the current year's Estimates.  These schemes are not employment schemes; and the limited money available in the Special Employment Schemes Office is divided so as to secure that the greatest benefit to turf production can be secured at the least cost possible.  I regard them as some of the most productive schemes administered by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  The drainage works are essential to get down to the good, black turf.  Road works are equally essential to secure that the turf can be drawn away from the cutting face on to good, hard roads, so that a farmer can draw the turf home at his convenience during the year instead of risking his whole harvest in trying to get his turf home in the dry period of the year, which constitutes the busiest weeks in a farmer's life.  There is not anything further that I need add in respect of these schemes; and the only regret I have is that in present circumstances sufficient funds are not available to do very much more work on these essential schemes than the amounts available will permit.</P>
    <P>The Rural Improvements Scheme <Col N="744" /> (sub-head J) makes provision for grants towards the cost of carrying out works to benefit the lands of two or more farmers&mdash;such as small drainage schemes, bridges and the construction or repair of accommodation roads to farmhouses, lands or bogs.  It is, as Deputies are aware, a contributory scheme, and applies to all parts of the country, irrespective of the unemployment position.  State grants varying from 75 per cent. of the cost in the case of farmers with an average land valuation of £18 or over, to 95 per cent. of the cost in the case of the smaller farmers with an average land valuation of below £6, are available, subject to the balance of the cost being met by the benefiting landholders.  Dealing with this scheme last year, which provides the only funds available for the improvement of these accommodation roads, affecting as they do the daily lives of five-sixths of the population of rural Ireland, my predecessor referred to the considerable increase in expenditure on this very necessary service in recent years.  The expenditure on this service, including farmers' contributions, was £173,210 in 1951-52, £218,278 in 1952-53, £233,660 in 1953-54, £222,600 in 1954-55, £286,000 in 1955-56 and it was down to £242,500 in 1956-57. The printed Estimates provision for this very necessary service in 1957-58 is £150,000.  I must say that I find great difficulty in understanding how this figure is put forward as a suitable provision for this scheme in the printed Estimates.</P>
    <P>When introducing the estimate in respect of this scheme last year, my predecessor explained that on the 1st April, 1956, he was starting that financial year with a commitment of £134,400 in respect of that scheme.  I find that the issue of offers in respect of the scheme was stopped in August, 1956, and that from September on no new applications under the scheme were accepted.  It was only on this basis that the expenditure was kept within the figure of £242,500 referred to earlier in this statement.  A number of offers had accumulated in the period August, 1956, to February, 1957; and about 450 offers representing an expenditure of £158,000 were issued in <Col N="745" /> February.  During the year, the arrears of inspections of schemes have almost been overtaken, and there were, in fact, schemes at head office which, on completion of the necessary inquiries before a formal offer can be made to the beneficiaries, were sufficient to absorb the printed Estimate provision of £150,000 twice over.</P>
    <P>The rural improvements scheme is the most productive scheme operated by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  It has the added advantage that the beneficiaries under the scheme must pay towards the cost of what they get.  The necessity for increased agricultural production is preached from day to day and rightly so.  What better scheme can be suggested than a scheme to enable narrow boreens to be widened and strengthened to enable agricultural machinery to reach the farmers' fields and haggards.  These boreens are not for one farmer only. The scheme deals with groups of two or more farmers and more often than not the number of beneficiaries runs into double figures.  When a boreen is put into repair under the rural improvements scheme, the farmers served are expected thereafter to keep it in repair, which should be well within their competence.  The scheme also provides an essential amenity in rural Ireland whereby the farming community can reach the county public roads without wearing knee-boots.</P>
    <P>The provision for miscellaneous schemes, sub-head K, is £15,000, a reduction of £5,800 on last year's provision. The expenditure last year was £15,000.  This sub-head is required to meet expenditure on minor marine works, such as the extension and reconstruction of small piers and slips to facilitate the landing of seaweed and sand in the interests of local farmers, and the fishing industry.  The county councils concerned are required to contribute one-quarter of the cost of these marine works and to maintain them on completion.  The sub-head also finances archæological excavations at Tara, Lough Gur, Lough Gara and other centres.  Apart from these schemes, the sub-head in other years made provision for sportsfields in rural areas, <Col N="746" /> but in present financial circumstances, however desirable these amenities may be, it will not be possible to make additional funds available in the current year.</P>
    <P>The Appropriations-in-Aid sub-head L. realised approximately £30,000 last year.  This sub-head is made up almost entirely of the contributions in respect of rural improvement schemes which amounted to £25,000.  It also includes receipts in respect of works on privately owned bogs (sub-head I), county councils' contributions towards the cost of minor marine works (sub-head K), and receipts from the sale of surplus stores.</P>
    <P>The gross provision in the printed Estimate at page 51 for the current year is £678,450.  To this should be added the sum of £45,000, the unexpended balance from previous years' National Development Fund grants, bringing the total to £723,450.  I have referred in this statement to the obvious inadequacy of some of the sums provided in the Estimate for the services in this Vote.  The Minister has authorised me to say that, in view of the degree of unemployment which still persists, and so as to allow the Special Employment Schemes Office greater flexibility in arranging for the short-term relief of unemployment in particular areas, he has, with the agreement of the Government, decided to make an additional £250,000 available to be expended in 1957-58 on the services provided in this Vote.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to give any indication of the nature of the additional allocations to be made for the different sub-heads.  This will receive consideration in due course and a Supplementary Estimate will be introduced at a later stage indicating what it is proposed to do.  Meanwhile, any observations or suggestions which Deputies on either side of the House may wish to put forward in this debate shall have my most careful consideration before submitting for the Minister's approval how it is proposed that the additional sum of £250,000 should be divided among the various schemes, and on this note, I conclude the opening statement on this Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for being so very prompt in paying heed to the request I made to him on Votes 8 and 9, and for so promptly providing a copy of his speech for me on this Vote.  I am particularly grateful in view of the fact that it might more accurately be described as a voluminous book rather than a note.  It is a tome of such magnitude that I had very considerable sympathy for the Parliamentary Secretary when he was wading through it.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to say very much on this Estimate, but it is perfectly clear that the tradition of the Special Employment Schemes Office has been, with one trifling exception, that of considering the problem they had to face as one of unemployment assistance alone.  I entirely agree with one phrase used by the Parliamentary Secretary when he was speaking, when he said it was the purpose of this office to spend whatever moneys they get. That is, of course, their duty, but I have no doubt whatever that the figure, of which I must confess I was aware of for a short time before I left office, of £25 a week for putting one man drawing unemployment assistance into work, will come as a severe shock to those who are not aware of those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is proof of the fact that to deal with any question of unemployment or to attempt to deal with it at the unemployment assistance end is the wrong method.  If the question of unemployment&mdash;I do not want to go into the wider aspects of it now because this is not the time to do so&mdash;is dealt with by concentration on the unemployment assistance end rather than on the inception and stimulation of productive work, then the problem will never be solved and no real progress will be made towards a solution at all. The question of large-scale unemployment is obviously one that must be considered by any Government at the moment when it arises or when it can be foreseen.  That was done, not merely by the last Government but by the previous Government, as the Parliamentary Secretary himself is aware, inasmuch as the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, made an announcement <Col N="748" /> in reference to it at a meeting at which Deputy Beegan was speaking in Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P>The last Government dealt with the matter in another way, by the stimulation of productive work, and that stimulation of productive work will bring in its train very much greater benefit to those who are unemployed than endeavouring to prime the pump at the wrong end, as the Parliamentary Secretary has suggested in this respect. It should be noted, for example, that at the present time the number drawing unemployment benefit is more than one-half the number drawing unemployment assistance and, as I say, the Special Employment Schemes Office confines itself to the consideration of providing schemes for those drawing unemployment assistance, and it is only with the greatest reluctance that they are drawn into the relief of those who are drawing unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>As I say, this is not the time to enter into a widespread discussion on the best method of dealing with unemployment as a whole, but I want to make it perfectly clear that we consider that the permanent way of dealing with that problem is by schemes of productive work rather than by unproductive schemes.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will forgive me also if I say that it is very much easier for the Government now to produce additional funds after the success, for example, of the Prize Bonds issue, than it was for us to produce four times the amount in question in the period preceding Christmas when the balance of payments, for one thing, had not been brought into correction, when, for another thing, the position in regard to deposits and savings had not been brought back into the corrective that was a fact by 31st March last.  However, that is not a matter for discussion on this Vote. That is a pleasure we will all have on some other occasion.</P>
    <P>The operations of the Special Employment Schemes Office have been dealt with in the past partly directly from that office and partly by making the various county engineers agents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> Does the Parliamentary Secretary propose to make any change this year in the existing arrangements as he found them on 20th March in that respect? It is a question that comes up every year and I am sure it is one to which the Parliamentary Secretary has already given his attention and I should like to know as a matter of policy whether he proposes any change this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters with which I should like to deal on this Estimate.  The first is in connection with rural employment schemes.  Under these schemes, where there are two or three farmers living on a boreen, they are entitled to get a 75 per cent. grant towards the repair and reconstruction of that boreen.  The scheme has worked fairly successfully for a considerable period.  There is one matter in connection with which Cork County Council have been endeavouring to get co-operation between the Department of Local Government and the Office of Public Works for a number of years.  If three farmers get the grant, the county council are not empowered to expend any money in contributing to the balance of the cost; that must be paid by the farmers themselves.  We have taken the matter up with the Office of Public Works and the Department of Local Government over a number of years, but we have got nowhere.  It seems that there is some regulation in the Department of Local Government which prevents the county council from contributing.  We thought that if we could succeed in getting co-operation between the two Departments, it would help immensely in getting such work done.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is entitled to give this grant.  If there were co-operation between the two Departments, as undoubtedly there should be, there would be no difficulty in getting the authority for the county council to give a portion of the money.  That cannot be done at present.  It holds up work, particularly at present, when practically every farmer has to make use of modern machinery, if that machinery cannot travel the roads on which the farmers live.  We have gone so far as to appoint a deputation to meet both the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Local Government in this matter.  That is why I am anxious about it.</P>
      <P>I was rather amused to hear Deputy Sweetman talk of productive works in this respect, considering the attempt that was made in this House recently on the Coast Erosion Bill, and I am wondering whether a portion of the extra money that has been allowed&mdash; £250,000&mdash;for development work could not be applied where coast erosion is doing very great damage, particularly in portions of my constituency where some hundreds of acres of land bearing a poor law valuation of some 35/&ndash; an acre are now being rendered derelict, due to the inroads of the sea.  The particular scheme I am speaking of, for the area stretching from Ballycotton to Ballymacoda, has been, I think, lying in the Office of Public Works for some time and has not been sanctioned, probably due to the common disease that seems to prevail throughout all Departments at the present day, namely, the want of money.  If there is £250,000 in the offing now, first come, first served, and I would make a plea for the first £25,000 or £26,000 of it, anyway.</P>

I suggest, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that it comes under &ldquo;Rural Improvement Schemes&mdash;scheme of grants towards the cost of constructing or improving accommodation roads, drains, etc., for the joint benefit of groups of farmers.&rdquo; Our position is that some £2,000 was spent before under the Local Authorities Act and now unfortunately that work has been rendered useless by the inroads of time. I suggest that in that case it comes under the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Secretary.  That is why I am urging it should be done in this case under rural improvements.  As a matter of fact there is nothing that cannot be done under this heading.  That is what I have found anyway.  I will not hold up the House but I would ask the Minister, since he has got a communication from the county council, to facilitate them by meeting the deputation.</P>

That was done on purpose in order to explain to the members of this House and the country in general the purposes and function of the Special Employment Schemes Office.  There is only a small amount of money available for distribution and it is principally for the relief of periodic spasms of unemployment.  I <Col N="752" /> quite agree with Deputy Sweetman that it would be better if we could give employment on productive work but I would like to know what type of productive work we could find in the City of Dublin.

      <P>There are other schemes which are very important, particularly rural improvement schemes and bog development schemes.  They undoubtedly help production and a production that is very essential and very, very necessary is agricultural production. While we do the best we can, as far as the urban areas and cities are concerned, I would like very much that we should be able to give some slice of this money to the rural improvement scheme, but that is only my opinion.  It has to be gone into.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman asked what we proposed to do regarding the taking over of counties.  One county has been taken over in recent weeks and we are going to seek permission to take over one or two others during the current financial year.  It may be argued that the work can be done more cheaply by having the supervision done by county council engineers.  I have nothing to say about these gentlemen but they were not recruited for that particular work and consequently their first obedience is to the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This work is work of a special nature and while it is possible that the best gangers would be allocated to the type of work that the Special Employment Office is carrying out, it is almost contrary to human nature that the best gangers would be handed over and put in charge of the work.  In fact in my county, Galway, the first person to object to the supervision of the work <Col N="753" /> by the county engineer was the county manager.  I think he was the man who first suggested to the Special Employment Office that they should supervise the work themselves and make provision for doing so and Galway was one of the first counties taken over.  I wish to inform Deputy Sweetman and others concerned that in the counties where we are carrying out special employment schemes in a big way we would very much like if we could take them all over.</P>
    <P>The only other matter was one raised by Deputy Corry.  He mentioned about the rural improvement scheme and the desire of the Cork County Council and of the Cork people to be in a position to give the required contribution instead of the local farmers.  As the Cork County Council has requested the Minister for Local Government and myself to receive the deputation I am not going to say anything on that point.  I expect that the deputation will be received and the whole business discussed. However, I want to point out to Deputy Corry that this office has no responsibility for the provision of roads to county council standards.  Unless the Department of Local Government change the statute or the regulation, whichever applies, we do not come into this at all.  Certainly, we do not come into it directly.</P>
    <P>As far as coast erosion is concerned, that is not a matter for the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Perhaps it is a matter for the Board of Works. I doubt very much if it is, considering they can expend only a certain amount even if they are responsible.  It certainly is not a matter for the Special Employment Schemes Office.  The Board of Works may be able to deal with it but it is not in the Estimates this year.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies are anxious to get copies of the sanctioned schemes.  They will get copies on application and on application only.  If they wish to get information about any particular scheme in their area they should give the necessary particulars.  These particulars are: the rural district, electoral division, townland, nature of the work, and name of the correspondent.  These are very simple particulars.  The <Col N="754" /> Special Employment Schemes Office will then be only too delighted to give them the information.</P>
    <P>I have no more to say except to thank the House for letting me off so easily.</P>

      <P>In view of the short time since I assumed office, Deputies will, I am sure, not expect me to be fully informed of the activities of the Department or to have examined its policies in any great detail.  In presenting this Estimate, therefore, all I propose to do is to indicate how it compares with last year's Estimate, to give briefly some explanation of the more substantial variations in the amounts provided under certain sub-heads and then to give some account of the working of the various services during the past year and of the Department's proposed activities during the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net Estimate for 1957-58 amounts to £8,663,500, being a gross total of £9,209,108 less Appropriations-in-Aid of £545,608.  The net provision represents an increase of £65,500 on that for 1956-57. As indicated on page 284 of the Volume of Estimates that figure takes into account the additional provision of £12,000 for 1956-57, the Department's share of the Vote for Increases in Pensions approved by the Dáil on the 21st November, 1956.  In making comparisons between sub-heads of the Estimate this additional provision for <Col N="755" /> 1956-57 has been taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The more substantial variations&mdash; those of £10,000 or more&mdash;occur on the following sub-heads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sub-head A (1)&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances (Headquarters): The increase of £15,000 is mainly due to normal incremental increases and revised scales of pay.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A (2)&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances (Metropolitan): The decrease of £23,000 arises from savings on staff secured by revised delivery services and reorganisation of the Telegraph Service.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D&mdash;Purchase of sites, etc: Decrease £22,000.  The sites to be acquired this year are less costly than those purchased last year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (1)&mdash;Conveyance of Mails by rail: The increase of £34,800 is due to higher payments to the Railway Companies in respect of parcel traffic which is offset by increased revenue from the traffic.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (1)&mdash;Stores (other than Engineering): The increase of £23,500 is mainly due to the higher cost of petrol and the import levies on new departmental transport.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (2)&mdash;Stores (other than Engineering): The decrease, £12,000, is due to the use of emergency reserve stocks for normal needs.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K-Engineering Materials: In the case of this sub-head also, the decrease, £29,500, is due to the use of emergency reserve stocks for normal needs.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L (2)&mdash;Contract Work: The decrease of £59,000 is due to reduced provision for the renewal of equipment at Malin Head and Valentia wireless stations and for lighting, heating and lifts.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M-Telephone Capital Repayments: Increase, £127,108.  Funds for the development of the telephone system are provided under the authority of the Telephone Capital Acts (1924 to 1956), which authorise the Minister for Finance to issue sums out of the Central Fund for this purpose. <Col N="756" /> Repayment of these funds is made by means of terminable annuities extending over a period not exceeding 25 years.  In consultation with the Minister for Finance, provision is made each year under sub-head M for the repayment of the instalments of principal and interest on the annuities created.  The increased provision in the sub-head is an indication of the continuing expansion of the telephone system.</P>
    <P>Sub-head T: The increase of £22,458 is mainly due to anticipated increased receipts from the Social Insurance Fund and the Savings Bank Fund for administrative expenses.</P>
    <P>Mail services operated satisfactorily during the past year.  A good standard of regularity and punctuality was maintained and the introduction of diesel working on C.I.E. trunk line mail trains resulted in postal improvements in many areas by way of earlier deliveries or later despatches.</P>
    <P>The volume of letter traffic showed an upward trend.  There was, however, a slight fall in the number of parcels handled.</P>
    <P>Christmas traffic was again very heavy.  Thanks to the very good response by the public to the appeals to post early the huge volume of mail was handled expeditiously and that posted by the advertised dates was delivered before Christmas.</P>
    <P>Postal delivery services in Dublin were reorganised during the year and put on a more rational and economic basis.  The reorganisation achieved a substantial saving in costs.</P>
    <P>The general reorganisation of postal delivery services in rural areas was continued.  A daily frequency of delivery and a better standard of service were provided in Wexford Head Office District and part of the Waterford District. The reorganisation of the Limerick and Ennis Districts will be implemented in the near future.  Work on the reorganisation of Bantry and the remaining portion of Waterford is well advanced and a start has been made in the Mallow area.  It is hoped to commence work during the current year on the remaining eight districts which have yet to be reorganised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> A special postage stamp, printed by the recess process, was issued in two denominations on 16th September, 1956, to mark the unveiling in Wexford of the statue of Commodore John Barry, which was presented to the nation by the people of the United States of America.  Two new stamps are to be issued shortly to commemorate the centenaries of John Redmond and Tomás O Criomhthain, and later in the year two further special stamps will be issued in honour of Admiral Brown and Father Luke Wadding.</P>
    <P>During the year two new sub-offices were opened and money order and Savings Bank facilities were extended to ten existing sub-offices.</P>
    <P>Reorganisation of the telegraph service continued during the year on the lines indicated in the White Paper issued to Deputies in July, 1955.  The reorganisation aims at reducing the number of handlings of telegrams to a minimum, firstly, by direct telephoning of short distance telegrams from receiving to delivery office and, secondly by transmission of long distance messages over a telegraph automatic switching system.  By means of this system telegraph offices may obtain direct teleprinter communication with each other without having to call upon the services of intermediate offices.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation proposals assumed a substantial reduction in the volume of traffic which has, in fact, taken place.  During the year ending 31st March last the number of telegrams handled was 2,127,000 as compared with 2,774,000 in the previous year. The decline in traffic has, however, slackened in recent months.</P>
    <P>The telegraph offices at Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Dún Laoghaire and Shannon Airport are now working on the telegraphic automatic switching system.  There remain 21 centres still to be connected. Delivery of the equipment necessary to connect them has been delayed but is now expected within the next few months and the scheme should be completed before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Morse telegraph working has been abolished at 21 more offices leaving <Col N="758" /> only 15 where this form of telegraphy is still in use.  It will cease altogether later this year concurrently with the completion of the telegraph automatic switching system.  The telegraph service will then be working entirely on modern equipment.  Considerable staff savings have already been effected as a result of the fall in traffic and modernisation of working methods and more are expected in the course of the current year.</P>
    <P>The telex service which was started in January, 1956, continues to grow; during the year 20 subscribers were added, bringing the total number of subscribers to 49.</P>
    <P>It has not so far been found possible to introduce a greetings telegraph service as planned, but the arrangements are in train and a date for introduction will be announced later.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the telephone service continued during 1956.  Some 8,880 miles of new circuits were added to the trunk network.  The number of new subscribers' exchange lines provided was 9,397, which was approximately 20 per cent. greater than the previous record figure in 1955.  The number of effective waiting applications for telephones was reduced from 4,200 on 31st December, 1955, to 2,800 approximately on 31st December, 1956. The latest figure (for 31st March last) was 3,100, of which 2,100 were in Dublin.  Sixty-five new telephone kiosks were provided.</P>
    <P>During 1956 local calls totalled 92,000,000 and trunk calls 13,952,000 showing increases of 4,000,000 and 218,000 respectively as compared with 1955 figures.  The increase in trunk traffic was lower than in previous years.</P>
    <P>The western co-axial cable was completed during the year providing ample circuits between Dublin and Sligo and between intermediate exchanges on this route.  As the cable is the main outlet for exchanges in the west and north-west it has enabled a general improvement of trunk service to be given over a considerable part of the country.</P>
    <P>The erection of overhead trunk cables on seven other routes commenced during the year.  These cables will be brought into service shortly to provide some 2,000 miles of additional circuits. <Col N="759" /> In addition, &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; systems, by which extra conversation channels are provided on existing wires, were brought into operation on 15 trunk routes, including Dublin-Arklow, Enniscorthy-Gorey, Thurles-Clonmel, Cork-Clonakilty, Limerick-Listowel, Galway-Claremorris. Altogether some 240 additional trunk circuits were provided on 170 routes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>During the current year some 5,000 miles of extra circuits will be provided on routes where they are most needed, mainly by the use of &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; equipment.</P>
    <P>During 1956 eight new automatic exchanges were opened and 130 exchanges were extended.  Mullingar exchange was converted to automatic working as the first part of a scheme now in hand for automatic operation of all the exchanges in the Mullingar area.  Automatic exchanges were also provided at Ardee and Rathluirc.</P>
    <P>In Dublin new temporary automatic exchanges were opened at Walkinstown  and Nutley Lane and automatic service was extended to Castleknock. Additional equipment was installed at a number of the Dublin automatic exchanges.</P>
    <P>In March last, Drogheda exchange was converted to automatic working and this will be followed later in the year by the opening of new automatic exchanges at Limerick, Sligo, Longford, Naas and at a number of smaller places.</P>
    <P>Recently subscribers served by the Athlone automatic exchange have, as an experiment, been given the facility of dialling trunk calls directly to Dublin and Cork subscribers.  This service is the first long-distance subscriber-dialling service to be introduced in these islands.</P>
    <P>Later this year Dublin subscribers will be enabled to dial subscribers at Bray, Greystones and the other automatic exchanges in the vicinity of the city.  At present such calls require the services of an operator.</P>
    <P>Extensive damage was caused to telephone plants throughout the <Col N="760" /> country by storms in January and February last.  Services were restored on a temporary basis within a short period but the repair work has considerably upset the construction programme in many areas.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, the number of new subscribers' installations reached a record level in 1956.  This was rendered possible largely by progress already made in the provision of underground cables prior to last summer when it became necessary to reduce the volume of telephone construction work being undertaken because of shortage of capital.  The result, though not reflected in the waiting list up to the end of December last, has been to delay further the clearance of waiting applications, particularly in urban areas requiring underground relief works.</P>
    <P>In rural areas also the amount of work undertaken has had to be curtailed and this has particularly affected applications involving heavy construction work.  Unfortunately, delays in installation work affecting a certain proportion of applications will be unavoidable so long as capital shortage persists.  Indeed, the Department will be fortunate if it can keep the waiting list from increasing materially and at the same time continue to meet the expanding needs of the trunk and exchange services.  With these primary ends in view plans for further extensive conversion of manual exchanges to automatic working are being deferred in order to conserve capital for more essential purposes.</P>
    <P>New buildings were completed and brought into service during the past year at Drogheda, Naas, Mullingar, and new buildings were completed and are now in course of being equipped for service at Limerick, Sligo, Naas and Palmerstown, Co. Dublin.  Improvement works were completed at Dundalk, Carrick-on-Suir, Lifford and Longford Post Offices.  Work is in progress on the erection of new buildings at Galway, Athenry and Cootehill.  The virtual rebuilding of the Kilkenny Post Office has reached the final stages.  It is hoped that work will commence during the present financial year on the erection of new buildings at Letterkenny, <Col N="761" /> Crumlin, County Dublin, and Droichead Nua, and on automatic telephone exchange buildings at a number of centres including, for the Dublin area, Dundrum, Stillorgan and Walkinstown, and on the adaptation of existing buildings at Donegal, Loughrea, Nenagh and Bray.  Apart from the foregoing the planning of other new building schemes and adaptation or improvement works is continuing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed new central sorting office at Dublin, in view of the urgent need for economy in State expenditure the plans were subjected, during the year to critical review with the object of reducing the capital expenditure on the project to the lowest possible dimensions.  As a result, a revised cost estimate was prepared by the Commissioners of Public Works, and my Department is awaiting the sanction of the Department of Finance for the expenditure involved. Whilst the cost estimate represents a very substantial expenditure of capital moneys and must, of course, be considered in relation to the other demands on the Government for capital expenditure, I am satisfied that there is, and has been for years past, a real need for the new building.  The revision of the original cost estimate has, unfortunately, led to some unavoidable delay, but I am now hopeful that the position will shortly be reached when the Commissioners of Public Works will be enabled to proceed with the preparation of contract drawings.</P>
    <P>The value of deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank during the year 1956 amounted to £15,292,000, representing a decrease of £105,000 in comparison with the corresponding figure for 1955.  Withdrawals amounted to £14,691,000, an increase of £2,062,000 on the figure for 1955.  Estimating the interest due to depositors for 1956 at £1,756,000, the total balance due to depositors on 31st December, 1956, was approximately £73,542,000, as against £71,185,000 on 31st December, 1955.</P>
    <P>Deposits during the year by the Trustee Savings Banks amounted to £773,000 and withdrawals to £690,000, a decrease of £435,000 on deposits and £66,000 on withdrawals.  The balance to credit of the Trustee Savings Banks <Col N="762" /> at the end of the year, including £324,000 for interest, was approximately £11,398,000.</P>
    <P>It would appear that heavy withdrawals from the Post Office Savings Bank and by the Trustee Savings Banks were made for the purpose of reinvestment in the National Loans and Savings Certificates.</P>
    <P>The estimated combined balances, Post Office and Trustee Savings Banks, on the 31st December, 1956, amounted to £84,940,000, compared with £82,176,000 on the same date in 1955.</P>
    <P>During the year 1956 there was a marked increase in Savings Certicate transaction as compared with the previous year.  Receipts from sales amounted to £4,165,000, repayment of principal to £2,239,000 and of interest to £713,000.  Corresponding figures for 1955 were £2,103,000, £1,438,000 and £478,000.  The increase in sales was due mainly to the introduction of the attractive 6th Issue in May, 1956. Judging from the time at which they were sought the increase in repayments was due to investments by Saving Certificate holders in 5 per cent. National Savings Bonds and 5½ per cent.  National Loan and to transfers from other Issues to the 6th Issue.</P>
    <P>The amount of principal due to investors at the end of the year stood at £20,572,000, compared to £18,645,000 at the end of 1955.</P>
    <P>In the campaign for increased savings, the Department has worked in close co-operation with the Savings Committee since it was set up in December, 1955.</P>
    <P>The number of staff provided for in the Estimate, 16,427, shows a small reduction on the number, 16,678, for the previous year.  The largest reduction is in the labouring force in the Engineering Branch.</P>
    <P>Relations between the Department and its staff continued to be good during the year.  The conciliation council, set up under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Civil Service, provided the main forum for discussion with the staff on matters of mutual concern.  On some 14 claims submitted to the council agreement was reached between the two sides on all <Col N="763" /> but one.  Claims for improvement in wages, related solely to the value of work done, have been disposed of now in the case of practically all the grades. So far as can be seen from the claims now listed, the work of the council is likely to be mainly concerned with claims other than wages claims, that is, with such matters as working hours and conditions, establishment and so on.  Few of such claims can, of course, be conceded without extra cost.  The steady rise in staff costs is one of the reasons that make it imperative that the Department should seek to make its working as efficient and economical as possible.</P>
    <P>As my predecessor mentioned last year the council has been dealing with the problems arising out of the reorganisation of the telegraph service. That reorganisation has necessitated the suppression of posts, both in the operating and supervisory grades, and the re-deployment of officers.  The staff have, I am glad to be informed, taken a realistic and co-operative attitude to those problems.</P>
    <P>The Sub-Postmasters' Consultative Council set up last year to provide a formal means of consultation for sub-postmasters who do not come under the conciliation and arbitration scheme, shows every sign of being a most useful and helpful body, from the point of view of all concerned.</P>
    <P>When speaking last year on the Estimate for the Department my predecessor referred to the heavy additional costs which had to be met in respect of salary and wage increases awarded to the staff through the conciliation and arbitration machinery and which, since 1954, have risen to £840,000 per annum.  He explained that these rising costs were bound to have a marked effect on the overall financial result of the working of the Department which for the year 1955-56, it was expected, would show a marked <Col N="764" /> disimprovement compared with that for the year 1954-55 when the overall deficit was £246,016.  It was, indeed, estimated that the overall deficit for 1955-56 would prove to be of the order of £500,000.  I am glad to be able to report that the position turned out to be more favourable, the deficit proving to be £368,479 made up of: Postal Service, deficit, £264,617; Telegraph Service, deficit, £238,299; Telephone Service, profit, £134,437.</P>
    <P>This improvement in the position was due mainly to increased revenue but very substantial savings were also secured by the introduction of modern and more economical methods of operation in the Telegraph Service.</P>
    <P>Definite figures for last year, 1956-57, are not yet available.  It is estimated, however, that the financial position will show a further marked improvement, the overall deficit being reduced by £222,000 approximately, to £146,000 made up of: Postal Service, deficit, £176,000; Telegraph Service, deficit, £220,000; Telephone Service, profit, £250,000.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is not possible to give any reasonably reliable estimate of what the position is likely to be at the end of the current year.  If, however, the present trend of traffic continues and no unforeseen heavy increase in expenditure should arise it is not unreasonable to assume that the year's working will result in a further improvement in the financial position.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to avail of this, my first opportunity, to pay a tribute to my predecessor who gave such long service in this House.  I feel sure every member of the House will join with me in expressing the hope that he may have many long years of happiness in his retirement.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, May 7th, 1957.</P>

      <P>The information asked for by the Deputy is not available in my Department. The particulars referred to in the first part of the question can be obtained from health authorities' records and I am asking these authorities to compile them, though it may take some time to do so.  When they have been received, I shall make them available to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question, I am not in a position to furnish the information asked for.  In this connection, I would like to point out to the Deputy that in addition to the very large number of doctors and <Col N="627" /> specialists employed by health authorities, part-time or whole-time on varying conditions of service in all classes of health institutions, such as regional, county, district, fever and mental hospitals and sanatoria, a very considerable number of medical practitioners in private practice and on the staffs of voluntary institutions throughout the country receive payments directly and indirectly from or on behalf of health authorities in connection with services rendered under the Health Acts and otherwise.  In some cases, these payments are not made direct to the doctors concerned but to the institutions to which they are attached and information is not available as to the manner in which they are allocated amongst those entitled to receive them; for example, the element in the daily capitation rate paid to voluntary hospitals in respect of local authority patients which is earmarked for the remuneration of the staffs of these hospitals. In other cases, payments, although made direct to individual doctors, may not be retained in full by them but may be shared by arrangement with the authorities or with other members of the staffs of the institutions in which they work.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be possible to furnish an accurate and complete return of the information sought by him.</P>
