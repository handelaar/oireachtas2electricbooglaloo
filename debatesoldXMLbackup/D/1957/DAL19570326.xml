      <P>The exact particulars requested by the Deputy are not available since tariff protection relates to an individual product and not to an industry while industrial employment statistics relate to industries and not to products.  Under such circumstances any computation must be of a tentative nature.  It is estimated that the average number of persons engaged in 1956 in industries, any of whose products would, if imported, be subject to a customs tariff, constituted 20 per cent. of the total number of Social Welfare cards exchanged in the previous year.  It may be added that in virtue of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, the insurance coverage now includes employment in agriculture.</P>

      <P>During the period 1st March, 1956, to 1st March, 1957, 319,255 tons of dried home-grown wheat were delivered to the flour mills, at an average delivered price of £34 15s. 4d. per ton, in respect of the 1955 crop, and £35 12s. 0d. per ton in respect of the 1956 crop.</P>
      <P>During the same period, 42,005 tons of soft wheats were imported, at an average price, delivered mill, of £30 17s. 6d. per ton, and 105,882 tons of hard wheat, at an average price, delivered mill, of £33 6s. 8d. per ton.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question, the type of imported wheat to be purchased is determined by the flour millers with due regard to the types of flour to be produced.  The maximum quantity of such wheat permitted to be used in grists for the production of subsidised flour is, of course, controlled.</P>

      <P>It was on the 18th July, 1955 that C.I.E. were directed to submit an amending superannuation scheme for their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>C.I.E. arranged, at the request of the Trade Unions concerned, to have <Col N="42" /> certain actuarial investigations carried out to determine what pensions could be produced from various rates of contribution and copies of the actuarial report were made available to the Unions on 31st May, 1956.  There was a meeting between C.I.E. and the Unions on 27th November, 1956, but I understand that no agreed proposals emerged from that meeting.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, with a view to resolving public doubts as to the secrecy of the ballot, he will make a statement on the procedure followed under the Electoral Act, 1923, in regard to the marking of the elector's number on the register on the ballot paper counterfoil; and whether, in the interests of preserving the secrecy of the ballot, he intends to introduce amending legislation in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Electoral Act, 1923, requires that the electors number in the register be written on the counterfoil of the ballot paper by the presiding officer.  The secrecy of the ballot is not affected, as the marked counterfoils are placed in envelopes which are sealed at the close of the poll by the presiding officer and by such of the agents present as wish to affix their seals. After the conclusion of the count the ballot papers are made up in sealed parcels and are transmitted by the returning officer with the sealed envelopes containing the marked counterfoils to the Clerk of the Dáil who is required to retain them for one year and then to have them destroyed unless <Col N="47" /> otherwise directed by an order of the Dáil or the High Court.</P>
      <P>The marked counterfoils and the ballot papers can be inspected only by order of the Dáil or of a Court trying an Election Petition.  The Electoral Acts provide that in carrying out such an inspection care shall be taken not to discover the manner in which any particular elector voted, unless his vote has been declared by a competent Court to be invalid.  No such inspection has been ordered since the establishment of the State but, nevertheless, it is not considered that the means of identifying invalid votes should be abolished.  I am satisfied that there is no danger of a breach of the secrecy of the ballot under the present procedure and accordingly I do not consider it necessary in the interests of preserving the secrecy of the ballot to have the law amended.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplies and Services Act is due to expire on 31st March and this Bill proposes to continue it until 31st December next.  I can, I think, express the fairly confident hope that it will not require to be renewed beyond that date.  There is only a very limited number of purposes for which the special powers of the Supplies and Services Act are still required and arrangements can be made to deal <Col N="52" /> with these matters by other legislation within the course of the year.</P>
    <P>The only purposes for which the powers of the Supplies and Services Act are being used at present are to deal with some traffic regulations operated by the Minister for Local Government, a small number of welfare schemes operated by the Minister for Social Welfare, and to maintain the existing arrangements for the control of prices, for the suspension of certain customs duties and for the operation of the petrol rationing arrangements for so long as they may be necessary.</P>
    <P>There is, I believe, general agreement amongst all the Parties of the House that this Act should cease to operate as soon as the Dáil can make arrangements for the continuance of whatever operations are authorised under it.  A very large part of the necessary permanent legislation has been enacted and the balance will, I hope, be enacted this year.  Therefore, unless some very exceptional circumstances arise, this last residue of our wartime legislation will be cleared off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, it was my intention to promote legislation to render unnecessary the continuance of the Supplies and Services Act, and, as the Minister has acknowledged, a good deal of legislation&mdash;I think about 12 Bills in all&mdash;was put through so as to render the continuance of the Act unnecessary. Some more Bills are to be put through.  There is one Bill relating to hire purchase and that new Bill is necessary because of the effect of the recently controlled hire purchase arrangements.  That Bill is in draft and can be introduced immediately. There is another Bill relating to the suspension of customs duties.  That Bill is also in draft and can be introduced immediately.  There is another Bill dealing with the question of the continuance of price control and that Bill is at present with the Parliamentary Draftsman with a view to being licked into shape as a Bill.  It already has the heads of a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the passage of these three Bills, all of which could be on the Order Paper, two next week and one within a month, the main necessity for the Supplies and Services Act, would have passed, were it not for the recent <Col N="53" /> necessity of introducing petrol rationing. While I agree at the outset that emergency legislation of a supplies and services character is not desirable, I have still come to the conclusion within the past few weeks that a sudden switch away from it to nothing of a comparable kind may involve the Government, the Parliament and the people in unforeseen difficulties.  So long as petrol rationing continues, it will be necessary to continue the Supplies and Services Act, even though we have passed permanent legislation to deal with all the other matters which are being dealt with in connection with the Act as it operates at present.</P>
    <P>This brings to mind in a very acute way and throws out in bold relief the necessity for having some kind of legislation to deal with an emergency situation which we cannot foresee, which is not of our making and against which we are completely powerless to insulate this country.  If the Supplies and Services Act had been repealed and it were found necessary to ration petrol, quite considerable difficulty might arise in finding the necessary machinery to do that job in the speedy and efficient way in which it could be done under the Supplies and Services Act.</P>
    <P>Petrol rationing is now petering out and within the next month or two, it ought to go entirely.  That does not mean, however, that we are never going to have the same difficulty again. A shipbuilding strike, an engineering strike or a dock strike in England might make it impossible to get tankers loaded, might make it impossible to get tankers unloaded here, or you might have a situation in England in which a dispute, for example, in the British coal fields might make it impossible to load ships with fuel for Ireland. In such circumstances, it might very well be necessary to ration the meagre quantity of coal that could be imported for the time being from other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>It is because situations of that kind, in the uneasy world in which we live, are things which seem to be ever-present that I believe there is now a case, in the interest of the nation, for considering whether we ought not to <Col N="54" /> have something as a substitute for the Supplies and Services Act, some piece of mechanism which is already in existence, remains suspended but can be brought into speedy operation on the passage of legislation through this House.  Something of that kind is desirable.  It is all right to say in an idyllic way that this emergency legislation is undesirable in times of peace, but a time of peace can often be much tougher than a war situation as many could prove from experience of various countries since the end of World War II.</P>
    <P>The Government should, I think, give consideration, perhaps in consultation with other Parties in the House, to the desirability of having at its disposal some piece of mechanism which will operate speedily and operate overnight, which will deal with a special problem only as long as the problem lasts and can then go back into retirement until it is necessary to bring it out for use again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that one of the reasons for which he wished to retain this Bill was the rationing of petrol.  The House will have observed that, in the course of the past 48 hours or so, the Minister has announced that the continued rationing of diesel oil and certain other oils is no longer necessary.  I think most of us understood that the shortage related in a more critical form generally to diesel and heavy oils than it did to petrol.  Perhaps the Minister could give some indication as to what his views are on the possibility of petrol rationing coming to an end, at an ascertained future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly on what the leader of the Labour Party said.  I should like to see the Supplies and Services Act disappearing, and let us at least try to get on without it.  I am afraid it is true that any of us who have occupied executive office find ourselves gradually growing into the frame of mind in which we would seek to short-circuit the rather cumbersome processes of democratic government.  It is undoubtedly true that a situation can arise when a Minister, anxious for the welfare of the particular section of the economy <Col N="55" /> for which he is responsible, wishes to take prompt and effective action to avoid a particular danger which threatens that economy.  I think that is one of the prices we have to pay for democracy and individual liberty in a free country.  It is true that things can be done much more quickly by order and it is true that, under a totalitarian regime, many more things can be done than through the democratic process.  Maybe the leader of the Labour Party is right that the world is becoming so complex that democracy can no longer function effectively in the full sense.  I am not prepared to accept that view yet.  I believe the Dáil would give to any Minister whatever powers are necessary for the protection of the public weal, no matter how little we liked the Minister or the Government to which he belongs.</P>
    <P>I dare to say that the whole future of democracy depends on whether there is retained that degree of public spirit which will give the lawful Government of the day, chosen by the Irish people, powers to protect the community against such dangers as those to which the leader of the Labour Party referred, from outside or within.  Let us see if we cannot do that through the ordinary procedure of Parliament and, if we cannot, then permanent legislation such as the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act may be necessary.  I prefer to go on believing that this Parliament will, in any emergency, do what is necessary to continue governing and to protect the community and only when I have seen that that is not so will I be persuaded that such legislation should be made part of our permanent legislation, because I think that in a certain sense that would be a declaration of a loss of faith in the normal procedure of democracy which has so far grown and prospered in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton raised the question of the extent to which it is desirable that the Government should have powers, in normal times, to take action which might <Col N="56" /> interfere with the business of the citizens of the State without consulting the Dáil.  In what Deputy Norton would describe as a yeasty situation the Government might have to take special powers but we think that it should be obliged to bring the Dáil together rather than that there should be special powers kept in cold storage for use in such circumstances.  That was the approach which we had when the difficulties of the war time began to pass and when the desire was to get rid of the restrictions and regulations which had been imposed in that war situation under these temporary Acts.</P>
      <P>Nobody can foretell what the future may hold but if we can assume that something like normal conditions may prevail then we should proceed by way of normal legislation.  With regard to fuel oil and heavy oils generally the position now appears to be such that there is no reason to maintain restrictions on their use and no difficulty is anticipated in meeting all demands for them.  The situation with regard to petrol is that there is likely to be, I gather, in the course of the next month almost enough petrol to enable the same volume of consumption as was experienced this time last year but not quite enough, and certainly no margin, to permit of an increase on last year's consumption.  In the circumstances it is necessary for the time being to keep rationing in operation but it will be little more than a precautionary measure and I should hope that it will be possible to ensure that nobody will be in difficulties because of the rationing scheme.  It will be our intention to get rid of it completely when that can be done without risk.  It appears that the situation is likely to improve in the near future but circumstances might alter that picture and in view of the absence of a margin of stocks I think it is desirable to keep rationing in operation for the time being.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. As I explained earlier, the Government have power to impose customs duties by Order, but these Orders must be confirmed by legislation within eight months.  The Orders which are scheduled under this Bill were made by the previous Government and will lapse, if not confirmed by legislation on some date in the first week of April. I have examined most of these Orders and in so far as I can see there is no good reason why they should not be confirmed.  They impose and increase duties on the articles set out in column three of the Schedule.  Deputies will see that they vary in importance but in all cases there will be agreement that they should be continued.</P>

      <P>Deputies will have seen from the Supplementary Estimate circulated that there are two rather large sums required which were not anticipated at the beginning of the year and there are certain appropriations-in-aid that have not come in.  The total extra amount required for this financial year is £1,130,440.  There are savings in other subheads amounting to £640,440, leaving a net total to be voted by the Dáil of £490,000.</P>
      <P>The various headings under which these extra payments and deficiencies accrue are set out.  Under M.7, which deals with the Agricultural Production Council, another £345 is required.  It was not in being at the beginning of the financial year and that is the amount required to cover its activities until the end of this financial year.</P>
      <P>Then, £50,000 is required under M.9 for the subsidy on phosphate.  Under N.1 £75,000 is required to cover the expenses in connection with the outbreak of swine fever which occurred recently.  I am glad to say that there has not been a case now since the 1st of March.  We trust that it is coming to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest amount required is £643,000 for subsidies for dairy produce. At the beginning of the year, it was anticipated that, for dairy produce subsidies, a sum of £2,100,000 would be required, but the estimate now is £2,743,000, leaving a sum to be voted by the Dáil of £643,000.  That is a sum which is very largely due to the increase in the production of butter, leading to an estimated export of 4,000 to 5,000 tons.  That will require a very <Col N="61" /> heavy subsidy in order to enable it to be sold abroad for the best price we can get and at the same time pay the farmers their usual price for milk.  At the present time the butter is costing the Butter Marketing Committee about 440/8 per cwt. to export, but they are compelled to sell it in competition with other exporters on the British market at 249/&ndash; per cwt.  That involves a loss of 191/8 per cwt., or about 1/8½d. per lb.  Deputies will see that this is a very large sum to pay, but there is no way out of it.  If we want to sell the butter abroad, we cannot get any more at the present time than the 249/&ndash; and the total internal cost and export costs on that amounts to the 440/&ndash; I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it right the Minister should not overlook that for the butter we sell in Germany we get a little more, but that is a restricted market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is largely sold in Britain and the Six Counties.  What I am giving is the average figure of which I have been advised, the average figure for the cost and what we can get for it.</P>
      <P>The only other big figure is in the Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;the deficiencies in Appropriations-in-Aid.  The recoupments from the American Grant Counterpart Fund were £345,000 less than was anticipated.  That is because the expenditure on the distribution of lime and the expenditure on the bovine tuberculosis eradication is not as high as was anticipated at the beginning of the year.  Consequently, the Department is now short of the £345,000 recoupment from the Grant Counterpart Fund which was anticipated.</P>
      <P>There are no other sums which are any way comparable in size with those.  I think that gives the Dáil a fair indication of what the money is required for and the net sum required, which as I pointed out, is £490,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarkable statement of the Minister on this Supplementary Estimate should bring home emphatically to the public the cockeyed policy which has been pursued in this country for the past 35 <Col N="62" /> years in so far as agriculture is concerned. We have arrived now at the stage of which, in spite of the wonderful Ministers for Agriculture we had over the years, the new Minister, in his first act as a Minister, has to introduce a Supplementary Estimate which will pay the British to buy our butter.  That is the first action he takes when he comes into this House&mdash;and that is after 35 years of native Government.</P>
      <P>I believe the necessary preparations for the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate had been taken prior to the change of Government. That would lead me to believe that the former Minister, if time had allowed him, would have introduced exactly this Estimate and that, on the introduction of the Estimate, he would have had the complete and unanimous support of the Labour Party, who would be agreeable to pay the British people to buy our butter.</P>
      <P>That fact deserves very serious consideration. We have people in Ireland here who never see butter from one end of the year to the other.  Their economic circumstances are such that the taste of butter is something that they can only dream about.  Yet, in spite of the fact that a large section of our community is deprived of butter, through economic circumstances, we come into this House to subsidise the British to buy the butter produced in our country.  If that is not a cockeyed policy, I do not know what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only do we do that, mark you, but we have a Supplementary Estimate here to-day under M.7, increasing the estimate from £5 to £350&mdash;an increase of £345&mdash;for the Agricultural Production Council.  Now, I do not know, sir, and I am not familiar with the position, but I am just wondering whether this Agricultural Production Council was working on the policy that we should increase our exports of butter.  Perhaps the fact that we have this increase in our export of butter can be tied in with the fact that we have an agricultural Production Council for which we need supplementary money at the moment.  It all leads up to the fact that when an increase in production takes place&mdash;in butter, for instance&mdash;we <Col N="63" /> ask the British if they will take money from the Irish Parliament in order to buy the butter from us.</P>
    <P>I know that the present Minister who introduced this Estimate is not responsible for it under the circumstances and I hope that, when the new Minister who takes over that portfolio has had an opportunity to get down to the details in the Department of Agriculture, we will never see the day again when a Supplementary Estimate will have to be introduced into this House asking the British to buy our butter at a subsidised rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to open a discussion on this point, but the fact of the matter is that, when we have surpluses which we cannot sell at home, we must sell them abroad at whatever price we can get for them. Many other countries besides ourselves are under that compulsion.  We are getting a very disastrously low price for the butter which we export at the present time, but so are the people of New Zealand, Denmark and Holland, who are exporting at present.</P>
      <P>For a long term policy, as far as I can see, to the extent that we can produce what we require here ourselves, we will be under less compulsion to sell abroad in order to get the money to buy imports.  This particular subsidy on butter could not have been anticipated by anybody at the beginning of the year.  There was a disastrous fall in recent months in the price of butter in England.  I do not see how the exporting countries can keep it up because there were countries exporting butter to Britain in which it was a very much bigger percentage of their total production than butter is of our total production and also a fantastically higher percentage of their exports than butter is of ours.  There are many things which are very difficult in the world, and the handling of this butter business is going to be a real headache.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate has been found necessary to meet increased expenditure on schemes being carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949.  The previous Government decided to make supplementary grants amounting to £200,000 available to county councils in November, 1956.  The amount required to meet commitments on these grants up to the 31st March, 1957, is £120,000. Savings on another sub-head of the Vote amount to £80,000.  The net excess of the Vote is, therefore, £40,000 and a Vote for this amount is now required.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £300,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1957, for certain Transport Services; for Grants for Harbours; for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1952, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933)); for certain Protective Equipment for Ships; for certain payments in respect of Compensation, including the cost of <Col N="65" /> medical treatment (No. 19 of 1946); and for the Coast Life Saving Service.</P>
    <P>I do not like to suggest to the Dáil that I have succeeded in disentangling in my own mind the financial position of C.I.E.  I think it is clear that it is a very serious one and I do not want to do more than give the House the general picture in so far as I understand it at this stage.</P>
    <P>On the revenue side, Deputies, I think, are aware that no provision has been made for the payment of grants to C.I.E. in respect of losses for some time past, and at the beginning of this financial year C.I.E. had a revenue debit of approximately £870,000.  On the capital side C.I.E. were authorised in 1955 to issue stock to the extent of £4½ million, which they did, and that covered its expenditure on capital account to the end of March last. Authority to raise capital by further stock issues in 1956 was not given to them.  It is quite obvious, therefore, that with a substantial revenue debit and no provision for new capital to meet its obligations on capital account, C.I.E. ran out of cash fairly early in this financial year.  It carried on by means of temporary borrowings, by negotiating for the partial deferment of payments due to suppliers of diesel locomotives and other capital equipment, and by obtaining from the Exchequer by vote of the Dáil an advance described as a repayable advance of £1,000,000 to meet its capital obligations to the end of November last.</P>
    <P>The £700,000 for which authority is now being sought is also to be classified as an advance on capital account. It is money required to meet the obligations of the board in respect of capital expenditure due for payment by it before the 31st March next. There is no provision being made to meet its operating losses.  It is estimated that the losses of C.I.E. in the present financial year, 1956-57, are £1,825,000, of which very nearly £800,000 represents interest due upon its Stock which will fall to be paid from the Exchequer under the State guarantee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> These substantial losses arose notwithstanding the fact that a 10 per cent. increase in rail fares and in road and rail freight charges was brought into operation during the year.  It is not yet clear to me, I must say, how the deficiency was financed, but presumably there are still amounts due by the board to creditors and there probably has been some running down of stocks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that money was spent by the board in meeting its cash deficiencies very early in the financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the board's powers of temporary borrowing under the Act appear to be exhausted and it is again clearly in urgent need of funds.  The estimate for the current year, as Deputies will have seen, provides for £1,250,000 to meet cash requirements.  The board's estimates of its capital requirements in 1957-58 exceed £1,500,000, so that the provision which is being made in the estimate against C.I.E.'s cash needs appears to be insufficient even to meet its commitments on capital account, and certainly it contains no provision of any kind for operating losses during the year.</P>
      <P>I am not presenting this as a complete picture of the position; I merely mention these facts to make it quite clear to the House that in providing this £700,000 to meet capital commitments already entered into&mdash;the money has already been spent in fact&mdash;the financial position of C.I.E. is not made any easier.  It is starting the new financial year much as it started the last financial year&mdash;without cash in sight to meet its outgoings.  The provision in the Estimate is not nearly enough to cover this cash deficiency. It is obvious that some major decisions affecting the future of C.I.E. will have to be taken very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Committee <Col N="67" /> which my predecessor in office set up to examine and report upon inland transport problems is likely to report next month.  The submission of that report will be the occasion for the examination of these major problems to which I have referred and it probably would be wrong for me to express any personal view regarding them until that report has been received.</P>
    <P>The actual amount which the Estimate will provide for C.I.E. is £700,000.  The total the Dáil is asked to vote is £300,000 because, as indicated in the Estimate, there was a saving on other sub-heads of the Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the sum of £700,000 which is the additional provision necessary for C.I.E., as the Minister has stated.  It is for capital works and it has not been so described in the Supplementary Estimate.  If the position is as the Minister has indicated it to be, I feel it should be so described here.</P>
      <P>I have no way of segregating the savings on the other sub-heads as between capital and income.  When the Minister was specifying that the £700,000 was a capital item, it would have been desirable that the savings would be segregated as between capital voted services and non-capital voted services.  Obviously the Minister is not in a position to answer that point to-day.  No doubt, however, he will be in a position to do so at a later date.</P>
      <P>I take it that the Minister proposes to publish the report of the Committee of Inquiry set up by his predecessor in office to inquire into the working of C.I.E. as soon as it is available.</P>

      <P>It is quite true that the Estimate as circulated describes the £700,000 as provision towards approved expenditure of C.I.E.  That change was made in the Estimate by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, at very short notice.  It is a more accurate description of what the Dáil is asked to vote money for&mdash;to meet capital requirements only.  I think there is one substantial liability of C.I.E. which must be discharged by the end of the month and that is to the <Col N="68" /> Minister for Finance in respect of income tax.</P>

      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is in respect of the Vote for Social Insurance, No. 61, in the Book of Estimates. It is for the sum of £1,581,000.  Deputies will remember that when the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1956, was before Dáil Éireann in June of last year, it was stated that the cost to the Exchequer of the increases in the weekly rates of insurance benefit effected by the Bill would be £500,000 per annum in a year in which the increases operated over the whole length of the year.  As the increased rates were effected from the beginning of September, 1956, the additional cost to the Exchequer for 1956-57 was estimated at £300,000 and provision for that amount was made in the Budget by the Minister for Finance.  The amount which it would have been necessary to provide by means of this Supplementary Estimate would there-fore have been £300,000, had it not been for the serious worsening of the unemployment position which <Col N="71" /> has occurred during the present financial year.  This has resulted in expenditure on unemployment benefit during that year being much higher than had been expected and it has resulted in a loss of income from contributions.  As Deputies are probably aware, the Exchequer makes good to the Social Insurance Fund, under Section 39 of the Social Welfare Act of 1952, the amount by which the expenditure of the Fund exceeds its income in any year.  The amount of this Supplementary Estimate is required, therefore, in order to balance the income and expenditure of the Fund for the year 1956-57.  The total expenditure out of the Fund on benefits in the year in question will be about £8,880,000.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1957, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chlaráitheora), and certain Services administered by that Office including Grants to Local Authorities, miscellaneous Grants and Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Act of 1957, which became law on 5th February, provided for the establishment of a board to make and carry out a scheme of voluntary health insurance.  This board was established by my predecessor on 12th February and I understand is now engaged in the preparation of an insurance scheme.  It has recruited some staff and has under contemplation the acquisition of office premises.  In order to meet this and other expenses, the Minister for Health has power under Section 16 of the Act to lend a sum not exceeding £25,000 to the board, to be applied towards the payment of the expenses of its establishment and such preliminary expenses as may occur in carrying out its functions under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> It appears that in the Estimates for the coming year provision is, in fact, made for advances up to the sum of £20,000 for the purposes to which I have referred.  On the other hand, as Deputies may be aware, as this provision for next year is in respect of a service to which reference was not made in the current Estimate, none of the money could be advanced until the main Estimate for the Department had been passed by the House and reported.  To get over this technical difficulty, a token Supplementary Estimate is being taken to-day.  When it is passed, it will be possible for me to consider making advances to the board before the House disposes of the Estimate.</P>

      <P>I was hoping that the Minister would give us some information regarding the qualifications of the members of this board.  They may have been given, but I am not aware of it. I believe there are many in this House, and possibly outside it, who would like to know the qualifications of the managing director and other members of the board.  I believe they would also like to know what salaries these people are getting.  I, for one, would certainly like to know that.  It struck me before I made my come back to the House that it should have been possible to find somebody in the Department of Health or in the Department of Industry and Commerce with actuarial experience who could preside over a voluntary board such as this and prepare a scheme.  One of their main tasks will be to prepare a scheme. That is why I say it should be possible to get an official of some of the Departments with actuarial experience to help prepare the scheme rather than take in someone from outside, possibly out of some other job, and put him in under contract with a reasonably good salary.  I may be wrong in this, because I was not here when the Bill <Col N="73" /> was being discussed, but I think the Minister should give us some information on that.  For myself, I would be very grateful to have it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question put to me by Deputy Norton as to when the scheme is likely to come into operation, the Deputy is no doubt aware that the board was established only on 12th February, a little over six weeks ago.  It would be quite impossible for the board at this stage to have done very much more than try to recruit such staff as it may require and to secure accommodation.  I have not had very much opportunity of looking into the operation of the board. Indeed, I am not yet familiar with the manner in which it proposes to attack the task which has been entrusted to it.  I would hope, however, when the main Estimate comes along, to be in a position to be more specific as to the nature of the schemes which will be put forward and as to the date upon which they will come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question asked by Deputy Gallagher as to the qualifications of the board, I suppose the only way in which I could deal with that would be to give the names and descriptions of the members of the board as they were, I think, given to the Press when the board was set up. The Chairman is Mr. James Troy, Chartered Accountant, of 44 Dartmouth Square, Dublin.  The other directors are Mr. M. P. Linehan, President of the Irish Congress of Professional and Service Associations: Mr. T. C. J. O'Connell, M. D., Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin; Mr. H. B. O'Hanlon, former Taxing Master of the High Court; and Mr. Patrick J. Shaw, solicitor, Belsize House, Mullingar. I understand that the fee paid to the Chairman is at the rate of £500 per annum and to the other members of the board £250 per annum.  The board, I believe, has appointed a general manager, Mr. Noel J. Burke, at a salary of £2,000 per annum, proceeding by annual increments of £100 to £2,500 per annum, and an assistant principal officer of the Department of Health, Mr. J. F. O'Mahony, has been seconded to act as secretary to the board.  The Act provides that the <Col N="74" /> directors may be appointed for a period not exceeding five years and the gentlemen whose names I have mentioned have been so appointed.</P>

I have nothing against the man who is being appointed.  I have no doubt he has the necessary qualifications.

    <P>A Vote on Account is roughly a four months' provision for expenditure on the Supply Services in the new financial year.  This four months' period is normally adequate for the Dáil to consider the individual Estimates and to pass the Appropriation Act.</P>
    <P>In order that there may be finance <Col N="79" /> available to carry on the public services generally after the 31st March it is necessary to have this Vote on Account passed and the Central Fund Bill confirming it enacted before Monday, the 1st April.  This gives less than a week to have the Vote on Account considered in Committee and on Report by Dáil Éireann and to have the consequential Central Fund Bill passed through all stages in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and signed by the President.</P>
    <P>Whatever balance may be available in the Exchequer on the 1st April and whatever further moneys might accrue to the Exchequer in the new financial year could not, as Deputies are aware, be applied to the Supply Services without the authority of the Oireachtas as expressed by Dáil approval of the Vote on Account and the enactment of the Central Fund Bill.  The Central Fund and Appropriation Acts of 1956 apply only to the financial year ending on the 31st of this month.</P>
    <P>The Volume of Estimates for the Supply Services on which the Vote on Account is based and the Vote on Account itself were already printed when the present Government took office.  The Estimates were released for publication on the day on which I first saw them&mdash;the 21st March.  Needless to say, the Government have not had an adequate opportunity of examining the Estimates.  Owing to the time factor, the Government, indeed, had no alternative but to circulate immediately, as they found them, both the Estimates Volume and the Vote on Account so that authority to issue money for the Supply Services in the opening months of the new year might be obtained by the 31st March.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I cannot be expected to analyse the contents of the Volume of Estimates.  The individual Estimates themselves show what is included for the various services and how it compares with the provision for 1956-57.  I have already begun my detailed examination of these Estimates and of the financial position as a whole.  The results of this examination will be made clear either before or at the time that I present my Budget.  At <Col N="80" /> this point I would prefer not to make any further comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Knowing Deputy Dr. Ryan of old, I was not surprised that he gave us the briefest possible explanation of the Vote on Account and the Estimates.  I might just give a few of the details in relation to the Book of Estimates which he has omitted. The Book of Estimates shows an increase of £3,444,000 over the figure for last year.  That includes £2,053,000 in the Transport Estimate&mdash;Estimate No. 51&mdash;which occurs because of a difference in the form of the provision of capital moneys for C.I.E.</P>
      <P>We discussed this matter a few minutes ago in the House.  It was not possible in 1956, nor would it be likely to be feasible in 1957, that C.I.E. would find by stock issues the funds they would require for their capital purposes. Accordingly, during the year that is now drawing to a close, the funds required by that company were made good by voted moneys.  Similar arrangements have been included in the figures for next year.</P>
      <P>When deduction is taken for that amount when comparing the Book of Estimates for the coming year with that for this year, it will be seen that the difference is only £1,393,000.  The Estimates show that there are decreases in 38 out of the 65 Estimates that are in the Book, and of these decreases some of the most notable are those which have been achieved while, at the same time, giving as good or better services.</P>
      <P>The decrease in the Estimate for the Garda Síochána of £75,000 arises because of modernisation of methods in that force.  I believe there are further improvements to come as a result of the industrial consultant's advice as to whether the force could be more efficiently run.  The Forestry Estimate shows that there will be provision for a larger plantable area while at the same time the annual cost will be less because of improved methods of working and because of the manner in which the former Minister for Lands, Deputy Blowick, arranged the sales of standing timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decrease in the Estimate for the Department of Defence also arises <Col N="81" /> because, as a Government, we were not prepared to spend the people's money in some of the ways in which it was spent previously by our predecessors. In the Department of Defence, it is quite obvious that expenditure takes a very substantial time to mature.  The contracts for such things as the jet planes and the laying down of concrete runways for them at Baldonnell, entered into by our predecessors, concluded only last year.  Last year we were able to get some supplies of the ordinary type of equipment that would be necessary for an army of the size of ours, and it is in consequence of that that we were able to make the substantial decrease on that Estimate this year.</P>
    <P>On the other side, there are some increases, notably for the building of new schools, for which is included this year in the Book of Estimates the highest figure in the history of the State.  I think all Parties will agree it is vital in the national economy that bovine tuberculosis should be eradicated. Accordingly, increased provision was necessary in order to bring about such eradication.  There is an increase of £466,000 for the butter subsidy. A reduction in Appropriations-in-Aid in the Vote for the Department of Agriculture arises because we are coming to the end of the Grant Counterpart Fund from Marshall Aid.  Offhand I would say that the Estimate for Agriculture is up by £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for the Department of Local Government there is an increased demand of £170,000 for loan charges of housing authorities and of £80,000 towards reducing sanitary service loan charges.  The Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce shows a substantial increase; £616,000 extra is being provided for the bread and food subsidy and I notice that £150,000 is included for grants to new factories.  We were twitted during the general election campaign by our opponents that we were winding up An Fóras Tionscal.  You will note that the Estimate for An Fóras Tionscal is up by £100,000 on last year.  I referred earlier to the £2,053,000 included for transport which arises because of the different nature of financing C.I.E.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> I do not propose to discuss the Estimates as such at any great length. My successor will no doubt discover, and my predecessor who sits beside him will appreciate, that when it comes to the framing of Estimates at the beginning of any financial year the work must be done in three different stages. There is first of all the detailed examination of the Estimates by the Department of Finance in consultation with the outside Departments; there is secondly the discussions that must take place between the Minister for Finance and the outside Ministers; and thirdly there is the wider type of discussion on policy that must take place among the Government of the day.  In relation to these Estimates, circumstances which precipitated the general election meant that it was impossible to have all these examinations of the Estimates as they came in from the outside Department.  Because all concerned were engaged with the general election, it was not possible to have a discussion between outside Ministers and the Minister for Finance, nor was it possible that the Government would be in a position to sit down and consider those Estimates in the calm and unflurried atmosphere in which Estimates must be considered normally.</P>
    <P>I do not want in any way to decry the work done by the officers of the Department of Finance in their detailed examination of the Estimates. Far be it from me to do that.  I would like to put on record, on this the first opportunity on leaving the Department of Finance, that I could not have received more loyal service or greater co-operation than I did receive and I can certainly say that my successor is lucky in the staff he has in the Department of Finance to aid him in his labours.</P>
    <P>However, detailed examination by departmental officials can never be the same as the examination in relation to wider policy, perhaps, and in wider spheres, by the Ministers concerned. The Government of which I had the honour to be a member had taken a certain decision in relation to this Book of Estimates.  The present Taoiseach will find that on 2nd November last, the Government decided that, in relation to the non-capital <Col N="83" /> services which were to be included in the Book of Estimates, the provision was to be framed on the basis that they should not exceed a total sum of £94,500,000.  The general election prevented us continuing and completing our examination of those Estimates on the second and third bases I mentioned.  It was quite obvious to me as Minister for Finance when the election became imminent that it would be impossible to make such an examination and accordingly I gave a direction that the Estimates were to be printed, and I approved the Estimates for printing as and when they came after the departmental examination, without examination by the Government or by the Ministers. We, however, have nailed our colours to the mast.  We took that decision, which is there on the records, that the Estimates for Publec Services for the year ending 31st March, 1958, should be on the basis that the provision of non-capital services should not exceed a sum of £94,500,000.</P>
    <P>If we had not been prevented by the election, we would have been in a position, by means of the second and third methods I have indicated, to reduce those Estimates in accordance with that decision.  I want, however, to be perfectly fair by saying that that figure of £94,500,000 should have added to it the £2,053,000 for the Transport Services to which I have referred, as it is again a question of comparing like with like.  There is ample scope now for the new Minister to implement that policy, if he so wishes.  We are giving him this Vote on Account now to spend a sum not exceeding so much. It is not a mandatory instruction on him to spend the amount that is included in the Vote on Account.  He is at liberty to spend a sum, if he so desires, which is roughly, as he says himself, one third of the amount for four months on the basis of that book. He has the whole of that period of four months to settle himself in and decide exactly what policy he wants to implement, to decide exactly how he proposes to bring down the expenditure to whatever amount he considers may be necessary or may be desirable for the coming year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> Let me be perfectly clear, therefore, that in so far as we are concerned, we are giving him this Vote on the basis that it is a sum which he may not exceed, that it is a sum within the framework of which he has his own policy which he can implement with the power that is now vested in him. As regards the general financial policy of the Minister, this is not the time, as he says, to discuss it.  We shall have that opportunity on the Budget. I think when the out-turn of the current year comes to be made he will find the estimate I made in the Budget of the amount which it would be necessary to borrow, £37,100,000, will not be required and that the total borrowings will not reach that order.</P>
    <P>It is, however, proper to-day that I should indicate some other parts of the more general picture into which this estimated expenditure fits.  The most important matter of all for our economic position is in relation to the balance of payments.  There can be no hope of real progress unless our balance of payments is in order and particularly unless we are not imposing an undue strain on our balance of payments for consumption purposes. Repatriation of external assets for the purpose of creating new productive capital assets is an entirely different situation.  The Minister can start now in his first week of office with the knowledge that he has not got to face any serious difficulties on the immediate balance of payments front.  The 11 months to the end of last February show a reduction of £34,500,000 on our external trade.  Exports show an increase of £8,500,000 in that period of which £6,200,000 are in this year.</P>
    <P>We knew full well the dire results that continued and prolonged deficits in our balance of payments would have on the whole national economy, on our whole standard of living and particularly on our ability to purchase abroad the raw materials we required for industry.  The measures we have taken in that respect have had their results. They have enabled the present Minister to take office with the knowledge that he has, as we had in the last month of our time, the assurance that we are not going to run into the balance <Col N="85" /> of payments difficulties which obtruded themselves before.</P>
    <P>The Minister can take office now with the assurance that for the first time, contemporaneously with the capital programme, he is not going to have those problems.  I say deliberately &ldquo;contemporaneously with the capital programme&rdquo; because it is obvious that any capital programme, however productive it may be, will create an immediate draw on our external reserves for payments which will not be met until such time as the works for which these capital moneys were necessary have come into profitable production.</P>
    <P>The basis has been laid on which he can now plan for the future.  Indeed, if he does nothing but allow the plan which we have laid in that respect to ride along, he will find the plums falling into his lap one after the other.  He will find the rise in exports will not merely move on, but will be accentuated, unless he does anything to stop them.  He will find the disastrous change in the terms of trade which occurred between 1953 and 1956, is gradually moving in the other direction. I hope sincerely it will continue so to move, but I want to say that the terms of trade are something that not one of us, on either side of the House, can alter to any degree.  If those terms disimprove, I will not lay the blame for that disimprovement at the feet of the present Minister.</P>
    <P>I believe we are facing a position in which the terms of trade are at least going to flatten out and we are not going to find the position with which we were faced in 1956.  Between 1953 and 1956, import prices rose by 5 per cent. and export prices fell by 3 per cent.&mdash;an 8 per cent. difference adversely on the terms of trade was what we had to face in 1956. If there had been no price changes between those two years, the import excess in 1956 would have been £6,500,000 less even than it was.  In fact, because of the change, it was £5,000,000 more.  We were, therefore, in the situation in 1956, in which we had to face £11,500,000 of a deficit in <Col N="86" /> the balance of payments problem because of price changes alone.  There is some evidence that the turn of the tide may be coming now.  I hope it is, for the sake of the country, but the Minister will find, having regard to the equilibrium we established on that front, with adverse terms of trade, a considerably easier problem now if he does not change the plans which have been laid down by us.</P>
    <P>If he turns to the monetary situation, he will find that since 30th June, 1956, bank deposits increased by £11,900,000 and that they increased still further in January.  In the ten months to January 31st, he will find in small savings an increase which I agree was not much, but which showed the trend was in the right direction.  He will also find that, for the first two months this year, the external reserves of the commercial banks have risen and that if he does not unduly draw for the public sector on those reserves, there will be an adequate expansion available for private enterprise.  I would particularly urge on him that he should make sure that his policy in relation to the public sector of our finances will not involve such a squeeze on those reserves that there will not be adequate funds for private enterprise.</P>
    <P>He will find, too, that it was part of my belief that, in our present circumstances, we should have the largest capital Budget for productive purposes that the public would support, that it would be obviously desirable in our present times that that step should be taken.  If the Minister for Finance and the Government turn to the question of prices, they will find that between mid-August, 1947, and mid-November, 1956, prices rose by only 34 per cent., while, in Britain, between mid-June, 1947, and mid-November, 1956, prices here rose by 58 per cent.&mdash;only  one-third rise here; over 50 per cent. rise there.  No matter to what part of the economy he turns, he will find that the basis was laid by us during 1956, upon which a Government, carrying out our policy, will be able to obtain adequate resourses.  He can even turn to unemployment in which every year the peak has always been reached in the week of the 4th February.  From that week in 1954 to the 16th March <Col N="87" /> last&mdash;the latest date for which figures are available&mdash;and I have deliberately chosen that year as Fianna Fáil's last year in office&mdash;unemployment dropped from the peak by 5,159.  This year, it has dropped 9,452 from the peak of the 4th February and it has dropped because the plans that we had laid were coming into operation and were beginning to be effective.</P>
    <P>I will not pretend that it is not perhaps somewhat galling for us to see the Deputies over there, as Ministers, reaping the reward of the measure that we took.  Regardless of that, it is not what Deputies on one side of the House or the other may feel but what will affect the country that matters.  The Government has got the right basis on which the economy can now be run and on which there can be future plans, with a solid balance of payments situation, with the monetary situation in hand, production on the increase and unemployment on the decrease.  Do not change that and we will give you any help, but if you stray away from the policies which we put into effect, somebody else will have to come in and do the job.</P>

      <P>One point to which I should like to draw attention is one mentioned by the former Minister for Finance in connection with the Estimate for Defence.  Deputy Sweetman suggests that the former Fianna Fáil Government was responsible for the purchase of jet planes and for the money spent on the construction of the runways.  The point I want to bring home is that a certain saving can be made even at this stage in so far as those jet planes are concerned. It is admitted by all experts that the jet planes which we have are now completely obsolete.</P>

It has been noticed in recent months that a number of tragic deaths have taken place in our Air Force and the public are perturbed at this loss of lives.  It has come to my notice that this loss of life is due in great measure to the lack of a proper communications system between the planes and the ground control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not have intervened in this debate were it not for the speech made by Deputy Sweetman, the Minister for Finance in the inter-Party Government.  I rise to say that I regret very much that I cannot take the same rosy view of the future as he does.  The problem to which he has referred has not been solved, the balance of payments as a danger to our economy still remains.  The Deputy must know that a very large part of the immediate balance which has been achieved has been achieved by the running down of stocks.  The Deputy must know also what is likely to be the out-turn of the Budget for the coming year and the problems which have to be faced next year.  I was listening to the Minister for Industry and Commerce speaking about the position of C.I.E. where there has been built up a deficit in revenue on the cash side of almost £1,000,000 which will have to be liquidated at some stage or another, just <Col N="89" /> as we had in the Budget of 1952 to provide for the liquidation of the fuel stocks which had been carried forward until the cash deficit amounted to between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000.</P>
      <P>I listened with amazement to Deputy Sweetman when he referred to the year 1956.  It was a grave and serious position, all right.  We had a balance of payments deficit of the sum of £35,000,000.  What, however, was the position in 1951 when the balance of payments deficit was running at the rate of £62,000,000 and that in a year which had been immediately preceded by another year in which the balance of payments deficit&mdash;if my recollection is correct&mdash;was running at the order of £31.5 million?  So that in two years the deficit on our balance of payments amounted to almost £94,000,000.  That was a grave and serious situation with which we had to deal in 1951 and 1952. And to complicate the position we found that, when the Budget for 1951 had been introduced, there were several items for which provision ought to have been made, but for which provision was not made; so that the Budget of that year closed with a deficit of between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000.  I am speaking from recollection and without having resort to any written figures.</P>
      <P>One of the major causes of that deficit was the fact that my predecessor&mdash;Deputy McGilligan, who had been Minister for Finance in the year 1951 &mdash;had received a Civil Service Arbitration award covering almost £3,500,000 &mdash;I am speaking from recollection&mdash;for  which no provision was made in the Budget and for which we had to provide during that year out of borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, when we came to the Budget of 1952, a Budget in which effect was given to the common acceptance on both sides of the House of the principles of the social welfare scheme and to which continuing effect had to be given to the proposals to increase the rates of the old age pension, we found that there was a gap between revenue and expenditure of over £15,000,000 which had to be faced.  We faced that in the 1952 Budget.  I want to concede all the credit that is due to <Col N="90" /> Deputy Sweetman, for whom I had a great deal of admiration, when he was Minister for Finance, but I do not want the country to believe for a moment that because there is a temporary balance secured on our external payments and because there has been evidence of a favourable change, which the Minister knows may be temporary or of long duration, in the terms of trade our problems have been by any means solved and that we are not going to require from our people a great deal more effort and, I am afraid, a measure of self sacrifice which we hope will be forthcoming, such as we were able to count upon during the economic war and during the last war. It is only when we get that measure of co-operation from the people and from all Parties in the House that we shall be able to place the economy of this nation again on a sound basis.</P>

      <P>I do not think I have very much to say because my colleague has dealt with some of the points raised by Deputy Sweetman.  I should like to say that for the three or four days I have been in the Department of Finance, I have been very curious delving into the situation with regard to the balance of payments, the capital Budget and the non-capital Budget. For these three or four days, the first ray of hope I got was from Deputy Sweetman's speech.  It was encouraging and I sincerely hope there was something in it.  I hope that when I go back and delve into those figures again, I may look upon them in a different light.</P>

      <P>I put this very simple question to the Minister to-day in connection with a number of young men who are imprisoned at the present time.  The question was whether the Minister was prepared to release them and the Minister's answer was in the negative.  I felt personally that, in view of the fact that this Government was just taking office, it would be a grand thing if all could start off with a clean sheet, that it would be a grand gesture on the part of the new Government to release these young men and that, by taking this action, they would be able to create and build up an immense fund of goodwill amongst our people generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this point to the Minister to-day and I regret very much that he did not agree with it.  Apparently, the Minister took the view, according to his own remarks, that I should have directed my remarks to those young men who are in prison.  He said that &ldquo;we&rdquo;&mdash;meaning the Government&mdash;&ldquo;are  quite prepared to submit the ways and means to these young men.&rdquo; I am at a loss to understand what the Minister meant to convey by that <Col N="93" /> statement, but I feel sure that he will enlighten me in the course of his reply this evening.  If it means what can be taken out of it on its face, the ordinary interpretation, then I am not prepared to accept that.  It would mean that these young men would be asked, I presume, to sign certain documents, give certain guarantees and make certain admissions, before they would be released.  I think that is a line which has been adopted by the British Government with Archbishop Makarios.  These young men, in the opinion of many members of this House, are misguided; yet they have pride and they have idealism, and it is a wrong way to go about changing their views by suggesting to them that they must crawl now before the powers that have office.</P>
    <P>We know that these young men have been imprisoned under various sections of the Offences Against the State Act, but it is not my intention, in the short time available to me, to deal with some of the sections under which these young men have been imprisoned. It should suffice to say that at least one of the sections under which action has been taken is a section for which no comparable section can be found in any legislation in any free country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely mention it, Sir, to point out that it is under certain sections of that legislation that we have seen fit to imprison these young men.  However, it is not the legislation I propose to deal with on this Adjournment debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell me bluntly whether he believes that these young men are criminals.  I would like any Deputy to tell me straight out here whether it is his belief that these young men who are imprisoned, these Republican prisoners, are criminals.  I do not believe that it is suggested by any Deputy.  I think that the furthest any Deputy or indeed anybody outside the House is prepared to go in describing them is to say they are misguided young men. I am not talking about other people <Col N="94" /> who may be shadows in the background; I am talking simply and solely about those young individuals themselves.  I say they are young idealists who are prepared to sacrifice their lives and that under no circumstances should they be put in the category of criminals.</P>
    <P>If all Deputies accept that viewpoint, it is not unfair to suggest at this stage that goodwill be shown towards them and that the olive branch be held out to them.  Surely it is a nicer way to deal with the problem and a more practical way to do so rather than to wield the big stick over their heads and threaten them? Is it not a well-known fact, wherever you have spirited youth, if you wish to get the best from them, you get it by persuasion and encouragement and that you never get it by using the big stick or threats?  That is precisely what is being done to-day with the youth of the country&mdash;the big stick is being used.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make this an issue. I want to see this problem solved with goodwill all round.  I have given great consideration to this matter for a long time and I am speaking now as perhaps one of the younger members of this House who is more in touch with the young people of the country than many of the older men here.  I say that in no spirit of criticism of the older men because I believe the young people will gravitate towards each other more than towards the older generation and it is because I believe that I know the minds of the majority of these young men that I make this plea.  I do not make it for the purpose of causing any worry or any disturbance in the mind of anybody inside or outside the House.  I hope that will be accepted.</P>
    <P>I have said the furthest any Deputy is prepared to go&mdash;and I have listened to some of them talking about the recent activities that took place across the Border&mdash;is that these young men are misguided and they are brave.  The previous Government took the view as far as I can judge it, that, right up to last Christmas, they were prepared to take no action in connection with these activities or in connection with the <Col N="95" /> young men, many of whom are now in jail.  We all know that certain actions did take place across the Border and that nothing was done immediately after these forays&mdash;if you like to describe them as such&mdash;until the British Ambassador paid his State call here in Dublin to our Government.</P>

      <P>All we do know is that immediately the full machinery of the law went into operation and as a result we have these young men in prison to-day.  It is on behalf of these young men that I make a plea to the Minister in this new Government to release them.  I am convinced, and I could not be more sure of anything in my life than this, that these young men were nurtured on the heroic tales of the men who died in 1916.  These young men have studied Irish history <Col N="96" /> as they know it.  They have been through the school books, and through the daily and weekly newspapers they have been given a version of Irish history that would indicate that nothing was ever achieved in this country and that no measure of freedom was ever wrung from Britain except at the point of the gun.</P>
      <P>The type of history lesson that all those young men were taught was that it was necessary to fight Britain with her own weapons, that blood must be spilled if anything was ever to be taken from Britain.  Their belief&mdash;and that is where their teaching and where the example of the past comes to light&mdash;is the very same belief as was held by members of the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael 35 or 40 years ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>These young men take the line they take in the sincere belief that they are following in the footsteps of the men who did great things for this country 35 or 40 years ago.  Is it fair to-day that we should brand them by imprisoning them as we are doing at the moment?  I believe that when you have idealists&mdash;perhaps some of them are fanatics at times&mdash;<Col N="97" /> in a State, the most reasonable way to deal with them is not to persecute them but to try, so far as possible, to give other outlets for the energies that are pent up inside them.</P>
      <P>I think the younger members of this House will agree with me when I say that in the past 15 or 20 years we have seen no practical steps taken to solve Partition.  Perhaps the older Deputies will not agree with that, but so far as younger Deputies and youth outside the House are concerned, their firm belief is that no real effort has been made to end Partition.  When that is the case, is it any wonder that we have a sense of frustration and despair amongst the rising generation to-day? Is it any wonder that, in the cream of the youth that is left after emigration takes its toll, that spirit of despair should find itself channelled into other lines where the energies of the young men concerned will be directed towards achieving&mdash;perhaps by means that this House does not agree with although at least they are sincere in their aim &mdash;the re-unification of our country?</P>
      <P>The stature of this Government would increase if it took the simple step of releasing these prisoners.  The present Taoiseach is quoted, in the course of an interview, as saying that he was in favour of letting the law take its course.  I do not know whether or not he has given great consideration to that matter but I would remind him, as I would remind the present Minister for Defence, that in 1917 a Sinn Féin M. P. was elected for South Longford. As a result of his election, that Sinn Féin M. P.&mdash;Joe McGuinness&mdash;who was in prison at the time was released forthwith by the British Government. It must be understood that, at that time, there was no such thing as political prisoners.  At present, the young men imprisoned here for alleged offences against the State are segregrated from the ordinary prisoners in the different jails but in 1917 there was no difference at all: all prisoners were considered criminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time, Joe McGuinness was released immediately by the British Government when he was elected because the people had spoken.  Surely if, in 1917, when political freedom in <Col N="98" /> that sense was not considered at all, a person was released on his election we can agree now, in 1957, under our own Government that if the people of the different constituencies say by their votes they want a certain man to represent them then, on that basis, we should release the individuals concerned if they happen to be in prison.</P>
    <P>May I put it this way?  The T.D., who is at present in prison, got a tremendous vote in his constituency. For all practical purposes, the Minister might as well say he would go down to Longford-Westmeath and arrest everybody who cast a vote for Rory Brady.  Everybody who cast a vote for Rory Brady did so because they were democratically entitled to do so.  The will of the majority in that constituency spoke in his favour and, as such, he was elected.  If he is wrong then a great many other people in that constituency are wrong as well.</P>
    <P>My approach to this matter is as follows.  First of all, I want to say that, personally, I do not agree with the outlook of men, whether young or old, who fail to recognise this House and its jurisdiction.  Accepting that, I want to make it quite clear to the Minister that I believe that the young men concerned&mdash;I know many of them &mdash;are motivated by the highest of ideals.  I must admit that I can do nothing personally but admire their courage and idealism although I do not agree with the way in which they are going about things.  I have to admire them.  If the matter were in my hands I would deal with the whole problem in a different way.  I cannot go into all that now in the course of this short debate.  Under the circumstances, I appeal to the Minister to look on these men as young idealists and, on that basis, to release them as a gesture of goodwill so that the new Dáil can start off with a clean sheet and perhaps good things will come as a result of what has happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will find in due course that trying to sit on two stools is a dangerous pastime.  He must surely realise that what he is advocating here this evening is what he calls the rights of the people concerned in his question <Col N="99" /> as against the rights of this Parliament which governs the affair of the State.  He was anxious to know what I meant when I referred to the ways and means which were there for these young men to secure their own release. There is a form which they are asked to sign if they desire to be released. There would be nothing dishonourable in their signing that form if they were not members of an illegal organisation. I am wondering if the Deputy considers that that illegal organisation has a right to operate in this State where we have a Constitution which these people refuse to recognise, a Parliament which they refuse to recognise and an Army which they refuse to recognise.</P>
      <P>There can be only one Army in the State and that shall be the Army which has been established by this Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy suggested that these men would have to crawl. We are not asking them to crawl.  The Deputy himself said that he would spurn the form in question.  That, I think, shows his attitude generally to this situation.  I feel that the Deputy has done a disservice to the State by the speech which he has just made. He practically advocated the right of certain individuals to refuse to recognise the laws of this country.  That cannot, in any circumstances, be subscribed to by any member of this House.  Every member of the House is equal before the law and amongst the many privileges which Deputies enjoy, that is one privilege to which they are not entitled&mdash;the privilege of being above the law.  That is what the Deputy is suggesting when he more or less says that the member who is in prison and who was elected in the last General Election should be released forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to enter into controversy with the Deputy on the question of the prisoner who was released in Longford very many years ago, but I think he will find, on examination, <Col N="100" /> that his statement is wrong and that the prisoner was not released when he was elected.  He was released at a later date in what might be described as a general release of those men who had been sentenced to penal servitude.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's statement that no action was taken until the British Ambassador came over here is, I believe, a garbled version of his own of the mission of the gentleman concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad if the Deputy would use his influence to convince the people on whose behalf he is speaking of the futility of the actions they are taking at the present time. We are endeavouring to preserve the peace that exists in this nation.  We are not attempting to wage war on any person; we are not attempting to deprive anyone, who is not in conflict with the law, of his rights and liberties; but when any individual comes into conflict with the law, then he must be dealt with and that is what has been happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is challenging members of the House&mdash;it seems to me almost like felon setting&mdash;to call these young men criminals.  No member of the House wants to call any young idealist a criminal, but we can at least say that they are foolish and are in conflict with the law.  Because they are in conflict with the law, they must be dealt with.  Does the Deputy want this Government or any other Government to sit down and do nothing?  Does he want us to allow these people to have the freedom to do the things they want to do?  Does he want them to have the right to use this State as a spring board for attacks on another portion of the country?  I do not think he does, but that is what he would appear <Col N="101" /> to be advocating.  We must get points of that kind made clear.  It gives me no pleasure and I am sure it gives no members of the Government any pleasure&mdash;no more than it would have given pleasure to any member of the former Government to have to deal with matters of this kind, but when we are confronted with them, they must be met and they must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan would be very <Col N="102" /> well advised to use whatever influence he possesses to get these young men to desist from the attitude they have been adopting.  As far as this Government is concerned, it will be our task to see that peace is preserved and I will endeavour to share in the responsibility of ensuring that that is done.</P>
