    <P>(a)  Grants towards the deficits of voluntary hospitals in the City of Dublin, in common with grants for capital and other purposes to voluntary and local authority hospitals generally, are paid from the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  During the financial years 1953-54 to 1956-57 the ordinary income of that Fund was not sufficient to meet the outgoings, and it was necessary to supplement the income by subventions from the Exchequer, which in the four years amounted to £6,780,000.  The issues from the Fund in respect of deficit grants to Dublin City hospitals during those years are shown in the tabular statement which, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose, with your permission, to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>(b)  The accounting year of the hospitals participating in the scheme for deficit grants from the Hospitals' Trust Fund is the calendar year.  The total deficits of all the participating voluntary hospitals for the years 1955, 1945 and 1935 were, respectively, £958,825, £240,510 and £73,762.</P>

      <P>The figures in the table do not include the cost of medicines for health authority patients treated in extern institutions since such cost is merged in a flat capitation payment and the amount is not ascertainable.</P>
      <P>The Disabled Persons (Maintenance) Allowances first became payable on 1st October, 1954, on which date subsection (5) of Section 56 of the Health Act, 1953 was brought into operation. Consequently there was no expenditure on this service in 1953-54.</P>

      <P>It is not yet possible to state the actual expenditure as the account for the year is not yet closed but it is estimated that there will be a saving of the order of £535,000.  Of this £500,000 occurs on the sub-head for grants to the Hospitals' Trust Fund and most of the balance on the sub-head for grants to health authorities.  These savings arose mainly out of the decision taken last year to achieve economies in public expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The financial year 1956-57 had less than a fortnight to run when the present Government assumed office on the 20th March.  When the year's accounts, <Col N="934" /> which are summarised in the first of the tables in the hands of Deputies, were made up, they showed a deficit on current account of £5.95 million.  Of this deficit £4½ million arose because revenue failed to come up to expectations and £1½ million because expenditure exceeded the budgetary provision made by my predecessor.  The allowance for Supplementary Estimates proved to be inadequate.</P>
      <P Just="Center">2.  CAPITAL ACCOUNT, 1956-57</P>
      <P>To the deficit of almost £6 million on current account must be added the new borrowing necessary to cover public capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>As Table II shows, public capital outlay, including the expenditure of Dublin and Cork Corporations, the Electricity Supply Board and Córas Iompair Éireann, amounted to over £40 million.  This was found as to £8½ million by re-issuing the capital repayments made to the Exchequer and Local Loans Fund and by using the moneys available in the Capital Fund. A further £2¾ million was borrowed by local authorities and other public bodies from non-Exchequer sources such as banks and insurance companies. The balance of £29 million had to be found as new borrowing by the Exchequer.  When this sum is added to the deficit of £6 million on current account the total gap which had to be filled by direct Exchequer borrowing was £35 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise how this money was raised.  Contrary to what one might expect, the savings directly contributed by the public, through Savings Bank deposits, purchases of Savings Certificates, investments in National Loans and Prize Bonds, did not supply all or even most of the borrowed money.  Their total contribution in the financial year amounted, in fact, to only £15.3 million, or considerably less than half the total.  That low proportion is at the root of our financial problem.  It is evident that direct public support in the form of savings has not been sufficient to enable national development to be continued on its recent scale.  In these circumstances there can be no justification for allowing a deficit in the Current Budget to swallow up resources <Col N="935" /> which are sorely needed for capital purposes, resources which, even if fully reserved for those purposes, would still be inadequate in relation to our development needs.</P>
    <P>The deficiency in public savings last year was made up in two ways.  Approximately £9.3 million was obtained from the banks and over £10 million from Departmental Funds, partly from investment income but mainly from sales of securities.  The full picture is given in Table III.</P>
    <P>The sale of external securities of Departmental Funds so that the proceeds could be lent to the Exchequer has made available £30 million for public capital purposes since 1951-52. The position has now been reached, however, that we can no longer draw on that source to any material extent since we must continue to keep an adequate reserve of readily available funds against our liabilities to small savers.</P>
    <P>The banks provided over £9 million directly to meet State capital needs last year, apart from lending on overdraft for capital purposes to various local authorities and public utilities. Indeed, during the six years just ended, they have provided capital for public requirements to a total of the order of £40 million, mostly at the expense of their sterling assets.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that an important source of finance for the capital requirements of 1956-57 was the Capital Fund, to which is credited the revenue from the Special Import Levies.  The levies serve the double purpose of restricting imports and diverting purchasing power towards meeting capital requirements. They yielded £4¼ million of revenue for capital purposes in 1956-57, an amount which otherwise would have had to be borrowed.  Unfortunately, their efficacy in reducing the deficit on capital account was nullified by the deficit of nearly £6 million on current account. There has been a striking, and very welcome, improvement in the trade position in recent months but some further time must elapse before the continuance of that improvement can <Col N="936" /> be regarded as assured.  Even with the levies in full operation our external payments have been barely in balance for the financial year 1956-57.  Our capital shortage is still acute and the levies are a reliable and necessary supplement to capital resources.  These are two good reasons why it would be unwise to discard them as yet.  That does not mean that the Government intend to insist rigidly on maintaining them.  On the contrary, the substantial exemptions and concessions already granted, involving a net loss of about £1¾ million of revenue this year, are evidence that the Government are prepared to modify the incidence of the levies where, on balance, the production and employment position, or the public interest generally, is best served by so doing.</P>
    <P Just="Center">3.  FINANCIAL YEAR, 1956-57&mdash;SUMMARY</P>
    <P>To sum up as regards 1956-57, the picture we get from Tables I, II and III is that current revenue fell short of expenditure by £6 million.  To cover this deficit and the requirements of the capital programme, a total of £35 million had to be borrowed by the Exchequer.  In round terms, £15 million was contributed directly by the public and £10 million each by the banks and Departmental Funds.</P>
    <P Just="Center">4.  FINANCIAL YEAR, 1957-58&mdash;INTRODUCTION</P>
    <P>The budgetary problem of 1957-58, on both capital and current account, is one of exceeding difficulty.  Since taking office the Government have had only a short time to review the national economic position.  I would like to emphasise, therefore, that while the budgetary proposals I am now putting before the House are intended to deal with some of the immediate problems, the matter cannot rest there. Our economic situation as a whole must receive continuous and careful study.  On the financial side, I have particularly in mind the examination of public expenditure with a view to achieving all possible economies and re-directing resources to more immediately productive purposes.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="937" />5.  CURRENT ACCOUNT, 1957-58</P>
    <P>With regard to the Current Budget for 1957-58, our starting-point is the deficit of nearly £6 million which emerged on current account in last year's budget.  The estimates for noncapital Supply Services as prepared by the previous Government are almost £5 million higher than actual expenditure in 1956-57.  This, of itself, would widen the deficit to £11 million.  Nor is this all.  The estimates for the Central Fund Services which must be met out of ordinary revenue show an increase of £1½ million over actual expenditure last year, an increase attributable to the growth in debt service charges.  This growth is inevitable in view of the steady and substantial annual increase in the national debt.</P>
    <P>Towards closing this gap of almost £12½ million we can expect a moderate increase in tax revenue&mdash;less than £2 million&mdash;at existing rates of tax. Customs duties are expected to show some buoyancy but income-tax, which depends on last year's profits, will be affected by the recession in trade and industry in 1956.  Non-tax revenue is expected to increase by almost £1½ million.</P>
    <P>As the White Paper published a few days ago disclosed, the estimated revenue, tax and non-tax, available for current purposes, other than the Road Fund, is £111.9 million, by comparison with an estimated current expenditure of £120.9 million.  The deficit to be met, therefore, is no less a sum than £9 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">6.  CAPITAL ACCOUNT, 1957-58</P>
    <P>The principle of balancing at the lowest possible level, which applies with full force to the Current Budget, is not applicable to the Capital Budget.  Here other considerations apply, such as the desirability of making maximum headway with works of national development and of preserving a high level of employment in the creation of durable and productive assets.  The fact must also be faced that at any given moment the scale of public capital outlay is largely predetermined by commitments.  Contracts <Col N="938" /> have been entered into; work is in progress; the withdrawal of funds at an intermediate point could be wasteful. In my view, the national interest requires the maximum of productive development, public and private, in the years immediately ahead.  As regards the public capital programme, I believe that the aim should be not a reduction, unless that should be forced on us by the inadequacy of public support, but rather a reshaping of the programme so as to make it more directly productive.</P>
    <P>The public capital programme for 1957-58 is set out in Table IV.  The Exchequer borrowing which may be necessary to cover that programme is £31 million.  Although this is less than the £35 million borrowed last year&mdash; £29 million for capital and £6 million for current account&mdash;it is still a very large sum.  It calls for a much bigger contribution from the public, through small savings and loan subscriptions, because the special aid provided by Departmental Funds last year cannot be repeated.</P>
    <P>Although the problem of financing capital outlay on the present scale is extremely difficult, I am not without hope that the difficulty may in time be lessened.  I believe that an increase in private savings may be expected; there is no doubt that it is vitally needed. The great success of the Prize Bonds issue&mdash;an enterprise on which I congratulate my predecessor&mdash;and the recent upward trend in savings are most encouraging.  No matter what the increase in savings, every penny will be needed to support capital development, private and public, and the employment it provides.  Nothing can be wasted in the financing of a deficit in the Current Budget.</P>
    <P Just="Center">7.  ECONOMIES</P>
    <P>A glance at some of the major items responsible for the estimated increase in expenditure on the non-capital Supply Services is sufficient to show the difficulty of making significant economies.  Many of the increases are inevitable, being the result of the rising level of loan charges and similar statutory commitments.  In other cases economies can be effected only at the expense of employment.  Industrial <Col N="939" /> grants payable under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, and the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, account for an estimated additional expenditure of over £400,000.  There is an increased current charge of £1.4 million for Córas Iompair Éireann.  Public works and buildings account for an increase of almost £¼ million.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be taken as advocating the maintenance of State expenditure at a high level simply to provide employment.  On the contrary, the aim must constantly be to ensure to the utmost extent that the employment given is both necessary and productive. Until alternative employment of a productive character becomes available, however, there should be some hesitation to make economies which would have a widespread effect in reducing employment.</P>
    <P>It is only too clear that we cannot carry through a public capital programme on the scale envisaged in Table IV and at the same time support the level of current expenditure contemplated in this year's published Estimates.  Economies must, therefore, be sought and achieved.</P>
    <P>In the short time available since the Government took office it would obviously have been impossible to examine critically and justly all the objects of expenditure of the taxpayer's money.  The searching out of wasteful or unnecessary expenditure and its elimination will require keen and continuous attention.  But the urgency and difficulty of our budgetary problem this year required that a start should be made at once.  I shall mention a number of specific economies which have already been decided upon but which represent merely an instalment of what the Government hope in time to achieve.</P>
    <P>It will be no surprise that I should begin with the administrative machine.  The present annual cost of the Civil Service, Gárda Síochána and the Defence Forces amounts in round figures to £25 million&mdash;almost £17 million for the Civil Service, over £3½ million for the Gárda Síochána and nearly £5 million for the Army.  I refer, of course, to remuneration only.</P>
    <P>When the cost of administration is <Col N="940" /> complained of, it is in particular the cost of the Civil Service which the critics have in mind.  There are almost 32,000 Civil Servants, of whom about half are employed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Numbers rather than scales of pay account for the high cost of the Civil Service. Roughly three-fourths of the Civil Servants are in receipt of salaries not exceeding £600 a year.  An annual bill of £17 million for the pay of Civil Servants is, however, too much for a country of our size and resources.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service itself has been concentrating for quite a while on organisation and methods studies. Useful results have been achieved but the total cost of administration none the less remains too high.  The abolition of certain services would, of course, yield economies but specific proposals in this direction rarely commend themselves to the public, however much a general reduction in costs of administration may be desired.  Work could, however, be expedited and expense reduced if delegation of duties were extended and the appropriate degree of responsibility were fully accepted and exercised at all levels of the Civil Service.  The existing Civil Service structure seems too elaborate for our needs.  The grading system is, to my mind, unduly complex.  I intend that these matters will be examined and radical changes made which will, I believe, ultimately produce worthwhile economies.</P>
    <P>To secure immediate savings, I have directed that recruitment be forthwith reduced to a minimum, that posts be suppressed at every available opportunity and that overtime be drastically curtailed.  I am satisfied that action even on these lines will produce a saving of at least £250,000 in the current year and I am taking that saving into account in framing my Budget.</P>
    <P>By the adoption of the most modern methods a reduction in Garda strength has been effected.  Every opportunity of further advances in this direction will be availed of consistent with the maintenance of a fully effective force.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the Defence <Col N="941" /> Forces is one which requires special consideration in the light of changing circumstances but an immediate small economy is possible which, with minor savings elsewhere, should yield £100,000 this year.</P>
    <P>A fundamental re-examination of the activities of the Land Commission is being initiated.  Such a review is clearly necessary.  The social and economic changes revealed in the evidence presented to the Emigration Commission and in recent censuses and again in the Farm Survey strongly suggest that the policy originally devised in 1923, and revised in 1933, should now be reconsidered.  Farming organisations and other groups interested in securing greater production have been making various proposals which will be examined in detail. Meanwhile, there will be no expansion of the operations of the Land Commission and I hope to save at least £80,000 of the provision made in this year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Government have reached the conclusion that the benefit to the State from the operations of the Irish News Agency has not been commensurate with the cost of the Agency to public funds.  As soon, therefore, as arrangements can be completed, the Irish News Agency will be wound up and payments from the Vote terminated.  In view of existing contractual commitments, however, there may be no net saving for some time.</P>
    <P>At a time when national production is not increasing and when ordinary revenue is not keeping pace with current expenditure the rising deficits in voluntary hospitals and the growing cost of health services are a cause of concern.  The Minister for Health proposes to introduce legislation which will enable him to make economies in the cost of the health services by moderate increases in certain charges and the imposition of some new charges.  It is proposed to increase from 6/&ndash; to 10/&ndash; a day the maximum charge for institutional treatment and also to introduce small charges for specialist and for X-ray services.  None of these charges will apply to persons in the lower income group.  By these modifications it is hoped to save about <Col N="942" /> £90,000 in a full year.  A similar saving will accrue to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The various specific economies I have mentioned will produce a saving of at least £½ million in the current year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">8.  OVER-ESTIMATION</P>
    <P>It is customary each year to take account at Budget time of the &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; savings which usually accrue in addition to specific economies, however closely the Vote provisions are estimated. The allowance made at Budget time last year was £3 million; the actual saving by reference to the total sum voted amounted to £3.16 million. Looking back over the past seven or eight years.  I find that the average saving has been of this order.  I am, therefore, counting this year on a general overestimation, as distinct from specific economies, of £3 million. I might add that I intend to make as great a contribution as I can to the realisation of this estimate by securing further specific reductions in current outlay during the year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">9.  SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS</P>
    <P>Certain supplementary provisions must, however, be made if the budget is to be realistic.  For example, the former Government, though they agreed to implement the Liston Award, made no provision in the Estimates for this payment to secondary teachers.  The present Government have decided to give full effect to the arbitration award and this will necessitate a supplementary provision of almost £½ million.</P>
    <P>The Estimates prepared by the previous Government showed a reduction in the amount provided for Employment and Emergency Schemes.  It was not possible to regard this as a justifiable or feasible reduction in view of the degree of unemployment which still persists and, despite the height at which public capital expenditure is being maintained, I have agreed to supplement the Vote provision by £250,000 so as to allow the Special Employment Schemes Office greater flexibility in arranging for the shortterm relief of unemployment in particular areas.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the 1956 <Col N="943" /> wheat crop was harvested under very unfavourable conditions with the result that in some areas the grain was of poor quality.  It became necessary to make special arrangements to take the wheat from the farmers to prevent a large part of it becoming a total loss. The then Minister for Industry and Commerce urged millers to accept all potentially millable wheat, even though partially sprouted, and gave them an assurance that appropriate quantities of imported wheat would be made available to provide a suitable grist. The present grist consists of two parts native wheat and one part imported. Even increasing the proportion of native wheat at this stage may still leave a surplus of native wheat to be brought forward to the new cereal year starting on 1st September next. In view of the expected large acreage of wheat coming forward this year, it would be impracticable to carry over the existing surplus for conversion into flour during the next cereal year.  The Government have decided to authorise the disposal of a large part of this surplus as animal feed.  The receipts from sales of animal feed will involve a loss of about £150,000 which will have to be met from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Another item for which provision was not made in the original Estimates arises from the following circumstances. In accordance with a Labour Court award, bakery wages were increased by 10% as from 12th September, 1955.  Relief for this extra expenditure was allowed later to master bakers but with effect only from 30th July, 1956.  The Flour and Bread Committee have recommended in their final report that retrospective relief should also be given to the master bakers in respect of the period from 12th September, 1955, to 30th July, 1956.  Public faith was pledged in persuading the master bakers to pay the extra wages and the Government have decided that the master bakers are in equity entitled to retrospective relief for the period mentioned.  The amount involved is about £230,000 and arrangements will be made to pay this sum from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Flour and Bread Committee made a further recommendation for the <Col N="944" /> granting of retrospective relief to bakers in respect of deficiency in profits but in the existing state of the Exchequer the Government are unable to accept this recommendation.</P>
    <P>With a view to promoting the expansion of production and exports I propose to make three further provisions not covered by the published Estimates.</P>
    <P>I propose to make available for the benefit of the sea and inland fisheries an additional sum of approximately £50,000.  Of this sum, £45,000 will be used to erect an ice plant at Dunmore East and to provide additional fishing boats.  The balance of £5,000 is being made available to the Inland Fisheries Trust in the form of a grant to meet the cost of improvements to inland fisheries and additional expenditure on the Trust's fish farm.</P>
    <P>The future of our cattle trade is so important that I am including provision for increased expenditure on the elimination of tubercular cattle under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order, 1926, in those parts of the country to which the new intensive scheme does not yet apply.  By this means, it is hoped to remove major sources of infection in advance of the extension throughout the country of intensive measures.  Increased compensation will be payable in respect of animals slaughtered under the 1926 Order and additional outlay in this respect is estimated at £100,000 in the present year.</P>
    <P>The non-tax revenue for the current year includes a substantial nonrecurrent receipt, on the basis of which I am setting aside £250,000 for the general purpose of improving the marketing of agricultural produce.  I have in mind not only a thorough investigation of possible openings in foreign markets but a careful study of such changes as may be necessary to suit consumer requirements in those markets and the making of domestic arrangements which will best ensure increased production at an economic cost.  The Minister for Agriculture will have early consultation with appropriate bodies so that effect may be given to these intentions.</P>
    <P>The Government are resolved to resist any further additions to the <Col N="945" /> year's commitments.  It would, however, be unwise to ignore the possibility of unforeseen contingencies arising.  The allowance made for such contingencies in each of the last four years has been £750,000 but it has never been adequate.  I am allotting a somewhat larger sum this year&mdash; £950,000&mdash;which, with the items I have already specified, entails a total supplementary provision for current services of £2½ million approximately.</P>
    <P Just="Center">10. DEFICIT ON CURRENT ACCOUNT</P>
    <P>These adjustments of the White Paper figures, namely, the deduction of £3½ million for specific and general economies, offset by an allowance of £2½ million for supplementary provisions, reduce the opening deficit on current account of £9 million to £8 million.</P>
    <P>I have already made it clear that the country cannot afford any deficit on current account.  The need for productive development to raise our living standards, to provide a livelihood for a larger population and to stem the steady flow of emigration is too great and too urgent for a policy of drift to be tolerated in our public finances.  The principle of the balanced Budget has been fully accepted by every Minister for Finance who has sat in these benches.  This year I am resolved that it will be put fully into practice.  That is the minimum requirement of the situation and on it this year's Budget is based.</P>
    <P Just="Center">11. TAXABLE CAPACITY</P>
    <P>Faced with the necessity of eliminating a prospective deficit of £8 million on current account, I had the alternatives of increasing taxation or reducing expenditure.  The main supports of the revenue cannot bear much greater weight without sagging under the strain.  Last year revenue fell short of the budgetary estimates under virtually every head.  We have almost reached the point of diminishing returns and, even in the case of those dutiable commodities which have been most buoyant in the past, we must now go cautiously for fear of exhausting their capacity.  Having carefully <Col N="946" /> surveyed the possibilities, I was forced to the conclusion that the most I could raise this year by way of increased taxation was something in the region of £3 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">12. CAPITAL INVESTMENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE REPORT</P>
    <P>Further economies in current expenditure must, therefore, be secured so that we may live within our income.</P>
    <P>In this context the advice offered to the previous Government by the Capital Investment Advisory Committee is of great relevance and importance.  The Committee envisaged not merely that current outgoings should be balanced by current revenue but also that current revenue should be used on a large scale to meet public capital expenditure. The Committee, in particular, recommended the abolition of the food subsidies and the diversion of the Agricultural Grant to a system of specific aids to increased agricultural production, such as the provision of vouchers for lime and fertilisers.</P>
    <P>The Committee's report was published as soon as the members of the present Government had read it.  The Committee is to be commended for the speed with which it rendered its advice and for its clear and comprehensive recommendations.</P>
    <P Just="Center">13. AGRICULTURAL GRANT</P>
    <P>The Government have not yet considered all the implications of the recommendations regarding the Agricultural Grant.  The report raises questions of fundamental importance to agriculturists and it will take time to examine them fully.  In any case, the finances of local authorities for 1957-58 have already been settled on the basis of the continuance of the present statutory grants.</P>
    <P Just="Center">14. FOOD SUBSIDIES</P>
    <P>After the most careful consideration of the economic and financial position the Government had no alternative but to take the unwelcome decision to with-draw the food subsidies.  Based on average consumption per head these subsidies over the past year have been worth approximately 1/1 a week to <Col N="947" /> each individual in the community but the provision of this benefit indiscriminately now costs over £9 million a year.</P>
    <P>As from to-morrow, 9th May, payment of subsidy to reduce the price of butter to the consumer will cease.  Control over wholesale and retail prices of butter will be moved.  The price to creameries for butter will, however, be supported by the Butter Marketing Committee at a level sufficient to continue the existing price position for milk supplied to creameries and to meet the cost of cold-storing butter for winter requirements.  The appropriate subsidy paid on butter not yet sold to consumers will be recovered, as far as possible, by a levy on existing stocks. On that account, it may be expected that the retail price of creamery butter will shortly reflect the withdrawal of the subsidy.</P>
    <P>As from Monday next, 13th May, all flour delivered from the mills, whether bakers' flour or shop flour, will be charged at its economic cost.  Steps have already been taken to restrict deliveries of subsidised flour from the mills to the amounts delivered in the corresponding period of last year.  As from the same date, there will be complete decontrol of the wholesale and retail prices of flour and bread.  The stocks of subsidised flour held by bakers should, however, result in postponing for some time the necessity for any increase in bread prices.  The Government are satisfied that the conditions now prevailing in the milling and bakery trades are such as to ensure effective competition for the available business and it is the intention of the Government to see that this competition will not be artificially restricted.</P>
    <P Just="Center">15.  INCREASE IN SOCIAL ASSISTANCE</P>
    <P>We are well aware of the effect of the withdrawal of the subsidies for many in the community but we earnestly hope that those who are themselves at work, drawing wages, salaries or profits, will realise that this is a sacrifice which is necessary to overcome a national difficulty and <Col N="948" /> to support the highest possible level of employment and development.</P>
    <P>If this sacrifice is not generally accepted and if, on the contrary, particular sections of the community secure compensation for themselves by an increase in money incomes for the same work, the result may be a revival of inflation and the recurrence of deficits in the balance of payments.  A renewed drain on our external reserves for consumption purposes would bring in its train a reduction in the capital available for public and private development, a restriction of credit for industry and trade and, inevitably, a widespread increase in unemployment and emigration.  This can be avoided if the sacrifice is made.  A balanced current budget will ensure that savings and reserves are used only for productive capital development providing a prospect of permanent employment for increasing numbers.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that there are certain sections of the community whom it would be unfair to expect to bear the full impact of the ending of the food subsidies, namely, those who are in receipt of Unemployment Assistance, blind pensioners, old age pensioners, widows and others in the Social Assistance categories.  Accordingly, the Government have decided that there should be a general increase of 1s. a week in social assistance payments, extending to adult dependants and one dependent child.  This will require legislation but will be made effective retrospectively to the middle of May.</P>
    <P Just="Center">16. INCREASE IN CHILDREN'S ALLOWANCES</P>
    <P>Consideration must also be given to the position of families whose weekly expenditure on bread and butter is high because of the presence of growing children.  Their position will be eased by the payment of an additional 4s. 6d. a month, with effect from 1st June next, for the second and each subsequent child eligible for Children's Allowances.  For May, an additional payment of 2s. 6d. for each such child will be made as an offset to the rise in prices in that month.  The May and <Col N="949" /> June payments will have to be made in arrear.  Thus, nearly the whole of the extra food bill for all the members of the family of a social assistance recipient will be covered by additional payments from public funds.  Apart from social assistance recipients, the head of every family with more than one child will be relieved, in respect of the second and younger children, of almost the whole of the extra weekly outlay entailed by the ending of the subsidies.  This is as far as the State can go in the present difficult economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>The result of deducting these reliefs from the saving due to the withdrawal of the subsidies is a reduction of £5.15 million in current expenditure in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>There still remains a gap of £2.9 million which must be bridged and can be bridged only by increased taxation on a few major heads.</P>
    <P Just="Center">17. TOBACCO</P>
    <P>Tobacco must once again be called upon for a contribution.  I propose to increase the main rate of duty applicable to leaf to £2 5s. 11d., an increase of 3/2 per lb.; the other rates of tobacco duty will be correspondingly increased.  Allowing a margin for the trade, the effect will be to increase to 3/&ndash; the retail price of the popular packet of cigarettes now selling at 2/10.  The increase in the duty would have the effect of increasing the retail prices of pipe tobaccos generally by about 2½d. per ounce, but the existing rebate on hard-pressed pipe tobaccos will be adjusted so as to restrict the price increases for these varieties to an average of 2d. per ounce.</P>
    <P>I propose also to levy a special excise duty of 3/2 per lb. on all duty-paid stocks of manufactured and unmanufactured tobacco held by the manufacturers at 5 p.m. this evening.</P>
    <P>Deducting £40,000 as the cost of the increased rebate on hard-pressed tobaccos, I expect to gain £1.01 million from these measures this year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">18. BEER</P>
    <P>I propose to increase the beer duty by £1 1s. per standard barrel of 36 <Col N="950" /> gallons, bringing the excise duty to £10 5s. 6d.  Allowing a reasonable margin for the trade this will have the effect of increasing the retail price by 1d. per pint.  The gain to the revenue in the present year is expected to be about £620,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">19. PETROL</P>
    <P>I propose to raise the customs duty on petrol by 6d. per gallon, with a similar increase in the excise duty.  The additional yield should amount to £1.15 million this year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">20. HYDROCARBON OILS OTHER THAN PETROL</P>
    <P>Oils other than petrol included in the hydrocarbon group are at present liable to a customs duty of 1s. 8d. per gallon if used for combustion in road vehicles.  The oils so used are commonly known as diesel.  I propose to increase this duty by 6d. per gallon also, with a similar increase in the excise duty but, through the operation of a repayment provision, the increases will not be effective in the case of diesel oil used in road passenger services licensed under the Road Transport Acts.</P>

      <P>Diesel oil is used in the great majority of buses and consequently the present proposals will leave bus passenger fares almost entirely unaffected.  Allowing £0.11 million as the cost of the concession for road passenger services, I expect the net yield from the duty increases to be about £0.12 million this year.  The present position as regards the liability to duty of oils other than those used in road vehicles is not altered by these proposals.</P>
      <P Just="Center">21.  EFFECT OF INCREASED DUTIES</P>
      <P>These four taxes&mdash;on tobacco, beer, petrol and diesel oil&mdash;are estimated to yield £2.9 million this year, just enough to eliminate the remaining deficit on current account and give a budgetary balance.</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="951" /> 22.  ENTERTAINMENTS DUTY</P>
    <P>I have had representations from cinema proprietors generally both for relief from the weight of entertainments duty and for revision of the structure of the existing scale of duty. In present circumstances, I am unable to agree to any concession which would involve loss to the Exchequer.  I propose, however, to include in the Finance Bill a new scale of duty which, though unlikely to have any effect on the yield of revenue, will remove some unnecessarily burdensome features of the present scale.  The new scale will operate from the 1st August next.</P>
    <P Just="Center">23. RELIEFS OPERATING FROM 1958-59&mdash;INCOME-TAX AND CORPORATION PROFITS TAX</P>
    <P>While I can do nothing which would upset this year's balance, I recognise the urgent need for economic expansion and in order to provide manufactures with an added incentive to increase exports of home-manufactured goods, I propose to raise from 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. the relief for profits on increases in exports which was granted under Part III of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956.</P>
    <P>The 1956 Act gives no consideration or assistance to those who have already pioneered in the export market without the help of any tax concession and whose exports in the future, through no lack of initiative or industry on their part, may not materially exceed those for either of the datum years prescribed.  I propose, therefore, to provide an alternative relief which will be based upon profits from exports and not upon profits from increased exports.  This alternative relief to manufacturers will be to the extent of 25 per cent. of the tax referable to the profits attributable to their exports of manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>The 100 per cent. relief on profits from increased exports and the alternative 25 per cent. relief on profits from exports will take effect as from the tax year 1958-59.  No cost to the Exchequer will arise in the current year but the alternative relief may cost £125,000 next year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> Again, as an encouragement to increased production and modernisation, I propose to lessen the tax burden upon trading profits by providing an accelerated depreciation allowance for plant and machinery (other than vehicles).  This will take the form of a 25 per cent. increase in the present rates of wear and tear allowable and will have effect as from the year 1958-59, so that there will be no cost to the Exchequer in the current year. It will be recalled that, in its report, the Industrial Taxation Committee favoured an acceleration in wear and tear allowances and recommended that those allowances, calculated on basic rates, should be increased by 25 per cent.  I am, therefore, providing that effect will be given to this recommendation as from next year, when the cost will be close on £400,000.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, enacted, subject to conditions, a 20 per cent. tax remission on dividends from investments by Irish residents in Irish industry.  A company's issues carrying the relief had to be so described as to be readily distinguishable from any other issues of the company that did not comply with the requirements of the legislation.  The consequent sub-division of shares has, it is represented, adversely affected marketability.  The changes made in the law last year went some way towards removing this difficulty. The Industrial Credit Company had, however, suggested that, as a bold step in these matters, the tax abatement provided by the section should be extended to all securities issued to the public by Irish manufacturing concerns since 1932.  I propose to implement this suggestion, with effect as from the 6th April, 1958.</P>
    <P>The shipping industry is one which, I am satisfied, merits particular consideration at the present time and, in order to encourage and facilitate its expansion, I am proposing a special &ldquo;investment&rdquo; allowance from profits for tax purposes in respect of expenditure on the provision of ships.  This allowance, which will be to the extent of 40 per cent. of such expenditure, will replace, in relation to ships, the initial allowance of 20 per cent. available under existing law.  I propose that the new 40 per cent. allowance <Col N="953" /> will not be deductible from the capital expenditure in ascertaining the amounts of annual wear and tear allowances.  There will be no cost to the Exchequer in the current year, as the special allowance will first apply to expenditure in the current year and will thus first affect liability for the tax year 1958-59.</P>
    <P>Scientific research is a necessary adjunct to the development of industry and the export drive and I propose, accordingly, to introduce a provision affording tax relief where any person contracts to make annual payments to a University in the State, for a minimum period of three years, for the purpose of enabling the University to carry on research.  The cost to the Exchequer of this relief will naturally depend upon the amount of subscriptions covenanted for, but it probably will not exceed £15,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">24. STAMP DUTY</P>
    <P>Finally, it has been represented to me that, in the case of certain large companies which issue chargeable receipts running into hundreds of thousands each year, the affixing of stamps manually to cover the 2d. receipt duty involves an undue amount of staff time and causes a considerable hold-up in mechanical accounting processes. I propose, therefore, to provide for arrangements for the composition of duty in such cases.  The companies may then be authorised to deliver periodical accounts and pay duty on the aggregate number of chargeable receipts issued during the period. Adequate safeguards will, of course, be provided for the revenue.</P>
    <P Just="Center">25. IMPOSSIBILITY OF GENERAL TAX RELIEFS THIS YEAR</P>
    <P>While the foregoing reliefs in aid of industrial and export expansion will not operate until next year, I would remind Deputies that the reliefs recently afforded both by way of exemptions from special import levies and duty-free licensing are estimated to involve a net loss of revenue in the present financial year of about £1¾ million.  This is no insignificant concession to have made in a difficult <Col N="954" /> year in order to secure increased industrial production and employment. The serious situation with which the Government was confronted precluded any possibility of further reliefs this year.  There was an urgent repair job to be done in this Budget to stop vital resources being drained away to meet ordinary expenditure.  It would have been pointless to juggle with budgetary possibilities&mdash;giving reliefs with the one hand and then being forced with the other to place even heavier charges on the community.</P>
    <P>The reliefs I have announced for next year&mdash;estimated to cost nearly £600,000&mdash;indicate the Government's belief that taxation of incomes and profits is too high.  I hope that, according as we build up our prosperity, some general reductions may be possible within the framework of a balanced budget.  I recognise that reductions in direct taxation would help to release bigger sums for productive investment, both private and public.  I believe, with my predecessor, that it is a good principle in the circumstances of this country to place whatever taxation may be necessary on expenditure rather than on income.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are still some recommendations of the Industrial Taxation Committee to be decided upon and, no doubt, the recently appointed Commission will produce well-considered proposals on the whole question of the taxation of incomes and profits.  I do not propose to make the fact that such a commission is sitting an excuse for doing nothing on the income-tax front if the circumstances of next year or the year after happen to be propitious.</P>
    <P Just="Center">26. CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</P>
    <P>In the circumstances of this year particular attention had to be given to alleviating unemployment and getting production going again.  There was a drop in industrial production in 1956 and a rise in unemployment.  National income fell&mdash;mainly because of a fall in farmers' incomes, itself the result of lower prices for exports.  There has recently been a marked increase in <Col N="955" /> agricultural exports at a higher price level.  Farmers' incomes, both from livestock and from crops, should be higher this year.  The substantial relaxations which the Government have made in the import levies and the lifting of hire purchase restrictions will operate to revive trade and industry and to alleviate unemployment. Generally, therefore, there should be a rise in national income in 1957-58. The unemployment figures have in recent weeks shown a decline not attributable solely to the operation of Employment Period Orders.  Production has been resumed in many factories and workers taken back.</P>
    <P>The main statistics relevant to recent economic trends are shown, for the convenience of Deputies, in Table XI.</P>
    <P Just="Center">27.  SOME CONSTITUENTS OF THE CAPITAL BUDGET, 1957-58</P>
    <P>Because of their consideration for employment the Government have decided to settle the public capital programme for the current financial year at a level which otherwise might seem insupportable.</P>
    <P>Included in that programme is a provision of £500,000 for the Industrial Credit Company which, with the Vote provision of £550,000 for Foras Tionscal and industrial grants, makes over £1 million for new industrial development.</P>
    <P>In the winter of 1955-56 a supplementary grant was allocated from the Road Fund but income was insufficient to meet the additional liability.  There was no compensating buoyancy in the following year, 1956-57, when, indeed, the income of the Fund fell much below the budget estimate and £½ million was diverted to the Capital Fund. As a result, the resources of the Road Fund became exceptionally straitened during the past financial year and payments from the Fund to local authorities are now heavily in arrear.  Provision must be made towards discharging these arrears, as well as covering normal expenditure in the present year, as otherwise a satisfactory volume of road works and employment could not be maintained. <Col N="956" /> Provision for this purpose has been included in the capital allocation for local authorities shown in Table IV and also in Table VIII dealing with the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Minister for Local Government that the global amount which is being provided for local authority borrowing will be sufficient to initiate at successive stages in the present financial year the whole of the housing and sanitary services schemes which were held up at the end of the last financial year as well as some schemes maturing this year.  It will also enable local authorities to continue operations under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts and to meet commitments already entered into under those Acts and in respect of Supplementary Grants.</P>
    <P Just="Center">28. SOURCES OF FINANCE FOR CAPITAL BUDGET, 1957-58</P>
    <P>Allowing for the assistance which various public bodies expect to derive either from internal reserves or from outside lenders, the public capital programme will be of the order of £44 million.  Of this, some £38 million will have to be financed by the State. Towards that £38 million it is expected that £18 million or so will be available from capital repayments to the Exchequer and the Local Loans Fund, the Capital Fund, small savings (including further issues of Prize Bonds) and the investment income of Departmental Funds.  The balance of £20 million at most will have to be found by borrowing.</P>
    <P>As I said before, we have to rely on public support to a greater extent this year for the financing of the capital programme since, unlike last year, we will not be able to make any appreciable draw on the sterling resources of Departmental Funds.  If direct public support should be insufficient, recourse may be necessary to the banking system.  In either event, the aim will be to absorb, for public capital purposes, genuine savings of the community, whether contributed directly to the Government or lodged with the banking system in the form of deposits. There has been a significant increase in bank deposits since the middle of <Col N="957" /> 1956&mdash;sufficient, it would seem, to permit of help being afforded this year both for productive private needs and for public capital purposes.</P>
    <P Just="Center">29.  ECONOMIC OBJECTIVES</P>
    <P>Our national objective is an expanding economy paying its way in its transactions with other countries.  In the financial year 1956/57 there was a balance on external account but this was achieved mainly by a reduction in imports.  The recent trade figures, which show a welcome buoyancy in exports, chiefly cattle and meat, hold out hope that in the current year it may be possible to bring our external payments into line at a higher level. There is, however, little margin for safety.  Imports are almost certain to cost more this year and we are also likely to need a greater volume, partly because of expanding activity and partly because of the extent to which stocks were run down last year.  It is more than ever essential to ensure the achievement of a balance, or near-balance, in our external payments.  The Government will endeavour to protect the economy from any undue loss of external resources, particularly from their wasteful use merely to support consumption in excess of current production.</P>
    <P>This year, in the short time available, I had to concentrate on the immediate task of stopping the drain on current account.  With this drain stopped, no time can be lost in turning attention to more fundamental economic and financial problems.  These problems must be tackled vigorously and wisely over the next five years if economic progress is to be assured.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the specific problem of internal transport.  It is clear that, for financial and general economic reasons, urgent consideration will have to be given to the future of the railways.  The economies yielded by dieselisation are, unfortunately, being negatived by rising costs and by the growing popularity of other modes of transport.  The former Minister for Industry and Commerce established a committee to study the whole problem of internal transport.  Important decisions will have to be taken when the <Col N="958" /> report of that committee has been examined.  Meanwhile, if C.I.E. is to continue operations on the present scale, financial provision will be needed in addition to that made in the Estimates Volume.  As was proposed by my predecessor, an amount of £2.11 million including provision for interest on Transport Stock, has been entered for this purpose in the Capital Budget (Table IV).  It cannot yet be determined what actual amount will be required or the extent to which borrowing may be appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is clear that we have come to a critical stage in our economic affairs. The policies of the past, though successful in some directions, have not so far given us what we want.  We are not satisfied with the rate at which living standards are being raised and productive and self-sustaining employment provided.  Further progress on a worthwhile scale calls for a comprehensive review of our economic policy. The examination of our affairs which we have been pursuing in connection with the European Free Trade Area proposals will undoubtedly show up defects in our economy and should guide us in making the improvements so urgently needed.  The direction and rate of our future advance will depend on the decisions we take now.  There are no easy expedients by which our difficulties can be solved.</P>
    <P>A considerable increase in total output and an improvement in production and marketing methods are of the greatest importance to our future security and advancement.  Both industry and agriculture must be efficient and competitive or they will not provide acceptable living standards.  If they fail in this respect, it is to be feared that emigration will continue almost unabated.</P>
    <P>It is to agriculture we must continue to look as the chief source of exports and the mainstay of our economy.  The raising of agricultural production in volume and in value is, therefore, of vital importance.  In broad terms, increased agricultural production depends primarily on the provision on a wider scale of expert technical advice and assistance, on increased use of fertilisers, improved <Col N="959" /> management of grasslands, more intensive production of home-grown feeding-stuffs for conversion into export products, the reduction of costs and, not least, better marketing arrangements. The Government are fully conscious of the vital necessity for increased production and, in spite of the present difficult financial position, are providing £250,000 to help farmers to dispose of a larger output at a remunerative price.  With an increase in agricultural production the purchasing power of the farming community will be substantially raised.</P>
    <P>An increase in production and lasting employment depends also on the simultaneous development of manufacturing industry, mainly for export, and of other industries, such as tourism, which supplement our external earnings.  For this development more capital from home or external sources and greater enterprise and technical competence will be required.</P>
    <P>Our main hope of further progress in the industrial field lies in the development of competitive export industries which will have the whole world and not a mere three million people as their potential market.  The Government believe&mdash;and I have already given testimony of their belief&mdash;that if we are to increase exports we shall have to direct our policy towards lightening the taxation on profits.  This will encourage the import of foreign capital and skill and provide generally for greater access for industry to new capital.  Lower transport costs would be very helpful.  Restrictive practices should be abandoned.  All of these have a direct bearing on the country's ability to maintain and extend its export business.  It must be obvious that those who increase their contribution to the national pool by greater production thereby raise the general standard of living.  They benefit the whole community as well as themselves.</P>
    <P>Another problem of critical importance for the future is the proper composition and direction of the public capital programme which absorbs so much of the available savings.  There can be no doubt that the programme <Col N="960" /> needs to be reshaped and redirected so as to make a better contribution towards the objective of an expanding economy yielding a rising standard of living.  The remedy for the related problems of emigration and unemployment is through the provision of productive occupations.  To absorb the unemployed on public works is to treat the symptoms without regard to the cause.  When capital resources are scarce it would be fatal not to concentrate particularly on productive development.  Higher taxation becomes inevitable to finance the net debt charges on public works and so the real income at the disposal of a wide section of the community is diminished. This aggravates the unsettling influence of unfavourable comparisons with conditions elsewhere.  At the same time, I want to stress that the Government's aim is to promote economic expansion and, by developing the nation's resources to the utmost, to reduce the present high level of unemployment and provide productive and lasting work for an increasing number of our people.</P>
    <P>We can no longer afford to incur a balance of payments deficit of any appreciable size because of the already serious depletion of our available external reserves.  It is for this reason in particular that I have emphasised the need for stability in money incomes.  An increase in money incomes not based on increased production would give rise to higher expenditure on imports and at the same time, by raising costs, make it more difficult for our exporters to find markets.  The resulting dislocation of our balance of payments would necessitate the taking once more of remedial measures to curtail consumption.  These measures could not but have serious repercussions on employment.</P>
    <P>The basic cause of the recurring crises in our balance of payments in recent years has been the disparity between average production per head in this country and elsewhere, coupled with the general pressure for comparable standards in money incomes and in health and social services.  The fact is that it is only by greater output per worker, increased saving and the <Col N="961" /> application of capital to productive investment that a higher standard of living can be reached and maintained.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that more and more of our people should realise that better living standards for a larger population depend primarily on our own efforts and efficiency as producers and on the resources we contribute out of income towards capital development.  We need to conserve and, so far as possible, expand the resources available for capital development by keeping within due bounds the growth both of private consumption of luxury or semi-luxury goods and of public consumption in the form of non-essential services.  We need to apply the available capital resources along lines to be settled after considering the best objective advice available, both from home and extern sources.</P>
    <P>In the latter connection, I may mention that the Government intend to seek legislative authority to join the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  Assistance from the Bank would then be available, initially in the form of expert technical advice and later, perhaps, in the form of loans for approved development projects.  I intend paying our subscriptions to these institutions out of dollars held in the Foreign Exchange Account.  We shall no longer earn interest but we shall have, instead, access to the valuable facilities of both Fund and Bank and, of course, our capital will remain intact.</P>
    <P>This Government have full confidence in the inherent soundness of the economy and in its ability to provide higher living standards for an expanding population on the firm basis of an increase in production and exports. The relaxation of restrictions and the assurance of new reliefs, together with the maintenance of the State capital programme at a high level and the prospects of a continuing improvement in exports, should strengthen business confidence and stimulate production. The resultant growth of opportunities for work should effect a marked improvement in the unemployment situation and check the outflow of our people.  We cannot hope to solve all our problems at once but, with the co-operation of every section of the community, <Col N="962" /> they can be reduced in scale and urgency and the way prepared for the achievement of what will always be the objective of this Party&mdash;permanently higher living standards for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it needs anything from me to remind the House that the country, as the House, will be severely shocked when it reads the proposals of the Minister to-morrow morning.  I wonder what would have been the impact on the country on the 5th March if those proposals had been disclosed by Deputy Dr. Ryan on the day before the general election?</P>
      <P>Last year, and in considering the outturn of this year, as the Minister has indicated, there were certain factors with which we as a country were then faced.  There were undoubtedly two factors which had to be considered by us as a Government in relation to the framework of our economic policy.  The first was our external balance and the second was our internal balance.  The external deficit with which the last Government was faced was one that arose from 1955 as a result partly of a worsening in the terms of trade, in which respect I note the Minister has suggested to-day that he is in a happier position. We had also in 1956 to consider the potential additional trend that might arise out of the full impact in that year of the 1955 fifth round of wage increases. However, it seemed to us clear, and I think it must be clear to anyone looking at the economic position of that time, that the essential thing to do in the year 1956-57 was to achieve stability all round as well as to get our external deficit under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That stability was achieved by the previous Government and I trust that the Minister has not jeopardised it to-day. Unless we had secured the stability that we did secure, the Minister would not have been able to introduce his Budget in the knowledge that in the year ended 31st March last, we were in a surplus position on our external account.  It was a trifling surplus, admittedly&mdash;£59½ million of a trade excess balanced by some £61 million of invisible income&mdash;but it was a situation which had not been <Col N="963" /> achieved for many years before and a situation in which the Minister was able to take his own line in relation to his internal budgetary problems for the current year.  It is beyond question that it was the fact that we had got our external problem into proper proportions that this Government, when they acceded to office last March, were able themselves to choose and to frame the financial policy they wished to introduce.</P>
    <P>In his review of last year in relation to the deficit on current account, the Minister did not bring one serious and obvious factor into the picture.  Whatever was going to be the situation in respect of our financial position for the year ending 1956-57, it was one which was aggravated very substantially by the international events in regard to Suez and the Middle East.  There was no mention whatever of that in the Budget speech which we have just heard.  The fact that we were able to survive that and the fact that we were able to end the financial year which has just passed with a net borrowing by the State of some £2,000,000 less than the amount that I indicated in my Budget speech of last year, shows the efficacy of the measures that were taken by the Government to achieve that position.</P>
    <P>So far as I can trace in the very short time that has been available to me&mdash;and the Minister will agree that he certainly broke the normal speed in reading out his Budget speech&mdash;the capital programme which he has suggested for the current year is on the lines previously determined by me.  The discussions that will take place both in this House and throughout the country during the next few weeks will prove beyond question the wisdom of the course I had hoped to adopt, segregating and introducing at separate periods in this House the capital and current budgetary proposals.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, as far as I can read the figures in that short time, that, for example, in respect of Table IV, which includes the Capital Budget, the amount the Minister proposes to give local authorities to spend, which he <Col N="964" /> adumbrated at some length in his Budget speech, is almost the exact figure that I had indicated last February was going to be spent in that respect.  The issues from the Local Loans Fund appear to include issues, again copying my proposals, from the Local Loans Fund to Dublin Corporation and to Cork Corporation. Therefore, it seems there is practically no difference between his figure of £14.88 million and the just under £14 million proposals which he found in the pigeon-hole in his drawer when he assumed office&mdash;that, in spite of the fact that we were castigated in this House and up and down the country by many of the Deputies sitting over on that side of the House now, on the ground that the amount we were proposing to provide for housing and other services by local authorities was grossly inadequate and unjustifiably low.  Now that the Minister is sitting on that side of the House, I wonder will we hear the same criticism from the Deputies over there.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the debate on the Vote on Account, I referred to a decision of the previous Government in relation to current services.  There was also on 24th January a decision of that Government in relation to the Capital Budget for this year, a decision that it was to be not less than £38,200,000 and not more than £40,000,000.  This Capital Budget for capital services, which the Minister has just announced will, according to Table IV, amount to £40,999,000, showing a variation, therefore, of merely £999,000, despite all the abuse and vituperation hurled by the Deputies behind the Minister and his supporters generally, who lost no opportunity during the election campaign, and despite the campaign that was conducted too for purely Party interests, last year in an endeavour to suggest that the action we were taking and the actions we proposed to take were not in the best national interest.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the current Budget, which the Minister has just introduced, will be received by the people with the greatest possible dismay.  I wonder how the Taoiseach and his colleague sitting next to him, the Tanaiste and <Col N="965" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce, are able to reconcile the proposals they have just introduced with the speeches they delivered on the last day of February of this year.</P>

      <P>Now, the outturn of last year shows, in relation to taxation, that we must have reached very nearly the point of &ldquo;no return&rdquo; in relation to tobacco Yet, the tobacco smoker is again attacked this year, notwithstanding that I remember the present Minister for Health, when he was Deputy MacEntee, saying violently last year to me that in no circumstances, no matter what the position was, would a Fianna Fáil Government ever add any increases in taxation.</P>

I remember, too, a considerable barrage of criticism on the subject of hard-pressed plug, but I note that in these Budget proposals to-day the old age pensioner, who smokes his hardpressed plug, will not get the full benefit of any relief.  I do not think I need say anything in relation to the additional taxation that is being put on the pint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The people in the country as a whole will themselves pass judgment on that and I have no doubt whatsoever as to the effect of that judgment.  I remember only too well in this House last year the rampaging that there was upon these benches on <Col N="967" /> the part of those who are now Ministers on the subject of an increased duty on petrol.  We were told then that it would adversely affect the cost of distribution, that it would slow down trade and industry, that it would have most deleterious and dire effects all over every aspect of our economy.  Yet, though they purported then to suggest that taxation would affect production, they have not provided in these budgetary proposals to-day the one essential relief.  If we are ever to achieve an improvement in our economic position it is upon the basis of our agricultural production we shall have to build.  According to the Minister's Budget statement to-day, farmers who use petrol in their tractors will have to bear the full increase, the full impact of the new 6d. per gallon.  Will that be an aid to production on the land?  Will that be a method by which we can build an expanding agricultural economy?</P>
      <P>In relation to diesel oil, it seems to me, judging by the very careful phrase the Minister used, that we shall have to face some increase in bus passenger fares.  The Minister's phrase was: &ldquo;The present proposals will leave bus passenger fares almost entirely unaffected.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So far as the other items the Minister mentioned are concerned, I think the general debate will prove a more appropriate occasion upon which to discuss them.  The Budget the Minister has introduced is one that will be greeted by the country at large, this evening and again to-morrow morning, with a gasp of dismay.  It is one in which the Minister himself has increased in some respects the Estimates that were framed, as he says himself, by the previous Government.</P>

      <P>It is one which he has introduced after he had been given Supply on the Vote on Account for four months, sufficient to enable him to carry on to 31st July next, thereby affording him ample time to form his own judgment and make his own measurements.  I acknowledge gratefully <Col N="968" /> his tribute to the success of the prize bonds, but as a result of that prize bond issue which I had arranged, he is not in the situation in which I was in June, 1954, when the first thing I had to do was to go to the banks and get money for the immediate carrying on of the working of the State.  He had the proceeds of the bonds in addition to the balance in the Exchequer; he had funds available to meet immediate commitments; and he was able himself, in his own way, with our external trading in balance, to choose the methods by which he would carry out the policy of the Government.</P>
      <P>We must remember that the policy, adumbrated and formulated in this Budget, must be considered side by side with the decision the Government have already taken that, while restricting consumption in this way, motor cars over £1,200 in value are now to come in duty free&mdash;the economics of a madhouse!</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a few observations on this Budget, reserving my main comment on it until we come to the General Resolution.  I think this is a brazen Budget and it is entitled to take its place with its equally brazen relation, the Fianna Fáil Budget of 1952.  They are both a product of the same mind.  They are both the product of a mind that thinks there is still something to squeeze out of the ordinary working people.  They are eating too much butter.  They are eating too much bread and flour is too cheap for them.  They have got to be squeezed.  Whatever advantages they have by way of food subsidies have to be withdrawn from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last election I said I believed that Fianna Fáil, if returned to power, would abolish the food subsidies. I asked the Fianna Fáil Party during the election to deny they intended to abolish the food subsidies. While a lot of frothy nonsense was talked by Fianna Fáil speakers on many subjects which had no relevance and were of no importance to the people, they could not be drawn specifically so far as the food subsidies were concerned.  They did, as Deputy <Col N="969" /> Sweetman said, make reference on two occasions, I think, to the fact that what we said in respect of the food subsidies was not true and could be proved untrue.  Who is telling the truth now?</P>
    <P>Surely the nation are entitled to an apology on account of the way they were misled by the Taoiseach speaking at Belmullet and by the Tánaiste speaking at Waterford.  On the day the Taoiseach was nominated here, I asked, before we cast our votes, whether we could get from the Taoiseach an assurance that they did not propose to abolish the food subsidies. The Taoiseach should get a copy of the Dáil Report of that date and read what he then said.  He said that I had been proved to be wrong in other prophecies I made and that Fianna Fáil, in fact, did not intend to do any such thing.</P>

Is not this a clear departure from the assurances they gave the people and from the way in which they endeavoured to woo the people into voting for Fianna Fáil in the last general election?  The mood of the Fianna Fáil Party then was that they could do the job better and should be put back into office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>All this has been done by a Government which promised the people they could do things better. Look at what this Government, which made so many promises, has to offer the people within two months of taking office.  This is the thanks to the people.  This is the gratitude to the people.  Flour is to go up substantially in price.  Bread is to go up by 3d. or 3½d. per 2 lb. loaf and butter is to go up by 5d. per lb.  Sugar has been increased only recently and jam and biscuits will now follow on these increases so that the Government which purported to stand as the barrier between the people and the last Government in fact comes out to-day to show that it is going not only to abolish the food subsidies but to do it in one fell swoop and all these decisions are to be made operative almost immediately.  But that is not all.  Tobacco is to go up in price and beer is to go up in price and 6d. per gallon is to go on petrol and insurance on motor cars recently went up by 20 per cent.  Then we are told that in this Budget there will be some compensations. Look at the compensations. The people who were drawing social assistance are to get an increase of 1/&ndash; per week&mdash;1/&ndash; for seven days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This 1/&ndash; per week <Col N="972" /> is to be given to social assistance cases, and only to those cases.  There is to be no increase whatever for the person drawing unemployment insurance benefit.  There is to be no increase in those benefits.  There is to be no increase for the sick man depending on sickness benefit or disability benefit&mdash; not even 1/&ndash;&mdash;under this Budget.  The widows and orphans drawing insurance benefit will get no increase in benefit under this Budget.  Therefore, that large mass of people&mdash;over 40,000&mdash;who are drawing unemployment benefit to-day will get no increase in that benefit under this Budget.  Thousands of people living on sickness benefit and disability benefit get no increase in their benefit under the Budget.  A large number of contributory widow and orphan recipients will get no increase whatever under this Budget.</P>
      <P>There is to be an increase of 4/6 per month in the case of children's allowances.  Let us have a look at that.  A man and a wife will get nothing of it.  A man with a wife and child will get none of it&mdash;there is nothing payable to them.  If they have two children they will get 4/6 per month for four people.  They will get 54 pence which is distributed among four people over 30 days. That is their compensation for the increase in flour, bread, butter, tobacco, beer and petrol.  The four persons will have the privilege of sharing between them less than 2d. per day&mdash;and that is the benefit that is supposed to be provided under this Budget.  That is the compensation. The Budget does not stop there.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the health services. Even the health services available to the ordinary working man and woman are being assailed in this Budget. Before the Health Act was introduced, an insured person, if he were insured for social insurance purposes for three years, could get all kinds of hospital and medical services free of charge. The Health Act came along and he was told: &ldquo;Although you had these rights to free treatment previously, you will have to pay 6/&ndash; per day for your treatment in hospital under the Health Act, a maximum of 42/&ndash; per week.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> The amendment now proposed in the health services will make that ordinary worker who, four years ago, had free health services, pay £3 10s. a week for the health services which he is getting to-day at £2 2s. a week and which&mdash;let me say it again&mdash;three or four years ago he got at no charge whatever to himself.  Therefore, even the ordinary working man when ill in hospital and when he is depending on social welfare benefits is made a target for a raid by the Government in order to balance this Budget.  I do not believe the economic condition of the country requires that these people should be treated in such a cruel and heartless way as it is proposed to treat them in respect both of the health services and of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>The effect of this Budget is clear. It will start off a new round of wage increases.  Is it any wonder that that will happen when you see food prices increased in this fashion?  There will be consequential increases in prices because of the abolition of the food subsidies to-day.  I have no doubt that the trade unions will now move out and look for further wage increases. It is quite clear that they are entitled to get them under this Budget.  It may very well be&mdash;though he did not say so&mdash;that the Minister for Finance recognises that this Budget will involve another round of wage increases.  Talk about stability!</P>
    <P>During our period of office, we endeavoured to hold food prices as low as we could.  No Government in Europe was able to hold the prices of bread, butter, sugar and flour as steadily as we held them for almost three years. There was no increase in the price of bread when we were there.</P>

      <P>I must say&mdash;apparently, much to the discomfiture of some members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; that we held the prices of bread, flour and sugar steady over three years and that we reduced the price of butter by 5d. a lb.  That is what the people had up to the 5th March.  Since they unfortunately made a mistake on that date, they now know what the mistake will cost them.  They will have the privilege of suffering for their error for the next four or five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> So far as the people are concerned, this Budget will be bitterly resented. It represents a conjuring trick on the people.  The Fianna Fáil Party promised the people they would see things through and do things better.  This is the first piece of their artistry that they have put in the show window. They ought to be thoroughly ashamed of having spoofed the people in such a deliberate way and of having done it so soon after they had, through their political misrepresentations, ensnared the people into voting for them at the recent general election.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a point briefly now, as I shall dwell at length on it later.  The Minister said that public faith was pledged to the master bakers. It was not pledged by me to the master bakers.  They paid the increase in wages awarded by the Labour Court in order to avoid a trade dispute and they wanted to get a guarantee that they would be compensated for it.  I gave them no guarantee in that respect and public faith was in no way pledged.  I challenge the Minister to produce the slightest evidence, orally or in writing, that public faith was pledged, so far as the master bakers are concerned.  In my view, the arrangement made with a number of master bakers was such that they could carry the wage increase awarded by the Labour Court, but certainly they were being well dealt with when they got flour at a cheaper rate and when certain adjustments were made in overweighting.  I regarded that as having fully met any reasonable demand they had, but certainly there was no question of breaking public faith with the master bakers.</P>
    <P>I think that is all I want to say on the Budget at this stage.  There will obviously be no room for joy at the cross roads over this Budget.  Instead there will be a feeling of despair and frustration.  The Budget does one thing. It is a high price to have to pay, I admit, but the Budget does expose the insincerity, the hollowness and the hypocrisy of the Government which led the people to believe that there was something much better than this, certainly not this, that they would get by voting for Fianna Fáil candidates <Col N="976" /> in the recent election.  It has now been clearly demonstrated that the people have been grossly misled.  Their eyes will be opened to-night; they will be opened wider still to-morrow, but unfortunately that will be too late and they will have to bear these burdens now for many a day because they were unwittingly ensnared into voting for the Fianna Fáil Party on the promises which were made by that Party in the recent election.</P>

      <P>This is the second occasion inside a period of five years in which the Fianna Fáil Party has deliberately got into power by a trick, by false promises, by what could be practically described as fraudulent promises.  During the last election campaign, every Minister, including the Taoiseach in the present Government, promised the people that there would be no increased taxation in one form or another.  The Taoiseach himself went down to Belmullet on the last day of February, a few days before voting day, and almost with tears in his eyes, denounced some of the prophecies then made by the members now in Opposition. We had warned the people&mdash;and rightly so; I warned them myself&mdash; that the prices of bread, flour, butter and petrol would surely go up because that was the Fianna Fáil method of finding money.</P>
      <P>He denied these things and I now hear in the House a quotation from the present Tánaiste, then Deputy Lemass, speaking in Waterford on the same occasion and making the same promises.  It all fits into the same pattern which was also followed by the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, when, just before the 1951 election, he promised solemnly in Rathmines Town Hall, two nights before the voting, that if Fianna Fáil got back into power there would be no increase in the prices of tobacco or drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On other occasions when budgetary matters were less serious than they are to-day&mdash;it happened many a time &mdash;the less serious aspects of the Budget could be laughed off.  It was a joke around the House, but on this occasion the matter is so serious it cannot be treated lightly because I say this <Col N="977" /> Budget is one calculated to drive more young people from the country than ever before.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Government: What young person at the present time in rural Ireland should stay in the country when the full impact of this Budget hits them?  Flour will go up from 25/&ndash; to 30/&ndash; a bag as sold in the shops to the country people&mdash;that is household flour.  The ordinary loaf of bread will probably be in the region of 1/1 or 1/2; the lb. of butter goes up from below 3/9 to 4/3.  Petrol goes up by 6d. and even diesel oil goes up.</P>
    <P>I see that the Minister for Finance includes diesel oil in the tax list even though it is one of the principal commodities required for the increased production about which the Government prates so much.  The price is being increased by 6d.  The only provision made specifically in his speech to exempt from that tax is in regard to the transport companies.  The Minister does not mention that farmers using diesel oil in either taxed or untaxed tractors will benefit by the rebate.</P>
    <P>Tobacco goes up by 2d. or 2½d.; the &ldquo;pint&rdquo; by 1d.  All the promises the members of the Fianna Fáil Government made, and not alone which they made but which every single candidate in the election made&mdash;those elected to this House and those not elected who are still down the country&mdash;are now thrown overboard as shamelessly as in 1951.</P>
    <P>In 1951 I blamed the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, for the Budget of that year.  I see now this Budget is a product of the Fianna Fáil Government and that this is their policy&mdash;to get in by any possible trick, by any misstatement or untruth at the time of an election, in any way you can fool the people, and then squeeze them dry.  I say this is a scandalous Budget.  A little over 100 years ago we had a calamitous year which was known as Black '47; this year will be remembered by the working people of the country as Black '57.</P>
    <P>I see that special mention is given to the Land Commission, or the closing <Col N="978" /> down of the Land Commission which was put into operation on the pretext of the war, in the month of April, 1941. I see that that is now to be put ruthlessly into effect.  I must tell the Minister for Finance that after his Budget goes into effect there will be no need to close down the Land Commission because there will be nobody in rural Ireland.  Who could stay on the land here after this Budget?  This Budget is framed deliberately as a rich man's Budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we know who they are.  We also know who got the hints before the election on what to do and how to do it.  We know now that what I regarded then perhaps as political gossip were simply hints.  I now see the full truth of what I heard at that time.</P>
      <P>There is no need whatever to close down the Land Commission because, when this Budget takes effect, the work of the Land Commission will finish automatically inside six months. I see now why Deputy Childers, Minister for Lands, was given the Fisheries Section&mdash;as soon as the Land Commission dies he can go fishing, I suppose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coupled with the removal of the agricultural grant, attention was directed by the Minister for Finance to the recommendations in the report of the committee which advised in regard to doing away with the agricultural grant and the possible diversion of it into some other channels.  Of course, anything that hits the farmer hits the worker in rural Ireland and anything that promises to hit them and bring in money to the Exchequer is certainly something which should be examined carefully according to the present <Col N="979" /> Minister for Finance and the present Government.</P>
    <P>A relief of 1/&ndash; is being given to certain sections.  As Deputy Norton said it does not amount to even 2d. a day and this is given to recipients of social assistance to compensate them for the other increases.  I wonder does the Taoiseach and his Ministers think that a time still exists in Ireland when you can go out and rob a poor man of 5/&ndash; and pretend that by throwing him back 1/&ndash; he will not notice the difference? That is what the present Government is doing&mdash;taking 5/&ndash; out of the poor man's pocket in bread, butter, flour, tobacco and drink and giving him back 1/&ndash;, rubbing salt into the wound instead of rubbing balm into it.  You are trying to pull the wool over the people's eyes.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the present Government that will not work.  The people are too well-informed nowadays.  They know the mistake they made at the last election.  They know that, whatever our faults and shortcomings were, at the very least, we told them the truth.  From our position in Government, we told them the truth as to what Fianna Fáil would do, if elected. I am sure they see it now and will be wiser the next time.</P>
    <P>I disagree with one thing that Deputy Norton said.  He said to Deputy Corry that Deputy Corry can sit back and gibe at the people for five years.  I do not think so; I think that there will be such a revolution as a result of the manner in which the people have been double-crossed that the Government will not last much more than five months, let alone five years.</P>

      <P>I do not think I can tell <Col N="986" /> you very much more.  As I explained, the effect of this increased duty is to increase the ordinary 2/10 packet of cigarettes to 3/&mdash;I do not know what effect it will have on other cigarettes which are not sold at the ordinary price &mdash;and to affect hard-pressed tobacco by 2d. an ounce on the average.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did mention that there was some concession in respect of plug tobacco.  Will he be good enough to say what the impact would be on plug tobacco if the full scale of tax applied to it and what is the difference between that figure and the figure he is proposing?  Do I understand him to say that he does not propose that the full tax will pass on to plug tobacco?  What is the reduction he has in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I am not offering a very big concession, I admit.  The increase would be 2½d. which, I came to the conclusion, would probably be 3d.  Therefore, I brought it down to 2d. so as to put on 2d. instead of 3d.  That is what it amounts to really.</P>

      <P>I should be grateful if the Minister could give us some information on this Resolution.  He associates hydrocarbon oil with T.V.O. and diesel oil.  I am not clear from the terms of the Resolution what are the relative positions of T.V.O. for agricultural tractors and of diesel for agricultural tractors at the moment and after the Resolution has been carried.  Will there be an increase in <Col N="996" /> the price of T.V.O. for agricultural tractors as a result of this?  Does the duty of 6d. on diesel oil apply to agricultural tractors though not to public transport vehicles?</P>

If the Minister looks at Section 5 of the Resolution, he will see that it speaks of 2/2 a gallon on tractor vaporising oil and that Section 7 refers to a rebate of 2/&ndash; per gallon on tractor vaporising oil.  Does that involve a net increase of 2d. a gallon?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the merits of this Resolution, I want to make a modest representation to the Minister for Finance. There are in this country a relatively small number of petrol driven tractors.  The fact is that when the Ferguson system was first introduced into this country, the inventor, Mr. Harry Ferguson, maintained against all comers that his tractors operated more efficiently on petrol than on T.V.O.  He even preferred it to diesel. Whatever the merits of that argument may have been, a certain number of farmers never accepted the view put forward by the inventor of the system himself, the manufacturer, and they bought and are still using petrol tractors.</P>
      <P>The amount is trivial from the point of view of the Exchequer, but it must be abundantly clear to anyone in this House that for a man who has a petrol tractor a burden of 6d. a gallon on petrol is extremely heavy.  When I was Minister for Agriculture, I discussed this matter with the Minister for Finance from time to time and my recollection is that we were both agreed that the number of petrol tractors was quite trivial- because, despite the advice tendered, the vast majority of farmers have gone over to T.V.O. or diesel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I suggest to the Minister for Finance that he consult with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, to consider whether it would not be quitable and fair to extend the rebate which is already available in <Col N="999" /> respect of the first 6d. on petrol to people who are in fact using petrol tractors, even if that rebate is given only for a limited time?  He could indicate that after a period of two or three years, when the tractors will be more or less used up, he could allow it no longer on them and that it is Government policy that all should go over to diesel or T.V.O.  It is a terrible hardship that a man who has put his money into a petrol tractor should be called upon to bear this extra burden. I could well understand that if there were some vast and insuperable administrative difficulty, the Government would be justified in saying: &ldquo;We would like to accommodate you, but we cannot go on doing it and anyone who wants to use a petrol tractor hereafter must face the fact that he will have to pay this extra petrol tax.&rdquo; Would the Minister say that, at least in respect of existing petrol tractors, there will be a rebate of this kind so as to give users of them a chance to carry on?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much the cost; there are other considerations which I do not want to go into now, but perhaps we could discuss them on the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the price of T.V.O. and diesel is now in the neighbourhood of 1/7 or 1/8 a gallon.  After this, the price of a gallon of petrol will be over 5/&mdash;about 5/4. For the limited number of petrol tractors in the country, that places the unfortunate individual who has sunk his capital in a petrol tractor in a terribly disadvantageous position <i>vis-à-vis</i> his T.V.O. or diesel competitor.  Many of those tractor owners are young men, at least in the West of Ireland, many <Col N="1000" /> of whom emigrated and earned the price of their machinery, their tractor and their plant, in England or elsewhere. They came home and they sank their money in them.  Anyone who was unfortunate enough to have bought a petrol tractor in those days now finds himself completely crushed out of business.  The petrol engine has been depreciated very much in value by the price of petrol.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, regarding the rebate of 6d. a gallon which exists does it not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe there are 100 petrol tractors in the country. Surely this petrol increase will hit those people particularly hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should think about it, in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to correct one point.  There is a rebate at the moment of 1/1¾ for tractors and stationary engines used by farmers.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, it is only a matter of changing that figure, but there are other considerations.  We can think over it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us, in regard to the 1/1¾ he refers to as the rebate, under what Act that is operative at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I spent some time drawing the Minister's attention to what I considered was the very bad way that my constituency was treated in the allocation of road grants.  When the Minister is replying I do not want him to say: &ldquo;That is what the Government you supported did.&rdquo; I believe the Government of the day should serve the people to the best of their ability and that, when an injustice is done and the Minister's attention is drawn to it, he should do the best he possibly can to remedy that injustice.</P>
      <P>I should like to go back again now to this matter of tourist road grants. At column 280 of Volume 157 of the Official Report it will be seen that, so far as tourist road grants are concerned, Cavan got £10,000; Clare, £35,000; Cork, £55,000; Donegal, £55,000; Galway, £55,000, Kerry, £55,000; Leitrim, £25,000; Louth, £55,000; Roscommon, £25,000; Sligo, £25,000; and Waterford, £5,000.  That is something that should be remedied this year because Waterford is an entry port for tourists.  We have there resorts like Tramore, Dungarvan, Clonea and Ardmore on the coast.  Tramore is a premier seaside resort, with a magnificent strand. Years ago, we were told that the road would be continued the whole length of the strand from the existing promenade right down to the sandhills. I would respectfully point out to the Minister that this is a matter that should receive his attention and, instead of allotting merely £5,000 to Waterford for tourist road grants this year, the amount should be considerably increased, so that the road&mdash;a great tourist amenity&mdash;can be finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> With regard to employment schemes, I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that one year Waterford got £250, another year £250 and another year £300.  That amount should also be increased.  I do not know how these allocations from the Road Fund for the upkeep and improvement of roads are made.  If these allocations are made on the amount of road tax paid, then, much to my surprise, we must have been buying fewer and fewer cars in Waterford over the past three or four years because the amount of the grant has been going down steadily.  It went down from £137,000 to £132,000.  I believe it should be increased rather than decreased.</P>
    <P>We would be very grateful in Waterford if the Minister continued the cooperation that we had from his predecessor and the co-operation we had from himself when he was Minister on a former occasion.  We have put in a scheme from Waterford County Borough for the building of 170 houses. I appeal to him to give that scheme his urgent consideration.  The direct labour guild in Waterford is a worthwhile body.  That has been proved over the years.  This body is at the moment building its five-hundredth house.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again appeal to the Minister substantially to increase the tourist road grant in relation to County Waterford, the grant for the upkeep and improvement of roads and the employment schemes grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to apologise to the Minister for the fact that I was not here last night when he opened this Estimate.  I have endeavoured to procure a copy of his speech, but I have unfortunately been unsuccessful.  I understand it is not the fault of the Minister or his officials. Neither have I been able to procure a copy from the ordinary channels through which one applies when one wishes to have a copy of a statement made here.  I understand that the Minister was himself slightly handicapped since he was called upon when he least expected to be called.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall have very little to say on this Estimate.  The Estimate was prepared by the Minister's predecessor, but he is <Col N="1005" /> now responsible for it.  As a former Minister for Local Government, my first duty is to pay tribute to the staff and officials of the Department of Local Government.  I found in the Department of Local Government, as I am sure the Minister found on a former occasion and finds again to-day, nothing but co-operation and helpfulness from the highest official, namely, the Secretary, down to the lowest. It is a matter for the Minister to dictate policy and, in that regard, I am certain that my experience there will be continued, namely, that the policy dictated by the Minister will be implemented fully by the officials.  I take this opportunity of putting on the records of the House my admiration and respect for the officials of that Department.</P>
    <P>Now, if I may say so, I sympathise with the Minister in many ways.  The Department of Local Government is purely a spending Department.  It is the conduit or pipeline through which finances flow from the Exchequer to local authorities.  Sometimes, if there appears to be a plug or block in that pipeline, it is not the fault of the Department of Local Government, of the Minister or his officials.  He may be marking time for very good reasons. Some of us, before we become familiar with the ramifications of local government and the difficulties under which the Department works, do not always appreciate the position.  If, at times, the trickle through the pipeline is very slow that is not the fault of the Minister or his officials.  They can merely facilitate the trickle through of what the Minister procures from the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused to read a few weeks ago a statement made by the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, after he had taken up office, at a victory Fianna Fail dinner at Ramelton.  He said one of the first duties and one of the first jobs of the present Minister for Local Government and the Cabinet would be to turn on the financial taps and to release tenders and contracts which were held up in the Department of Local Government.  So far, I am afraid there has not been very much of a flow and, <Col N="1006" /> judging by this Estimate and judging by what we heard in the Budget Statement to-day, we cannot expect much of a financial flow.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to learn to-day that the present Minister and the present Government will implement the under-taking given by me, namely, that all commitments in regard to housing entered into by local authorities will be honoured.  I was very glad indeed to hear from the Minister for Finance to-day that money was being provided for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I am sure that, like me, the Minister would like to see local authorities continue the supplementary housing grant schemes, but, if the money is not available, we have just got to put up with it.  The Minister cannot be blamed for that.  I have come to the conclusion that we have reached the stage where we should have a stocktaking of the housing problem of this country.  During the last few months in which I was Minister, I asked local authorities to re-examine the position as there was a danger&mdash;it actually happened in some cases&mdash;of over building.  Deputy Larkin looks at me, but I am not referring to the City of Dublin.  There is undoubtedly in certain parts of the country over-building and there has been a neglect of reconstruction.</P>
    <P>How often do we find small towns in rural Ireland with eyesores in the centre, undemolished derelict sites which could be reconstructed and made into useful accommodation for people residing in these localities and thus avoid the necessity for and the cost of transport from the suburbs into the centres of these towns.  The survey which I initiated and which I hope will be carried out will enable the Minister to make a realistic assessment of our housing needs.  I thought at one stage that in the City of Dublin there should have been a revaluation of the housing needs of this city.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think that two things are responsible for what may be termed the traffic problem in this city. First of all, the corporation have extended their area too far out into the country, with the result that people employed in the centre of the city have to be transported from the city to their <Col N="1007" /> residences and again from their residences to the city.  The result is that we have a traffic problem.  We got people out of the slums, but we put them on the streets, if I may use the expression, for the purpose of transporting them.  I am sure the Minister will reconsider these matters when he comes to examine the housing problem in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The previous Government gave an undertaking to the Dublin Corporation that they would provide £4,000,000 last year, £4,000,000 this year and, if in office, £4,000,000 the following year for the financing of the capital projects of the city.  At that time, I asked the corporation to allocate a minimum of £400,000 for small dwellings.  I do not want any discussion on the matter now; I merely mention the matter in passing.  It is a great pity that the £400,000 which was eventually made available in January or February was not made available in July or August when the moneys were allocated.  If it had been, there would not have been, in my opinion, what is known as the housing crisis in the city, particularly in view of the fact that not only was a sum of £4,000,000 given for last year, but also for the present.  There is nothing in this Estimate to increase that amount.  It has not been said that Dublin Corporation will get £4,000,000 for the coming year.</P>
    <P>I think the previous Government set a headline for Dublin Corporation.  We all know the difficulty they had in procuring finance.  We all know the flops which their loans have been in the past.  They decided that there would be no more financial flops so far as loans were concerned and decided that they would advance £4,000,000 and they could cut their cloth accordingly. I think Dublin Corporation have been very well provided for, and if my successor can do more for them, I shall be greatly surprised indeed.</P>
    <P>I think I should pay a tribute to Cork Corporation for the manner in which they had their loan subscribed last year.  As has been pointed out, they will have no more financial difficulty in so far as loans are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> I merely heard the contribution of Deputy T. Lynch to this debate in which he particularly referred to tourist road grants.  During my term as Minister, I decided that there should be a greater allocation from the Road Fund for county roads as distinct from main roads.  I said in this House that, in my opinion, we were building boulevards for pluto-crats and that we were neglecting the roads leading into agricultural land, farmers' houses and labourers' cottages. The more I see of our roads, the more I am convinced of that.  The more I read of the accidents on our roads and examine the statistics, the more I have come to the conclusion that it is upon these boulevards the greatest number of accidents occur.  I hope the Minister will see his way to continue the policy initiated by me by the allocation of a greater sum each year for our county roads in order to bring them up to a reasonable standard.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have agreed &mdash;it is common policy&mdash;that increased agricultural output is what is necessary if we are to survive.  The day of the horse is gone and we have now got to depend upon mechanisation for increased output.  I hope the local authorities will take advantage of the option they have with regard to <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads and that some of them will eventually be taken over.  I think it was Westmeath which specialised in the taking over of these <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads, but, unfortunately, having regard to the money available to them out of the Road Fund allocation, very little could be done.</P>
    <P>Quite recently, I had the opportunity of having a discussion with some American tourists motoring through this country.  They were amazed at the standard of our main roads.  There is no doubt that if one goes from here to Donegal, Galway or Cork, one will see that these arterial roads have reached a high standard, but once we go down to the back roads of rural Ireland, we get into difficulties.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the continuation of the policy initiated by me in regard to the county <Col N="1009" /> roads.  I agree with Deputy Lynch that more could be done for the tourist roads, particularly tourist roads in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>We have got to decide some day what we allocate road money for.  Is it to give employment or make roads? Personally, I would rather see the roads brought to a high standard by means of mechanisation than manual labour, because once we have got our roads up to a fairly high standard, moneys may be allocated and diverted to other channels which will give us productive employment and be of much more benefit to the economy of the country.  We should not spend money on roads merely for the purpose of spending it.  I am afraid that most rural Deputies advocate the spending of money on roads purely for the purpose of the labour content involved.</P>
    <P>As a result of the tariffs last year, local authorities were unable to procure machines which they consider necessary for the improvement of our roadways.  Those tariffs are now gone.  I feel certain the Minister will sanction the purchase of any further machinery that local authorities may find necessary.  If he does so, in a few years' time, the roads will have reached a sufficiently high standard of excellence to enable us to divert moneys which are now being spent on what I must describe as non-productive work to other channels.</P>
    <P>I feel certain that the Minister will endeavour to secure some continuity of policy as I did when Minister for Local Government.  The Estimate, not having been prepared by the present Minister, but he being responsible for it, there is very little I can add.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points which have been made already by the former Minister with which I must deal at the commencement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It surprises me that a former Minister for Local Government who would normally be expected to have some real knowledge of the position could, when speaking on the Estimate of his successor, refer with some disparagement to the fact that Corporation building has extended too far out from the city centre. Surely Deputies are <Col N="1010" /> aware that no local authority building is permitted without the permission of the responsible Minister.  Every scheme, whether it be for the construction of houses or flats, whether it be for ten houses or a dozen flats or 500 houses, is submitted by the appropriate local authority and given ample, and sometimes too prolonged, examination in the Department of Local Government. Therefore when an ex-Minister of this Department is critical of this heading one wonders whether he should not look into his own conscience.</P>
    <P>There is another factor in that reference by the former Minister.  Up to 12 months ago, Dublin was growing very rapidly for a very prolonged number of years.  Adding very seriously to the already overcrowded position and slum conditions was the constant influx from the provinces.  I have not as yet heard, and I hope the present Minister can advise the House, how a local authority&mdash;whether it be in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or anywhere else&mdash;can stop Irishmen and Irish families from migrating to a city within their own shores.  Seeing that, for 30 years, no one has yet found even a glimmer of a solution to the problem of Irish men and women and Irish families leaving the country, it appears to me to be ludicrous to suggest, even by inference, that a local authority has only to hold up its hands and say: &ldquo;You cannot come in here. We have not enough room to build any more houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many times, and in many places, reference has been made to the fact that the City of Dublin has been spreading too far&mdash;as if anyone connected with the local authority could stop it from spreading.  It is true that possibly, in the course of the past ten years or so, a little more emphasis could have been placed on the construction of flats within the city boundary.  Anyone who is or who has been Minister for Local Government is, no doubt, aware that sites for flats are not acquired overnight, that plans are not prepared overnight and that flats are not built overnight.  No doubt approval has been given up to the present to the continued building on <Col N="1011" /> the perimeter of the city mainly because it is only by concentrating to a great extent on building houses around the outskirts that it is possible, to provide a large number of dwellings in a reasonable space of time.  However, that is not, I think, the problem for the future.</P>
    <P>The problem for the future as regards building&mdash;I should like to address these few remarks to the present Minister, in particular&mdash; appears to me to be a concentration on building within the city area.  We know that a limited number of sites are available.  In all, some 60 sites have been earmarked.  Some of them may readily be acquired while others may take some considerable time to acquire.  Nevertheless, everything possible should be done to expedite and simplify the machinery necessary to deal with the building problem in our city.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the possibility that there is over-building. A recent survey by the city medical officer shows that there are still some 13,000 families in Dublin City without adequate accommodation.  We know that, at times, there are difficulties in letting houses built on the very edge of the city.  Such difficulties have been experienced for many years.  They appear to be greater at times when attractive flats are nearing completion in the centre of the city.  Families sometimes feel that it would be much more convenient for them to be housed in flats in the city which are near their places of employment, their shopping centres, their churches and schools rather than on the outskirts of the city.  For that reason, they are sometimes most reluctant to accept accommodation four or five miles out from the city centre.  That is a perfectly natural and human position and one with which I do not think anyone could quarrel.</P>
    <P>The former Minister referred to the financial position.  I do not know whether, as far as building is concerned, it was the financial position or a policy but I do know that since 1951 there has been a steady reduction in the number of dwellings provided. <Col N="1012" /> There has been a more progressive reduction in the amount of employment given to building craftsmen engaged in the construction of either houses or flats in the city.  I hope that when the Minister is examining the many problems involved, he will give some attention to this aspect of them.</P>
    <P>Roads in rural Ireland are somewhat outside my experience and I feel some trepidation in commenting upon them; but surely it has been the recognised&mdash; and quite properly recognised&mdash;practice down the years to endeavour to marry two very worthy objects, the development of roads and the relief of unemployment in rural areas, especially among workers who, during some part of the year, can work on farms or on the bogs.  We are reaching a position in this country when the name of the great god, efficiency, is on everyone's lips, but purely from the angle of laying down a yard of road, while it might prove slightly less costly to lay it by machinery, I hope the Minister will bear in mind that the slight saving there may be&mdash;in some cases there will be possibly no saving in that approach&mdash;may very well result in a cost in another direction, the cost of trying to provide the family of the worker disemployed by this form of mechanisation with some form of unemployment insurance or relief.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend to the Minister that in his approach to these matters, he might take into account all the factors involved, including the factor that a spell of unemployment in a rural area especially is the greatest encouragement that any of us can imagine to those concerned to cast their eyes outside their own country for employment.  We are continually being advised that the one thing our country cannot stand indefinitely is the continued emigration of our people.  I would be pleased if the Minister would indicate that local authorities in the country and in the city here can carry on with the housing programme as far as it is in their power to do so.  I hope the Minister is in a position not to indicate that money will be recommended, but to give some assurance that the money will be available.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister for <Col N="1013" /> Local Government is not the Minister who can tell us that money will be available for specific purposes, but assurances have already been given that, as far as Dublin is concerned, the programme for housing under the corporation's own housing schemes and the programme of development under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts could proceed up to a maximum expenditure for the current year equal to that of last year&mdash;a total expenditure of £4,000,000.</P>
    <P>I hope we will be able to spend that amount of money and I hope the Minister in his directives to those who work directly under him or who are under his control, will assist us by performing an operation which has been referred to on many occasions, that is, the cutting of the red tape.</P>
    <P>The building of houses in Dublin is not confined to housing of the working classes and the situation of those who wish to build their own houses has become very difficult.  Towards the end of 1955 and last year, financial uncertainty created a number of very serious problems.  This year, conditions governing the issue of grants and loans from the Local Loans Fund appear to be creating problems of their own because two points of view appear to be taken as to whether, in certain circumstances, an applicant can qualify for a grant.  If an applicant does not qualify for a grant, he does not qualify for a loan and the house is not built.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to examine all the conditions governing the issue of loans and grants for those who wish to provide their own accommodation, with a view to seeing if there is any way in which he can ease the present difficulties.</P>
    <P>Grants have been made in increasing amounts in recent years for the purpose of encouraging people to repair their dwellings or repair their property. These grants are being availed of to a greater extent each year and I would again recommend to the Minister's attention this form of encouragement.</P>
    <P>The success of the efforts of local authorities depends to a great extent on the liaison that exists between the <Col N="1014" /> local authority and the Department.  I do not propose to criticise in any way the officers of the Department because the Minister will accept full responsibility, but I do say to the Minister, and say advisedly, that in recent years, on too many occasions, housing and development schemes have been held up because of a delay in giving sanction.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this problem which I would ask the Minister to take into account.  The question of cost where you are building a house is important; it is even more important if you are building 500 houses or 200 flats; but, when you come to build flats in a city area, whether it is the City of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or any other city, there is one factor that is not common where you are building on the outskirts of the city.  That factor is the cost of acquiring the site.  That cost, taken in conjunction with building costs, may inflate the cost of building a room by some hundreds of pounds.  I suggest in all seriousness to the Minister that when it comes to a question of examining housing and particularly flat building, from the point of view of cost, he should consider the cost of the site as a completely separate item.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, if you acquire a site which has been cleared or which has been occupied by semi-derelict houses or dwellings for a period of years, you may acquire at a very low cost and yet, within a quarter of a mile of that site, the cost of acquiring another site, equally suitable for flat development, may reach a very substantial figure.</P>
    <P>The problem in Dublin remains the housing of some thousands of families. That problem has been faced and tackled with greater or lesser success over a number of years.  The problem now, basically, is rapidly becoming the problem of constructing flats in the central city area.  That is due to the fact that the ground available is almost used up and, secondly, because of increasing transport costs, etc., the limit of building development is reached around the city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> In conclusion, I would again point out to the Minister that, since 1951, a period of six years, there has been a steady decline in the construction of dwellings in the city.  There has been a steadier and larger decline in the employment of craftsmen.  I would ask him, as the responsible Minister, to take whatever steps lie in his power to endeavour to arrest that decline and to continue the policy which has been the accepted policy, I am sure, of this House and of successive Governments over the years, of not resting until all families living in unsuitable, unsatisfactory or overcrowded conditions have decent homes of their own.</P>

      <P>Galway County Council also had a housing problem.  We were one of the first local authorities to adopt the supplementary housing grants scheme.  We first adopted it without a means test.  Later, the Minister, when he was Minister for Local Government previously, introduced a scheme which was very suitable for our county because it benefited the poorer sections of the community for whom the Act was primarily intended.  As a result of the State grants and supplementary grants, a great deal of useful work was done in County Galway, as, I am sure, was done in other counties throughout the State.</P>
      <P>However, about a year ago, we got into difficulties because we were accepting applications and, like Micawber, were hoping for something to turn up.  We found that there was no money forthcoming.  We continued to accept applications and carried on the scheme for supplementary housing grants, for new houses, reconstruction and installation of water and sewerage, up to the end of the financial year. Then the trouble was that people who had started to build houses or who were making provision for reconstruction or for installation of water and sewerage and who had entered into commitments with contractors or builders' suppliers found that no grants were forthcoming.  County councillors were pestered with letters and we made several appeals to the Department, all to no avail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> Recently we got a small instalment and I, in conjunction with other Deputies in the county, put down a Parliamentary Question last week to the Minister and he informed us that he has recommended the payment of £150,000 for these grants.  I am sure that news will be most welcome to applicants and I hope that that money will soon be issued to Galway County Council so that they may make payments that are long overdue.</P>
    <P>Having got that reply to the question, I made it my business to see the Secretary of Galway County Council on Saturday last and I find that the sum mentioned, large as it may seem and generous as it was on the Minister's part to announce it, will pay only the supplementary grants due up to last August.  If we are to carry out our commitments in full we will need another £30,000 or £60,000 from the Local Loans Fund.  We have discontinued the scheme now for this financial year but a lot of useful work was done and more remains to be done.  I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an assurance that we will be able to carry out our commitments.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the position regarding water supplies.  In our county we have several towns and villages which are still without a proper water supply.  We have sent up these schemes to the Department for approval and we have to await their decision.  My idea about the question of water supplies, and I hope that the Minister will go into the question some time, is that they should be taken out of the hands of local authorities and put on a national basis. I would like to see a board set up which would be a semi-State body such as Bord na Móna.  We could have a Bord Uisce.  It could be granted so much money and could provide water supplies on a regional basis throughout the country.  I have in mind a small town near my own village where I know that the cost of the water supply involved an enormous amount of money and still only supplies one small town with 20 or 30 houses.  If the water supplies were on a regional basis all the villages around the particular locality could be supplied.  A charge <Col N="1017" /> could be made for the water in a similar way to the charges made by the E.S.B. for electricity.  There could be a fixed rent so that every farmer and householder could avail of the supply. I could envisage the employment that this would give in rural Ireland and I can envisage the saving of labour that it would result in so far as the drawing of water is concerned.</P>
    <P>As the busiest time of the year when small farmers are cutting turf and thinning beet they are forced, for half their time, to travel with ponies and carts to rivers and lakes, which may be three or four miles away, to draw water.  They spend so much time drawing water that they would gladly pay the water rent if such a board was set up.  If we are to have the increased production which we are talking about, such a step would help production apart altogether from giving employment. We have rural electrification throughout the country in nearly every place now but to my mind this is more important.  I am not speaking about bathroom facilities so much as having running water on tap for the household and the farmyard.</P>
    <P>The only other remark which I will make on this Estimate is that I agree with Deputy Larkin about machinery. I would not like to see too much machinery replacing men in our county.  The road workers in our county are paying into a pension fund and they must work for 200 days in the year to qualify for that.  If we have unemployment and men laid off, owing to the fact that too much machinery is being used, that would not suit the economy of road workers in our county.  Most of them are small farmers or the sons of small farmers and most of them are pensionable servants.  I shall conclude by wishing the Minister the same success in this term of office as he had previously as Minister for Local Government and I hope he will continue to do the same useful work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks on this Estimate will be very brief.  I notice that it is for an amount rather similar to that for last year, approximately £4,700,000.  The present Minister is <Col N="1018" /> experienced in this Department, having held office before, and I feel and hope he will make a success of it and ensure that many improvements will be made within the ambit of local government.  I should like to refer to one particular point to which Deputy O'Donnell referred, that is to derelict sites which are such an eyesore throughout the whole country.  They are harmful to the very intensive tourist drive that is in progress at the present time.  I think I am right in saying that grants are available to local authorities for the eradication of these sites and for the replacing of them with small parks, perhaps, or with trees where they could be planted. I think the Minister should draw the attention of these authorities to that fact.  Sufficient importance is not being attached to the grants that are available for the eradication of these eyesores, as I term them.</P>
      <P>I think it was some time last year the ex-Minister for Lands brought in a Bill whereby legal difficulties with regard to the acquisition of land for afforestation would be eased in order to expedite the forestry drive.  The same thing could apply to derelict sites because very often the whole trouble lies in the fact that legal difficulties obtain when these sites are to be acquired by the various local authorities. If the Minister could intensify the drive to eradicate that trouble I think he would receive the thanks and commendation of everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year a lot of attention, and a lot of talk, was devoted to the question of loans for houses.  In the course of the various debates that year a lot of importance, and rightly so, was attached to Dublin and Cork Corporations. This year I think £4,000,000 has been allocated for building houses in Dublin.  I should like to remind the Minister that there are other places besides Dublin and Cork in this country. Even though the problem of housing is great in those cities there is also an acute problem down the country in other towns.  No matter how many houses are built, the same insatiable demand for more houses is there and I would impress on the Minister the urgency of dealing expeditiously with applicants for loans from counties such as my own county, <Col N="1019" /> Louth, and others outside Dublin and Cork.  It is only right to say that in proportion to the population and the demand for houses more importance should be attached to Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>I should also like to remind the Minister that there is a housing scheme pending in a place named Cocklehill in Blackrock, three or four miles outside Dundalk.  It is proposed to build a number of houses there.  The land on which the houses are to be built was acquired compulsorily some time ago. So far nothing has been done except that the Department some time ago sent down a request to the Louth County Council seeking a reappraisal of the means and conditions of the various applicants for these houses.  I think that was more or less a ruse to put this scheme on the long finger and to discourage the continuance of this housing drive.  I want to impress on the Minister that there is an acute demand for these houses and he will be doing a good day's work if he can expedite the matter.</P>
    <P>Regarding roads, last year the former Minister, Deputy O'Donnell, took a step forward, in my opinion and in the opinion of councils throughout the country, when he allocated £500,000 towards the improvement of county roads as against main roads.  It is a fact that most accidents occur on long, wide stretches of main road.  Motorists come along and see a long expanse of road ahead of them. They feel the sky is the limit so far as speed is concerned, that no such thing as an accident can happen.  Of course, the unexpected happens; they are not prepared for it and an accident occurs.</P>
    <P>Another good result of applying more money towards improving our county roads would be that it would aid our tourist drive.  Most of the county roads lead to tourist spots. Tourist centres are not to be found along the main roads; they are to be found in the hidden by-ways.  For that reason alone, if for no other, it would be a good thing if the Minister devoted more attention and more money to the repair and upkeep of county roads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> I notice in the Book of Estimates that this year more money is being allocated for the provision of sanitary services.  One of the sub-heads in that section relates to swimming pools. Here again I must strike a local note and ask the Minister if he intends to implement the decision taken last year to grant £6,000 towards the provision of a swimming pool at Blackrock, Dundalk. There is a local development association there, the Blackrock Development Association.  They are very anxious that this swimming pool be provided.  Blackrock is a tourist centre and a swimming pool there would be an added amenity and one which would be very much appreciated by many people.</P>
    <P>A proportion of the necessary money has been earmarked from the rates by Dundalk Urban Council and Louth County Council.  This is in addition to the local contribution collected from people interested in this project. These people realise that the swimming pool would be a great attraction in the area.  It was the Department of Finance that, more or less, promised the £6,000 would be given and I suppose these remarks should properly be addressed to them.  But the Department of Local Government did have a hand in it and I would ask the Minister, if he can, to help on this project at the most opportune time, which I hope will be soon.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have very much more to say except to wish the Minister success.  Although he is not on my side of the House I still wish him success.  I hope he will devote much attention to this very important Department. It is the Department in which there is the greatest liaison between the Government and local authorities. I hope that this time next year we may be able to look back on a year of progress in local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past few years, when I rose to speak on this Estimate, I endeavoured to spotlight the difficulties confronting Cork Corporation in regard to their housing programme and I make no apologies to anybody for opening on the same note again this evening.  I think it is generally accepted that the housing problems of <Col N="1021" /> this country have been largely solved in very many areas.  That has been done as a result of the very fine efforts of successive Governments and as a result of the intelligent and courageous manner in which local authorities have tackled those problems. No matter how critical we may be of one another from time to time, I think we should at some time stop, reflect and say that successive Governments have done a good job in rehousing our people.  All of us should take pride in that.</P>
      <P>However, there are still a few pockets, such as Dublin, Cork and perhaps the larger centres, where the problem is still a major one.  On former occasions here I gave details of specific cases of persons seeking rehousing in Cork.  I endeavoured to point out what a very grave social evil was represented by the typical cases I quoted.  I shall not bore the House by repeating those cases.  I am quite sure the Minister is well aware that we have a major problem in Cork City still and that we require something in the region of 4,000 houses before we can say we have solved that problem. No Party has lagged behind in facing up to it.  No individual member can claim greater credit than another in endeavouring to solve this problem. We had to go to the previous Minister for Local Government and we had to go to the present Minister when he was Minister on a former occasion.  I must say we were sympathetically received at all times.</P>
      <P>On this occasion the corporation, in my opinion, is faced with the most serious problem it has experienced in the last decade as far as the financing of its housing programme is concerned. So far, we have not been so sympathetically received.  I say &ldquo;so far&rdquo; because I feel that, as a result of representations, the Minister will see his way to take Cork Corporation, and particularly Cork City Deputies, into his confidence and discuss the matter with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As you are aware, Sir, the problem arose on this occasion because Cork Corporation were advised that the amount of money to be made available from the Local Loans Fund was such <Col N="1022" /> that it would not meet the requirements of their capital programme in the present financial year.  Up to last year the corporation had been in a position to finance its own capital programme from moneys secured in the open market.  It was because of the circumstances which existed last year that the corporation for the first time had to have access to the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>In the financial year 1956-57, Cork Corporation got from the Local Loans Fund £825,000 to meet its capital requirements.  I qualify that statement straight away by saying that at first it was intimated we were to get £750,000 but subsequently, on its being pointed out, during representations to the Minister, that such a sum was not sufficient to meet our commitments for house building and other capital works, we got a supplementary sum which brought the total up to £825,000.</P>
    <P>That is approximately our requirements this year.  The Minister will appreciate that any local authority, dealing with a large housing problem, must have its plans made in advance. We cannot wait until the end of one year to make our plans for the following 12 months.  Consequently, the house building programme of Cork Corporation for 1957-58 has been determined long ago.  Our requirements in that regard have been pointed out to the Minister.  The corporation unanimously decided to ask the Minister to receive a deputation of the five Cork City Deputies.  It was left to me to convey this message to the Minister on the phone and I was very disappointed when told that he refused to meet the five Deputies to discuss what is a major problem, not only to the people in Cork responsible for housing but to the many people who are awaiting new houses.</P>
    <P>I could imagine the Minister refusing to see me, but I do not see why he was so reluctant to meet his three colleagues&mdash;the Minister for Education, Deputy Healy and Deputy Galvin.  As I have said, the Minister absolutely refused to meet us.  I was sorely disappointed. I had not endeavoured to make political capital out of this matter.  Deputies Healy and Galvin <Col N="1023" /> can confirm that I felt the matter was too serious to be dealt with in any but a serious manner.  I wrote a personal letter to the Minister, couched in the most sober terms.  I endeavoured to put the case as straightforwardly as possible.  I outlined the serious position in Cork and the serious repercussions the Minister's decision would have, first of all on the people waiting for houses, and secondly on the employees engaged in the building industry and on the contractors.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, as well as our direct labour scheme we also build a considerable number of houses under the contract system.  In my letter, I appealed to the Minister to meet the Cork City Deputies.  I said that with our local knowledge we might be of help to the Minister.  I suggested particularly my own personal desire to be as helpful as possible in the matter and I offered my co-operation to the fullest extent.  After a delay which I am quite sure was unavoidable, the Minister replied to my letter, again refusing to meet the deputation.  In the last paragraph of his reply, he intimated that he did not intend to enter into any review of the present pace of building in Cork City.</P>
    <P>I was gravely disturbed by this letter and so were my colleagues in the Cork Corporation.  The Minister's own colleagues in the House were disturbed that, in spite of the major problem confronting the Corporation, they now have to cut back their house building programme instead of increasing its tempo.  We were advised by the Department that we would have to make adjustments in our programme which would result in a saving of £3,000 per month for six months and £6,000 per month for another six months on our direct labour schemes. We were advised to cut down on our contract schemes and to delay the start of other schemes.</P>
    <P>I hope and am confident that my colleagues who are members of the Minister's party will join with me in endeavouring to convey to the Minister the serious repercussions that would flow from such a state of affairs.  We have already cut down on our direct <Col N="1024" /> labour house-building schemes despite the fact that houses are badly needed, that we have a serious unemployment problem.  We had last week to lay off 40 or 50 men.  That is only the start. When we come to September we will have to postpone our contract scheme. I feel sure that Deputies Healy, and Galvin and the Minister for Education will not for one moment back up the Minister on the stand he is taking.</P>
    <P>At this stage I do not wish to produce press cuttings or to quote from contributions made during the election campaign in Cork or from advertisements issued in the newspapers addressed to people seeking houses and addressed to corporation tenants. I refrain from doing that because I am quite sure these statements were issued by the Fianna Fail candidates in Cork in good faith.  Having issued such statements in good faith, and having been returned on that programme, I challenge them that it is their duty now in this House, and in private with the Minister, to see that the programme they put before the people in Cork in regard to housing is implemented. In conclusion, I should like to wish the Minister every success in his efforts.  I should like to convey to him the knowledge that, as far as local government in Cork is concerned, he will have my full co-operation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;It is merely to clarify the position. The suggestion of the local authority is that they should build six unserviced cottages a distance of a quarter of a mile from the village of Ballinacurra.  If we are to build these cottages, we cannot give them the amenity of water, if we build them this distance away from the village; but in the village there is a water supply and if the cottage are built in the village, they can be serviced by piped water.  That is a very important amenity and adds very little, if anything, to the weekly rent.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There was no bother at <Col N="1028" /> all in getting sanction.  Sanction arrives for £200,000 and you will be waiting for the £200,000 for nine months; and when the nine months are up, you get £20,000 and the men who had built the houses are there waiting for their money and have no money to get.</P>
      <P>Deputy Casey complained about unemployment in the building trade in Cork.  That was the reason&mdash;there was no money to pay the grants and the loans which the county council was giving to the private builders who were building their own homes.  There was no money for the contractor; the contractor was unable to pay the builders' provider; the builders' provider provided no more material; and Deputy Casey's men had to walk the streets. As a matter of fact, I find, from the Minister's statement, that he has sanctioned £1,240,000 to be paid to banks, contractors and persons to whom the money was left due by his predecessor&mdash;on private building alone.</P>
      <P>Is it any wonder we have unemployment in the building trade?  However, that is only a small portion of the picture. In the South Cork Board of Health, our medical officers and inspectors carried out a housing survey. On that survey we decide the number of houses that it is proposed to build&mdash; 15, 16 or 20 houses, as the case may be&mdash;and send that up to the Department of Local Government for sanction. On this occasion there was no money in the kitty so the Minister and his officials got a brain wave.  Having held it up as long as they dared for three, four or five months, they sent down another circular to have a resurvey and to find out whether some of these houses&mdash;houses that were condemned by the medical officer&mdash;could not be repaired.  That was the manner in which the Minister succeeded in holding up housing.  My objection in this is to the employment of officials in the Department of Local Government for the purpose, not of expediting housing but of holding it up.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the manner in which this Department was administered during the past 12 months.  Would it not be more honest to say: &ldquo;There is no money here for that at the moment.  Wait until we get it&rdquo;?  Instead of that the Minister's officials were used in an endeavour to throw dust in people's eyes, absolutely regardless of the extra expenditure they were imposing on local authorities. Last week I instanced the case of a man for whom a site had been obtained for a rural cottage.  Sanction was sought from the Department as to the amount to be given for it, but that was left in the Minister's Department for seven months until the present Minister sanctioned it and sent it out. There are so many officials in that Department falling over one another&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we have nothing but the issuing of contrary Orders to the local authorities.  For example, I had to bring one instance before the manager about two months ago where four different officials of the local authority went out in turn to examine one site for a labourer's cottage.  The architect went out to inspect the site; the deputy county surveyor went out to inspect the site; then the housing engineer and the county surveyor inspected it.  They all passed it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have paid far more attention to the proposals of the Minister for Finance to-day in introducing the Budget if he had proposed a complete investigation into each Department with a view to the cutting down of surplus staff.  He made one statement here that the country could not carry that burden, and that is true.  Money is scarce now, and we know that when honey is scarce in the hive the drones will be killed.  Under instructions sent out by the previous Minister for Local Government we had the spectacle last month of having to ask the law adviser for a ruling as to <Col N="1030" /> which of the five heroes was to make the inspection and report.</P>
      <P>Surely we are not so prosperous that the ratepayers of this county or of any county or local authority can afford to pay five officials to inspect the site for one labourer's cottage.  That is only one of many instances that have occurred.  The contract stage was reached in respect of a large number of houses and sanction was sought from the Department for the tenders. Although those tenders were lower than practically any tenders previously accepted by the Department of Local Government, they were rejected and we were told to look for new tenders. I do not know whether they expected any of the building materials to fall in price or whether it was not another portion of the Department's instructions: &ldquo;Do anything but allow no more houses to be built.&rdquo; It was one of the two at any rate, but I cannot put my finger on which it was.</P>
      <P>However, the facts speak for themselves. The contract was £1,020 per house.  It was rejected.  A team of officials in the Department was doing nothing for the past six months, if not longer, except examining ways and means of holding up housing schemes.  That was their job.  We heard a lot of talk about expediting house building. We had a lot of warnings from the other side of the House to-day, but the present Minister has to find £1,340,000 which was left due by his predecessor to the private builders.  That money has to be found now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the liability to the Road Fund to 31st March, 1957, in respect of road maintenance and improvement grants and other liabilities, of £4,212,000.  That is another little item left due, unpaid.  Payments in respect of their existing liabilities to the Road Fund would be the first charge on the £4,787,000.  This amounts to £2,600,000, due to local authorities last year for road improvement and not paid.  This is a little bill that is left as a tail-end. The Minister has very decently come along now and added £900,000 to that, but he says that will have to be repaid by the Road Fund over a number of years.  I think it is time that we had <Col N="1031" /> a little straightening out of this Road Fund.  Could we be given the amount taken out of that fund by the Minister for Finance each year for the past ten years when preparing his Budget? Could we find out whether the Road Fund owes any of that £900,000 or whether the boot is not on the other foot?  That is information we should get, if the Minister will be kind enough to give it to us when he is concluding. If not, we shall have to get it by way of question and answer in the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised us on a former occasion that the Road Fund would not be raided again while he was in office, and he kept that promise.  I hope, when the accounting is being done now, that we shall have a straightening out of this item.</P>
    <P>I come now to another matter, namely, the attitude of assistant county managers towards the people who have to find the money.  Here, again, we have a load of red tape.  We have endless writing by officials who, apparently, have nothing else to do except to try to find something to occupy their spare time.  Or is it their overtime?</P>

      <P>If a labourer's cottage or a non-municipal house becomes vacant now in the South Cork area it takes 12 months before a new tenant is installed.  That is about the average. First of all, the housing inspector has to inspect the house.  He is followed by the medical officer, who inspects it all over again.  Then there is an examination of the applicants and one applicant is picked.  That is only the start of the trouble.  The next step is that the landlord receives a notice asking if he is going to demolish the house or carry out certain repairs to the house, and so forth.  The tenant will not be moved out until all that is finished.  According to what our legal adviser tells us, that could go on for ten months at least.  That is the instruction of the new manager whom we were presented with as a gift from Dublin.  Every week that one of those <Col N="1032" /> houses remains vacant represents a loss in rent and in income to the local authority.</P>
      <P>If a house remains vacant for a long period, as unfortunately houses do now from nine to 12 months, there is a repair bill of anything up to £20 or £30.  If there is a regulation of that type in the Department of Local Government at the moment, I am wondering when it arrived there.  Whose was the brainwave?  When we had the late assistant county manager, we had none of these delays.  The longest I ever saw a house vacant in that period was a month, but they are now vacant for 12 months.  I want that matter remedied also.</P>
      <P>These are only some of the matters I would like to go into briefly in this debate.  I am sorry the Minister is doing away with the Local Authority (Works) Act.  We did a lot of good work under it in Cork and we had hoped to do a little more.  However, I can quite understand the position of a Minister who had to find £1,340,000 to pay the debts of his predecessor in regard to private housing.  I beg the pardon of the House for not having the time to find out how much he had left due to local authorities in regard to housing.  I am sure there were another couple of million there, together with the £2,600,000 in road improvement grants.  The county councils were told that the money was there for them, but it never came.  The Minister who had to find all that has done a pretty good job and on behalf of the unfortunate people in Cork whom I know were just bankrupt, owing to the action of the previous Minister in the Department in withholding housing grants, I wish to thank the present Minister for the good job he has done.  I think it is only just to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he look over the number of secret instructions which were sent down to county managers of local authorities during the past 12 months&mdash;secret instructions in regard to the ways and means of holding up housing schemes and delaying progress in regard to other essential matters.  Let him look up these, scrap them and notify their lordships, the county managers, that they have <Col N="1033" /> been scrapped.  If he does that, he will be doing a good day's work for us who are members of local authorities.  We do not want to be pressed into the position of having to come before a local authority seeking the suspension of a county manager, but, if put to it, we will do it.  We do not want to be placed in that awkward position but neither can we afford, as representatives of the ratepayers, to lose thousands of pounds each year under the policy which was carried out in regard to housing.  It is something we are not prepared to stand for.  I have given the facts as I know them and I have given nothing but facts.</P>

He moans and groans and points an accusing finger at the Minister's predecessor in regard to that situation, at a time when there are more and more of Deputy Casey's men walking more and more of the streets of Cork City because Deputy O'Donnell's successor deliberately denied to Cork Corporation an opportunity of continuing the building schemes which were initiated under the Minister's predecessor.</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting local authority building schemes as a way of absorbing unemployed men.  I agree that if we have not got the money, we must cut our cloth according to our measure; but if we are to cut our cloth, let us cut it in matters which are not quite as close to the moral and social bone in Cork City as in Dublin City.  We are not simply discussing a way of dealing with unemployment when we ask the Minister to see the five Cork Deputies on the question of housing in Cork.  We are dealing with the lives of men and women.  We are dealing with the surroundings in which children are to be brought up, in which the fundamental unit of our society, the family, has to grow and flourish.  I am quite sure there is no need for me to recite to the Minister the type of cases with which we have to deal in Cork City.  I am quite certain they have been brought to his notice both in his present short term of office and in his previous terms.</P>
      <P>There are many cases in Cork City where a man, his wife and three children have to sleep, eat, cook and live in one small room.  If the Minister inquires from the housing authority in Cork, he will find that what I am saying is no exaggeration. It is on behalf of these people that the five Cork City Deputies, not just the Minister's own Deputies or the Opposition Deputies, approached the Minister and asked to see him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be very glad if the need had not arisen for me to talk about the matters which I broached.  We felt it was in the interests of the citizens of <Col N="1035" /> Cork and the social life not only of the older generation but particularly of those growing up.  We felt the Minister ought to meet us and give sympathetic consideration to the problems we put before him.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not seen fit to meet the five Deputies from the second largest city in the country and, therefore, it is necessary for me to tell him what I would have been glad to tell him in private, that there is a grave and terrible necessity and wherever the Minister looks to make savings, he should make available to Cork City funds for which Cork Corporation&mdash;a corporation in which the Minister's Party holds the majority of the seats&mdash; have asked.  Again, I am not suggesting that it is purely a means of absorbing some of the unemployed.  I am suggesting, however, that if the Minister looked into it, there might be ways and means by which we could produce as many houses with less expenditure than we have had in the past.</P>
    <P>For many years, we of Cork Corporation and we who represent Cork City in this Chamber have been imploring the Minister's Department to approach the question of the housing of the working classes in a realistic fashion. We have told them that the best judges of the proper type of local authority houses are those who have to live in them.  We have told them that those who have to live in them have a right to tell the Minister, through their representatives here, the types of houses in which they wish to live.  We have told them that if it comes to a decision by the Minister on the advice of his advisers, who certainly have never lived in these types of houses, or the views of those who had to live in them, he might be well advised to adopt the hard, practical views of the men and women who have had to live in these houses, pay the rents for them and bring up their families in them, because that process will continue so long as these houses are there.  Men and women will have to live in them, pay the rent for them and bring up their families in them.  That is why we want houses properly adapted to that purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> We have had in Cork City, and I am sure it happens in every city on which the Department forces its views in regard to housing, a system under which the Department insists that a certain type of house, with a certain amount of ground at the side of the road which is a certain size, must be built.  Time and again, the Minister and the Minister's predecessor&mdash;I am not saying this now in criticism of the present Minister or of his Party since they took office recently&mdash;have been told that the people who have to live in them do not want that sort of house, that there is a more economic sort of house that can be built, where families can be brought up happily and in good health.</P>
    <P>Time and again, it has been pointed out that these people do not want houses built 12 to the acre.  They want terrace houses, small houses which are economical to keep, to heat and to pay for.  For some strange reason adumbrated by some strange people in the Department, you must have 12 houses to the acre and the Cork Corporation had to go down on their knees to the Minister's predecessor before they got some small concession in the matter.  I think they may now build 15 houses to the acre.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Cork Corporation could save quite a lot of money, and we in Cork would be anxious and happy to save that money, by building smaller houses on less ground, by building houses which a man could keep on much less money from the point of view of furniture, floor covering, coal, gas and electricity.  I would ask the Minister to approach the problem earnestly.  It is a practical way of dealing with the many difficulties which the Minister's Department is now meeting in regard to housing.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that the results of the Minister's research into that matter, and any Order he may see fit to make, will not immediately be felt.  Meantime, I beseech him to look into the question of what he can do in regard to continuing the rate of housing in Cork City.  We were in the unfortunate position that at one stage more houses were being built in Waterford and in Limerick than in Cork City.  I am not <Col N="1037" /> saying that that is the fault of the Minister or of his Department.  The fault in that regard lies locally.  Now, however, that Cork Corporation have got to grips with the problem and that they and the officials are anxious to grapple with it, as a special act of grace, I would appeal to the Minister to investigate ways and means of winning the race against disease and social evils.</P>
    <P>You cannot expect a man to bring up his children to love and respect the family surroundings if these surroundings are simply one filthy room in a filthy garret where the smells of cooking pervade the place all day.  The children go into the street.  Heaven knows what they learn there, possibly to their social or moral detriment, apart altogether from the possible damage to their health.  There is not much point in building sanatoria to cater for such types of persons afterwards, when we could take the more fundamental step of preventing the spread of these germs in the homes which eventually drive the disease-ridden bodies into sanatoria and hospitals. I am quite sure I need not stress the importance of that aspect because I feel certain it has been brought home to the Minister before this.</P>
    <P>As I have been on the question of building smaller houses, even for large families, I would ask the Minister also to try to impress on local authorities the need to build houses for newly-weds, for old couples who have run their race and set their families up in life and who now live alone, for the widow and for the widower.  There are many such people not alone in my constituency but in any big city or town in this country.  Marriages will continue to be made and young couples will continue to look for houses in which to spend the early years of their married life.  If we build more houses of the bungalow type, we will avoid many social evils and young couples will sometimes be enabled to set up earlier in life.  In the course of time, they will have families and they will then move out of such houses to larger houses, making way for more young couples coming along. <Col N="1038" /> These houses would fill a great social need in regard to newly-weds and also in regard to some older people who are now more or less thrown out on the side of the street, deserted, or else who have to live with their families where there is the danger of discord in a mother-in-law or a father-in-law, son-in-law or daughter-in-law atmosphere. Furthermore, these houses are cheaper to build than the larger type of house which we have been providing and there is just as great a need for them as there is for the larger type of house.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to draw to the attention of local authorities the mandatory nature of the letting regulations under which local authorities should let their houses to tenants.  I personally know of cases where men and women who are not at all entitled to local authority houses have been given them.  These houses are built for a certain type of person with a certain type of family.  The rights of such families should be jealously guarded and nobody else should be allowed into these houses until the needs in regard to the sections of the community for which the houses were built have been filled.</P>
    <P>I am sincere in wishing the Minister well in the difficulties he has to meet. I appreciate that they are there and that they are very real.  I would ask him also to bear in mind that our difficulties in Cork City are very real and very practical.  They should not be looked upon simply as temporary measures to keep somebody in employment. It is bad enough to know that from 40 to 50 men will be unemployed in Cork as a result of what the Minister said he feels he must do, but it is worse to know that social consequences of a very serious type follow.</P>
    <P>I would not suggest that we must spend money simply for employment. In building houses of that nature, native timber, native materials and other commodities produced almost entirely in this country are being used; native labour is being used.  You are building houses which are always looked upon as a good investment because there are always people ready to pay a rent for them and the Minister <Col N="1039" /> will at least get some of the money back rapidly.  It is not as if we were asking the Minister to put his money into some non-productive scheme.  I should be sorry to think that the Minister would look upon such schemes as unproductive.  They are productive of all that is best in our national life, of happiness in the home, of good health, of proper social and moral qualities for which we look in the younger generation in this nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what his view is regarding the Dublin Housing Consultative Council.  I appreciate that he has not been long in office and that possibly he could not get round to deal with this council which was reconstituted by his predecessor in August last.  When this consultative council was set up in 1948 by the late Deputy Murphy, then Minister for Local Government, there was a complete reversal of the position that exists to-day. There was a shortage of houses and of skilled labour and a great deal of uncertainty regarding the Dublin-Howth main drainage scheme.  It could also be said that there was then no real long-term plan.  To-day there is a complete change.  The great majority of the overcrowded families have been housed by Dublin Corporation.  There is no shortage of labour and I think the main drainage question is settled at last.  The corporation have now reached the position where they are dealing with the housing of small families and it is therefore reasonable to ask: is there a necessity for the council to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have attended many meetings of this council and its members are all very keen and competent people, most anxious to co-operate in solving the difficulties that arise in regard to housing problems.  Recently I believe the members of the council are conscious of an air of futility at their meetings because they are going over work already carried out by the Dublin Corporation and the corporation's housing committee.  One cannot blame these people who are not members of a local authority&mdash;they are trade union officials, representatives of churches <Col N="1040" /> and schools and other outside bodies&mdash; if they feel frustrated.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister, if he decides that this council should continue, that he should ask the council to deal with some specialised work that will restore some life to the building industry, and that I think is very important.  The members of the council would like to know exactly where they stand.  Since it was set up, the terms of reference have not changed.  I would ask the Minister and his officials when they come to consider this matter to bear in mind what I have said.  As reconstituted by the Minister's predecessor, I think the council consists of very competent persons and it is unfair to them to be asked to come to meeting after meeting to listen to a re-hash of what the corporation has done or intends to do.</P>
    <P>I hope the previous Minister will not think that I am critical of the council itself.  When it was set up the idea was certainly a good one and I would like to see the council getting down to some useful work.</P>
    <P>I do not know what has been said up to this regarding Small Dwellings Act activities but I think every effort should be made to encourage these loans.  There has been a slowing down in applications&mdash;I am speaking from the Dublin end of it&mdash;for various reasons.  To my mind, money allocated under the Small Dwellings Act is very wise expenditure because it provides a man with a home for his family and gives him a certain amount of pride in not being a liability upon the State or the local authority.  It gives him a chance to have a reasonably happy life&mdash;provided he has not a nagging wife or a television set.  No matter what the difficulties, we should ensure there would be no hold-up in Small Dwellings Act activities in Dublin, Cork or elsewhere, and anything the Minister can do to provide money and to approve schemes should be done.</P>

      <P>And they will continue to do it all along the line.  With other organisations they can certainly serve a useful purpose in providing what everyone here would like to see &mdash;decent homes for our people.  As Deputy Casey said, all Parties and all Governments have done their best to solve that problem which cannot be solved unless there is co-operation between the Government, the local authorities, workers and trade unions.</P>
      <P>To emphasise the popularity of schemes under the Small Dwellings Act it is interesting to note how few people surrender their houses.  The great majority make a brave effort to maintain their houses and meet repayments. Although many thousands of Small Dwellings Act loans were issued by Dublin Corporation, there are only 22 vacant houses on the corporation's hands to-day.  I think that is a tribute to the man who makes an effort to buy his own house.  From 1948 to April, 1957, 5,282 loans amounting to £8,992,355 were issued for small dwellings by Dublin Corporation. There are possibly more since before 1948.  That is a fair share of money and the average loan would amount to £1,400.</P>
      <P>It is to the credit of those people who made the effort to provide their own homes that, of that number, there are only 22 houses on the hands of Dublin Corporation to-day and they are possibly cases where the bread-winner died or there were some other difficulties.  It is a great tribute to everyone concerned and abundant evidence that the provisions of loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts certainly should be encouraged in every way by the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter that is causing some concern to Dublin Corporation at the present time, that is, the question of vandalism, especially in public parks.  Recently, at a meeting of a committee of which I am a member, very serious complaints were received that park attendants were attacked by young, troublesome fellows and, even worse than that, that there were very serious crimes committed in public parks.  That is a matter that requires <Col N="1042" /> serious attention.  My own view is that Dublin Corporation will need to recruit younger men as attendants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>My main reason for mentioning it is that I feel park rangers or attendants should have greater powers, powers like those vested in harbour police.  If Dublin Corporation or any other local authority appeal to the Minister to introduce legislation to give them such powers, it should be considered very favourably indeed.  It is very important that this sort of serious crime should be clamped down on right away.  While park attendants have given great service to Dublin Corporation, some of them are getting on in years and are not able to cope with these attacks by these very active, troublesome people.</P>
      <P>The other crimes that were complained about are more serious and by the time the guard arrives, these people are gone.  If park attendants had more powers, it would be a great help and I suggest that the Minister should favourably consider any proposition towards that end that may come from any local authority to the Department during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to plans submitted to the Department by Dublin Corporation, there have been a few delays, but not many.  We have got a great deal of co-operation from the Department in the ordinary housing programme for rented houses.  Dublin Corporation have built 33,834 dwellings, and that is quite a good record.  Of those, 5,311 are tenant purchased, the balance are let on weekly tenancies.  We have still a fairly large programme.  We have dealt with the majority of the large families and are now dealing with the smaller families.  That raises the <Col N="1043" /> problem of the subsidies given to local authorities.  For dwellings provided out of a State contribution, we got two-thirds for the major subsidy and one-third of the minor subsidy.  Now that we have dealt with the larger families and have come to deal with the smaller families who are living in unfit dwellings, finance becomes a problem.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that there are many thousands of families living in corporation houses as sub-tenants.  If the corporation houses them, they are not entitled to any subsidy.  These are matters that the Minister and the Department should take into consideration. There is not much that we can do about these sub-tenants.  A son of the tenant may get married and may bring his wife into the house or the daughter may get married and bring in her husband.  These people cannot be thrown out; they must have somewhere to live.  The position is that they are not eligible for the major subsidy.  Following a review last year, the corporation decided not to confine the allocation of houses exclusively to maximum subsidy cases.  At the present time we are getting applications from minor subsidy cases.  The Department should listen to the corporation's views on the question of the minor subsidy.  It represents a big problem, especially where there is overcrowding in corporation houses.  I realise that we have received generous grants from the Department through the years and we do not want to be considered as being like Oliver Twist, asking for more, but we must ask for more in view of the very great problem facing us which we are anxious to solve in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the points I have made.  I should certainly like to hear his views on the question of the Dublin Consultative Council.  I do not mention it in any critical way, but I do think that it could do a certain amount of useful work.  At the moment there is an air of futility which I should like to see cleared away.</P>

      <P>Deputy Coburn mentioned the importance of co-operation between the Department of Local Government and the local authorities. I fully agree.  We all realise the importance of the parts played by local authorities and the Department.  We also appreciate that in rural Ireland the Department of Local Government plays a more important part in relation to the everyday problems of the people than any other Department.  Therefore, irrespective of what Government may be in power or what Minister may be in charge of the Department, success in this field of activity depends on co-operation.</P>
      <P>I will be candid in speaking on this Estimate and say that the Department of Local Government was not the outstanding Department of the late inter-Party Government.  We had much difficulty there&mdash;we are not hiding the fact&mdash;but it must be understood that when we address our remarks to a Minister for Local Government, those remarks indirectly apply to the Minister for Finance because, no matter what the Minister for Local Government may consider advisable, he may find greater difficulties in securing the green light from the Minister for Finance than Deputies may find in their endeavours to secure advantages for their constituencies from the Minister for Local Government.  Nevertheless, the Minister for Local Government must be prepared to accept responsibility.  I am quite prepared to admit that we had many difficulties in the past and I hope that in the future we will not be faced with a continuation of these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to roads, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to one important aspect in regard to their construction.  In doing so I consider it only fair to give credit to the Minister for Local Government in the last Government, Deputy O'Donnell, at least in so far as the question of the use of machinery in County Cork was concerned.  We all understand the advisability and necessity for using machinery in the construction of roads but the question arises to what extent the use of machinery is advisable.  To what extent can local authorities continue <Col N="1045" /> on a spree of buying imported machinery?  As a member of the Cork County Council I had hoped that my colleague, Deputy Corry, would lay aside the Minister's brief and draw particular attention to the problem that we have had of spending so much money on the purchase of imported machinery.  As I say credit is due to Deputy O'Donnell because as Minister for Local Government he did take note of our complaints and decided, in our opinion wisely, not to give sanction to the purchase of additional machinery.</P>
    <P>It is a strange fact but it is true that in some local authority areas, irrespective of the fact that sufficient money is not being provided through the annual estimates, coupled with the annual grants, to give full employment on the roads for the full 12 months of the year, it still seems to be a convenient policy with county managers and county engineers to advise the members of local authorities on the importance of continuing a policy of buying more machinery.  The policy is to buy more machinery, use it on the roads for a few months and then leave it idle in county council yards for the rest of the year.  That has been the policy in the past and I sincerely hope that the present Minister for Local Government will make sure that the action of his predecessor in regard to refusing to give sanction for the purchase of additional machinery, in Cork at any rate, will form the policy of the future, especially as the livelihood of so many road workers will always be at stake.</P>
    <P>Another point in relation to roads to which I would like to refer is that I understand that at intervals there are conferences in the Minister's Department between the Minister and his advisers and the various surveyors in each county regarding the various types of road construction.  In the last few years I have seen a departure from what we might really say were the old but trusted methods used in the construction of roads, with a foundation of solid stone.  We were told that new methods were better and that the new methods gave us more mileage at a cheaper cost.  Apparently when the <Col N="1046" /> local engineers advised the members of the local authorities on this policy they were doing so at the behest of the Minister for Local Government and his Department.  Let me say here to-night, and I speak from experience, that this new departure in relation to the gravelling and tarring of roads will cost each local authority a colossal amount of money, within the next four or five years, through the repairing of these roads.  Already we are getting proof of the unsatisfactory nature of this new type of road-making.  I consider it essential that the Minister should again inquire into the matter to see whether this new policy will be the policy of the future or whether the slower but surer policy of a solid stone foundation will again be put into operation.</P>
    <P>The new method has proved conclusively in County Cork (1) that there is an unsatisfactory finish on the roads, (2) that there is less work and fewer days of employment for the road workers and (3) that there were very large sums of money available for contractors who are able to get rid of a type of gravel for the roads that could not be used for any other purpose.  The ratepayers in Cork and elsewhere, if they are not already suffering from this new departure, will find that they will be suffering from it within the next few years and that new methods very often do not prove best.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, as Deputy Corry also said he was sorry, to hear of the suspension of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I remember in 1948 when the then Minister introduced that Act.  He was a man who spoke with a knowledge of the advantages which would accrue from this important measure, a man with 25 years of solid experience behind him, 25 years of unbroken membership with a county council.  That was the late Deputy T. J. Murphy, God rest his soul.</P>
    <P>I quite understand there was opposition at that time to the introduction of that Act but Deputy Corry was not one of those who opposed it.  He knew the advantages that could follow from it.  I am very sorry to see that we now find it necessary, apparently, to suspend that Act.  I hope that <Col N="1047" /> wiser counsels will prevail.  I would be satisfied if the Minister had informed the House that works under this heading would be suspended, perhaps because of the lack of funds, but I would be most disappointed if I thought that it was being shelved and would not be thought of again.  My words to the Minister may not mean anything, but perhaps a recommendation from Deputy Corry to a Minister of his own Party, as one who realised the importance of the work that could be done under this Act and who supported its introduction, could help the position.  I would ask the Minister to have the matter reinvestigated.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing, I was surprised at Deputy Barrett's statement in relation to the type of person who is getting a tenaney.  I do not know what system is in operation in other local authorities but I do know that in South Cork the tenancy of houses has never been influenced by the members because of the satisfactory way it has been handled by a county housing superintendent, who is outstanding in every way, and by a county medical officer who does not believe in such a thing as favour.  The county medical officer realises his duty to be fair to everyone and he has been fair to everyone.  In regard to the tenancies of houses in our constituency, be they village type houses or rural cottages, we can always say that everything is above board.</P>
    <P>For some years past grants have been given to persons building their own houses.  As Deputy Casey said, over the past years, irrespective of what Government was in power, we can see an improvement in the situation. At present, people can avail of grants up to £250 or £275.  In certain circumstances they may be able to avail of grants from the local authorities also.  All that helps, but applicants still have a very high hurdle to surmount.  An applicant may be lucky enough, for example, to secure a loan of £1,000 from Cork County Council.  He will find, however, that repayment of that £1,000 amount to £2,400 or £2,500 over a 35 year period. <Col N="1048" /> I believe it is essential that we should give the people ineligible for council houses, particularly white collar workers, the opportunity of building their own houses.  We should co-operate with them in every way.  In regard to the giving of grants and the repayment of loans, would it be possible for the Minister and his Department to co-operate with local authorities so that a lesser rate of interest might be charged to applicants?  I am not demanding that from the Minister. I have no right to demand it from a Government I may not be supporting. I did not do so in the past. I am merely making a suggestion.  I am convinced that the feasibility of any suggestion put to me will be considered by the present Minister.  I would like him to see if he could implement this suggestion.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves in a dangerous position as regards housing at present. In Munster, Leinster, Connaught and that part of Ulster which is ours, we find that a very high number of houses are the property of local authorities. There are schemes whereby the tenants of these houses may purchase them but these schemes are not always successful. If we could in future give a greater inducement to people to build their own homes, instead of depending on local authorities for the temporary tenancy of a house, I believe we would be giving those people the greater sense of security which would come from their ownership of their own homes.</P>
    <P>The point on which I wish to conclude was mentioned by Deputy Corry. He dealt with it briefly.  I think the Minister's brief upset him a little and he did not want to be too hard.  Two years ago and three years ago I drew attention to this matter.  It may be considered a recurring item and is not a complaint against one Minister only. I always understood that it was essential by law in this country that all trade union organisations should have a licence for negotiation.  It has applied in every case except one.  It seems that no licence is necessary in the case of the County Managers' Association.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to understand <Col N="1049" /> that the responsibility is his.  I am asking again, as I have in the past: who pays the travelling and away-from-home expenses of such people when called by the Minister to meet him or his officials in the Custom House?  I do so, not in a mean, vindictive way, but because I am satisfied that the results are most harmful to the interests of the Minister, the local authorities and the people generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry rightly referred to the number of circulars issued by the Minister for Local Government to county managers and assistant county managers.  We have heard more statements made by managers and assistant county managers about their rights and their conferences with the Minister for Local Government than anyone would wish for.  We have now arrived at the stage that, at times, circulars are spoken of, not issued, by members of this association informing us that certain decisions are being taken.  It is made clear at once by these responsible officers that they are prepared to refuse to co-operate with members of local authorities because they seem to think they have the Minister for Local Government and his Department behind them.</P>
    <P>I started by saying I fully agreed with Deputy Coburn in his remarks about co-operation.  While I am in favour of a system of county management, and although I spoke in favour of the amending Act introduced here in the last couple of years, I do not want a system which would give the right to a Minister for Local Government and other people down the country to ride rough-shod over the members of local councils.  These people should co-operate with the local authorities.  It is true that members of local authorities have been given some protection in the recent Act by reason of a clause in it which gives them the right of demanding a manager to do a certain thing and of going so far as calling for his suspension if they can prove such is warranted.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I say I hope the time for circulars is finished; I hope the circulars which in the past were sent out telling local authorities how they <Col N="1050" /> should thatch the roofs of county council cottages are finished with.  We saw a lot of that, not between 1952 and 1954, but in the last couple of years.  We in the Labour Party had occasion to speak very plainly about what we were prepared to accept in that regard.  If we are to hope for success in relation to housing, in relation to water and sewerage schemes, this bottleneck system in the Department of Local Government&mdash;the system which has meant hold-ups in tenders for house-building, the system which has been the cause of so much disagreement in local authorities&mdash; must be broken.  If that system is to continue, let the Minister realise that he will not receive the co-operation he should receive.  We hope to see the end of the era of circular, circular, nothing but circular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is perhaps the most important Estimate that comes before the House and those of us who are members of local authorities are always anxious to seize the opportunity perhaps to repeat what we have been saying year after year, the things we think should be done and which are not done and the things which are done which we think should not be done.</P>
      <P>Most of the speakers so far have confined themselves to particular items of administration in regard to the work of local authorities.  Before I deal with the particular items that concern me, I should like again to stress a very important point&mdash;a point on which I have been harping year after year&mdash;namely, the growing burden of administration and its cost to local authorities.  I do not know when a Minister may undertake a complete overhaul of our entire local government system, but I do know that the burden of local administration is growing out of proportion to the capabilities of those who are handling it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increasing rate on agricultural land and property is something that will have to be tackled sooner or later. They are two separate points.  The question of the increasing burden of local administration is due to the fact that many things are divided between <Col N="1051" /> central and local authority, grants from the Exchequer being always accompanied by a call for a proportionate contribution from the local authority.  Consequently, the amount of work is increasing and the amount of the rates going up annually until we have reached the stage where we wonder how far we can ask the rate-payer to come to the aid of the not-so-well-off, since he is rapidly entering that category himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with the increasing rate and all through the year the local authority members request the County Manager and the various officials to give sympathetic attention to this and that scheme.  It may be the provision of water for a few tenants in a rural area, the reduction of a hospital bill for some patient who had to pay more than he could afford.  Every day we are acting as the buffer between the public and the various officials in trying to get little improvements here and there for the benefit of people.  Then, when it comes to the annual rates meeting, we all set out to try to reduce the rates which we have been responsible, to a great extent, for increasing during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a system which calls for review, a system which will have to be amended sooner or later.  The impact of these schemes on the local authority, <Col N="1052" /> since it comes gradually, has not been felt until recently and I think it is the utmost hypocrisy for members of local authorities to talk about economies on the eve of the striking of a rate, when they themselves have been responsible during the year for increasing that rate though advocating various schemes on behalf of some taxpayer or ratepayer.</P>

      <P>I must say that in local government the question of political favouritism does not arise very much.  Up to the time the previous Minister took office, many of us had divergent views on the question of the operation of the managerial system.  I for one felt that certain amendments were necessary.  I am not saying this for the purpose of casting any aspersions on the former Minister, but he promised and brought in a Bill for the purpose of amending the Managerial Act.  I think there never was an Act which proved more of a damp squib than did the Act of last year known as the City and County Management (Amendment) Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  It would need to be.  The Act made no provision for this point.  When listening to Deputy Desmond a while ago, I was wishing that he had made that speech on the passage of the Bill when it was before the House.  To-night he deplored the system whereby a good deal of the direction and control of local authorities comes by way of circular from the Department in Dublin.  I know the Department feel that unanimity in the matter of local administration is necessary and that a good deal of direction, with the right of approval of this, that and the other from the Custom House is necessary.  At the same time, those of us who are members of local authorities very often feel that we are not regarded as being responsible local administrators, when we have to sit by and wait for direction from the top; and when we do suggest anything we have to get it vetoed or approved by the same central authority.  I agree that at times and in some councils it is necessary, but I <Col N="1053" /> think we are inclined to move too far in that direction.</P>
      <P>Before going from the over-all picture of local government as it is operating generally, I would like again to appeal to the Minister to set up a committee in his Department to examine the question of revaluation throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I would find it very hard.  The whole system, as it at present depends on the local rate, is outmoded and obsolete.  The Ministers responsible should jointly make an effort to ensure that the whole question is examined, with a view to its amendment at the earliest possible time, if we are to continue administering from local authorities the many schemes which are passed on from the various Departments in Dublin.  The Departments <Col N="1054" /> of Health, Social Welfare and Local Government, practically every Department of State, are now passing on to local authorities the administration of new legislation.  At the same time, the limitations of the managerial system do not give local administrators much scope in the administration of those schemes.</P>
      <P>Passing from the general to the particular, I should like to refer to housing. I am not in agreement with all those who say that our housing problem is solved or almost solved.  It is right to admit that we have reached a stage where the ribbon building of tenant houses in villages and towns may be nearing completion, or reaching saturation point.  That is a debatable point.  The history of housing in this country over the last decade is sad enough.  We were being pressed at the time by every Minister to go full steam ahead.  The boot was on the accelerator; then it went rapidly on the brake and we were suddenly told that we were reaching saturation point with regard to houses.  The brake was jammed on and I am afraid the impact dislocated or unseated many workers at the time.  In fact, I think it was contributory to unseating Deputy O'Donnell himself.</P>

      <P>Not many houses are required in towns.  I am about to talk about rural housing in hamlets and townlands and I intend to say a few things on that subject.  We in Donegal initiated one of the best schemes known in this country, when we embarked on the &ldquo;specific instance cottage&rdquo;.  It was a scheme under which the county council undertook to build a cottage for a smallholder up to a valuation of £5.  We set that as a limit, with a view to raising the limit when it became necessary.  We had many applications.  The first venture went slowly, until we got into our stride, acquired the knack of putting through the acquisition of sites and so on, more expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first batch of 80 houses went rather slowly, but then we moved more <Col N="1055" /> rapidly.  We gave a tenant a selection, a choice of the plans of three different houses.  We said: &ldquo;No. 1 would cost you approximately 10/&ndash; a week, No. 2, 12/6 and No. 3, 15/&ndash;; which are you having?&rdquo; The applicant gave the site free.  He completed the particulars on his form of application, they were duly investigated and, everything being found in conformity with the scheme outlined, a decision was taken to build his house.  That house was subject to the terms of the Local Authorities (Cottage Purchase) Agreement, just the same as other cottages.  He could have it consolidated with his holding in due course and could pay the rent together with his land annuities in one receivable order.</P>
    <P>That scheme was going admirably until last June.  There are yet in the Department of Local Government&mdash;unless they were released within the last few days&mdash;many applications for such houses.  When the scheme was mooted, planned and approved of, each application was subject to approval by the Department of Local Government. There are proposals for the building of upwards of 100 houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing political in this.  I have already spoken to the Minister and I am appealing to him now, using this House as a medium, to give the release of these applications his immediate consideration.  It is a commendable scheme and one that merits better attention.  If the local authority is satisfied that the four or five different contractors who have tendered for these houses have given a competitive price, then there is no reason whatever to hold them up.  Until we have completed our work in that direction, we cannot say that our housing problem is by any means solved, and we can go on building under that scheme more and more houses over the next five years.  By that scheme, in the Donegal congested areas, where the valuation is low, you will succeed in solving the rural slum problem which is very much with us still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the people who speak about emigration do not realise that young <Col N="1057" /> men who are brought up in poor thatched cabins, however respectable they may be, do not want to marry and settle down in houses where their parents and a few brothers and sisters are already living.  They prefer to go to Birmingham or elsewhere, live in a flat and work for a week's pay rather than live under those conditions at home.  One of the contributing factors to increased emigration from the congested areas&mdash;and I say this in all seriousness&mdash;is the lack of proper housing accommodation.  I would like the Minister to keep that in mind in future in dealing with the type of houses necessary for the purpose of solving the rural slum problem.</P>
    <P>The question of roads has already been pretty well covered by all the other speakers.  I do not propose to repeat what has already been said, but I am glad that the Minister has come to the aid of the Road Fund to the extent of £900,000, even though it may have to be paid back over a number of years, to maintain the fund at the same level at which it would have been, had the Suez crisis not intervened to rob the fund of part of its revenue.  I should say that, in addition to the Suez crisis, it was the Minister for Finance crisis which robbed us of £500,000 last year. Between Colonel Nasser and the Minister for Finance, the Road Fund was rather sorely depleted.  It is indeed surprising that it was not more depleted, and I am surprised personally that £900,000 will bring it up to the level which we might have expected, had the fund been left intact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anywhere, at the crossroads or in the Dáil.  However, I do congratulate the Minister on maintaining the same standard of grant as we had last year, in spite of the great difficulties he had to surmount, because <Col N="1058" /> local authorities are the greatest employers of labour in this country. Every pound voted for the roads programme, no matter what type of grant it may be, whether it is under the Employment Schemes Vote, the Local Authorities (Works) Act or the ordinary roads programme, it is a pound for the workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the point.  It has always been spent in this country.  I was anxious, and had advocated in the House some two or three years ago, that greater attention be paid to county roads, and the Minister saw fit to ignore my pleadings at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He brought in two Estimates in which he made no provision for any change in the system of the allocation of grants.  Then suddenly, in the middle of the roads programme, he decided to divert the money from the schemes in progress to the county roads.  However commendable that action might be in so far as concentrating extra money on county roads is concerned, the transition did not prove a very satisfactory one.  Many workers were dislodged from their employment and on the whole the change worked out most unsatisfactorily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid things did not go according to plan anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>But there was a something somewhere which seemed to undermine the obviously good purpose of the proposed transfer at the time. I agree with those people who say that our method of repairing bog roads is not a proper one.  I do not know what can be done about it, but it is a problem which is receiving a good deal of consideration in every council.  It is <Col N="1059" /> this problem of the maintenance of county roads, where some loose gravel is thrown into the pot-holes and next week the roads are as bad as ever.  I have been advocating that light diesel rollers be used on this material, even though tar spraying or no other system is used.  It is certainly a waste of money under our present system of traffic to have loose gravel thrown into pot-holes week after week, so that when you drive along that road again, it is as bad as it was before.</P>
      <P>The day is gone when the heavy irons on cart wheels embedded that gravel into the road.  The position is now completely changed.  A fast heavy truck is driven along and even though the pot-holes have just been filled, it removes the gravel immediately and the water is there next day again. This problem will have to be overcome and I believe the best means of overcoming it would be to use the light roller. Even though the maintenance money would not go so far and the area covered would be smaller, the quantity of work done would be more satisfactory and more permanent, and the money would be better spent in the long run.</P>
      <P>I would recommend the engineering officers of the Department, who meddle a great deal in many of our problems, to interest themselves in this more serious problem for a while.  It is a problem which has baffled most councils up to the present and so far I do not think anyone has come forward with a real solution, which we would welcome if we could get it.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the various other points I have noted here.  There are many other Deputies who are anxious to speak and I would like to conclude on the note on which I started in regard to the growing burden of local administration.  It is my opinion that it is out of proportion to the capabilities of the local administration to handle it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every new Act passed here imposes in some way or other an extra strain on local authorities.  At the same time, local administrators are not entrusted with much by way of actual administration; <Col N="1060" /> the managerial hand is in every pie.  I certainly agree with those who say that a few men meeting once a month would not be capable of administering the affairs of any county at the moment.  I do not think anybody would approve of a return to the old system of complete autonomy for local authorities.  I believe, however, that they should be more than just advisers.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, I was at an international conference in Rome.  It was a meeting of the I.U.L.A. Deputy Carroll was also present.  One of the principal subjects discussed there was the question of fiscal autonomy in local administration.  I was impressed when I discovered that practically every country in the world is struggling with the same problems as we have here&mdash; an increasing burden of local administration, rising rates, councils continuely begging subventions from the central Exchequer and objecting to these subventions being given under conditions, namely, on the basis that a contribution will also be made by the local authority.</P>
    <P>I cannot see eye-to-eye and neither can I agree with those who advocate fiscal autonomy for local authorities. If we were to finance even a fraction of the work administered by local authorities at the present time out of rates alone, we would have to build extra workhouses to accommodate our ratepayers. I do not think anybody could visualise any such change, unless some of the work the councils are now administering were passed on to the central authority.</P>
    <P>We have had speakers here year after year advocating that mental hospitals should become a charge on the central authority solely and that certain other sections of local administration should be taken over from local authorities.  We shall have to be relieved of some of the burden in one way or another. We want a revision of valuations so that the burden of rates will fall more equitably on all, or we want the burden of work now foisted on local authorities curtailed and administered directly by the central authority. If that is not done, our local parliaments will become like <Col N="1061" /> the bodies in the cantons in Switzerland, but they will not have the necessary finances to meet the schemes they will want to administer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of Waterford Corporation, I note with regret that we, perhaps the last surviving group of corporators who work a direct labour scheme, are this year limited in the number of houses to be erected.  That limited number will not keep the workers unit group in continuous employment.  We have been told that only a certain number of houses will be sanctioned.  Our guild can compete with any contracting group in Waterford City or anywhere else.  I appeal now to the Minister to examine the position and to give us enough money to keep that group in employment.</P>
      <P>I am very well aware that the Minister is limited by the financial resources available to him.  I am very well aware that there is not enough money to do all that he would wish to do, as there was not enough money for his predecessor to do all that he wished to do.  This direct labour scheme has been in operation for the last eight to ten years and has proved its worth. The Minister should strain every nerve to keep that group employed, so that it will not be broken up and so that the workers will not leave Waterford.  If the group is kept together, there will be certain advantages.  People getting houses will have the advantage that they will get these houses at a lower cost because these workers make no profit, apart from their ordinary wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Waterford County, we have been held back for some years in relation to rural cottage schemes.  At one period we had something like 105 cottages. These were approved by all concerned and we proposed to raise the necessary money.  On a subsequent revision, prior to the present Minister taking office, that number was reduced to roughly 54. Possibly economy reasons dictated that action.  It is unfair to deprive people of cottages, unfair to deprive them because of the exigencies of a situation rather than on merit.  They were not responsible for the exigencies of the situation.  I admit that nobody can build without money, but, where people <Col N="1062" /> are entitled to housing by virtue of their economic conditions and where they cannot avail of grants, however tempting, every effort should be made, irrespective of economic conditions, to provide houses.  Economies must not be made at the expense of the working man; at the end of his working day, he should at least be entitled to come home to a house capable of accommodating him, his wife and his children in comfort.</P>
    <P>On the question of road grants, I would have had a good deal to say were it not for the Minister's reply to a question to-day.  I appeal to him, however, to communicate to the various counties, as he promised to-day he would, what the final decision on the question of road grants is.  In my own County of Waterford, at least 50 to 60 people were notified during the past three weeks that they were redundant not because there is no work for them, but because there is not enough money to pay them.  I am not trying to lay that as a charge against the Minister. Perhaps it is as he says, that the money was not there or that they were not satisfied it was there because of the Road Fund position.  It is true that because of petrol rationing and other matters, the position had to be examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated during Question Time to-day that he is willing and anxious to say to Waterford County Council to go ahead with their ordinary road work schemes and keep in employment the people whom they had kept employed in past years.  He said that to-day, but I appeal to him to confirm that and to indicate to the Waterford County Council and other county councils what is the grant we are to get.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, I would say there has been a hold-up.  There has definitely been a hold-up for one reason or another, under the last Government. For the past three years in my own urban area, we have been endeavouring to get a housing scheme going.  At the present moment, it is with the Minister's Department.  We have got the land and we need to go on with approximately 30, 40, 50 or perhaps 80 houses, but we are awaiting the appointment <Col N="1063" /> of an arbitrator.  We can do no more than we have done.  We sent the scheme to the Department prior to the present Minister taking up office. We sent it three or four months ago when the previous Minister was in office and we are still awaiting notification.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us he will appoint an arbitrator as quickly as possible?  If the money is not there, let us know that; if he has not the money to do it, let him tell us that and we will understand.  I appeal to the Minister not to have local authorities, of one of which I am chairman in my own constituency, held up to ridicule and accused of neglecting their work when it is a matter for the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>I want to say in all honesty and without any intention of embarrassing the Minister that we in the local authorities are willing and anxious to try to carry out our duties and all we ask for is co-operation.  We appeal to the Minister, in so far as he can within the amount of money which is permitted to him, to co-operate with us. I can assure him, as one who holds a different political belief from his, that in so far as he carries out his duties I, as one who has a certain amount of influence in my own local authority, will co-operate with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker that local authorities should be notified as early as possible in the year with regard to the amount of grants to be given to them under the different headings&mdash;main roads, county roads and tourist roads.  Most local authorities hold a preliminary road meeting in January. In my own county, the estimates meeting is held in February.  At all times, we have to frame our estimate on the assumption that certain sums will be made available from the central authority by way of road grants.  I think the Department of Local Government early in January each year should make a provisional allocation to each road authority and tell them the amount of money they are likely to receive. It would be a great help to the local authority and to the officials in preparing the estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> I hope the policy of the previous Minister with regard to the county roads will be followed by his successor and that a greater proportion of the available money will be diverted to the county roads.  The county roads have been neglected over the years and more money should be spent on them.  I think the decision made by Deputy O'Donnell, when he was Minister for Local Government, was a wise one and one which met with the approval of many members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I should like also to compliment the previous Minister on one good thing he did during the past 12 months, that is, the issuing of a booklet entitled &ldquo;Rules of the Road&rdquo;.  I regret very much that the booklet did not get a wider circulation.  It was sent only to those who had applied for a driver's licence.  I think it should have been sent to every household and that copies should have been sent also to the teachers in the national schools for distribution among pupils.  It was an excellent booklet, well produced and well illustrated, and it was one that could properly be placed in the hands of the children.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Brennan when he said that local authorities were becoming very much like the Garda Síochána.  The central authority are handing over to us&mdash;and I speak as a member of a local authority of 15 years' standing&mdash;different duties every year.  Of course, they always dangle the carrot before us and say that, if we do this, the central authority will do something else.  We are more or less intimidated into adopting schemes and making financial provision for them, schemes which should properly be within the jurisdiction of the central authority.</P>
    <P>During the year, a scheme of that kind was put before us and we were asked for our co-operation.  In fact, we were obliged to give it by the Minister for Local Government.  That was the scheme in relation to sign-posting the roads.  In my county, if we agreed to carry out that elaborate scheme and put up the statutory road signs, it would have cost the ratepayers <Col N="1065" /> about 3d. in the í.  We decided to put up the signs we are obliged to put up on the main and county roads but spread the work over two or three years.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of confusion with regard to these signs.  In the past, the Automobile Association provided signs for many of our roads and then the Tourist Board or An Board Fáilte entered the field and now we have the local authorities competing with An Bord Fáilte and the Automobile Association.  There are different signs and different terminology all over the country.  You see the word &ldquo;CrosBhóthar&rdquo; or &ldquo;Crosaire&rdquo; and all the rest in two languages.  You also have different signs pointing out the same thing.  Uniformity is now the desire of the Department.  We were told during the year that uniformity is fit and proper but I disagree that local authorities should be saddled with the expenditure.</P>
    <P>I think, too, it would be wise if on our roads, especially our main roads carrying the bulk of our traffic, the main arterial roads out of Dublin to Cork, Galway, Limerick and other big centres, proper lay-bys were provided. Many users of these roads, especially drivers of heavy trucks going to and from Dublin with merchandise, oftentimes feel tired easily.  They have long hours to work.  Sometimes they have to meet boats at Dublin.  Frequently they are on the roads for 11 or 12 hours at a time.  Lay-bys are necessary, especially during the night when drivers get tired during a journey.  Some provision should be made for the extension of the lay-by system all over the country.  I noticed some of them on the Dublin-Naas road and on some roads to the South.  In my view, local authorities should provide more lay-bys because they would prevent quite a considerable number of accidents on the road which occur as a result of drivers of of heavy vehicles getting tired after long journeys.</P>
    <P>I come now to what I have always understood to be a very unjust and vexatious system, namely, motor taxation. I am not referring to motor taxation as such but to the tradesman who has to have a car to get to work in his own area or to people with small incomes <Col N="1066" /> who are not able to tax their car for the full year and are, therefore, obliged to tax them quarterly or half-yearly. These people are charged anything up to 20 per cent. more than the person who is better off and can pay the full year's tax at the one time. That is a most unjust imposition and it should be remedied.  I do not think I am entitled to advocate legislation but I thought it might have been remedied during the past year.</P>

      <P>I would also ask the Minister to remove the difficulties that exist in each county with regard to the appointment of engineers.  In my county we have no county surveyor&mdash;we have not had one for the past two years.  Some difficulties have arisen between the Department and the local authorities with regard to the salaries that should be paid to county surveyors, county engineers, assistant county engineers, and so forth.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>For a time here to-night I thought that the capital of Ireland was in Cork.  For a solid hour I listened to Deputies from Cork County and City and one would imagine that nobody had any trouble but themselves.  I wonder how they fight an election down there at all because each one supported the other.  It seemed to me as if they were a mutual admiration society.  Then, for another while, it almost seemed as if we would have to <Col N="1067" /> take the road to the Rosses.  I can assure Deputies that we in Galway have our troubles, too.</P>
    <P>The position as regards housing grants in Galway in the past 12 months was absolutely scandalous.  No supplementary grant was paid since August last.  Ther was also a complete hold-up of the issue of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  Our manager told us that we had been promised this and that.  We lived in sight of the land of promise for the past 12 months.  Now that Deputy Smith is in charge of the Department of Local Government I hope that we shall not remain outside the promised land but that he will lead us into it as the Israelites were led into it according to the Old Testament.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give some definite directive in relation to supplementary housing grants.  In Galway, we made certain provisions.  We told the applicants that it was not necessary to apply immediately and that the last date for making application was around the end of April.  We said that anybody who had been allocated a new housing grant or a reconstruction grant up to that date would qualify for a supplementary grant if the money were made available.  I appeal to the Minister to tell us what dates he has in mind and whether he will make money available or allow moneys to be borrowed to pay grants up to the 31st December or the end of March&mdash;or whatever date he may select&mdash;so that the confusion which has existed for the past 12 months will disappear and the people will know once and for all where they stand.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing schemes generally, I would ask the Minister to have a reassessment of the plans that local authorities are advised to adopt when preparing a housing scheme.  I have noticed, in relation to my own area, that the plans which were approved were out of keeping with local conditions.  In particular, I refer to the lay-out of some of these houses. We have had a big living-room and a very small kitchenette.  Anyone who is familiar with conditions in rural <Col N="1068" /> Ireland must know that the important room is the kitchen and that that room should be big.  They must also know that, generally speaking, people cannot provide two fires.  I urge the Minister to get rid of the lunatic fringe of architects and engineers attached to the Department of Local Government who are out of touch with conditions in small towns and rural areas.  They have been the cause of many mistakes in the past.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has caused quite a lot of trouble is the hold-up in preparing vesting schemes for cottages. Time and time again, people have been encouraged to buy out their own houses.  In County Galway, we had a scheme in respect of Board of Health cottages erected in pre-war days.  I think, however, that we cannot prepare a vesting scheme for cottages built since 1937.  I trust the Minister will be able to give us some direction on that matter.</P>
    <P>I should like also to agree with some speakers who referred to decisions taken by an Association called the County Managers' Association.  I shall now put a few questions to the Minister with regard to that Association.  What statutory existence has it?  Why are local authorities hamstrung by decisions taken by this group?  Why can managers come and tell us they were in conference with officials of the Minister for Local Government and that they have taken this or that decision? These gauleiters should be got rid of. If they want to make any decisions, they should make them openly and with the approval of the local authority.  We should not have the position that decisions are taken with regard to remuneration or conditions of service by this group who style themselves the County Managers' Association, the minutes of whose meetings are never supplied to members of local authorities and whose decisions we hear of only gy chance.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every luck in his new position.  I compliment him on his decision to honour his predecessor's debts with regard to the payment of supplementary housing grants.  That <Col N="1069" /> has been a sore point with local authorities in the past 12 months.  I hope that, with the advent of a new Minister, the matter will now finally be remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point to which I should like to refer is the existing scheme with regard to the employment allowance, abatement of rates on agricultural land.  I think there is some hardship attached to the present position with regard to that allowance in so far as it refers to employed personnel on agricultural holdings. The existing scheme provides for abatement of rates in respect of members of the family, relatives within a certain category&mdash;employed on the rated holding.  The main provision of the relief refers to the employment of labour on holdings, which is causing a good deal of hardship to many, if not all, who are owners of agricultural land.</P>
      <P>The present regulations provide that there must be 52 weeks' continuous employment on the holding to qualify applicants for abatement, and I know in my county, and in every other county, that condition is such as to cause hardship to the ratepayer.  There are many reasons why it is not practicable to have labour employed continuously the whole year round.  The first reason is that farm workers are very reluctant to work a full year of 52 weeks, even allowing for the holidays they are now entitled to, according to existing legislation.  In most parts of the country, I think Deputies will agree with me, the best a farmer can hope for is to get an agricultural worker to contract for a period of 10 to 11 months.  That is becoming more difficult now in recent years.  We have found, in our local authority in Kerry, some cases where prosecutions had to be instituted against applicants for employment allowances.  They had to be instituted against such ratepayers because employment allowances were claimed for periods which when checked up did not turn out to be in accordance with the actual position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in the least condoning the alleged offences that are so committed, <Col N="1070" /> but I think the present system is, to some extent, influencing the commission of such offences.  I would like to avail of this debate to-night to appeal to the Minister to consider a slight modification of the existing arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If this modification would require legislation, the Deputy may not advocate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming it would be possible for the Minister to devise some way other than legislation. I am not advocating legislation, but I am hoping some modification can be brought about or arrived at without having to go to the lengths of legislation and I hope the Minister will be able to throw some light on this subject.</P>
      <P>I suggest-to come to the point&mdash;that under this category the period of employment should be reduced to ten months minimum and that the abatement should be proportionate, that is, that if the employed person works for ten months, it will be 10/12ths; if the period is 11 months, the abatement should be 11/12ths; and if the period is the full 12 months, then the existing allowance should apply in full.  I feel that if there was any possibility that farm workers could be persuaded to work a full 12 months, as is the case in industry in general, it would be wrong to make this case; but I am perfectly satisfied from my own experience down the years that it is not possible to get agricultural workers to put in a full 12 months' period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that weather and other conditions might make that a bit difficult, but in any event, I know many farmers who have tried it and it is only in a small proportion of cases that the workers will agree to work the full period.  I think there is a very good case for the proposed revision, and I know local authorities throughout the country in many cases have from time to time sent resolutions to this effect to the Department.  I understand it has been discussed at fairly high level, that is, at the General <Col N="1071" /> Council of County Councils.  It has made recommendations on the lines I have suggested here to the Minister and sooner or later this matter will have to get attention on these lines, and I think the present time is very opportune.  So much for that.</P>
    <P>I shall pass on to the question of road grants.  I think the change in the system of allocating road grants this year has been somewhat detrimental to the progress of work on roads throughout the country.  In previous years, we were always accustomed to get notification from the Department as to the total amount of the allocation from the various funds for the maintenance, repair and construction of roads under the local authority.  This year, for some reason that perhaps can be explained later, we were advised of an interim allocation and we were asked to make out our proposals which had to come to the Department for sanction.</P>
    <P>In my county, we proceeded with all haste to make out those proposals and they were sent to the Minister's Department in accordance with the directions given.  We find now in a number of cases, some of these proposals have not been accepted and have been referred back to the local authority again.  Attention has been drawn to the fact that allocations have been made to roads, not on the five-year plan, at least not on the roads sanctioned on the five-year plan.  There were some roads undoubtedly brought into the five-year plan in 1956, and as far as I can understand, these were accepted in principle at the time.  In any event, sanction was then given to start work on steamrolling, and in fact, stretches of the roads in question, were commenced and steamrolled last year.</P>
    <P>The proposals which came up to the Minister's Department, which were for approval on the interim allocation last year, referred to some of these roads, and it is rather hard to understand now why the roads in question should not be sanctioned for continuance of work.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude in connection with these allocations, because local authorities are now somewhat committed, by virtue of having started on <Col N="1072" /> the works a year or so ago, and to allow the local authorities to continue with the construction and steamrolling of those roads.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here this evening to the proposal of the previous Government to discontinue the steamrolling of certain main roads and to switch the moneys allocated to these roads to by-roads.  I do not know what is the general opinion of Deputies here who are members of local authorities, but in my county that proposal was premature because we still have quite a good mileage of main roads&mdash;roads classified as main&mdash;which have not been steamrolled and at the time that the switch was suggested, the local authority unanimously rejected the proposal and in due course was able to persuade the Minister to agree to allow the position to remain as it was.  We were then able to continue the steamrolling of certain main roads. These are main roads of lesser importance, but they are classified as main roads and, as such, are more entitled to steamrolling than county roads which, undoubtedly, are not as important, irrespective of what traffic they may carry.</P>
    <P>The present policy of steamrolling county roads on a five-year plan is a very good arrangement because it enables the local authority to plan ahead on a very definite basis.  It also enables the Department to curb any irresponsible scheme that might be proposed under that heading.  The only trouble is that quite a number of roads are put on the five-year plan and the present system of scheduling those roads is somewhat loose and indefinite. A halt should be called and no more roads should be placed on the plan until such time as the roads already scheduled have been finished.  In that way, it will be possible to complete long stretches of roads which have been commenced but which are not being proceeded with as quickly as the local authority would wish.</P>
    <P>There is just one final point I should like to make, in connection with the provision of rural water supplies.  I hope that properly comes under the direction of the Minister for Local <Col N="1073" /> Government.  It is a matter that is very desirable and urgent.  The record of local authorities with regard to the provision of water supplies in urban areas is reasonably creditable.  I am referring now to rural areas.  The existing arrangement is that pumps are provided at crossroads or central points to supply the population of the district. These pumps are usually provided only after very careful examination by the county medical officer of health and on his recommendation that a pump is necessary in a particular case.</P>
    <P>Considerable difficulty is sometimes experienced by the engineering department of the councils in providing a satisfactory and certain supply of water for those pumps.  A good deal of money has been spent on them, very often with poor results.  Many pumps have been provided within the past 15 years, but the demand for pumps still persists and is very noticeable.</P>
    <P>The amount of expenditure on pumps is not always justified.  While I realise the difficulty of providing the necessary money for a bigger scheme, nevertheless the Minister would be justified in considering the practicability of providing regional water schemes. There is one thing to be said at the outset in favour of such schemes, that the people for whom they are provided are prepared to pay economic rents and such schemes could be described as schemes that will give an immediate return to the Exchequer for any money expended on them.</P>
    <P>Since the advent of rural electrification, the people have become conscious of the value of running water, just as they are conscious of the value of electricity.  The rural community would welcome water supplies and would be prepared to go a long way in paying whatever is the economic charge therefor.  I understand that experiments have been carried out in a few centres during the past few years, the results of which have been very satisfactory. I respectfully suggest to the Minister that, as soon as possible, he should ask the engineering section of his Department to examine this very important matter and that experiments should be carried out in every county. Two areas at least in every county <Col N="1074" /> should be selected for the provision of rural water supplies.</P>
    <P>The general experience in most counties is that there is an abundant supply of water which is going to waste.  With the very fine engineering service now available through the Minister's Department and the local authorities, it should be possible to formulate a standard scheme for the purpose of providing water for the people in rural areas.  The people in urban areas have such amenities and at very reasonable cost.  The country districts also are entitled to this facility.  The provision of these amenities is vital if we are to be consistent in our efforts to keep people on the land, where there is a shortage of labour, particularly for domestic purposes. I am sure the housewives of rural districts would welcome and encourage schemes for the supply of water to their homes.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the Minister could be expected to install a water supply in all the houses in the same way as the E.S.B. were able to bring electricity to every house.  I do think that the water could be trapped and conveyed through mains to the principal centres of population in rural areas and, with the grants, which I hope will be reintroduced for the provision of water schemes in the homes, the householders could be very easily encouraged to tap the mains and bring the water into the homes.  I am quite sure the Minister will examine that suggestion as soon as he can get time to do so, and I sincerely hope that when the Estimate for the Minister's Department comes before the House again in 12 months' time, some progress in that sphere will have been recorded.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the appointment of rate collectors in general.  We are not concerned with that matter in County Kerry because we happen to have a direct system of rate collection, but one thing that struck me as being very unfair under the County Management Act is that county councillors and, as far as I know, urban councillors, are deprived of any power except one, that is, to appoint rate collectors.  The time has <Col N="1075" /> arrived when rate collectors could best be appointed through the Local Appointments Commission, or at least through some system other than asking the unfortunate councillors to try to decide who is the most suitable for such a position, and I am sure most members of local authorities would welcome that change.</P>
