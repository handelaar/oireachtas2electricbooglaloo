      <P>In connection with a question and supplementary questions addressed, in this House, to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the 27th June, 1957, I undertook to have this matter examined and to report to the House.</P>
      <P>The matter has been examined, and I have been informed that, normally, Radio Éireann does not report speeches made at political meetings except extracts from those made at the Ard-Fheiseanna of the principal political organisations, but that this has not been taken as precluding Radio Éireann from occasionally reporting, at the discretion of the Director, statements concerning matters of wide national interest, even where such statements are made at political meetings other than Ard-Fheiseanna.</P>

      <P>Imports are brought to account by reference to the commodity classification specified in the current Official Import List.  This list does not require importers to state the use for which their imports are intended and, consequently, no particulars <Col N="170" /> of sheet iron imported specifically for use in the manufacture of corrugated iron are available.  I propose, however, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing particulars of certain iron and steel plates and sheets imported for all purposes in each year 1953-56 and in the first nine months of 1957.  The imports shown relate to the Official Import List headings which would include any imports of sheet iron of the type used in the manufacture of corrugated iron as well as imports for other uses.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of the items comprising the consumer price index (a) the national average price per unit in mid-February, 1957; (b) the national average price per unit in mid-August, 1957; (c) the average change per unit in terms of money, and (d) the percentage change.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the national average retail prices of certain items of food in mid-February and mid-August this year and the differences between them.  In the case of <Col N="174" /> the other items in the consumer price index no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful.  The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive inquiries.  As regards the percentage change in each item in the index between mid-February and mid-August, 1957, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy Desmond on Wednesday of last week in which this information was given.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>NATIONAL Average Retail Prices of Food at mid-February, 1957, and mid-August, 1957 and the difference between them.</P>

      <P>The earliest date by reference to which information on the lines sought by the Deputy can be given is July, 1914, as there are no official statistics which afford a measure of changes in the value of money prior to that date.  The approximate amount of money required to purchase the same volume of goods and services as £250 would buy in July, 1914, was £381 in 1934; £792 in 1948; £1,021 in 1955; and £1,140 in mid-August, 1957.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether in view of the severely restrictive and more often prohibitive terms imposed by motor insurance firms on applicants for third party and passenger personal injury insurance cover, on new drivers, and on existing policy holders having unfavourable claims experience, and since such terms are generally not competitive, and therefore give the person who is seeking cover no reasonable chance of obtaining equitable terms, he will consider introducing amending legislation to the Road Traffic Act, 1933, to provide for the setting up of an appeals board, representative of the Tariff Offices Association, and the insuring public with an independent chairman appointed by him, to determine questions referred to it by aggrieved parties.</P>

Proceedings in respect of oil pollution of harbour waters would normally be taken by the harbour authority.  I have no function in relation to the pollution of waters by substances other than oil, but the discharge of matter deleterious to fish is, I understand, prohibited by various Fisheries Acts.</P>

    <P>While I must make it clear that these are matters in which I have no functions and have, therefore, no authority to intervene, I have made inquiries and have been informed by Bord na Móna that overtime and Sunday work take place only intermittently <Col N="185" /> and for short periods and that it would not be possible, therefore, for the board to arrange to recruit extra men when the need for such work arises.  I have also been informed that, while the board endeavours to give the maximum possible term of employment to each of its workers, it must be recognised that because of the seasonal nature of its operations it would be impossible to provide a full year's work for each of its employees. The board points out that the arrangements for seasonal lay-off of workers are in accordance with a scheme which was agreed with the trade unions representative of the workers. I understand that this scheme provides for preferential treatment for married men in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that there is no area proposed for development under the rural electrification scheme known as the Dunmanway rural area.  Dunmanway town has had an urban supply of electricity for some years.  Of the rural areas immediately surrounding the town of Dunmanway, those of Drinagh, Teenah and Ballineen have been considered for selection on a number of occasions but have not, so far, been selected as their returns did not compare favourably with those for other areas awaiting development in the board's Cork No. 2 district The areas will be reconsidered in due course and the decision of the board will depend on how the returns then compare with those for other areas awaiting development in the Cork No. 2 district.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that, in the countryside west of Dunmanway, there are two proposed rural areas, tentatively named Togher and Coolkelure. So far no definite arrangements have been made by the board for carrying out a canvass of the residents of these areas.</P>

      <P>For some time past, my Department has, on my instructions, been making inquiries as to the availability of supplies of influenza vaccine for the vaccination of key personnel in the health and other essential services.  To date it has been found possible to procure only a very small quantity which is negligible in relation to the amount required.  In the circumstances, it would not be practicable to make a distribution on a country-wide basis. Arrangements have, accordingly, been made with the Dublin Corporation for the allocation of the very limited quantity available to the larger acute surgical hospitals, maternity hospitals and fever hospitals in the city.</P>

      <P>The Offaly County Council made a Compulsory Acquisition Order to acquire the private roadway known as John's Terrace, Birr, for the purpose of providing a new approach and entrance to the local district hospital and clinic.  The council considered that the present entrance to the hospital, the reconstruction of which is now nearing completion, was inadequate and unsuitable.  The Order was duly submitted for confirmation. As objections were lodged against the Order, it was necessary, in accordance with the provisions of Section 83 of the Health Act, 1947, to hold a public local inquiry into the propriety of confirming the Order.  The inquiry was was held in Birr in June last and the report of the inspector who held the inquiry is at present being examined in my Department.</P>
      <P>The objectors to the Order suggested that other alternative and suitable entrances were available.  Before coming to a decision on the question of confirming the Order, I shall have to be satisfied as to the suitability or otherwise of the alternative entrances suggested.  Consideration of the inspector's report is now almost complete and I hope to reach a decision soon on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view <Col N="191" /> of the recent changes in interest rates, he will consider introducing legislation to increase the rate applicable to Post Office Savings Bank deposits so as to encourage further thrift throughout the country and to raise capital for State projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.</P>
      <P>While I am anxious to encourage thrift, I consider that the present rate represents a fair return for money withdrawable on demand.  The present rate has been in force through periods of both cheap and dear money and I feel that in the long term it is to the advantage of the Post Office Savings Bank depositor to enjoy a rate of interest which remains unaffected by market variations in interest rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's aim is to promote the maximum domestic development of a productive character. This aim would be frustrated if the external reserves of the Government and the banking system were to be depleted for consumption purposes.  It is, therefore, gratifying that for more than a year now there appears to have been no deficit in our external payments. The emergence of a balance or a small surplus in the calendar year 1957 would represent, however, only the first break since 1946 in a series of deficits, totalling over £200,000,000.</P>
      <P>There is a risk of unintended deficits arising in the future.  In the past there have been large and unforeseen variations in external trade which seriously disrupted our external payments. These trends are usually well under way before they can be statistically established and before remedial action can be set in motion.  Such action itself takes time to become effective.  In 1955, for example, we incurred, with little warning, a deficit of £35,500,000 which had to be financed entirely by drawing down our external reserves. For these reasons, it is clear that the recent modest improvement gives no grounds for complacency, and that no useful purpose would be served by attempting to define an appropriate upper limit for our external reserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received from the Department of Justice a Garda report on the statements made in the article to which the Deputy refers.  From this report it is clear that the newspaper article is not only a fantastic exaggeration of what took place at the hiring fair in Galway this year, but that it contains many falsehoods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, it is a convenience for those who want employment whether industrial or agricultural to meet those who want to employ them.  It is a custom in some parts of the country for men who want agricultural work for a season to meet farmers, who are looking for help, in certain towns on certain dates.  There is no truth whatever that the men seeking employment in Galway &ldquo;demonstrated their strength by lifting barrels, bending nails or raising carts off the road.&rdquo;  There were no women looking <Col N="196" /> for employment.  There were no &ldquo;rich farmers who went so far as to feel the muscles of the poor boys and girls,&rdquo; and, of course, no auction of any kind took place.</P>
    <P>An appropriate letter has been written to the editor of the English paper concerned regarding this &ldquo;beautiful story out of the West&rdquo; as these falsehoods are described in the article.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate, however, that the only way effectively to stop the writing and publication of this type of article is for readers to stop buying the paper concerned.  So long as there is a ready market for this kind of material, writers will be hired by a greedy newspaper proprietor provided they are prepared to demonstrate to his satisfaction their ability to distort the truth and their weakness for the lurid lie about Irish life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware of the heavy losses suffered by wheat growers owing to the lack of drying facilities which has been caused by the closing by millers of certain drying plants which were available to growers in previous years, and, if so, what steps to prevent similar losses in future are contemplated by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>While there were some difficulties in regard to the use of individual driers for the drying of wheat, the over-all position is that more drying facilities were in use this year than in any previous year.  In this connection, I would point out that purchases of wheat by the flour millers in the week ended 12th October amounted to 462,000 barrels, the highest quantity ever purchased by them in one week.  Furthermore, the average weekly purchases for the four weeks ended 12th October were 430,000 barrels.  While some growers have had difficulty in having their wheat taken up, it is clear that the bulk of the crop has been marketed satisfactorily.  I propose, however, to look into the whole problem of the marketing and drying of wheat in the light of this year's experience.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The survey to which the Deputy refers was carried out over the period from January to March, 1951.</P>
      <P>(b)  The survey disclosed that the bulk of the milk supplies in the district was already being supplied to the cream separating stations at Kilflynn and Dromclough, owned by Abbeydorney Co-operative Dairy Society Limited, and Lixnaw Co-operative Creamery Limited, respectively, and that the quantity of milk available would not be sufficient to render the operation of either a new cream separating station or a travelling creamery in addition to the existing cream separating stations an economic proposition.  Of a total of 70 farmers in the district who supplied milk to the two societies, 29 were within a distance of three miles from creamery premises, 28 between three and four miles, and 13 between four and five miles.</P>
      <P>(c)  As a result of the survey, the decision was taken at the time not to grant a licence to either of the two societies concerned to establish a cream separating station in the district or to provide a travelling creamery, and I am not aware of any circumstances which would warrant my altering that decision now.  I can only suggest that the needs of the farmers in this district who live at undue distances from creamery premises would best be met by the provision of lorry services for the cartage of their milk to the two existing cream separating stations and, if possible, the delivery to them at the same time of pasteurised separated milk.</P>

    <P>2.  Figures for each county for 1956-57 are not available as the agricultural census for that year was confined to estimates calculated from sample returns (accounting for 25% of the area of the country) collected for District Electoral Divisions in each of which a Garda station was situated.</P>
    <P>3.  Figures for the total number of agricultural holdings in 1956 and 1957 have not been calculated.</P>
    <P>4.  In addition to the soil tests mentioned in columns 4 and 5 above, 16,435 soil samples in 1955-56 and 8,154 in 1956-57 were tested in connection with experimental and special advisory work undertaken by officers of the Department of Agriculture.  These were not recorded on a county basis.</P>

      <P>The answer to (a) and to (b) is yes.  As regards (c), I think I should say first that it is not proposed to change existing policy, and, secondly, that any Landrace pigs now in the country either have been illegally imported or are the progeny of illegally imported pigs.  Boars of such origin cannot be licensed.  It is an offence to keep them and the owners should realise that they are liable to prosecution.</P>

If it is the policy of the Government to prohibit the importation of Landrace pigs, surely some steps should be taken to see that they are not allowed to be disposed of by way of advertisements.</P>

The next return will be circulated shortly.  It is not the practice to compile statistics for parts of counties and, as has already been indicated in replies to previous similar questions, the provision at more frequent intervals of special statistics on the lines asked for in the Deputy's question would entail an expenditure of official time which would not be justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Old age pension claimants are not usually asked to say if they were ever in prison.  Occasionally, however, such an inquiry might be considered necessary because it is provided in the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908, Section 3 (3), that where a person of 60 years of age or upwards has been convicted by a court and is liable to have a detention order made against him under the Inebriates Act, 1898, the court may order that he be disqualified from receiving a pension for such period, not exceeding ten years, as the court directs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state (1) the total area of lands taken over for forestry purposes in the North Kerry Dáil constituency and the acreage taken over at each centre, (2) the total acreage planted there within the past 25 years, and (3) the acreage at present on offer to the forestry branch; and further, whether the forestry branch will consider further offers of land for forestry purposes, and, if so, if he will indicate generally the type of lands and the areas that are considered suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The total area held by the forestry division in North Kerry is 867 acres, of which a total of 619 acres is classified as productive.  The total area planted to date is 612 acres. All the land held in the area is attached to Brosna forest.</P>
      <P>As regards prospects for further expansion, I must state that acquisition statistics are kept on a county basis and I am unable, therefore, to supply figures for part of County Kerry as requested by the Deputy.  The position for the county as a whole is that there are at present 218 areas totalling 26,507 acres on offer to my Department for afforestation purposes.</P>
      <P>My Department will be glad to consider any further offers of land that may be forthcoming.  Most of the land acquired is that normally regarded as waste or sub-standard land from an agricultural standpoint.  It is desirable that each offer or group of offers should comprise as large and as compact a block as possible, but special factors, such as proximity to existing forest lands or the commencement of forestry operations in a new district where prospects of further expansion are good, may render the acquisition of comparatively small areas a practical proposition.  Without inspection, it would not be possible to pronounce on the suitability or otherwise of any land offered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the Forestry Vote for 1957-58, I gave a general forecast of the thinning programme for the year.</P>
      <P>A considerable proportion of thinning is effected by standing sale and the date of completion of the sale contract is treated as the effective date of thinning for statistical purposes. Statistical data cannot readily be assembled until the close of the year.  There is a similar difficulty in the case of areas thinned by direct labour.  Such work continues from year to year in many forests and accurate statistical recording of progress cannot be economically undertaken at shorter intervals than the full year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware (1) of a slump in the shell-fish trade in lobsters, crayfish, etc., with France, (2) that it is now almost impossible for the French importers to obtain licences for import of Irish shell-fish, (3) that Irish exporters and fishermen have large supplies which they cannot dispose of, and (4) that because of French restrictions on foreign exchange, exporters have not been paid for supplies exported since last May; and if he will make representations to the French Government so as to prevent the collapse of the trade this winter with serious financial loss to the fishermen, the exporters and the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the position to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the present unsettled state of affairs in France, the normal licensing system was suspended in June last and importers have been largely operating under an emergency scheme. I am not aware that there are any large supplies held here awaiting export although I recognise that payments under the emergency licensing scheme for lobsters and crawfish have been <Col N="250" /> held up pending the issue of regular licences expected early next month.</P>
    <P>Representations of the strongest nature have been and continue to be made to the French authorities.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these adverse circumstances, I am glad to say that our exports of shell-fish to all countries in the first seven months of 1957 reached £212,408, an increase of £52,771 over the corresponding period of 1956.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that this trade difficulty continues to have my personal attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Health ceases to stutter, I shall ask a very simple question.  It is this: has the Minister had an opportunity of directing the attention of the French Government to the fact that when they made representations to us, they were vitally interested in continuing exports of French cheeses to this country? Though it conflicted with considerable force with important interests here, a concession was made in that regard to meet their urgent representations.  In the light of that, would the Minister not consider approaching the French Government to discover whether or not they are prepared to make a parallel concession now to the Irish Government in respect of shell-fish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would inform the Deputy that all the characteristics of reciprocal trade between the two countries have been mentioned in connection with these negotiations and everything possible has been done to secure licences for the imports.  I should say that the French Government has been reasonably helpful in providing advance licences, thereby enabling the trade to continue during the period in which the import quota was reduced, owing to the economic <Col N="251" /> difficulties which that country experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister directed the attention of the French Government to the fact that we maintained this concession in respect of a commodity which they were particularly solicitous to export to this country, even in the presence of very considerable economic difficulties of a kind such as those with which the French Government is now so oppressed?  In the light of that fact will be Minister ask the French Government whether or not they will be prepared to make a similar concession in regard to shell-fish for us? Perhaps the Minister for Lands is unaware of the fact that the French Government made special representations in respect of cheese and it was on foot of those special representations that special concessions were made to meet their case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether, during his recent visit to Castletownberehaven, he satisfied himself that the port was suitable for development as a major fishing centre; and what steps he proposes to take to have the port developed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>My visit to Castletownberehaven served to indicate to me that <i>prima facie</i> it was among the ports which might be capable of greater development as a fishing centre.  Proposals are being examined in my Department, in consultation with the Office of Public Works and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, for the execution of harbour works and shore installations there, but it is too early to indicate precisely what form of works may eventually be decided upon.  Local initiative and enterprise are, of course, vital factors in the development of any port and I am encouraged to believe that Castletownbere will not in future be lacking in these respects.</P>

      <P>No recent complaints of infringement of the exclusive fishery limits off the coasts of West Cork and the Dingle Peninsula have been received in my Department.  When occurrences of this kind are observed locally, the best course to take is to report them immediately, either directly or through the nearest Garda Station, to the Department of Defence as the authority responsible for the Naval Service, by whom my Department is assured that all practicable steps are being, and will continue to be taken, to detect and prevent illegal incursions by foreign vessels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The examination of conditions in the fishing industry which I am making naturally extends to the problems of marketing.  I am prepared to assist as far as lies in my power to obviate excess transport and other costs but must point out that fishermen and merchants may decide for themselves where and when to dispose of their fish.  The gradual provision of depots, ice plants and quick-freeze plants should make bulk transport of fish a more commercially profitable proposition.  Fishermen have already utilised transport co-operatively in some areas.  Co-operative groups of fishermen should be able to bulk their deliveries and thereby be in a position to apply for favourable bulk transport rates from C.I.E.  My Department will gladly give any help practicable.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider having a conference between his Department, the board <Col N="254" /> and the fishermen?  In West Cork, fish are dispatched to Dublin and returned to Cork City for consumption there. Excessive transport costs are bound to have a most adverse effect on the incomes of the fishermen.  Is the Minister prepared to have such a conference? I believe that is the only way out of the difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishermen in many places exercise their own choice as to where they will sell their fish and in many cases they select Dublin as the point of sale.  It is essential, too, in many cases that the fishermen combine in order to reduce transport costs, and that is the major factor and not the question of where they sell their fish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that <Col N="289" /> the Bill be now read a Second Time. The principal purpose of the Bill, as Deputies will have understood, is to extend, for a period of five years, that is, until 31st December, 1963, the period during which grants may be made for industrial development in the undeveloped areas and to increase from £2,000,000 to £4,000,000 the maximum aggregate of such grants.  That is the principal purpose of the Bill and other provisions of it are either supplementary to that or effect comparatively minor changes in the Act.  One of the additional provisions of the Bill is to deal with the possibility that An Fóras Tionscal will cease to exist at the end of this additional five-year period.</P>
      <P>I do not want to suggest that any decision has been taken that it will cease to exist at that date.  It will be a matter for consideration by the Government of that time.  It is, for a reason which I will explain, desirable that the legislation should contain provisions of that kind.  The original 1952 Act had no such provisions in it.  What is proposed is that if An Fóras Tionscal ceases to exist, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will take over its assets and liabilities.  The reason it is desirable to make that provision is that it is the practice of An Fóras Tionscal to pay out the moneys which it has agreed to grant to the promoters of any industrial enterprise only when the promoters themselves have expended a reasonable share of their own money on the project.  The aim of that arrangement is to ensure that the intention of the promoters to invest their own resources in the project is made clear by the physical evidence of factory premises and plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of that provision, it is obvious that a considerable time must elapse before any grant which An Fóras Tionscal has agreed to pay is actually paid over and certain figures which I will give later will reveal how that practice affects the finances of An Fóras Tionscal.  If provision is not made in the legislation for the assumption, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of responsibility for the liability of An Fóras Tionscal, then An Fóras Tionscal would have to cease <Col N="290" /> entering into grant commitments some considerable period before the Act was due to expire.  By inserting this provision in the legislation, An Fóras Tionscal will be enabled to continue to discharge its functions for the full period of its existence.  The provisions of the Bill in that respect will come into operation only if the grants scheme is ended and, as I said, that provision in the Bill does not imply that any decision to end the scheme in 1963 has been taken.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other amendments being made in the 1952 Act arising out of the experience of An Fóras Tionscal in its operation.  The first of these relates to the provisions in the Act for the making of grants for the training of workers.  An Fóras Tionscal has experienced rather serious difficulty in the operation of that provision because under the 1952 Act, the amount of wages for which training grants may be made may not exceed the normal trade union rates applicable to a learner in similar employment in the same or a comparable area.</P>
    <P>In the case of industries of a new kind it has not been found possible to establish in a legal way the normal trade union rate applicable to a learner.  Even in industries of a kind which were already established in the country, difficulties have arisen and where workers were sent abroad for training even greater difficulties were experienced.  It is proposed to get rid of these difficulties in this Bill by removing the limitation upon workers' wages so that it will be left to the discretion of An Fóras Tionscal to decide how much of the wage expenditure will be borne where these training grants are being given.</P>
    <P>The second of these amendments relates to a point which was drawn to my attention by the Minister for Local Government.  The aim in that regard is to remove an anomaly. Where a project is assisted by An Fóras Tionscal it may obtain a relief of rates under the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1954, for a period and, having enjoyed the relief of rates under that Act, it may then invoke the procedure <Col N="291" /> under the Undeveloped Areas Act to secure a rates relief for a further period of ten years.</P>
    <P>It was never intended that projects should qualify for rates relief under both codes.  The Minister for Local Government suggested to me that this Bill should include a provision requiring that remission of rates under the Undeveloped Areas Act should have effect in respect of the local financial year immediately after the completion of the factory and for the next nine years.  That provision, which is being made here, will preclude a project qualifying for rates relief twice.</P>
    <P>There are 46 projects which have been approved by An Fóras Tionscal and which either have reached the production stage or are at various stages of development.  Thirty of these projects have reached the production stage and the remaining 16 are either factory premises in the course of construction or are projects which, for some reason or another, have not yet reached the production stage.</P>
    <P>The total grants approved for these 46 projects as at the 30th September last amounted to £1,565,098; but of that sum, representing the total amounts of grants approved, actually something slightly less than £500,000 has been paid out.  The total amount so paid to date is £493,848.  There are outstanding commitments of £1,071,250, that is to say, grants which the board have undertaken to pay when the assisted projects have reached the agreed stage of their development.</P>
    <P>Applications for assistance under the Act are at present under consideration which will almost certainly absorb more than the balance remaining of the £2,000,000 authorised by the 1953 Act.  That is the reason this amending legislation is required and required rather urgently.  The total estimated capital investment involved in the projects which have been assisted under the Act is £4,500,000. These projects are expected to employ something more than 3,500 persons, possibly 4,000, when in production, and I think I am entitled to hope that the number will increase as the firms <Col N="292" /> concerned extend the scale of their operations.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that An Fóras Tionscal may assist in the establishment of industrial undertakings in the undeveloped areas in a number of ways.  They can make grants towards the cost of the acquisition and erection of factories and the provision of services for these factories.  They may acquire land and erect factories for renting for approved projects.  They may assist by adapting existing premises or by making grants for that purpose.  They can make grants not exceeding 50 per cent. of the cost for the acquistion of machinery and equipment. As I have indicated, they can provide for the training of workers and, by the issue of certificates, can secure, at the discretion of the local authority concerned, a two-thirds remission of rates for a period of ten years.</P>
    <P>In most cases the assistance given took the form of a cash grant related to the estimated requirement of the undertaking under the various headings of the Act.  Before giving assistance under the Act, An Fóras Tionscal must be satisfied on a number of points.  They must be satisfied that the industrial undertaking is likely to provide or maintain employment in an undeveloped area.  They must be satisfied that financial assistance is necessary to ensure its establishment, maintenance and development. They must be satisfied that the undertaking is of a reasonably permanent nature and that it will be carried out efficiently.</P>
    <P>Generally the board has worked on the principle, which I outlined when introducing the 1953 Act, that its aim should be to offset any competitive disadvantage associated with a western location.  In most cases where the board has refused grants for which application was made, it was due to a decision of the board that there was no competitive disadvantage associated with the location.  In addition to these statutory obligations, An Fóras Tionscal when deciding on applications has to have regard to the question whether the giving of assistance by way of grant in any case would be <Col N="293" /> unfair to other concerns established already in other areas without assistance from the State.  The board is empowered to give grants to undertakings already in existence but only where a substantial expansion of that concern is proposed.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Undeveloped Areas Act applies to what were formerly described as the &ldquo;congested&rdquo; districts, as defined in the Land Acts.  There is power in the Undeveloped Areas Act to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to declare by Order any other area to be an undeveloped area.  The areas specified in the Act are Counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and Kerry together with the most of County Clare and the four former rural districts of Bantry, Castletownshend, Schull and Skibbereen in County Cork. In the case of certain areas which are contiguous to these undeveloped areas, as defined in the Act, I have indicated that, if concrete industrial proposals emerge, they will be referred to An Foras Tionscal for consideration and, if An Foras Tionscal indicates its readiness to give assistance, I will be prepared on my part to give sympathetic consideration to the question of making a Scheduling Order under the Act in respect of the area concerned.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to describe the results of the working of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1953, to date as encouraging if not spectacular.  When that Act was framed, when the policy of giving exceptional State assistance to encourage industrial development in those Western seaboard counties was adopted, it was recognised that the pull of economic advantage in the Eastern areas was very strong and was likely to remain strong.  I think it is true to say that many of the projects which have been established in these Western counties, or which will in the future be established, would not have gone to Western locations but for the inducements offered by the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    <P>I endeavoured, when introducing the 1953 Act, to discount, any excessive optimism.  I argued that results were likely to come fairly slowly.  However, <Col N="294" /> it is interesting to note that the rate of progress in industrial development in these areas in tending to accelerate as the promoters of new industries are becoming increasingly aware of the advantages available under that Act. In the first full year during which An Foras Tionscal was operating and the Undeveloped Areas Act was in force, the total of the grants allocated was £150,000.  For each of the next two years they averaged £300,000 and for the following two years they averaged £400,000.  I think that quickening of tempo may be expected to continue. Indeed, the indications are that a considerable number of propositions will be under examination in the next few months.  Not all of them, of course, will be approved by An Foras Tionscal as coming within their terms of reference and deserving of their support but a number of them will almost certainly be so approved.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps worthy of mention that many of these new industries established in the Western counties since the Undeveloped Areas Act was passed are contributing in a fairly substantial way to our export trade.  That is a very welcomed development.  A number of the firms already in production have succeeded in opening up export markets.  It is perhaps even more interesting that some of the new proposals coming along for consideration are being planned on a scale which means that export trade must be secured if an economic volume of production is to be realised.  In all the circumstances, I think the case for continuing this legislation is incontestable. Therefore, I have very considerable confidence in recommending the passage of this Bill to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be any objection to the increase of the money which is required under Section 15 but I should like to ask the Minister a few questions which he left unanswered in his opening speech.  He referred to the fact that, when in production, a total number of 3,500 to 4,000 persons would be employed and the total capital investment would amount to £4,500,000.  I take it that that included the amount advanced <Col N="295" /> from grants by An Foras Tionscal and the private investment together.</P>
      <P>While it is generally accepted that the aim of this Bill has been to promote employment in what were formerly known as the &ldquo;congested&rdquo; districts, I think it worth considering at present whether we are not storing up future problems.  When the initial Act was introduced in 1952, the question of a Free Trade Area had not been considered or, if it had been considered, it was only a remote possibility. Recent developments show that that situation has changed rapidly and, in so far as opinion is available with which to guide industrialists or persons concerned in industry, people who have studied this question all appear to agree that it will involve considerable problems when it comes, so far as industries are concerned&mdash; that it may mean advantages for some and disadvantages for others but that the changed circumstances which will come about will involve major questions not alone of national policy but for the industries concerned.</P>
      <P>I should be glad to know from the Minister, when he is concluding, if future policy by his Department or by An Foras Tionscal will take into account the advent of the Free Trade Area and the position which will arise for industries who are now seeking or who may in the future seek assistance from the grants available from An Foras Tionscal.  While all sections in the House wish to see employment provided in the congested areas, if, in a very short time, these industries are obliged to meet, not alone the disadvantage which they have had to face from their inception of being in remote places, competing with industries established in the Eastern part of the country, but also the problems which will arise as a result of the advent of the Free Trade Area, then I think we should consider carefully where we are going in this matter and what will happen if that situation arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to hear from the Minister greater details of the actual numbers employed at present and the value of the output from the industries concerned.  The Minister mentioned <Col N="296" /> that some encouraging exports had taken place and we would be glad if he could give details, not necessarily mentioning the concerns by name but the total value of the exports and the type of commodity which has been exported and if he can say whether this is a new development which was not formerly carried on here.  Subject to these queries we gladly give this Bill approval.  I should like the Minister also, in cases where factories closed down, to give details of the losses incurred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is only one issue arising on this Bill and that is whether the House should give approval to the continuance of the Undeveloped Areas Act and the procedural arrangements which have made it possible under the Act to encourage the establishment of industries in these areas.</P>
      <P>I do not think there will be any two views in the House on that.  The original Bill was welcomed, not in any spirit of gushing enthusiasm but as an endeavour to establish industries in some areas &mdash; in undeveloped areas is perhaps a more correct description&mdash; in the hope that we could stop emigration from these areas and permit them to make a contribution to the economic development of the country.  Some noteworthy progress has been made by the establishment of some of the industries although I agree with the Minister that, on the whole, we could not say the progress made has been spectacular.</P>
      <P>The State has already committed itself to spend £2,000,000 in encouraging the establishment of industries in undeveloped areas and the proposal now is to extend this sum to £4,000,000.  That represents evidence of the earnestness of the State in encouraging development of industry which, without State aid, clearly would never be established, because the absence of State aid over the past 30 or 35 years has shown that these industries would not come to life of their own volition in the undeveloped areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I say that progress has not been spectacular, I think on the whole it has been fairly good and has certain <Col N="297" /> encouraging facets about it.  Some of the industries have been started in a manner which gives evidence of growth and success.  There have been some failures, some regrettable failures and it might indeed be well if An Foras Tionscal, the body responsible for the administration of the grants, profited by the experience in those industries which fell down and if perhaps they applied more rigorous tests to the management of industries in the undeveloped areas in the future.</P>
    <P>Two industries that failed to my own knowledge, appear to have failed very largely on the managerial side and I think, perhaps, more experienced direction or more skilled management might have avoided the closing down of these industries and the consequent loss of substantial State capital and the disemployment of workers.  I am sure the directors of An Foras Tionscal are aware of the two instances I have in mind and I do not think there will be much disagreement between them and myself as to the infirmities from which both industries suffered at managerial level.  In a business of this kind one must, I suppose, take risks of losses as part of the inevitable risks which have to be undertaken in encouraging projects of this kind.</P>
    <P>I believe it is a good national policy to encourage the establishment of industries in the undeveloped areas but at the same time I must say that the emergence of the Common Market and the Free Trade Area is, in my view, calculated to make the going much more difficult in regard to the establishment of industries, either in the undeveloped areas or outside those areas.  I cannot share the simple enthusiasm of some people who have no association with industry in a practical way for the Free Trade Area, because the citizen of this country who can to-day with his hand on his heart say that the Free Trade Area will be a heaven-sent panacea for our difficulties is a person who should be locked up in an economic mental home.  Anybody who has given even the most casual study to the proposals for a Free Trade Area knows it is bound to have immense repercussions, not merely in respect of <Col N="298" /> the establishment of new industries, but also in respect of existing industries here.</P>
    <P>For 35 years we have looked at our industrial development as development which necessitated protection against outside competition in order to foster the growth of new industries here and to make up for the lack of traditional know-how and the absence of mechanical knowledge which were not possessed by our people.  What we have to contemplate in connection with the establishment of a Free Trade Area is &mdash; I do not want to develop this point to any great length&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not discuss the pros and cons of the Free Trade Area on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to do that.  I merely propose to utter this warning, that since 2,000,000 good looking pounds are now in the weighing scales we should remember the difficulties into which we are likely to run and we must have a sobering review of our industrial development if some of the enthusiasts for the Free Trade Area have their way.  I fear that those who so lightly think that adherence to the Free Trade Area is likely to inaugurate the era of the gravy train &mdash;as the Americans would describe the situation here&mdash;are going to be sadly disillusioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our own approach to industrial development has been to assist development on the basis of protection of new industries against foreign competition, against the intensity of that foreign competition, against the highly capitalised foreign competition and against the skill and ingenuity which went with the long established craftsmanship of other countries.  But if we are in the Free Trade Area then have no doubt about it, if Britain is also in the Free Trade Area every manufacturer in Britain will be able to send in his products here without any duty whatever on them.  Every industry here whether in the eastern or western portion of the country, when that stage of free trade has been reached must be able to produce and sell goods, <Col N="299" /> not merely in the foreign markets comprised in the Free Trade Area of the Common Market but also able to sell goods where they are made and elsewhere in Ireland in competition with other industries from the Free Trade Area.  Up to the present, they have not been able to do that.  They are not able to do it to-day.</P>
    <P>We would close 75 per cent. of our industries to-day if we were to repeal the tariffs the free trade area contemplates. That type of development has got to be watched.  We have got to be extremely careful before we take a definite step.  If we take a definite step either to go in or stay out it should be done after the Parliament or perhaps, the people&mdash;it will have a tremendous effect on life in this country&mdash;have been given an opportunity of weighing the pros and cons of the whole situation.  We are presented in this regard with a situation in which going in is bad and staying out is bad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has a serious effect upon the Bill.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to the matter, too, because he, without any consultation with me, apparently sees the danger of these new industries being able to start or survive against development of the kind he had in mind and which I have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be developing the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  This is a development in regard to which I do not think there should be much Party disagreement.  The whole question is a national one.  From our point of view, it is not a Party question.  When it arises, I think it has to be approached from a national point of view and not from a Party point of view.  I myself would certainly be prepared to say to the people we represent that all our resources and ingenuity must be pooled in order to <Col N="300" /> offset the worst possible reactions of the development of a free trade area in which we may be the extremely poor relations.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, I welcome the Bill as an effort to continue a policy which has given us fair and, perhaps, encouraging results.  It is an investment which I think we must make.  I hope the continuance of the legislation will, notwithstanding the difficulties we see on the horizon, encourage other industrialists and potential industrialists to avail of the facilities which are offered under this Bill and which represent striking encouragement financially to those who are interested in the establishment of industries within the undeveloped areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, agree with what has been said already.  The continuance of this legislation, is welcomed by both sides of the House, particularly by those of us from the Western seaboard areas, referred to in the Bill, as the undeveloped areas.  I am one of those who would have liked to see greater success under the Act since it came into operation.  That was no fault of anybody who at the start foresaw what might be the future of industry in the Western areas under that Act.  It was no fault of those who operated the Act.</P>
      <P>There was, as the Minister pointed out, sufficient activity under the Act to justify its existence and while we realise that industry, particularly large industries, are something which do not spring up overnight and require a good deal of forethought and examination, it is only natural to realise that the amount of activity under the Act over the past few years was not so great. We hope that it is only a signal of what the future will hold.  God knows, the Western seaboard badly needs industry, and unless we have an increasing number of industrial concerns moving into those areas with a corresponding increase in what little native industries there are in those areas, I cannot see much hope of arresting the steady flow of population from those areas, not merely through emigration but actually within the country itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> The movement towards the eastern seaboard, particularly towards the larger towns and cities, is, to my mind, not a healthy sign because people moving into those areas where the population is concentrated do not usually go into productive employment and very often too many of them become a burden on the social services of the State.  It would be better if more employment could be found in the areas along the western seaboard and thus give encouragement to the population who eke out an existence but who are inclined to lose heart and do not even make an effort to carry on by the means through which they have made a decent enough living in the past.  They are inclined to be attracted by those already gone.  It is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill is only one of the many things that will eventually tend towards the amelioration of that problem.  I said I did not think the operation of the Act had any serious effect on progress in the past few years, but I do think &mdash; the previous speaker spoke about an element of risk in these matters &mdash; that the authority dealing with problems in connection with applications for grants under the Act were unduly careful.</P>
    <P>I believe that many of those who came along to find out what assistance was available to them were not satisfied with the manner in which their applications were handled.  The amount of probing and examination done was done in the best interests of the proposed industries.  It was done to ensure that the industries would be of a permanent nature with a reasonable hope of success, that they would employ a certain number of people and so forth. But I think the nature of the investigations which take place before it is finally decided that a grant is payable very often creates a bad impression with the outsiders who came in here to seek these facilities.  It often tended towards their calling off the proposals altogether.</P>
    <P>I think we should approach such people in a more hospitable manner. Very often when a proposal is before the board of An Foras Tionscal for a long period, it transpires that just at <Col N="302" /> the time when they think, after 12 months, that the scheme should be ready to be sanctioned or put into operation, some petty question again arises which throws the whole thing back into the melting pot and as often as not the concern making the proposal is only then being seriously considered a <i>bona fide</i> firm capable of carrying out the work at all.  When a proposal is made by some outside concern, the first duty should be to ascertain whether or not it is a <i>bona fide</i> firm or a representative of such that has the necessary technical know-how and reputation and that what they are going to produce is something for which there is a market.</P>
    <P>First of all, it should be ascertained whether they are really worthy of consideration at all.  Having at the outset satisfied ourselves as to the qualifications in that respect, it would only be natural then to get down to the smaller details of hammering out a working scheme with regard to the costings, the volume of production which was hoped to be achieved, and the employment to be given.</P>
    <P>I make the statement for what it is worth, but I believe the officials concerned have been much too wary. They have examined proposals much too cautiously and have been entirely too anxious to probe the smallest details in respect of any proposal put before them.  In some cases, this has resulted in certain proposals being decried and people being discouraged.</P>
    <P>I should like to see some grading of the scale of grants payable in respect of proposals, in accordance with the location or the area in which an industry is to be established.  If an industrial concern decides that they will open a branch in this country to avail of the benefits given under the Undeveloped Areas Act, they will look at a map and see the entire undeveloped areas boundary along the western seaboard.  They are likely to decide on locations along the borderline, in Counties Galway, Clare and Roscommon, which are much nearer to the hub of things, and are more likely places in which to set up an industry than Valencia in Kerry, or Glencolumcille in Donegal.  They know that they <Col N="303" /> will get the same facilities by just moving across the boundary of the undeveloped areas as they would by going back to the farthest extent.  You naturally do not expect to have the same enthusiasm or chance to secure industries, in the areas where they are most needed, as you will have on the fringe of the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that there should be a scaling down of grants, or better still, an increase in the amount available, to those prepared to go to the more decentralised areas.  For that purpose, it might be necessary to have a zoning of the area as it already exists.  There are areas in which industry is seriously needed and it is doubtful if many of the worthwhile concerns would select those areas in preference to some that are much nearer to main traffic routes, to the centres of population and so forth.</P>
    <P>In Donegal, we cannot say the success of the Act has been any too encouraging.  We have got grants for a few projects that more or less were not foreign to the soil.  We were glad to get them, however.  They created necessary expansion in one case and, in another case, we hope they will succeed in giving us an industry that is badly needed.  But I should like to point out to the Minister that one of the largest towns in the county, Ballyshannon, is easily one of the worst towns as regards unemployment in the Twenty-Six Counties at the moment.  What authority An Foras Tionscal has for directing industries to particular areas, I do not very well know.  I do realise and appreciate that when an industrial proposal comes along, they cannot in all cases say: &ldquo;You must go to Ballyshannon, or you must go to Bundoran&rdquo;, but there are occasions when an industrialist does approach An Foras Tionscal and indicates that he hopes to start an industry somewhere in the undeveloped areas.  In such a case, the board should use the function which they have of directing, or suggesting a number of areas, where that industry would be welcomed and suitably received.</P>
    <P>As far as Donegal is concerned, I <Col N="304" /> hold we are the most undeveloped county and in the most disadvantageous position, by virtue of the Border, and by virtue of our position on the North-West coast.  I mention particularly Ballyshannon and I say that there is no town in Ireland where the draught of unemployment has been felt so severely as in that town.  I have made these facts known, time and again, and I do hope that in all fairness the spirit which is enshrined in this Act, the continuation of which we are supporting to-day, will prevail. Certainly the people of that area will do everything possible to co-operate in the establishment of new industries.  I do not want to dwell on that parochial side too much, but I do emphasise there should be greater encouragement given to those concerns which are prepared to go farther into the undeveloped areas, than to those who are just prepared to stay on the fringe and qualify for the benefits available under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal with the question of the Free Trade area, but I thought the previous speaker, an ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, was unduly pessimistic and did strike too much of a panic note with regard to what he felt the Free Trade area was likely to hold for industry here. I doubt if anybody can predict what the effect of the free market will be. I had occasion to listen to it being discussed at an international conference, superficially, I know, but even those who were directly concerned or interested, were themselves very doubtful as to what its outcome or effect would be.  It is a serious thing to strike any note of panic with regard to industrial development in this country at this time and I do not think it is justified. There may be an insinuation that we should be cautious about entering into commitments in regard to the Free Trade area, but, as the speaker himself admitted, to enter it may mean taking certain risks with regard to certain spheres of production and not to enter it may mean taking greater risks.</P>

      <P>I am merely referring briefly to a few points which a previous speaker made.  I think it is a pity that a note of panic should be sounded at a time when we are hoping to continue to expand the development of industry in this country.  No panic is justified at this stage.  Those people whose duty it is to produce and who are prepared to invest their money in production are usually people who can see sufficiently far ahead to know what are their chances of succeeding in the particular business in which they are involved.  If the business is run efficiently it is all to the good for themselves.  They will be able to compete with any producer in any part of the world.  If they are not able to produce efficiently and cheaply they cannot expect to compete on the outside market, free or otherwise, with any other concern.</P>
      <P>I cannot see that the British export trade is a very competitive trade, as it used to be.  I noticed in England that in many of the picture houses films are being shown warning against the high cost of production that is likely to drive Britain out of many of the export markets of the world.  If the powers that he have seen fit to issue such a warning by means of a propaganda film strip, they must be worried in regard to the high cost of production there.  I do not think it is difficult for any country to compete with them or with any other producers if the necessary standard of efficiency is attained.  If our industrialists go all out for greater efficiency in production, better management, and consequently cheaper goods and more competitive prices, then they will be doing a good thing for industry generally in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to sound any note of warning.  I hope and believe that our industrial exports will accelerate and expand.  Goodness knows that result is very badly needed in the areas to which this Bill before us today applies.  I sincerely hope that the measure will eventually be one of the main contributing factors towards creating the necessary increased employment in these areas, that it will eventually arrest the flow from those <Col N="306" /> areas and the depopulation of what used to be many happy homes along the hillsides on the Western seabord.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure, but my welcome for it is not by any means as enthusiastic as that for the original Bill in 1952.  I thought then, and I suppose many others thought also, that we were laying the foundation stone in that Bill of something that would help to establish industries in the undeveloped areas, and I must confess to disappointment in the results. In my own county only one small factory has been established under this Act and I am sorry to say that my latest information is that even that one is not going well.  I do not want to lay the blame for that on the 1952 Act or on Foras Tionscal.  It would be very unjust for me to do so, but there are deficiencies in that Act which should be remedied now.</P>
      <P>While it is essential to bring industries into the towns in rural areas, such as Galway, Westport and Ballina, where they are very beneficial, I submit that this does not help to stop emigration from the areas 10, 12 or 15 miles away.  The Minister will probably say that it is the aim of the original Act and of this one that the initiative to start an industry, as well as a certain percentage of the capital, should come from the local people.  I am speaking of areas where the initiative will not come from the people.  It is very different in a town where you have a certain amount of business experience, It is easy for those people to come together and make the effort to establish an industry in their town, as groups of businessmen have done in several towns, sometimes with success and sometimes without success.</P>
      <P>The day has come when the Minister should take the initiative to start industries in the rural areas outside the towns.  That is one thing which is lacking in the original Act, and the Bill at present before the House should remedy that.  If we do not establish industries in the rural hinterland we will not get far.  We may provide employment in the towns and stop emigration there, but that will not help the countryside some miles away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> Deputy Brennan has criticised Foras Tionscal for being too particular in their examination of proposals by industrialists from outside.  My experience has been that, while many honest and reputable industrialists from outside were interested in our scheme of giving grants under the 1952 Act, that scheme was bound to attract every crook from outside who thought he could make money soft.  I know that, in one instance at least, Foras Tionscal saved the people of a town in the West of Ireland from becoming the victims of a person who I believe to be an international crook, and who knew as much about industry as I do, which is practically nothing.  Foras Tionscal have not been too careful, and they deserve the highest praise we can give them in this House for the manner in which they have sifted the wheat from the chaff, as they will always have to. They must abide by the Act.  In some cases, grants have been refused, but, if there is any flaw, it is in the Act and not in that particular body.  On any occasion that I went to the board on a deputation I found them courteous and willing to help as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister should introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to allow him to take the initiative in starting industries in rural areas.  For instance, there are many fishing villages that would benefit by the establishment of a small industry such as net-making or some other industry that would supplement a local industry already established or the method of livelihood of the people.  Even if such industries were run at a loss for a time, they would create employment and introduce skills into the areas which would not be lost in future years.  That was my aim when I was Minister in trying to create new forests in such areas.  The present Minister for Industry and Commerce could do as useful, if not more useful, work in that direction by extending this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, but I do hope that the undeveloped areas will benefit more by it than they did under the original Act.  I cannot see that happening unless the scope of the Bill is <Col N="308" /> widened along the lines I have indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome a measure designed to improve the undeveloped areas.  When the original Act was introduced in 1952, it was acclaimed in this House as likely to bring a good deal of prosperity to the undeveloped areas.  Five years later, we have this measure to extend the original Act for a further period of five years.  This would be an opportune time to get full particulars regarding the operation of the Act.  Instead of that, this measure has been introduced in a rather sketchy fashion.  We are told by the Minister that the Act was a success, but not spectacular.  The ex-Minister agreed that the measure was a success, but could not be described as spectacular.  Would I be wrong in describing it as a failure?  I think I would be nearer the mark than either the Minister or the ex-Minister.</P>
      <P>It is surprising that we did not get particulars as to the administrative cost involved under the Act, as to who has benefited by it, as to the districts in which the money has been spent. This House is entitled to know the places in which public money has been expended and the persons who have received money collected from the taxpayer. There is nothing secret or private about such information and we should have got these particulars from the Minister.  The Minister contented himself by telling us that, under the Act, £473,000 has been given in grants. The next bit of information we got was from the ex-Minister, who told us that two projects have been complete failures.  That is a peculiar way for Deputies to get information.  We should have had a comprehensive statement by the Minister at the outset. I protest against the failure to give that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ex-Minister for Lands has told us that, so far as County Mayo is concerned, the Act has been of little or no advantage.  Deputy Brennan informed us that, so far as Donegal is concerned, it was of no advantage there.  I can say, so far as West Cork is concerned, that it was of no advantage, and I believe Deputy Palmer could say the <Col N="309" /> same of his constituency of South Kerry.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to know where the £473,000 has gone.  Deputies would also be interested to learn about the two projects that have been complete failures and how much public money has gone down the drain as a result of these failures.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go outside the scope of the measure, which asks us to extend the Act, but we are within our rights in commenting on the results achieved under the Act.  It would not be out of place to term the measure a failure.  I expected far more from it and, like Deputy Blowick, hoped that An Foras Tionscal would send technical advisers to the various undeveloped areas to advise interested parties as to the best procedure to adopt.  I have never heard of anybody from the board being in West Cork.  I think the same is generally true of all the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>The board could be helpful in advising people living in remote islands as to how they could improve their position. Did they consider that their activities were confined to establishing factories?  I thought the existing industries in these areas would get certain help under the measure.  It would not be out of place for the board to help agriculture and fishing or advise on how the general position of the people around the coast could be improved. We got no help whatever, and for that reason I hope the Minister will give us details as to where the £473,000 has gone and as to the administrative cost, the number of people employed and the total cost of the two projects which Deputy Blowick has referred to as having failed.</P>
    <P>We will probably read in the paper to-morrow that £4,000,000 is available for the promotion of industries in the undeveloped areas.  I think we are deliberately creating a false impression because many people reading the Minister's statement to-morrow will believe that £4,000,000 is readily available whereas, judging from past experience, it will be the year 2057 before that £4,000,000 is expended.</P>
    <P>In making that statement, I quite <Col N="310" /> appreciate that every application should be judged closely and carefully. I am surprised to learn in the course of this discussion, from another ex-Minister, that the bulk of the applicants, so far as his definition of them goes, could be termed &ldquo;crooks.&rdquo;  That is an enlightening statement from an ex-Minister.  In view of all these statements, I hope the Minister will clarify the position when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Deputies could mention areas in their own constituencies which need development at this time.  I could name every town in West Cork, the Berehaven Peninsula and the numerous islands as needing help.  I would like the Minister to change the policy of the past and send technical advisers to these districts to advise interested parties there as to the best way of promoting suitable industries that are likely to be economic.  They would be more usefully employed in spending part of their time at least in that way rather than in the office in Dublin where they can meet only a few people who may come to them as a deputation.</P>
    <P>I rose to make a protest regarding the fashion in which the Bill has been introduced.  I am not adopting a pessimistic attitude, but we have to be reasonable and judge by what happened in the past.  If the same is to continue in the future, this measure will scarcely be worth the paper it is written on.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the measure and hope it will be much more successful than the original one.  I hope those in offices in Dublin and in receipt of salaries for administering this scheme will be sent by the Minister from those offices to the western and southern seaboards to meet the people they are supposed to help.  I ask also that the two industries&mdash; fishing and agriculture &mdash; in the remote areas be taken into account.  They are industries just as important in those areas as a factory or a tomato-growing plant.  I hope the position will change in the future and that the prospects for this measure will be brighter than those for the measure introduced in 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Undeveloped Areas Bill became an Act, those of us who come from the undeveloped areas had great hopes that factories would arise because of the Government aid. However, knowing that our people in Ireland as a whole, and especially those in the remote western areas, are very slow to invest money in any local project, no matter how hopeful may be its prospects of success, we considered that it was a drawback in the original Act that the initiative should come locally and that there must be a certain percentage of local investment.</P>
      <P>However &mdash; although Deputy Murphy said I, too, would say Kerry did not benefit &mdash; I can say that in my constituency good efforts were made to set up factories to deal with local raw material.  I regret that failure followed in one place and in another it is only barely existing.  It is too bad that when State money is invested and local people invest their money, it should not be successful.  The people to whom I refer invested their money in these projects, not because they would benefit personally &mdash; in fact, they did not expect any dividends at all for years &mdash; but so that they as business people would help to raise industries and give employment.  Where money is invested by the State or the people of the State in this way, the type of industry to be set up and the type of people to be responsible for it must receive great care.  However, as other Deputies said, perhaps the officers of An Foras Tionscal have been a bit too cautious in some instances.  Especially when applications are made for the further development of those industries, I think the Trade Loans Advisory Body are also too cautious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industries to which I refer are known to the officers of An Foras Tionscal and also to the Minister.  I admit that steps were taken to endeavour to help them.  I would ask the Minister not only in order to try to save the money invested by the State, but even more especially to help those who invested their money, to try to devise some means by which they could be brought into operation.  In one instance, where there was failure, it was due simply to the withdrawal of <Col N="312" /> imperial preference by the British Government in connection with the export of the material from that factory, so that really the industrialist who initiated the project and the people who invested were not really to blame at all.  The management was perfect.  In the other case, it is hoped that the erection of the factory can proceed.</P>
    <P>In the case of the area in South Kerry where attempts have been made by the local people in two important towns to start industries, I would ask the Minister to see once again what help can be given, either by a further portion of the grant being advanced or by a loan, so that the State money and the local investment will not be lost.  The Bill itself, when first operated as an Act, was most welcome. We from the undeveloped areas are pleased to see this further extension of it and that an extra amount of money will be provided.</P>
    <P>The Act has now been in force for four years.  I do not know exactly what benefit it has been to the undeveloped areas as a whole.  However, the idea is good and whatever effect a free European market will have on our industrial production, we only hope that this Bill and the original Act will result in further helping the development of industries in these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to statements which some Deputies have made that the 1952 Act, when passed, was paraded as an instrument which would bring immediate prosperity to the western counties, I can only say that I took exceptional pains when speaking on that Act here and outside to discourage hopes of any immediate spectacular industrial developments in these counties.  I emphasised then what I am emphasising now, namely, that the pull of economic advantage in the eastern part of the country is very strong and that it will take some time to reverse, or even slow down, the trend which had persisted for many years, the trend of economic activity to centre in eastern cities and towns.  I expressed the hope that, once we got that trend checked and a flow of industrial activity moving into <Col N="313" /> the West, that flow would tend to strengthen in time, and that is what is happening.</P>
      <P>The figures which I gave here when introducing this measure indicate that my expectations in that regard are being borne out and I am fairly confident that the development of industry in the West will tend to accelerate.  It will, of course, be greatly helped if the new enterprises which are already in operation or may soon come into existence are shown to be successful. Nothing succeeds like success and the example given by some firms in establishing successful and profitable enterprises in the western counties will tend to kill for all time any mistaken idea that a western location is an unsuitable one for industrial activity and major industrial development.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to figures which I gave for capital investment totalling about £4,500,000 induced by reason of the introduction of the 1952 Act.  Arising out of that investment employment of something between 3,500 and 4,000 workers will take place. A certain interesting calculation can be made by anybody who studies these figures; the indication is that it takes an investment of about £1,500 in industry to employ one worker.  Consequently, it will be appreciated that any extension of industry on a scale which will make a real impact upon our unemployment situation will involve a very substantial investment in the aggregate.  In our circumstances we just cannot expect that that will come very quickly.  This is a case in which we have to think in terms of a long pull instead of speedy results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to one question by Deputy Cosgrave concerning industries which have undertaken export business from the western counties, industries which were brought into being or assisted in developing with the aid of grants from An Foras Tionscal, I have not available to me figures which would enable me to indicate the extent to which export business is taking place or the proportion which it represents of the total output of the industries concerned. It is interesting to note that of the new projects which have recently been approved, but where production <Col N="314" /> has not yet started, no less than five are based upon export trade, either mainly or entirely and those who have started these new factories do not feel that their prospects of securing that export trade will be seriously reduced by reason of the western locations which they have chosen.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to failures.  It is rather remarkable that of the 30 concerns which have come into production the record of failure is so small. Deputy Norton spoke of two concerns. I am not quite sure what two he had in mind.  There was one concern which went into liquidation.  Everybody knows about it because it was published in the Press.  That was Tralee Moulded Products, Limited.  Even there, I am not without hope that the industry may be revived or that some other industry of a similar kind will be established in the premises.  Deputy Norton may have had in mind the same concern as Deputy Palmer.  In that particular case, there was an undertaking to give a grant when a certain stage in the process of manufacture was reached.  That stage was never reached and no grant was paid. So far as that particular enterprise is concerned, I appreciate very fully the importance of endeavouring to ensure that where local businessmen invest capital in an industrial undertaking the investors should not suffer a total loss.</P>
    <P>No doubt everybody who undertakes to invest in an industrial enterprise has to recognise that he is taking some risk and it would be altogether wrong to remove completely the element of risk.  But if that particular concern can be revived on a basis which will ensure that it will have a reasonable chance of survival in a very competitive trade and if faith in its future can be demonstrated by the investment of new private resources, then I certainly will personally be disposed to do everything I can to help it get going ahead again.  A number of concerns which were assisted did not realise all the initial hopes of their founders, but some realised these hopes very abundantly.  Nobody can guarantee, when a new industrial enterprise has started, that it is going to have a completely <Col N="315" /> uninterrupted story of success. However, on the whole I think it is true to say that most of these concerns are doing well enough.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that their survival and growth must depend upon the enterprise of their managements and upon the skill of their workers.  As far as the Government are concerned, however, they have given the opportunity and it is for the people concerned to use it.  If they find they cannot use that opportunity completely there is not much use coming looking for further Government subventions and aid.  They are not likely to get it on the one hand, and our experience is that once a concern has to resort to support of that kind its future is very doubtful in any case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan criticised an Foras Tionscal on the ground that it was too careful, that it submitted applications made to it to a too meticulous examination and, in some instances he contended, those who were associated with the application did not proceed with their project because of the delays involved in that examination.  I have as much desire as any Deputy in the House to see industrial development going ahead quickly, but where we are dealing with grants of public money it is very important indeed that the utmost care should be exercised to ensure that the grants will produce the results which the Dáil intended when passing the legislation.  Free money cannot be given away lightly, and An Foras Tionscal are, I think, quite right in insisting that applications of this kind must receive detailed examination.</P>
    <P>The submission of detailed proposals is at least evidence that the promoters of a project have themselves thought out all the problems associated with the project, have made realistic calculations of the investment required, of the costs they are likely to encounter and of the markets that will be available to them.  It is perfectly true to say that far more applications for assistance were turned down than were granted.  That was not altogether for the reason which Deputy Blowick <Col N="316" /> advanced &mdash; that the prospect of free money brought a whole lot of undesirable characters into the picture.  It was mainly due, as I said initially, to the fact that many of the applications could not be supported by the argument that there was any disadvantage at all in the location chosen, partly to the fact that the proposals put forward had been ill-conceived and that An Foras Tionscal could feel no confidence that the enterprises would succeed. Only in a few cases were applications turned down because of a suspicion that any fraud was intended.</P>
    <P>It is, in my view, in the interests of the undeveloped areas themselves that this meticulous examination should be made and that no grant should be given until the members of An Foras Tionscal are reasonably satisfied that the project they are supporting is likely to succeed and to be a permanent source of wealth and employment in the area concerned.  I think Deputy Brennan does not understand the system of the grading of grants.  It is not true to say that a concern putting up proposals for a location across the Shannon in Athlone will receive the same relative grant as the promoters of an industry in Gweedore. There is no such uniformity of assistance. Indeed, the grants are related to the difficulties likely to be experienced in the locations chosen.  The selection of the location is a matter for the promoters but An Foras Tionscal will be disposed to give more help where the location chosen is one in which the prospect of industrial development without that help is more remote than it is in areas which are not at any great disadvantage at all.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that there must be some substantial investment of their own resources by the promoters of such industries.  That is not merely a device for minimising the amount of Government assistance; it is a necessary condition for the success of the enterprise.  Unless those who are going to manage it have, themselves, a substantial stake in its success, success is not likely to come.  When Ballyshannon, Bundoran, West Cork, and any other areas concerned seek to secure the establishment of new industries, <Col N="317" /> they can reckon as a certainty on getting for sound proposals substantial Government aid in the form of free grants towards the cost of providing buildings and machinery whether such proposals are prepared by local interests, local development committees or industrial interests from any area or country.  They can reckon that the aid will be given not merely generously but willingly and happily.  That should encourage people in these areas to investigate industrial possibilities with enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to continue this form of aid for five years.  I do not say it will stop at the end of five years, but one cannot foretell what the conditions will be in 1963.  Therefore, those who want to take advantage of that aid would be well advised to try and get going during this five-year period.  Deputy Blowick was not correct in stating that only one small factory in Mayo got assistance.  According to my information grants were given to seven concerns, which are described as being in production, and to one not yet in production. These were not all new concerns. In some cases the extension of an existing enterprise was involved.  I cannot say whether any of these grants were substantial.  Many projects for Mayo emerged because of the passage of the Act.  Some reached a certain stage of examination and then did not proceed.  We have often had references made to the famous Ballina biscuit factory. This project was brought to the point where agreements for its establishment had been signed and where a specific grant of a substantial amount had been allocated by An Foras Tionscal. However, because of the withdrawal of one of the external partners for reasons of their own the project did not go ahead.  There was also the case of a textile factory for that part of the country for which a large grant was allocated.  Again it did not go ahead due to the withdrawal of the promoters.</P>
    <P>The same story could be told in many parts of the country.  Not all the projects which come to An Foras Tionscal and are approved by them reach the production stage.  My Ballina experience <Col N="318" /> has made me particularly cautious about forecasting industrial development until I see the factory going up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy talked about administration expenses.  Information on that matter is contained in the Annual Report of An Foras Tionscal, which is submitted to the Dáil.  I note that he started off by describing the Act as a failure, and ended up by welcoming the Bill, so that he covered himself both ways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick suggested that instead of holding ourselves out to assist by way of grants industries promoted by private enterprise we should establish State concerns, particularly in the rural areas of the West, and I think Deputy Murphy had the same idea in mind.  Whatever case can be made for that, it should not be made on this Bill, which is designed to assist private enterprise in these counties. Possibly that case could be argued on the next Bill which I see my colleague, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, is ready to take.</P>
    <P>One further matter I should mention. Deputy Cosgrave asked if the decision of Foras Tionscal upon new applications would take into account the possible emergence of a European Free Trade Area.  The answer to the question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, because Foras Tionscal is bound by the Act to have regard to the prospects of permanency and, indeed, it is now standard practice in the Department of Industry and Commerce to notify everybody coming into the Department to discuss new projects whether in the West or elsewhere, that this Free Trade Area plan is likely to proceed and to examine their proposals on the assumption that the Free Trade Area will come into existence and that this country will join.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss the Free Trade Area proposal.  I merely want to say that the emergence of the proposal is a very important factor bearing upon our industrial policy, whether it is industrial policy as a whole or that part concerned with western development. We have not to take a decision yet on that proposal, but when we do have to take a decision, when the matter comes to the Dáil and when that very vital decision is before us, it <Col N="319" /> will not be a question of whether we want a Free Trade Area or not.  The question will not come here for a decision until the agreement for the establishment of a Free Trade Area has been negotiated.  Our vote will not decide whether or not there will be a Free Trade Area.  The question we will have to answer is whether we want to be in it or whether we want to remain an isolated unit on its fringe.</P>
    <P>The Dáil cannot take any decision on that now, nor do I think we should attempt to take the decision until we see the whole of the proposals together. We can only guess now what form they are likely to take.  Whatever form they are likely to take they will not involve a situation in which we will have tariff protection one day and none the next.  The process of dismantling barriers to trade will be a long-term one.  No doubt the emergence of the Free Trade Area and the prospect of the dismantling of tariffs, even over a number of years, will affect many of our industries.  It will, indeed, affect industries in every country in Europe.</P>
    <P>The most satisfactory feature of all comments on this proposal, to my mind, is the indication that the great majority of Irish industrialists are not afraid of it at all.  Some industries brought into being by high tariffs may have no hope of survival, but many of our manufacturers see in the prospect of a Free Trade Area an opportunity which they are quite keen to take a crack at, and so long as that spirit exists among the leaders of industry&mdash; and the decision of the Central Trade Union Organisation in this regard has also to be taken into consideration, and indicates a refusal to be intimidated by future prospects of European free trade &mdash; I think we can face up to whatever is coming with the certainty that even though some adjustment in our industrial organisation will be involved, we are more likely to gain than to lose on the whole in the new situation.</P>
    <P>I repeat that our decision will not be whether to have that situation or not.  We are going to have a new situation, anyway, and, so far as industry is concerned, the question will be <Col N="320" /> whether our industrial progress is more likely to be fostered in the context of a European Free Trade Area or by maintaining an isolated position when every other country in Europe has entered a Free Trade Area.  I think, however, that Deputy Cosgrave can be quite certain that everybody who from this embarks on a new industrial enterprise, whether in the West or not, will be conscious, as he is, of what the future may hold and will not risk his own resources in promoting enterprises unless he is confident in his capacity to make his investment pay off in dividends no matter how that situation may develop.</P>

Bé Bórd na gCeantar gCúng a bhunaigh na tionscail seo, ach amháin tionscal na mBréagán don chéad uair mar cuid de na hiarrachtaí a bhí á dhéanamh aca chun saol geilleagrach na gceantar gcúng a fheabhsú.  Chuir an Bórd rompa tionscail bhaile nó tionscail teaghlaigh a chur chun chinn tré deontais agus iasachtaí a thabhairt agus teagascóirí a chur ar fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>D'éirigh go réasúnta maith leis na tionscail seo, go h-áirithe i rith an chéad chogaidh mhóir i gcás an bhréidín.  De dheasca na ndeacrachtaí a tháinig ann tar éis na bacanna agus na coscanna a bhí i bhfeidhm ar an tionscal thall i Sasana i rith an chogaidh a bheith scaoilte tháinig meath orra timpeall na bliana 1920. Cuireadh deireadh le Bórd na gCeantar gCúng sa bhliain 1923, agus socraíodh go roinnfí na dualgais a bhí á gcoimhlíonadh <Col N="321" /> aca ar Rannaí éagsúla.  Faoí Ordú a rinne an Rialtas i mí Deireadh Fómhair, 1956, do haistríodh na tionscail tuatha go léir ón Roinn Tailte go dtí Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Rinne Coimisiútn na Gaeltachta staid na dtionscal tuatha a scrúdú agus mhol siad go mba, chóir Lár Ionad Margaíochta a chur ar bun chun cúraí díolacháin d'fheabhsú.  Mholadar freisin go mba chóir tabhairt faoi athbheochaint tionscail an bhréidín.  Ag éirigh as na moltaí sin do cuireadh Lár Ionad Margaíochta ar bun i mBaile Átha, Cliath agus tugadh an t-ainm &ldquo;Gaeltarra Éireann&rdquo; air.  Níl ins an ainm sin, ár ndóigh, ach ainm trádála agus is faoin ainm sin a díoltar anois na hearraí uilig atá dhá ndéanamh ins na tionscail tuatha.</P>
    <P>Tá borradh mór taréis teacht ar na tionscail tuatha ón uair a chéad bunaíodh iad.  Do cuireadh tionscail nua ar fad &mdash; tionscal na mbréagán &mdash; ar bun sa bhliain 1938 agus rinneadh forbairt mhór ar na tionscail eile, go háirithe tionscal an bhréidín.  Tugaim anseo cuntas gairid ar gach tionscal ar leith ón uair a cuireadh an Lár Ionad Margaíochta ar bun.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain 1929, bhí an tionscal seo i riocht chomh holc sin go raibh líon na bhfíodóirí ag dul i laigheadh go tapaidh ó bhliain go bliain.  Ní raibh eagraíocht ar bith ann chun bunábhar nó cumraí a chur ar fáil nó chun an bhréidín a dhíol.  Shocruigh Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta ar mhuileann sníomhacháin a bhunú i gCill Chtártha agus eagraíocht margaíochta a chur ar bun. Cuireadh ranganna ar bun chun tuilleadh fíodóirí d'oiliúint agus cuireadh cumraí nua ar fáil.  Mar thoradh ar obair na mblianta ó shoin i leith tá monarchan curtha ar fáil anois i gCill Chártha inar féidir gach gné den obair a dhéanamh idir sciúráil, meascadh, cárdáil, sníomhacháin, físiú, agus críochnú, agus ina mbíonn breis agus céad oibritheóirí fostaithe ó cheann ceann na bliana.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis na h-oibritheóirí seo bíonn timpeall céad go leith fíodóirí &mdash;agus an chuid is mó díobh ag obair ina dtithe féin &mdash; ag obair go rialta chun freastail ar ordaithe.  Tá díolacháin bréidín méadaithe ó £18,075 sa bhliain <Col N="322" /> 1935-36 go dtí £276,810 sa bhliain 1956-57.  Díoltar 50 per cent. den bhréidín seo thar lear.</P>
    <P>Tá 26 ionad cniotála agus dhá ionad bróidnéireachta faoí chúram Ghaeltarra Éireann faoí láthair agus cuirtear obair ar fáil do 300 oibrithe lán aimsireach agus 700 oibrithe páirt aimsireach a oibríonn in a dtithe féin.  Cé nach ndeacha an tionscal maisín cniotála&mdash; munab ionann is an tionscal láimhchniotál &mdash; ar aghaidh chomh tréan le tionscal an bhréidín tá earraí maisínchniotála de luach timpeall £100,000 a ndíol go rialta le roinnt blianta anuas. Maidir leis na tionscail lámh-chniotála agus bróidnéireacht bhí díolacháin de luach £46,500 ann sa bhliain airgeadais 1956-57.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh an tionscal seo ar bun ag Cuan Éilí Co. Mhuigheó sa bhliain 1938.  Osclaíodh monarchan eile ag Croilí sa bhliain 1940 agus sa bhliain 1949 osclaíodh monarchan eile ag an Spidéal chun páirteanna bábóg a dhéanamh.  Chomh maith le bréagáin, déantar málaí siopadóireachta ins an tionscal seo.  Sé luach na n-earraí a díoltar sa bhliain ná timpeall £70,000. Tá tuairim is 130 oibrithe fostaithe sa tionscal seo.</P>
    <P>Is léir mar sin go bhfuil athrú mór tagtha ar chúrsaí na dtionscal ón uair a chéad bunaíodh iad mar thionscail teaghlaigh ag Bórd na gCeantar gCung. Chomh maith leis an obair sa mbaile tá obair ar siúl i monarcain agus ionaid scaipithe ar fuaid na Gaeltachta.  Tá an cur-amach méadaithe go maith agus tá na tionscail anois ag braith cuid mhaith ar margaidh thar lear chun obair a choinneál leis na hoibritheóirí go mór-mhór i dtionscal an bhréidín.</P>
    <P>Ag féachaint don bhfás mór atá taréis teacht ar na tionscail le roinnt blian anuas agus don bhfíor go gcaithfí bheith in ann seasamh i gcoinne coimhlint, go mór-mhór ins na tíortha thar lear, socraíodh go mba chóir a mheas ar cheart eagraíocht tráchtála a chur ar bun chun na tionscail a stiúriú agus gan iad a fhágáil ag obair go díreach faoi Roinn Stáit.  Taréis dul isteach san scéal go mion is go cúramach táim sásta nach bhfuil módh oibre na StátSheirbhíse oiriúnach chun gnó tionsclaíochta den tsaghas seo d'oibriú go héifeachtúil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> Ní chuig obair den tsaghas seo a ceapadh módh oibre agus rialacha na Stát-Sheirbhíse.  I dtreo is go mbfhéidir na tionscail a fhorbairt níos fearr fós tá sé fíor riachtanach im thuairim eagraíocht tráchtála i bhfoirm Boird mar a léirítear sa Bhille, a chur ar bun agus na tionscail a chur faoin a chúram.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom gur gá dom dul isteach ró mhion i bhforálacha an Bhille féin mar is dóigh liom go bhfuil siad iontuigthe ionnta féin.  Tá an soláthar ins an mBille seo ar aon dul go ginearálta leis an soláthar a rinneadh i mBillí a ritheadh cheana féin i leith Boird Reachtúla.  Go hathcomair tá beartaithe Bord ar a dtabharfaí Gaeltarra Éireann a chur ar bun agus na tionscail tuatha a chur faoí'n a gcúram. Tá sainmhíniú tugtha sa Bhille ar chomhachtaí agus dualgaisí an Bhoird agus tá sé ráite ann cé'n chaoí a ceapfar baill an Bhoird agus cad iad na coinníollacha a bheas i bhfeidhm maidir leis na ceapacháin.  Aistreófar socmhainní agus dliteanais na dtionscail tuaithe chuig an Bord nua.  Cuirfear airgead ar fáil don Bhord faoí Alt 25 mar dheontas chun gná-chostais d'íoc agus faoi Alt 26 cuirfear airleacain inaisíoctha ar fáil le h-aghaidh caiteachas caipitil an Bhoird.  Faoí mar is gnáthach, cuirfear mar dhualgas ar an mBórd cúntais a choinneál ar a n-ioncam agus ar a gcaiteachas, agus na cúntais a chur faoí bhráid an Aire.</P>
    <P>Beidh ar an mBord, freisin, tuarascáil a thabhairt ar a gcuid imtheachtaí gach bliain.  Tá soláthar san mBille &mdash;Altanna 31 agus 32&mdash;go bhfuighidh an Dáil cóipeanna de na cúntas agus de na tuarascála a chuirfidh an Bórd ar fáil agus coinneófar Teachtaí ar an eolas sa dóigh sin, ar conus mar atá obair an Bhoird ag dul ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Is eol don Teach cé chomh deacair is atá sé cúrsaí geilleagrach na Gaeltachta fheabhsú.  Is léir dúinn anois nach mbíonn aon fhonn ar tionscalóirí dul isteach in áiteacha iargúlta d'ainneoin na mbuntáistí atá curtha ar fáil chun pé ceataí a ghabhann le tionsclaíocht sa chuid is fuide siar den tír a mhaolú.  Is mór is fiú dúinn mar sin, aon tionscal atá againn cheana sa Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt <Col N="324" /> oiread agus is féidir.  Chomh maith leis sin beidh sé de dhualgas ar an mBord nua tionscal oiriúnach ar bith a chur ar bun sa Ghaeltacht.  Sé an cuspóir atá ann: go gcuirfear obair Ghaeltarra Éireann idir lámha i slí gnótha, agus go mbeidh an Bord i ndon na tionscail tuaithe a leathnú agus tionscail nua a bhunú chomh luath agus is féidir.  Ins na cúrsaí uilig, níl aon amhras orm ach gur ionmholta go maith an togra san mBille seo, ar an ábhar go dtiubharfaidh sé seans ceart do na tionscail seo dulchun-chinn níos fearr fós a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille dá réir don Teach.</P>

      <P>Somebody said in the course of previous debates here that the speaker whose speech he was then criticising had succeeded in making a molehill out of a mountain.  The speech which the House has just heard delivered by the Minister for the Gaeltacht is an attempt at making a molehill out of a mountain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my fault if Deputy Doherty insists on giving a display of his lack of knowledge of manners and the other things incidental to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty1957" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá níos mó Gaeilge agam ná mar atá agat.  If Deputy Doherty persists with his display of lack of knowledge of Irish, English and manners, it is not my fault.  He might discover that parliamentary representation can never be reduced to that kind of conduct.  This speech is demonstrative of the molehill of success side by side with the mountain of failure.  We welcome this Bill, in principle, on this side of the House. We welcome it in principle because its presentation to the House is the result of a decision of the previous Government, as enunciated by the then Taoiseach, Deputy J.A. Costello, in October, 1956.  However, while we may welcome the Bill in principle, in the light of all that has happened in relation to Gaeltarra Éireann since October, 1956, up to the present day, <Col N="325" /> we hold ourselves free to criticise it by way of timing, by way of the ultimate date for its operation and in detail in relation to the administrative contemplation contained in its various provisions.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech gives certain details.  It sets out how many are employed in this branch or that branch of a particular industry.  It resembles very much the description given in an editorial of a national newspaper to a certain report issued by another public body a short time ago where it was described as &ldquo;an unrevealing document.&rdquo;  The Minister's speech is of very little value to the House and to the people of the country who will have to give reasonable thought to the prospect of investing State moneys in an industry such as this, particularly when the speech is, as I say, an unrevealing document in so far as it fails to give any comparative knowledge, namely, the number of people employed in each industry last year, the year before, and so on, instead of leaving it at the bald figures obtaining at the present time.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows perfectly well that there has been a serious fallingoff in production in most aspects of the trade conducted by Gaeltarra Eireann and, up to recently, that was true of all, with the exception of tweed.  The Minister implies that the main reason for bringing this Bill before the House at this stage is to foster and promote that further development of tweed which has been so apparent in the years gone by. That speech, delivered in this House this evening, contrasts &mdash; I might say conflicts &mdash; in an extraordinary way with the speech delivered by the general manager of Coras Tráchtála, Mr. Walsh, in an address to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, as reported in to-day's issue of the <i>Irish Independent.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht says, in effect: &ldquo;We are &lsquo;up-and-coming&rsquo; and, accordingly, we want this Bill to establish a board on a business basis that will make that &lsquo;up-and-coming&rsquo; more accentuated and will give rise to further promotion of the trades relevant <Col N="326" /> to Gaeltarra Eireann.&rdquo;  Listen to the report of Mr. Walsh's speech at the Dublin Chamber of Commerce yesterday, as reported in to-day's issue of the <i>Irish Independent:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Restrictions on the importation of woollen and worsted cloths imposed by the U.S. Government were described by Mr. W.H. Walsh, General Manager, Coras Tráchtála Teoranta, in an address to Dublin Chamber of Commerce, as a serious blow not only to Irish weavers and mills but also to the efforts of all concerned with the encouragement of Irish-American trade.'</P>
    <P>Mr. Walsh said that the quota on woollen cloths imposed by the U.S. Government early this year had the effect of increasing the duty from 25 per cent. to 45 per cent. after a quota figure of 14,000,000 lbs. weight from all countries had been reached. By July all the quota was filled, and U.S. importers were not willing to pay the extra duty as it priced the Irish cloth out of the market.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Our handweavers and mills are, therefore, getting no repeat orders and the immediate prospect is partial elimination from the market&mdash;perhaps total elimination for buyers and makers-up are disinclined to do business in cloth that is on and off the shelves in jack-in-the-box fashion,&rsquo; he said.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How these two statements can be reconciled, I do not know.  How the Minister, at this stage &mdash; having regard to the peculiar position obtaining, particularly with regard to our American trade &mdash; can ask the House to set up a board to which moneys will be advanced from the Oireachtas is to me somewhat inconceivable.  That is but one of the details of timing with which I quarrel.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this House and most people in the country are conversant with the situation as it obtained in Gaeltarra Eireann &mdash; the situation as I found it in October of last year.  It would be an excellent thing if the Minister would direct his mind towards the clearing-up of all the doubts and suspicions that were in the minds of most people before asking any body of <Col N="327" /> men in this country who, presumably, will be decent business men, to take over a concern which, not alone in my opinion but in the opinion of many other people, merits the closest scrutiny and inquiry.</P>
    <P>The accounts of Gaeltarra Éireann for the years 1955-56 and 1956-57 have not yet, I think, reached the Public Accounts Committee and before any body of men are asked to give their time and energies and the benefits of their experience and knowledge to the running, on a business basis, of this board, the Minister, I strongly urge, would be well advised to await the findings of the Public Accounts Committee on the transactions and dealings, internally and externally, of Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    <P>I am not going to weary the House or the country by repeating verbatim all and every one of the allegations which I made here last June but, with all deference and respect to the reply given by the then acting-Minister for the Gaeltacht, I now repeat each and every one of these allegations for the benefit of the House and the country. If I so wished, I could give information this evening upon which all the publicity of Dáil and newspaper reports could be turned regarding the affairs of Gaeltarra Éireann since last June. I shall refrain from doing so with this suggestion to the Minister, that before he proceeds further he should make inquiries into and concerning inquisitions which are being conducted at the behest of outsiders and by officers of Gaeltarra Éireann within their own Department.</P>
    <P>I shall give the Minister, expecting from him the same confidence as I now promise him, information which will warrant that inquiry by him.  If he fails to take advantage of it, then it is for the House and the country to judge.</P>
    <P>I should like to know in relation to Section 1 of the Bill why Arramara Teoranta is not being included.  That brings me to Section 8 of the Bill. This Bill purports to ask the House for power to set up an independent <Col N="328" /> board to conduct the affairs of Gaeltarra Éireann on businesslike lines and promote other industries in the Gaeltacht in addition to those already operated there.  &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;, would appear to be the key word in relation to this board but Section 8 says in one simple and sweeping sentence: &ldquo;The Minister may at any time remove a member of the board from office&rdquo;&mdash; no cause, no reason, no stated misbehaviour, no stated incapacity, no reason to be given to the House or to the Government.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I do not think the Minister for the Gaeltacht is in any way personally responsible for taking upon himself such large, sweeping and absolute power and I would commend to him &mdash; I shall certainly have something to say about it on the Committee Stage of this Bill &mdash;the terms, or a combination of the terms, of Section 5 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927 and Section 10 of the Turf Development Act of 1946. The members of a board are there afforded the protection of being given a reason for their dismissal, and a dismissal, mark you, not by the Minister but by the Government, and I think it would be an advantage to the Minister to have taken off his shoulders the individual responsibility for such dismissals, however necessary, and make it the collective responsibility of the Government.  In any event, in those two sections I have mentioned I think the Minister will find, to his advantage, a possible amendment of Section 8.  I think it would probably be preferable, and very probably lacking in contention, if the Minister were to consider that and if he brought it in as an amendment himself rather than have it tabled from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 12, the Minister will understand me when I say that I recognise it as a standard provision in articles of association of companies and, indeed, it is a provision contained in many other Acts that have set up similar boards in this country.  But I wonder is it workable? Admittedly, it is in other Acts. Section 12 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A member of the board who has <Col N="329" /> any interest in any company or concern with which the board proposes to make any contract or any interest in the contract shall disclose to the board the fact of the interest and the nature thereof, and he shall take no part in any deliberation or decision of the board relating to the contract, and the disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are two aspects in relation to that section which I want to put before the House.  One is that this creates a farcical situation bordering on corruption, and the other is that it is unworkable if the members of the board are men of substance and knowledge, experience and ability.</P>
    <P>Take the latter case first.  When this board is appointed by the Minister&mdash; the chairman, managing director and three other members &mdash; it is reasonable to assume that they will be men with a knowledge of business.  By the way, it is also reasonable to assume that there will be a representative from the Department of Finance having regard to the fact that the moneys voted by this House will be advanced to this board.</P>
    <P>Assume one of these men is a man with wide interests, not alone in one aspect of this business but in more than one and that there is a company in which he has an interest.  Assume that the board proposes to make any contract or to have any interest in the contract with that company, is that man expected to give his assistance on this board and at the same time be denied the advantage of operating as a member of one or other of his own companies?  That is arguing all the time that members of this board will be men of standing and integrity.  I see no reason in the world for precluding a man of good business standing and integrity from the deliberation or decision of the board relating to a contract in which any of his business interests would be involved.  That is the unworkable side of it as I see it.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, take the farcical side.  This board is about to do some business with a company of which one of the members is also a director.  As such director of this board of Gaeltarra <Col N="330" /> Éireann he is precluded from taking any part in the deliberations or the decision. Can anybody envisage anything funnier or less likely than that he would have a private word with his other directors, saying: &ldquo;Well, boys, I cannot open my mouth either in the deliberations approaching the decision or in the decision itself, but I am sure, like old pals, you will look after me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On those two bases I suggest to the Minister that Section 12 is unworkable, on the one hand, and farcical on the other, depending entirely in either case whether the members are going to be men of good business standing and integrity or whether they are not.</P>
    <P>The figure which may be advanced to this board by the Oireachtas is £500,000.  I refer again, on the question of Section 31 relating to accounts and audits, to the importance of the State being in a position to examine how that money was spent and generally allocated.  It is true that in the two Acts I mentioned already, the Electricity Supply Act and the Turf Development Act, there are two different methods of audit.  In the Electricity Supply Act there is a resemblance to this one.  In fact, I think it is word for word as in Section 31, sub-sections (1) to (4).  Sub-section (5) is, if it is to stand, a healthy addition, namely, &ldquo;the Minister shall cause copies of the documents furnished to him under this section to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  I would prefer &mdash; and it is something which the Minister might also consider &mdash;the wording of the particular section in the Turf Development Act in relation to accounts and audits where the Comptroller and Auditor-General is given access and power in relation to those audits.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I urge the Minister to take stock and not to rush or attempt to rush this Bill through the House.  I do not know whether it is competent to discuss the personnel of the proposed board in relation to the constitution of the board in Section 5 but, apart from my suggestion that somebody from the Department of Finance should be there, with regret, I cannot recommend to him anybody else.</P>
    <Col N="331" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill is a step in the right direction.  Of course, the Minister will say that I am clapping myself on the back when I say that because it was while I was Minister for Lands that I caused the Bill, now before the House, to be sent to the draftsman.  It is something that is necessary and it will, I believe, have a beneficial effect on the whole working of what were formerly the Gaeltacht Services Division of the Department of Lands and recently the Department of the Gaeltacht, particularly in the matter of trading, employment and so on.  It will give much needed freedom to the new board that will be set up under this new Bill which the officials of the Gaeltacht Services Division or the Minister for Lands and the Minister for the Gaeltacht never had.</P>
      <P>Naturally enough, being under Government and under Finance control, there were certain rules which had to be observed and which oftentimes had a near disastrous effect on the working of certain sections of the Division. I am glad the Bill has come before the House.  I think the Minister can be assured there will be no opposition to it and that any criticism made will be of its nature helpful.  Seeing it is the first measure the Minister, in his capacity as Minister for the Gaeltacht, has brought before the House he will get every assistance as far as I am concerned and, indeed, as far as everybody is concerned.  I cannot help recalling the first piece of legislation which I brought into the House.  It did not get the speedy passage through the House that this Bill is getting.</P>
      <P>I hope the new board when it is established will help to spread industries throughout the West of Ireland, in much the same way, and in conjunction with An Foras Tionscal, if such is possible.  I believe it will be possible for the new board to do that. It is absolutely essential to do so if we are going to keep our dwindling population, particularly in the Gaeltacht and in the poorer areas outside the Gaeltacht, at home.  If we are not going to lose more of our population it is absolutely necessary to establish new industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am coming to, and it is <Col N="332" /> just as well to put it bluntly once and for all, is that we are talking about keeping the Gaeltacht alive and about stopping emigration.  There is only one way to stop emigration and that is to spend money in the form of employment in these areas.  It is not for the good of their health that boys and girls are leaving the country.  It is not because they want to see what foreign countries are like.  It is because the particular area in which they live is not able to give them the livelihood they can earn elsewhere.  That is putting it more bluntly than it was ever put in this House, but there is no use in dodging the issue.  If we are earnest about keeping in this country the remnants of the people who are left in the rural and Gaeltacht areas, there is only one way of doing it and that is to spend money there.  There is opposition to spending money in such areas but there is no other way of keeping them at home.</P>
    <P>I do not know of anybody who would not have stayed at home for a lesser wage than he could get abroad, if it were possible to get work.  That is my experience and I have talked with hundreds of them.  None of them has gone just for the sake of travel or for the sake of amusing himself.  Such people have gone to make a livelihood for themselves.  I fully agree with their going as long as they cannot get a living at home.  No boy or girl should waste their best years in searching for employment at home when it is not there.  I would be the very last to ask them to stay under such circumstances.  On the other side, we are sent here to represent those people and it is our duty to pour money into these areas.  While it can be very easily held by some that such would be a waste of money, there is plenty of money being spent in other directions that could easily be diverted into these areas.</P>
    <P>The reason I rose to speak was to impress on the Minister and the new board, whoever the members will be, the necessity to establish industries down the country.  The Minister is the vehicle through which the board will get their money from Oireachtas Éireann and I am impressing upon him the need not to stint them for money. <Col N="333" /> It was not stinted while I was Minister for Lands and while Deputy Lindsay was Minister for the Gaeltacht.  If we are genuine about it, nice talk, flag-waving, beating drums and all the rest is not worth a button to the people down the country.  The young people, if they get nothing will go; if they do get something they will stay at home.</P>

      <P>If some people are doing it for the sake of the Irish language let them.  I am speaking from the prosaic point of view of keeping our young men and women at home, whether they speak Irish or English.</P>
      <P>With reference to Section 4 of the Bill I was very particular, when this Bill was first sent to the draftsman, that the powers given to the board under paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) of Section 4 should not be given.  The Minister in sub-section (1) of Section 4 is giving power to the board to carry on, control and manage the present rural industries and to exercise the functions in relation thereto which were previously vested in the Minister.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board shall have all such powers as are necessary for the purposes specified in the foregoing sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) states that the board shall have power</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to discontinue, either generally or in a particular place or district, the carrying on of any industry, being one of the rural industries, or any industry or productive scheme of employment provided by it under this section or any activity carried on by it in relation to or as part of the rural industries or any industry or productive scheme of employment so provided by it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a paragraph I think is unwise. Possibly with the first board there may be no need for alarm, or with the second or third boards, but the day will come when it might be our bad luck to have a weak-kneed Minister in <Col N="334" /> charge of the Gaeltacht who would give way to pressure by a Minister for Finance or by some other body, to effect savings.</P>
    <P>We all know that none of the Gaeltacht industries can show a profit. They were never intended to do that. They were intended to give employment, to produce goods to be sold to the best advantage.  I can easily see the day coming when a situation will arise when it will be pointed out to a Minister for the Gaeltacht that all these things are running at a loss and that they should be all centralised.  I would ask the Minister to look over that section again, to hold some power in his hands and be in a position to put down his foot and say that such and such an industry will not be closed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in Section 8, to which Deputy Lindsay has referred, the Minister has retained enough power to cover such an eventuality.  Under that section he can sack the whole board if they go against his wishes.  I agree fully with Deputy Lindsay in that regard.  It is an extraordinary section. The Minister is a legal man and I am not.  I am sure he appreciates better than I do the implications of that section but, with regard to sub-section (4), the Minister would be wise to retain at least such power in his own hands as would prevent any board from closing down an industry without his consent.  That is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>I wish the new board every good luck.  They have a big job in front of them and the only thing that will ever cramp, stint or stultify their efforts will be shortage of cash.  If we are genuine about our desire to keep our young people at home in rural areas, the key to the problem is simple &mdash; that is, to give them employment, and employment means money.  Give the board the necessary money to establish industries in these areas and if such industries do not stop emigration completely, they will at least cut it down to harmless proportions.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla, focal a rá fán Bhille seo&mdash; Bille a bhfuil baint aige le muintir na Gaeltachta agus lena mbeatha, Bille, <Col N="335" /> tá súil agam, a chuirfeas deireadh le himirce agus a fhágfas rathúnas ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta ó Thír Chonaill go Ciarraí.  Tá an Ghaeltacht á bánú lá i ndiaidh lae, tá an t-aos óg á tréig-bheáil agus muna mbunaíthear tionscail ins na háiteanna seo ní bheidh sábháil le déanamh ar an Ghaeltacht. Tá na daoine ag fágaint na Gaeltachta le leath-chéad bliain anuas agus má leanann sin ní bheidh Gaeltacht ar bith ann i ndiaidh fiche bliain.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh Aíre na Gaeltachta agus an Bord nua a ndícheall an Ghaeltacht a choinneál beo.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a thabhairt do Ghaeltarra Éireann as an méid tionscal a bhunaigh siad sa Ghaeltacht, i gCiarraí, i nGaillimh agus i dTír Chonaill, tionscail a bheireann fostaíocht do na céadta a chaithfeadh dul i gcéin ach go bé go bhfuil siad ansin.</P>
      <P>Rinne na hoifigigh ins an Roinn agus ins na monarchain a gcuid oibre go héifeachtach agus tá muidne sa Ghaeltacat buíoch díobh.  Más rud é go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht le sábháil, caithfear tarrtháil a dhéanamh uirthi in aithghiorracht agus tá sé de dhualgas ar an Rialtas sin a dhéanamh.</P>

    <P>Ní aontaím leis na daoine adeireann nach ndearna Rialtais na hÉireann dada don Ghaeltacht ach isí an cheist anois &mdash; caidé eile atá le déanamh más rud é go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht le slánú. De thairbhe deontaisí ón Rialtas agus ón Chomhairle Chontae tá tithe comh maith sa Ghaeltacht inniu agus atá in aon áit eile sa tír.  Gan dabht ar bith, tháinig biseach mór ar shaol na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht le scór go leith blian, ar thithe na ndaoine, ar an chaighdeán beatha, ach ina dhiaidh sin is trua linne atá inár gcónaí i gcroí na Gaeltachta, bheith ag coimhéad ar an aos óg ag fágáil na tíre lá i ndiaidh lae.  Ba cheart dúinn anois bheith ábalta i bhfad níos mó cuairteoirí a tharraingt chun na Gaeltachta.  Ní bheidh sé i bhfad anois go mbeidh críoch curtha leís an scéim aibhléise ar an Claidigh agus le stáisiún na móna ag Mín a Cuing. Bhéarfaidh an stáisiún seo obair do mhórán ins na ceantair mhóna i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill, agus cheana féin rinne aibhléis an saol níos socúlaí do <Col N="336" /> bhean a tí agus cuideoidh sé fosta le tionscail a bhunú ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Mar adúras tá dualgas ar an Rialtas fóirithint ar an nGaeltacht go tapaidh. Tá saoirse againn ins na Sé chontae fichead agus ceannaíodh an tsaoirse sin go daor.  Dá gcaillimís an tsaoirse sin ar maidin d'fhéadfaimís í a bhaint amach b'fhéidir i gceann 50 nó 100 bliain ach má chaillimid greim ar an nGaeilge ní féidir í a fháil ar ais.  Ar an ábhar sin impímid ar an mBord úr a ndícheall a dhéanamh agus táim cinnte go ndéanfaidh siad sin i dtreo is go sábhálfar an Ghaeltacht agus go gcoimeádfar an t-aos óg sa bhaile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Cosúil leis na Teachtaí eile, is mian liom comhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Áire.  That is just a preliminary in Irish because it is as much as I think I can do without being incoherent or unintelligible.  I should like to make a few comments on this question.  I am not one of those who is encouraged to speak Irish by way of grant for roads or houses, a special deontas under the Undeveloped Areas Act or anything like that.  I learnt mine through the very imperfect system of teaching Irish that is now operated in the schools.</P>
      <P>The Minister is charged with the affairs of the Gaeltacht.  Everything he is doing or proposes to do in this Bill is, I expect, for the encouragement of the Irish language in those areas and to try to ensure that the Irish language will grow.  Many efforts have been made in the past and much money has been spent to ensure that the Gaeltacht will grow and that the number of Irish speakers will accordingly increase. I should like to ask the Minister one simple question, because if I ask him too many, he can evade the main one, though not deliberately.  Is the Gaeltacht growing or is it failing? He can take any period of years, the last five, ten, 20 or 50 years.  Many of us over on the east coast want to know is the expenditure of so much money, relatively, on the Gaeltacht worth while?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If my information is correct, the Gaeltacht is a very small area indeed, something like the size of County Louth, or perhaps even half that size. I should qualify all these statements <Col N="337" /> by saying that I want to see the Irish language a live language in Ireland, but I believe that the methods being employed, particularly in the schools, are doing nothing but attempting to kill the language.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick said: &ldquo;Lash the money into it.&rdquo;  I think that is the expression he used.  I do not think it should be lashed into it, and I do not think it is a fair crack of the whip for people from the east coast who have no Gaeltacht to have to look on as, in the words of Deputy Blowick, money is lashed into the Gaeltacht, unless we see results for it.  We have not had results over the past 35 years. The Gaeltacht is particularly situated in respect of Government grants, and that is why I want to know if it is not worth while.  I am not saying it is not, but the Minister, the Government and the departmental officials should know whether or not it is worth while.  They have special housing grants over and above the ordinary housing grants, special road grants over and above the ordinary road grants, special bounties for Irish-speaking children.  I am sure there are many more grants they enjoy that I cannot bring to mind at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government said to-day that, in view of our financial circumstances, we are doing pretty well by the old age pensioners, and that we could pay the old age pensioners only what the country could afford.  He said it was a formidable bill &mdash; £11,000,000.  When we add up all the money spent in the name of the Irish language, we ought to ask ourselves is it worth while.  Again, I qualify all that by saying that I believe the Irish language can be revived, not with the lashing of money into the Gaeltacht, not with paying special bounties or allowances to those who can teach through Irish, but by a voluntary effort which should be encouraged and which can come from the people. It is only when we have compulsion that we cannot get things done.  No matter what anybody may say, I believe that, in the schools at least, the Irish language is being forced down the necks of children who, in the heel of the hunt, will turn against it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> Deputy Lindsay talked about the recent difficulty in respect of the export of tweeds to America.  It is unfortunate but I do not think we should entirely depend on the American market or any other market for the disposal of our tweeds.  I do not think Irish people generally appreciate the value there is in Irish tweeds.  We in the House do not seem to appreciate it.  If there were a &ldquo;Buy Irish Tweed&rdquo; campaign, Gaeltarra Éireann would make tremendous strides.  That would apply not merely to the factories owned by the Government but to the private enterprises that are manufacturing excellent tweeds.  We should not depend on the German or American market too much, but should make our own people conscious of the excellence of Irish tweed and try to get them away from the idea that the English cloth is the best.  There should be a home market for Irish tweed, not an exclusively export market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall contribute only a few words to the debate because, like Deputy Corish, I represent an eastern area which is not affected by the various problems with which this measure proposes to deal.  This measure is designed to hand over responsibility from the Department of the Gaeltacht to a managing board which will organise industries and arrange for the sale of the finished articles and their export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to the view that we must examine the outlook of people in the western areas.  Naturally, we must contribute towards their welfare in some way or another.  They complain that they were driven to Connacht by Cromwell.  This measure is an effort to keep them there and to preserve the Irish language amongst them.  We should decide which is in the best interests of the nation &mdash; to adopt measures which will have the best cultural results or measures which will have the best economic results.  In connection with many Gaeltacht schemes, apart from housing grants, road grants and rural improvement schemes, the emphasis is on home crafts and industries arising therefrom. Such schemes provide work mainly <Col N="339" /> for womenfolk, while the men are obliged to emigrate.  In my view, it would be better for the new board to concentrate on providing the type of activity that would keep the men at home in Connacht.  We will not succeed in keeping the people in Connacht if we do not provide the kind of activity that will keep the men there, as well as the women.  In that respect, I suggest that the new board should endeavour to encourage poultry-keeping, pig-rearing, forestry and other types of industries which would employ men.</P>
    <P>I hope the new board will concentrate on building up an economy on the basis of agricultural or industrial activity in these areas &mdash; they are mainly rural areas &mdash; which will provide such incomes for men as will encourage them to remain at home and which will replace the system of emigration which exists there at the moment and which seems to go hand in hand with the home-craft industries which have been sponsored by the Gaeltacht Department and which will be handed over to the managing board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the measure before the House to-night.  It certainly has not come before its time. When I spoke on the Estimate for Gaeltacht Services two years ago, I pointed out that, in fairness to private enterprise engaged in the same type of production as Gaeltarra Éireann, the duties of the board of Gaeltarra Éireann should be handed over to a private board in order to eliminate unfair competition.  Deputies from Donegal are well aware of what the position was.  People who were making every possible effort to place goods on the export market complained, rightly or wrongly, that Gaeltarra Éireann, which was in a position to go to the Exchequer at the end of the year for a subvention to make good any loss which it had sustained over the year, was able, when necessary, to undercut private enterprises that were trying to market their products.  This Bill will eliminate that complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody suggests that Gaeltarra Éireann is not doing an excellent job <Col N="340" /> in the tweed industry, but those private enterprises that have swelled their exports to America and other countries over the past few years will be happy to know that, in Gaeltarra Éireann, they will have a fair competitor and that any grouse or complaint they may have had in the past will be obviated by the establishment of this board which, I hope, will not give reason for any complaint from private enterprise in the future.  It is a good omen.  I believe the function of Gaeltarra Éireann was to set up industries which private enterprise could not undertake by reason of their type or location.  We always regarded that as the main function of Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    <P>When it was a matter of producing something which private enterprise could produce successfully, we did not think it necessary that a State-sponsored body should undertake such work.  No matter how a State-sponsored industry may be run, overheads will outweigh the profits.  If everyone is to keep himself correct in front of a superior or ultimately with his auditor, the overheads will on all occasions be many times that which they would be if the enterprise were run privately. That is unavoidable.  It does not attach any blame to the officers who have brought Gaeltarra Éireann to the very fine state it has attained to-day. I hope we have a right to feel that the step which is now being taken is the beginning of a new and important era for the Gaeltacht and the congested areas.</P>
    <P>I am more than interested in Section 4.  It is by that section that the success of the new board will stand or fall.  Under Section 4 they have power to establish new industries.  If the board is an efficient one, it will take over and conduct successfully the work which is already well operated by Gaeltarra Éireann.  If it can make a success of that at the outset, then it will be encouraged to expand, to establish new industries and &mdash; as we were saying a while ago in connection with a similar Bill which was before the House &mdash; we can find place for quite a few more industries of that type in some of the congested areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> It is for that reason that we are enthusiastic with regard to the Bill which is before us to-night.  Our enthusiasm may be justified.  A good deal will depend, not on lashing money into it so much, as Deputy Blowick said, but on the useful, careful and prudent management of the money placed at its disposal.  If the board undertakes its work in a businesslike way &mdash; it is handling an industry which can easily show a profit &mdash; it will be capable of expanding and we hope it will have no inhibitions about expansion in the areas concerned.  If it sets about the work in that way, we may well welcome the measure to-night and look forward to a brighter era for the congested areas and for the Gaeltacht as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish &mdash; and Deputy Rooney, to some extent &mdash; gave us the other angle on this question of money for the Gaeltacht.  I suppose that in the case of a Deputy from a part of Ireland which does not benefit under any of the little schemes which are calculated to benefit the Gaeltacht, it is only natural that he will see no good or little good in a piece of legislation such as this.  We would remind those people that, apart from the important task of preserving the Gaeltacht and thus preserving our ancient culture and language, we have souls to feed and people to maintain in those congested areas, for there are more people to the square mile there than there would be in 20 square miles in some of the counties from which some of those Deputies come.</P>
    <P>After all, in the last analysis, we are aiming at supporting more and more people instead of, as at the moment, a falling population.  Those areas are congested areas; they contain a greater proportion of population than any other areas in the State.  Therefore, we are expending some money on giving certain advantages to the Gaeltacht or congested areas.  It is not money lashed out, as Deputy Corish seemed to indicate, for something which is doubtful &mdash; he questioned whether the Gaeltacht was expanding or shrinking &mdash; but it is money provided to keep people in a reasonably modest existence, in decent homes where they have always lived along the western <Col N="342" /> seaboard.  We will thus arrest the flight from those areas and the shrinkage of the Gaeltacht and the depopulation of those rural townlands on the western seaboard.  If a Deputy is broadminded enough, I think that, irrespective of whether a piece of legislation of this kind is of benefit to his own constituency or not, he should see enough good in it to realise that it tends towards assisting an increasing population or arresting a declining population and in the last analysis that is what every side is geared to accomplish.  If we do not achieve that, then we have achieved little success in any efforts we make in industry towards providing employment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal with the question of any set-back Irish tweed has got.  Irish tweed &mdash; or, as it is better known to us, Donegal tweed&mdash; is capable of surmounting any temporary set-back which it may experience on the world market, in America or elsewhere.  It is interesting to note that its popularity, in spite of any tariff walls raised against it, is even in the ascendant to-day on the world market rather than in a decline in any area.  The outlook there is good.  If we produce sufficient, and of the perfect quality which we are producing at the moment, it is completely unnecessary to organise our own people to start wearing it, since there will be sufficient markets abroad to consume all we can produce.  That will be so, so long as we keep abreast of the times, so long as we keep abreast of fashion and produce the type of material wanted by those who in advance are studying trends of markets abroad.  Some of our producers in Donegal are sparing neither effort nor money to send representatives abroad, to appoint agents to study the trend of the market for years ahead.  While we have people prepared to do that we need have no fear about the future of the tweed industry.</P>
    <P>I hope that on the board which the Minister will appoint there will be at least a few people who will understand what tweed production is.  I hope they will be business people who will understand what a competitive business and an export business are.  I am not <Col N="343" /> concerned with what politics they may have, if they are a board which will do a good job.  They have an important task ahead of them.  I would ask the Minister to impress upon them the importance of their duties under Section 4.  It is the one section which would appeal to the people of those areas, that is, finally to expand the industry to the extent where more and more people will find suitable employment in the areas where it is so badly needed at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry indeed that I cannot report for my area the same as Deputy Brennan has done for his.  In West Cork there is a considerable portion of Gaeltacht area &mdash; Ballyvourney, Ballingeary and Cape Clear Island.  All down the years, since those areas were placed in the Gaeltacht, very little attention indeed has been given to them.  Cape Clear, of course, is at a little disadvantage, being an island, with its nearest port nine miles from the mainland, the port of Baltimore.</P>
      <P>I wonder, if we are to succeed in our deliberations to help these backward Gaeltacht areas, if it would be possible to establish some industry in the port of Baltimore, which is nine miles from Cape Clear.  It is actually the port which serves that very big island.  It would be desirable that the Minister should consider doing something to help those unfortunate people in Cape Clear.  They have never received any assistance hitherto.  The Minister is a new Minister and I appeal to him to ensure that the people in West Cork will not continue to be neglected in the future.  I appeal to him to establish some new industries there under his aegis.</P>

      <P>While I am gratified at the introduction of a measure of this kind to deal with a problem that seems to have evaded solution since the foundation of this State &mdash; one cannot say it had been solved prior to that &mdash;there are certain remarks which I must offer.  When one looks back over the past 35 years, the little that has been done in relation to this matter is a semi-tragedy.  One feels, for that reason, somewhat sceptical as to the possibility of the success of the present proposals.  Apparently the success of the proposals revolves around the board.  I do not know how one should approach that matter.  Whether or not one should approach it with confidence will depend on who is appointed to the board.  Unless the members of the board are people in whom the people of the Gaeltacht have confidence and also in whom the people of the country have confidence then one must be quite sceptical about the prospects of the success of this measure.</P>
      <P>Speaking for myself, I feel sceptical about this proposal &mdash; coming, as it does, 35 years after the foundation of this State.  How is it that it did not dawn before to-day on those in control? What has induced us to take this step, after all that long period of years?  It is a confession of the absolute failure of efforts by various Governments in the past because a failure it has been, I regret to have to say.  One would like to speak rather severely of this chapter in our history, in our dealing with this problem.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the very first thing that should have been done in connection with this matter was to make a national effort to create an industrial arm in this country.  The obvious place in which to develop that arm was where there was an abundance of labour and that abundance of labour was available in the area with which we are now dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody considering the setting up of an industry will look first of all for <Col N="346" /> availability of labour in the area concerned. You cannot establish a new industry or extend an old one in an area where labour is not available. Here we are, after 35 years, and we have not made the position any better in these areas.  What should have been done at the beginning was to establish a board which should have been given ample funds, controlled by this House, to establish industries from Donegal to Kerry.  Had that been done originally, the Irish language and the Irish way of life about which we hear so much might have been preserved.</P>
    <P>Actually the position has become worse after 35 years.  In areas where the Irish language was spoken exclusively 35 years ago the people are now, at best, bilingual.  Many of them have lost the language entirely.  We have been fiddling while Rome was burning. Nothing practical was done in these years.  A board such as I have suggested could have, 35 years ago, made employment available in the Gaeltacht areas which would have kept the young people at home.  How did we expect the young people to remain at home when they had not available to them weekly pay packets?  Did anybody think that these young people, reading about high wages elsewhere, would remain at home where there was nothing for them?  Perhaps that could happen 60 or 70 years ago when there was no radio and when newspapers were not plentiful in these areas.  That position does not obtain now: these young people know everything now; they are as well up as the people in Dublin City.</P>
    <P>We have been talking during the years about preserving the Irish language, about preserving Irish traditions and Irish culture while all these things have been dying slowly for lack of support from us.  I am very cynical and sceptical about all that has been said in this regard during the past 35 years.  I have nothing but the best wishes and the best hopes for this Bill. I hope it will have the success that it deserves.  My belief is that there is only one way to cure this position and that is to create employment with consequential weekly pay packets for the young people in the Gaeltacht areas. That is the only cure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> At the moment, these young people are handicapped at the start.  There is no attraction for them at home. Accordingly, the members of any new board which is set up will have to take off their gloves.  Any such board must be comprised of men with wide experience and wide ability in big business. The members of such a board must have vision, courage and industrial ability.  Otherwise their work will fail and there will be a worsening instead of an improvement in the position we are now trying to cure.</P>
    <P>We must be prepared to devote huge sums of money to the establishment of industries in the Gaeltacht areas.  I will not attempt to suggest the sum that would be required to do the work that is needed, but some very large sum must be earmarked if an impression is to be made on the solution of this problem.  The necessary attractions must be provided to keep the youth of these areas at home with their parents until such time as they get married and set up homes for themselves. One of the difficulties confronting this board is whether at the moment there are sufficient young people in the areas to man the factories it is proposed to set up.  Unless these industries are created this Bill is mere eye-wash.  I do not use that term in any offensive way, but for want of a better word.</P>
    <P>We have all this talk about the Irish language, but some of these areas have become English-speaking, and Irish is not spoken there at all.  In my own native parish, 50 or 60 years ago, and before that, there was practically nothing spoken but Irish; now there is not a word of Irish spoken there, unless you meet some of the old people who bid you the time of day or God's blessing in Irish.  The young people have all been away to England, Scotland, Wales or America and have lost contact with the language entirely. That is the result of our efforts.  This is a new adventure.  We are sending up a new satellite, as it were, and I hope that its motive power will be as successful as that of the recent satellite, that it will keep going and will overcome every obstacle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> The only way that success can be achieved is through the character of the men appointed to the board, if they have the qualifications to which I have referred and if this House makes available to them the money which they consider essential to create industries down the whole line from Donegal to Cork.  Let nobody deceive himself; it is, was, and will continue to be a huge and difficult problem.  I baulk at the problem when I think of this House making available to them the amount of money which I think they would require to make a success of the job.  I have sprung from these people and I have watched the tragedy of their decline and their departure from this country.  I shall be proud of these measures if they succeed, but yet I face them as a sceptic, and I make no apology for that.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a problem that has so far evaded solution, for the reasons I have already stated.  If we are to tackle it, let us tackle it with vision, courage, and energy, plus the necessary cash.  I certainly shall not condemn the men appointed to this board if they fail in their efforts because of lack of finances, because this is, was and will remain a question of finance in regard to floating and keeping afloat these industries.  Let us not talk about what we have done.  We have some handwoven tweed industries, but we always had them and there is nothing new about them. There was practically no townland in the Gaeltacht that had not one or two weaving houses.  They have now become centralised; their products have become a huge success and they are a credit to the Department.</P>
    <P>The board will require the assistance of this House as soon as it tackles the job and shows itself capable of making a success of it.  We cannot hand these men five broken swords.  That has been done already and has ended in disaster.  The very introduction of this Bill is an admission of failure.  Sixty years ago, these areas were comfortably happy.  They had an Irish way of living; they were far happier than they are to-day; but they underwent a revolution, and I use that word in the sense that these people desired progress and aimed at a higher standard <Col N="349" /> of life.  That is natural in human beings and it will continue to be.  Certainly I could not condemn young people for leaving the Gaeltacht areas and hoping for a higher standard of life, but I am very doubtful that they have found it. Many of them are perhaps financially better off, but financial success is not everything; there is more in life than money.  Yet we find thousands of them going miles away to get lost.  That is the tragedy of the whole situation and anybody who does not admit it is evading the whole question.  I wish the Minister good luck and God's blessing, prosperity and success in his endeavours.</P>

    <P>I am not too sure whether the new board will be an improvement on the existing arrangement in regard to these Gaeltacht cottage industries and industries such as hand-weaving which were run, in the main, by Gaeltarra Éireann.  That does not say that I have any fears that a board such as this will fall short of the work that has been done.  They can progress.  It is too soon to say that it is a better or a worse arrangement than we had previously.</P>

      <P>Ar labhair an Teachta go fóill?  I think that a board such as this can do very useful work.  I hope &mdash; I am not too clear on this point &mdash; that moneys will be made available from time to time to this new board.  They should be told they are being given a certain sum of money to carry on and try to make the business of Gaeltacht industries pay its way.  It is a good aim but I should like to be sure that moneys will be made available, if necessary&mdash;up to now it has been necessary &mdash; and that these moneys will be available in the future to carry on and improve these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two things are required.  In establishing any new industries and improving existing ones, the idea should be to help the people of the Gaeltacht to get employment in the Gaeltacht areas.  Secondly, we should try to improve and develop existing cottage industries which are in areas outside the Gaeltacht, in the West of Ireland and the western seaboard generally.  It is important to the country that these Industries should be developed even if <Col N="351" /> they are outside the Gaeltacht area. Where new industries can be set up, even if they are outside the Gaeltacht area, the board should assist them, provided they are in what is known as the Ceantair Cúnga.</P>
    <P>The board should not confine itself solely to the purely Gaeltacht areas. Industries of this kind should be fostered and helped in the Breac-Ghaeltacht and other areas of the West of Ireland.  I would also urge that the new board should assist private individuals and private companies who are doing the same kind of work in the congested areas as the board itself will be doing.  After all, when an individual or a group of individuals sets up cottage industries or an industry such as hand-weaving at least some help should be given to keep that industry going so that there will be fair competition between private and State-owned or semi-State owned industries.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said to-night about the large sums of money spent in the Gaeltacht and in the West generally.  It is no harm to spend these sums of money.  They are not outlandish sums, by any means.  Comparison with larger sums spent in other directions shows that the amount spent for development of the Gaeltacht is comparatively small.  If these sums were not spent in order to keep industries useful to the people, to the Gaeltacht and the State as a whole, in existence, the State would then have to meet unemployment and the payment of unemployment assistance and other unemployment benefits in these areas.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this is something which I favour very much, even though it costs the State money to provide work and have goods such as Donegal tweed and other products of Gaeltarra Éireann factories and depots available on the markets at home and for export.  It is better we should have these than that we should have to pay various social welfare benefits.  It is better for the country, the Government and, above all, better for the people themselves. In the West of Ireland, what they want is work; they want to produce <Col N="352" /> goods, and it is only when work is not available that they resort to unemployment benefit of one kind or another, or take the emigrant ship.  I think the people of the West prefer to emigrate rather than depend on doles and other allowances from the State.</P>
    <P>A good deal more can be done.  We had the ex-Minister for the Gaeltacht referring to the slump at the moment and he said that just because there was a slump, we should do nothing about Gaeltacht industries or cottage industries in the West&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think we should have such a pessimistic view just because the Americans have increased the tariffs on imported tweeds from 25 per cent. to 45 per cent.  With the help the new board can give, with new energy and a new drive and exploration of other markets &mdash; and there are other markets as well as the American market &mdash; we can improve on the very favourable position in which Donegal tweeds and other products of Gaeltarra Éireann are, or were up to a few months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> We had slumps before.  The last speaker came in here running down Donegal tweed and the price and quality of it, tearing it up here in the Dáil.  Yet, by sheer perseverance, by State and technical assistance of all kinds, we were able to improve our product to the stage when it is now regarded, not alone here but all over the world, as a first-class article of clothing, fetching high prices in foreign markets.</P>
    <P>The new board would be well advised to seek other markets than America. We had a good innings there and there are no grounds to fear that market will fail us completely.  Even if it does not fail us, we should still seek other markets because we have a first class article for sale and one which is sought by foreigners who come here.</P>
    <P>When I mentioned that the board should assist private individuals, I had in mind one case where a local group in Clonmany, County Donegal, has started weaving classes.  A local committee has provided a hall and secured an instructor from the vocational committee and they have 10 very enthusiastic boys attending. Inishowen is an area where weaving was carried on but died out, and this is an effort to revive it.  The weaving classes are in progress now and will continue for some months, and I would urge that when those classes are finished, every assistance should be given to the boys &mdash; I know they will be anxious to continue to improve their knowledge of weaving &mdash; by allowing them to purchase thread and after that, by seeing to it that a market is found in which to sell the goods they produce.</P>
    <P>While up to now, the industry is confined to purely Gaeltacht areas, I think where private groups such as the one I mentioned are anxious to introduce the industry to other congested areas, they should be given every assistance, because while it may not help the Gaeltacht, it will do it no harm and it will help the country and congested areas.  It will prevent emigration or payment of social benefits.</P>
    <P>I trust the new board will be more <Col N="354" /> successful than Gaeltarra Éireann has been, although, unlike the speaker who has just concluded, or the Minister, I would say that Gaeltarra Éireann has had a good deal of success, despite initial difficulties of great magnitude. It was not easy to succeed when Gaeltarra Éireann first went into the Kilcar factory, at a time when, not alone Donegal tweed but any Irish-manufactured article had keen competition here.  It was not easy to go down there and help in the manufacture of Donegal tweed, but they did it and they have kept up the drive, with the result that we have come a long way since then.  I want to give them credit for work well done, despite many handicaps.</P>
    <P>Some people may say more could be done.  Possibly it could; had there been more money available, a good deal more could be done.  That is why I mentioned earlier that I am anxious to know whether sums of money will be made available from time to time to the new board in such a way that they will not be asked at too early a date to carry on under their own steam.  It would be bad to set up a board, give them money and then cut them adrift.  I hope it is not the intention to do that.  State aid should be forthcoming, especially if it is clear, as it is in this case, that the board will advance and expand existing industries. I should like to sound that note of warning.  It was mentioned that the board would be something on the style of some of our existing boards such as the E.S.B., the Turf Board and the Sugar Company who are able to carry on without any State aid.  As far as I can see, knowing the position in the Gaeltacht and the congested areas, State aid must be a feature of Government policy for a long number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>The various views expressed by Deputies on this Bill are interesting.  The object of the Bill is to set up a board and the various clauses dealing with it set out the salaries and pensions of the members of the board and the members of their staff.  The real point is should we or should we not have such a board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> During all the years this State has been in existence, this problem of the Gaeltacht seems to have been the Cinderella of Irish politics.  At the very outset, there was a kind of partition of the country.  I am not now referring to the Partition of the North. We had the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, the Gaeltacht, the Breac-Ghaeltacht and the Galltacht.  One Partition should have been enough.  I know the people of the Gaeltacht.  I was born and reared there and I grew up amongst them.</P>
    <P>This problem of the Gaeltacht is really historical.  It is a problem that will not be solved for very many years. It will not be solved by the setting up of a Minister for the Gaeltacht or by setting up a Gaeltacht Board.  My personal view is that this problem is one that goes very deeply into Irish history.  I need not develop that here because Deputies know it began during the Plantation time when the people were driven back from Leinster and Northern Munster.  That is what brought about the congestion of the Gaeltacht and the undeveloped areas we were discussing earlier to-day.</P>
    <P>The only solution I can see is this. Those people have a perfect right to come back, where possible, to the land from which their ancestors were driven.  We talk a lot about setting up industries in the Gaeltacht for the preservation of the Irish language.  The problem will be eventually solved in this way &mdash; it should have been solved to a great extent earlier &mdash; that when those large estates in the Midlands and in eastern Ireland are divided&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>When will that be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Numbers of them have been divided.  Bring those people from the congested Gaeltacht areas back to those lands.  Eventually, you will have solved the problem of the Gaeltacht because you will then be able to have economic holdings for the people who remain behind.  Is that not the problem of the Department of Lands and of the Land Commission?  They are very slow about doing their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question.  Around the whole coast of the Gaeltacht areas <Col N="356" /> and the undeveloped areas, there are the finest fishing grounds in the world. Is it not the problem of the Minister for Lands in charge of fisheries to develop those fisheries to such an extent that we shall be able to give employment to those who cannot live on the land?  Furthermore, all the beauty spots of this country's tourist areas are along the west, south-west and south coasts.  By developing them, we can also develop and help those areas.  Surely it is also for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to look after whatever industries may be set up under the Undeveloped Areas Act? Is it not also the duty of the Department of Agriculture to do everything possible to help the farmers in the Gaeltacht areas to drain, reclaim and fertilise their lands?</P>
    <P>I cannot see the necessity in the first place for setting up a Ministry for the Gaeltacht.  That is my personal view.  But if it is set up, then I think the Minister should be responsible for his Department, without any help from a board.  We have too many boards entirely in this country.  Ministers have various boards and advisory boards. They are all expensive.  Every Ministry and every board set up will mean extra expense.  We hear a lot of talk about restriction of credit, adverse trade balances and so on, yet we are always doing something that involves further expenditure.  I am sure this very Bill will involve a great deal of extra expenditure.  I have no idea what the amount will be. Perhaps the Minister will tell us when he is replying, but I suppose he could not really estimate what it will be eventually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Wednesday when the debate on this motion was opened, Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Desmond contributed to it.  Running through their speeches, and also running through some of the interjections, was the general idea that the activities engaged in by illegal forces at the present time in the Six Counties were justified by the fact, or the alleged fact, that the Irish Republican Army in 1919 and 1923 was exactly on the same footing.  That is a very disastrous idea for members of this House to promote because nothing could be further from the truth.  When the Irish Republican Army in 1919 were asked to give their allegiance to the Dáil, to the representatives elected by the Irish people, they gave allegiance. They promised to obey Dáil Éireann and their commissions were issued, after the Dáil and the Republic were set up, by the Minister for Defence of that Government and they obeyed his orders.</P>
      <P>When the split came over the Treaty, the newly-elected Minister for Defence undertook that the Dáil would be maintained as the Government of the Republic and the forces of the State as the Irish Republican Army.  Many at that time who were against the Treaty urged the Republican Army to maintain its allegiance while the Government maintained the Army as the Army of the Republic.  When the Civil War broke out the attitude of the Irish Republican Army at that time was that when they were attacked they were fighting to maintain the State that had been established by the Irish people and that had not been legally disestablished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the Civil War when the Republican Army was defeated, they issued peace proposals which clearly indicated their attitude at that time towards constitutional authority in the country, and clearly indicated their acceptance of the idea that the <Col N="358" /> majority of the people's representatives should decide national policy, provided there was no oath of allegiance to a British king.  The cease fire proposals at that time, the peace proposals that were made in May, 1923, read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  That the sovereign rights of this nation are indefeasible and inalienable.</P>
    <P>2.  That all legitimate governmental authority in Ireland, legislative, executive and judicial, is derived exclusively from the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>3.  (a)  That as a practical rule of order and democratic government, political issues shall be decided by the majority vote of the duly elected representatives of the people, subject always to the right of referendum and appeal directly to the people, and to an understanding that 1 and 2 are fundamental.</P>
    <P>(b)  That as a corollary, the people are entitled to have all lethal weapons within the country in the effective custody or control of the Executive Government responsible to the people through their representatives.</P>
    <P>4.  That no citizen who subscribes to the foregoing can be justly excluded by any political oath, test, or other device from his or her share in determining national policy, or from the councils and Parliament of the nation.</P>
    <P>5.  That freedom to express political or economic opinions, or to advocate political or economic programmes, freedom to assemble in public meeting, and freedom for the Press are rights that must be guaranteed.</P>

      <P>The conditions laid down by the men who fought to maintain the State established by the people in 1919 were clearly outlined in those proposals. The conditions which they <Col N="359" /> demanded as a preliminary to the placing of their arms at the disposal of the elected representatives of the people have been fulfilled.  They were fulfilled completely in 1937 when the people finally enacted their own Constitution.  The oath of allegiance to the British King had been abolished before that.  The situation then became that people were free to go to the electors on any policy they liked and that they could come into this House and advocate any policy they liked.  The Constitution fulfilled the conditions which would give an orderly way of arriving at decisions here, an orderly way of arriving at such fundamental and vital decisions as that of peace or war.</P>
      <P>It is misleading the young people of the country, and particularly those in the various groups who are carrying on armed activities, to say they are justified in their present ignoring of the wishes of the elected representatives here, that they are justified because of the alleged attitude of the Irish Republican Army in the 1919-1923 period.  The smaller a country is and the weaker it is, the more important it is for it to have smooth and well-organised ways of arriving at policy.</P>
      <P>Policy to be effective must have behind it the greatest proportion of our people.  We must expend as little energy as we can in arriving at a policy and when it is arrived at, with the least expenditure of energy, it should have the greatest backing from all the people.  The men who are at the present time engaged in these armed activities have the right, as any of the Deputies in this House have, to go before the people and get elected on any policy they choose.</P>

      <P>What I was condemning was the idea running through <Col N="360" /> Deputy McQuillan's and Deputy Desmond's speeches and Deputy Giles's interjection that these people were justified in carrying on as they are because of the alleged attitude of the I.R.A., the Irish Republican Army, in the old days to the vital question as to how policy was to be decided and who was to have control over the armed forces.  I shall leave it at that. I dealt rather fully the last night with certain aspects of the Partition question. I do not want to go over it again. What has to be decided by the Dáil is whether the Government should be given a direction such as that outlined in Deputy McQuillan's motion, that we take certain decisions now that must be carried out immediately by the Government.  Any reasonable person will admit that it must be left to the Government to decide on matters of this kind and on the content and the timing of any motions that are put before either the United Nations or any other assembly in which the Government represents the country.  I hope the Dáil will so agree and that the Government will have the right to discuss this matter in all its aspects from time to time and to see what form of motion, if any, should be put before the United Nations or any of its constituent bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Intervening.  With regard to the first part of this motion &mdash;that U.N.O. observers be dispatched immediately to the occupied part of our national territory, I feel that it is incumbent that neutral observers should know at first hand what is taking place in that quarter of our territory which is in the hands of alien occupying forces.  These forces have the full power of radio, Press, television and cinema to distort the facts and disseminate their propaganda, but when the people of Ireland try to put the facts before the world they are jailed for their attempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The struggle of the resistance movement in the North is not a struggle of Nationalist against Unionist, as British propaganda would have us believe.  It <Col N="361" /> is not directed against the Unionist population of the North.  It is not directed against any section of the Irish people, against any Irishman or Irishwoman.  Its only target is the British occupation of our country for the past 750 years.  The Irish people know well that it is the British garrison in Ireland who are keeping the struggle alive; but when the Irish people try to explain to the world what their aim is, they are gagged and jailed.  For this, amongst other reasons, it is essential that neutral observers should see for themselves the justice of the struggle of the resistance movement against the alien occupation of one quarter of our national territory.</P>
    <P>As to the second part of the motion &mdash;the setting up of machinery for a plebiscite of the people of Ireland on the question of Partition to be held under U.N.O. auspices.  Surely this plebiscite is long overdue.  When this Dáil has in its 35 years of existence as a national Government failed and failed miserably to take any active step to undo the injustice of the partition of our land and to force the commando troops of an alien Government to leave our country and leave us work out our own salvation in our own Irish way, then it is surely time that they stood aside and let the plain people of Ireland decide what steps they wish to have taken to put an end to this 750 years long occupation. Seekers after freedom in other countries are patted on the back by our Governments.</P>
    <P>The Irish people know that Ireland will have no peace until the Imperial garrison is withdrawn from our land. When this is done, the Irish people will resolve all their differences, differences which can easily be remedied once the British propaganda designed to divide, and keep divided, our people, is withdrawn.  Ireland wants full control of its own destiny, north and south.  As long as we have occupied territory and an artificial border, so long will we have disunity, emigration, unemployment and poverty.  It is the grossest travesty of simple justice when the Irish National Flag can fly in amity and unity with the flags of other nations everywhere, save <Col N="362" /> in our own country.  Is it not therefore time to let the people of Ireland decide, by plebiscite, what they wish to have done, and to have this plebiscite under the auspices of U.N.O.?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a favourite phrase in this House that the Government and the Parliament here have done nothing for the past 35 years.  I think a great deal has been done in those 35 years, not only in the economic and social fields, but also in the matter of getting control of this country.  Deputy Finucane ought to be aware of the fact that we did get the return of the portions of our territory that were occupied by the British in 1938, and also got annulled a clause in the Treaty whereby the British people were entitled to use any portion of our territory in times of stress.  That was a pretty fair advance towards securing the sovereignty of the Twenty-Six Counties of which we have control.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out also from memory that we were making great strides with the British people up to the time of the armed activities in Britain, the Coventry bombings, and so on.  There are many people who believe that were it not for those bombings, greater strides would have been made towards securing the unity of the country.  Consequently, a number of us who can remember the time the British were in occupation here are very disappointed and upset when people take the law into their own hands, would seem to override the Parliament elected by the people of Ireland and do things which we believe are very damaging to Irish unity and in fact set things back many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met many people from Northern Ireland, both parliamentary representatives and others.  I lived for several months in the Six Counties and I have a pretty fair idea of the people who live there.  I also have a good idea of the history of the Republican movement and I believe that republicanism was started in the Six Counties about 150 years ago.  All the great names in the Republican movement were people belonging to the Faith of the majority of the people of the Six Counties and they were, I suppose, some of the <Col N="363" /> greatest patriots our country has ever known.</P>
    <P>I discussed this question with a representative of the Six Counties at Strasbourg.  He and I did not yield anything to each other, so far as our beliefs were concerned.  He asked me point blank in the course of a long discussion what were my views with regard to Partition and the steps that should be taken towards ending it.  I spoke to him quite frankly in these terms: I said, as Deputy Finucane has said, that for 750 years the people of this country suffered and endured to secure freedom and unity for the country, believing that they were entitled to it and that that freedom would bring prosperity; that we waited, suffered and endured during all those years, having at the back of our minds the knowledge that if we yielded to the British, there were many benefits which we would secure for our people; that our forefathers, notwithstanding the bribe of all those benefits and services, were prepared to suffer. I said that for 750 years our people carried on until, in 1937, we secured sovereignty for 26 of our counties.  I said that we waited for that length of time for that freedom and our people were prepared to suffer as they did during all that time.  I said that, while I should like to see unity in the morning, I wished first that the people of Northern Ireland would come into the Irish nation of their own free will. That was the first point that I wished to make.</P>
    <P>I said that if we did by force secure the union of the Six Counties with the Twenty-Six Counties, it seemed to me that we would have to maintain in the North an armed force to keep our Irish people there in subjection; that we would have, in fact, to duplicate in the North what we say the Six-County Government is doing to the people whom we regard as Nationalists in Northern Ireland.  I said that that was a situation that I did not want to see; that I would not like to see an Irish Government dragooning any section of our people in any part of our country and that, therefore, I was hoping and wishing that at some stage the people of Northern Ireland would <Col N="364" /> come in with us in the Government of the 32 Counties of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I continued that, while I should like to see unity established at once, I was satisfied to wait five years, ten years or 25 years since I knew that it was inevitable that the unity of this country would be restored and that, as I was satisfied that that would happen, I would prefer to wait the 25 years I mentioned, or longer, if necessary, so that our people would be united in a voluntary way, rather than that we should have to dragoon them into becoming Irish people.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputy Finucane and Deputy McQuillan that the Unionists in Northern Ireland are truly Irish.  They are as Irish as I am or as the rest of the members of this House are.  The only difference between us is that they have a different viewpoint.  It could have happened in 1914 and 1915, when I was a lot younger than I am now, that we would have had their view.  It was almost turning that way until the people who came out in 1916 put national spirit into our people again.  Anyone who is old enough to remember that period will know that from 1914 to 1916, it could easily have happened that we would have become satisfied to be within the British Empire.</P>
    <P>The motion asks the Government to instruct our delegate at the U.N.O. to seek in the Assembly that that body would dispatch observers to the Six Counties.  The first thing I notice about that is that we are to be immune from observation.  Even if the Deputies' demand were met by the Government, I think the observers should be asked to come to the Twenty-Six Counties as well as to the Six Counties, in all fairness.  Why should we take it on ourselves to ask that only Northern Ireland should be subjected to this inquisition?  Are not the people of Northern Ireland entitled to expect that they would come here also?</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I do not see any reason why we should not trust the Government that is in office, no matter what Government is in office, when it is dealing with the question of Irish unity outside this country.  I would have been perfectly happy to leave it <Col N="365" /> to the previous Government, and we did leave it to the previous Government, to decide what action our delegates at U.N.O. would take.  I think that whatever action is necessary will be taken by the Government at present in office and that this motion should not be passed by the House.  I do not see what useful purpose it would serve to have this plebiscite.  We all know what the result would be, if it were taken over the 32 Counties.  The result would be that three-fourths of the people would vote for a united Ireland and one-fourth would perhaps vote against it and then if that decision, the likelihood of which is known to the British people and to most people throughout the world, were taken, all that would happen would be, in the event of the British withdrawing, that we would have to compel the people of Northern Ireland with a police force and an army to accept Government from Dublin or from a subordinate Parliament that we might establish in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This motion does not serve any useful purpose.  Anyone who has had experience of U.N.O. realises that we represent only one view in that body; that we are a very small country and cannot hope to impose our will on the great number of Governments represented at U.N.O. and that, if we did try to do it and made ourselves objectionable because of our pressure, far from getting their support, we probably would engender antagonism.  The Minister was wise in what he said here to-night, that they would choose the best time to make their appeal and, in the meantime, build up the case for Irish unity amongst the delegates.</P>
    <P>I might say from experience that national groups in international organisations do far greater work in the lobbies than in the chambers.  They meet representatives of other countries. As a representative of this country, I was surprised by the number of people who asked me questions about this country and about the views of Irish people on their countries.  I found that we were able to do a great deal in the lobbies to publicise the position of this country with people of other nations.  My hope is that by our <Col N="366" /> continued membership of U.N.O. we will, both in the lobbies and in the Assembly, continue to keep the case of Ireland before the delegates from other countries and, when the proper time comes, will be able to secure the co-operation of those delegates for whatever measure that is thought best to bring Ireland's case to the fore.  Of course, people forget sometimes that the people on the spot are the best judges of the time and the method to be adopted in raising such questions. Therefore, I think it would be wrong that a Parliament such as this should give those delegates an order to do certain things, maybe at the wrong time.  Therefore, my opinion is that the House should not pass this motion.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few brief comments on this motion. I must say that I am a little saddened at the attitude displayed by the last speaker in his remarks.  In the first place, I do not think there should be any objection to Deputy McQuillan or anyone in this House putting down a motion on the question of Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, the Deputy said the motion should not have been put down.  I have faith that Deputy Aiken as Minister for External Affairs, will, generally speaking, present our case in any international body as well as any Minister for External Affairs would, as well as Deputy Cosgrave or as any other Minister did.  But Deputy McQuillan and I may have a different viewpoint from many members in this House, as to when Ireland's case on Partition should be presented, where it should be presented and how it should be presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of this motion and I do not think it should be confused at all with anything that has happened in the past 12 months here in this part of the country or up in the North.  I think it is to obviate what is happening&mdash;and with which I violently disagree, that is, the use of force &mdash; that this motion has been tabled.  It is to prevent a continuance of some of the <Col N="367" /> things that have happened in the Six Counties over the past 12 months that this motion is put forward; and Deputy McQuillan, Deputy Finucane and we in the Labour Party ask that now in the United Nations the problem of Partition be brought to the fore.</P>
    <P>I know there are many objections, about our being &ldquo;a sore thumb&rdquo; in any international organisation.  I know that we may bring ourselves into disrepute if the problem is presented in the wrong way or is presented at the wrong time; but I believe that, by and large, weighing up all these difficulties, the pros and cons, now is an opportune time to have this case presented.</P>
    <P>What is being asked?  I will take the second part first.  We are asking our delegate to U.N.O. to seek in the Assembly the setting up of the necessary machinery whereby a national plebiscite of the whole people of Ireland on the question of Partition may be held under U.N.O. auspices. Deputy Loughman has repudiated every statement on the question of national self-determination that has ever been proclaimed and propounded by Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach, by Deputy Aiken and all the members of the Front Bench.  Deputy Loughman says that if we get self-determination and if there is a plebiscite of the 32 Counties, we will be left with a problem.  He says he wonders if we may have to send up policemen or soldiers to keep subject those people who would then be in the minority in the 32 Counties.  I would be prepared to chance that; I would be prepared to say that, whatever Government there is for the 32 Counties, it would be acceptable to the minority.  Remember that in the present United States of America there was even a much bigger problem, where you had practically half of the present United States in the South opposed to those in the North.  There was not any real difficulty when the Act of Union was passed and those two merged as one State, one country, so to speak.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should underestimate British propaganda, which is much more subtle than anything we in <Col N="368" /> Ireland could disseminate in Strasbourg. Deputy Loughman has been in Strasbourg and I have been there.  I have spoken there, not on the question of Partition, but I have talked to individual delegates.  They smiled and were very nice and very diplomatic; they pretended to understand the Irish point-of-view as far as Partition is concerned; but whilst they did understand it, these Unionists from the North whom Deputy Loughman pretends to know so well and those British M.P.s, whether they be Labour or Tory, have a much more subtle type of propaganda.  The members of the British Commonwealth all over the world have a much more subtle bit of propaganda than we can ever hope to have, because we are babes in arms when it comes to diplomacy.  That is not of our own making; that is not our own fault. We are a relatively young nation and we are still inexperienced in the exercise of that type of diplomacy which the British people have been used to for many centuries.</P>
    <P>The reason why I support Deputy McQuillan's proposal is to try to get our representatives to understand that it is not a domestic problem, that it is not just a struggle between Irishmen in the North and Irishmen in the South, or between Catholics in the North and Protestants in the North. We want to bring home to the United Nations that it is the British Government which was responsible for the division into six counties and 26 counties.  Whilst Deputy Loughman may appear to think that many people with whom he came in contact wanted to know all about Partition, the vast majority of the 82 countries in U.N.O. have not the foggiest idea about the problem in the North.  However, they are told by the British, by the British Members of Parliament and British representatives, and by those from the Commonwealth&mdash;people from South Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand&mdash;that this is a religious problem, that it is &ldquo;the fighting Irish fighting against one another, as usual.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If observers are sent over, let them come to the Six and Twenty-six Counties.  They can get a greater appreciation of the situation then. Let them also go to Britain and see <Col N="369" /> what the feeling there is on Partition. I agree with Deputy Loughman when he denies the allegation by, I think he said Deputy McQuillan or Deputy Finucane, that for 35 years nothing has been done.  I would disagree with that.  A lot has been done; a lot has been done for which we do not give ourselves credit, not only on the question of Partition but in economic, industrial and agricultural fields as well.  Much has been done in those short 35 years in which all of us could take pride and which is to the credit of all Governments.</P>
    <P>Whilst a lot may have been done to try to end Partition, relatively little has been achieved &mdash; and I think that is what Deputy McQuillan may have been trying to say.  All of us must agree that relatively little has been achieved.  Perhaps we got back the ports and did certain other things and declared a Republic for this part of the country; but as far as the actual reunification of the Six Counties with the Twenty-Six is concerned, the problem has become even more difficult-and that, let me say in all honesty, has been aggravated by the events in the Six Counties in the last 12 months.  It is not for me to say it, but I do not doubt the sincerity of the majority of those people; yet they are going the wrong way about it.  Let me finish with that, because this motion should not have introduced that question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I explain to Deputy Corish that what I was objecting to was instructions?  I was not objecting to observers, but to instructing our delegate on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The instructing is an expression of opinion from Deputy McQuillan, Deputy Finucane and myself. Deputy Aiken may have &mdash; he has &mdash;a different view and I am sure he will carry it in the Fianna Fáil Party and this will be voted against. There is nothing to prevent Deputy McQuillan, Deputy Finucane and myself expressing a different view and letting the public know about it.  That is the purpose of debate here, because the experience has been that the Government with a majority will <Col N="370" /> enforce its majority &mdash; whether it is a Coalition or a Fianna Fáil Government. But at least we can express our views here.  The reason why we ought to bring this thing to the notice of the United Nations is that in the United Nations Charter there is a proclamation about national self-determination. If national self-determination should apply to any country in the world, it should apply to this country &mdash; for the various reasons which have been given by Deputy Aiken, by the previous Minister, Deputy MacBride, by Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach and by others.</P>
      <P>That is supposed to be one of the most important points in their Charter, and we all know, to our regret, that it has been applied all over the world, but there is no attempt to apply it to certain countries &mdash; countries, mark you, that are not strategically placed.  I often think that if we were in a particular part of the world and could be pulled by this Power and that Power, you would have the other 80 nations of U.N.O. falling over themselves in their efforts to try to relieve this problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs spoke about the Hungarian problem.  I forget whether he dealt with the Cyprus problem in his speech to the United Nations.  I am not twitting or criticising the Minister at all.  In the main, he made a good contribution though I disagree with many portions of his speech.  He and others in the United Nations put forward suggestions for the solving of the Hungarian problem and the problems of the satellite nations.  Nobody seems to be the least bit perturbed about the Irish question simply because Ireland is the next parish to America.  We are not in any of the &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo;.  We are situated between three great friendly Powers, Canada the United States of America and Great Britain.  If we were in the strategic position that Cyprus occupies everybody would be concerned about the division of Ireland.  We support this motion and the Labour Party will vote for it.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Corish so ably cleared away the smokescreen thrown up to-night and last Wednesday by the Minister for External Affairs and his colleague, Deputy Loughman.  Every time an effort is made here to obtain support for a constitutional and practical step towards ending Partition the immediate reaction of successive Governments has been to throw up a smokescreen of alleged illegal activities here and on the other side of the British-imposed Border.</P>
      <P>It is only a short time ago since I tabled a motion here seeking to open Dáil Éireann to the elected representatives of the Six Counties.  A considerable time elapsed between the time the motion was tabled and the time when the motion came up for discussion.  In the interval certain incidents took place in the North. There were certain attacks on installations in the Six Counties and when the motion came up for discussion the then Taoiseach and the other Deputies who spoke concentrated <i>in toto</i> on the incidents which had taken place and were successful in hiding from the public the true meaning of the motion. In my opinion, and in the opinion of many outside, that motion represented a practical step towards achieving unity in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-night and last Wednesday night when this motion was being discussed we had exactly the same type of approach and the same type of smokescreen thrown up.  Would anybody listening to the Minister and to Deputy Loughman to-night not conclude that the motion under discussion was one asking for support or aid in relation to the activities taking place in occupied Ireland?  The motion merely asks that this House, through the Government, would direct our permanent representative to the U.N.O. to seek &ldquo;(a) the immediate dispatch of U.N.O. observers to the occupied part of the national territory, and (b) the setting up of the necessary machinery whereby a national plebiscite of the whole people of Ireland on the question of Partition may be held under U.N.O. auspices.&rdquo;  Is there anything in that motion to which the remarks of the <Col N="372" /> Minister for External Affairs were directly or even indirectly relevant to-night?</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to deal with the red herrings drawn across the trail by the Minister in his contribution.  I shall not dispute or discuss his interpretation or his history of events.  The younger people to-day are prepared to leave discussions on the Civil War to those who took part in it.  Such a contribution as we had to-night is a tragic contribution 35 years afterwards.  The best that can be done with the past is to forget it.  We should not now be discussing who was right and who was wrong.  We should all be agreed that it was a tragic period and, having agreed, we should move forward on honest and constructive lines to repair the damage done then and since.</P>
    <P>Deputy Loughman made one important point; he does not want any portion of the people dragooned by anybody.  Note that.  That is something with which everybody will agree. But who is doing the dragooning?  Are the Irish people dragooning one another?  Is some section of our people being dragooned?  Does Deputy Loughman believe that it is right that the Nationalist population in occupied Ireland should be dragooned as they are being dragooned to-day and have been dragooned since the Act of 1920 came into operation?  Is it not there that the dragooning is taking place? If we are keen to put an end to that on constitutional lines is there any better place to air our grievance than before the Assembly of the United Nations? From the Minister's contribution to-night it is quite clear that the Fianna Fáil cupboard is bare so far as any policy in relation to Partition is concerned. There is nothing left in the cupboard except skeletons.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that, through my opening remarks, there was nothing but a feeling of despair and hopelessness and that I was preaching that policy of despair and hopelessness. He went on to say, as reported at column 158 of the Official Report, Volume 164:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this House we are all agreed that Partition is a crime against the <Col N="373" /> Irish people, that it is a wrong that must be undone and that it is against the whole trend of thought in the democratic world at the present time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, in the course of his remarks, as reported at columns 159-160 of the Official Report, Deputy Aiken, the Minister for External Affairs, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The people responsible are the British Government.  It is they who brought it into being; it is they who are keeping it in being.  It is they who show by their actions that they regard it as in the British interest to keep Ireland divided just as they declared it to be their interest that Germany should be reunited.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a strong case from a man who should know the position.  He fairly and squarely lays the blame for Partition at the door of the British Government.  With regard to people like myself in this House who criticise the lack of action over the past 35 years, who criticise the various Governments for their approach to the ending of Partition, who criticise their approach as one of hopelessness and despair, as reported at column 161 of the Official Report, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This hopeless type of approach of Deputy McQuillan, that we must get it by this date or another date, is completely and absolutely wrong. We must set no date by which we must end Partition or surrender.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I said nothing in the course of my remarks about surrender but I did cast out the idea that the younger people have become cynical at the lack of sincerity, cynical at the approach of the major Parties on this question and that that cynicism has now been transferred into channels which, I understand, is being deplored in this House by Deputies who, themselves, many years ago, kindled or lighted these fires.</P>
    <P>We have been told by the Minister that we are not to set any date, that it does not matter how long it takes, that, in his view, Partition will be solved.  I am not prepared to take that view.  I am not prepared to believe it, because the evidence is to the contrary.  The gap between the two <Col N="374" /> parts of Ireland is slowly but definitely widening and if that drift is allowed to continue it will be a sad day for both parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is accepted by most people that the major ills that beset Ireland to-day stem from Partition.  It is accepted that the same major evils of emigration and unemployment are common to both sides of this unnatural boundary.  It is accepted that Partition was imposed on Ireland by force.  I think that the evidence of our eyes, ears and everything else will prove that Partition is there and is maintained by force by an alien Government. We know the consequences of anything like rule by force.  Wherever force is essential in maintaining or holding down people, that force breeds and incites other force in opposition to it and it is only that which we see happening to day, as we have seen it happen for years past, in the occupied part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of every Deputy to help with all the practical suggestions he can think of towards achieving the unity of our country.  I asked the Taoiseach a further question to-day:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach if, in view of the fact that Ireland is now a party to the United Nations Charter, he will state whether the Government propose to take the case for Irish unity before the Hague Court for the purpose of seeking a judicial settlement of the long standing dispute with the United Kingdom concerning sovereignty over the Six Counties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government do not propose to take the step indicated in the Deputy's question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an action that many people of this country believe should be taken but the Government take the view apparently &mdash; as we see from the reply to my question to-day &mdash; that they are the only people who will decide when to take that step.  I maintain that the people of this country, through their representatives, are entitled to put forward in this House what the people would like to see done.  I have not the slightest doubt that outside this <Col N="375" /> House the majority of the people of Ireland would be completely behind the motion in the names of Deputy Finucane and myself.</P>
    <P>I want to deal specifically with a few of the Minister's points, when he did come to the motion.  He criticised me for suggesting that he gave little attention on his recent visit to the United Nations Assembly to the problem of Partition.  He quotes me as saying that he wandered all over the world and looked at conditions in other countries.  As reported at columns 161-162 of the Official Report, he said here on Wednesday last:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the speech in the United Nations I referred to the case of Ireland.  I pleaded for the acceptance of the principle of self-determination for all countries in the Irish situation that were divided or that were still altogether occupied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, in his speech before the United Nations Assembly he dealt with problems of other countries all over the world and pointed out that these problems were similar to the Irish situation.</P>
    <P>I do not object for a moment if the Minister feels like criticising conditions in other countries which are unfortunate enough to feel the hand of the oppressor.  However, it is not unfair to suggest that charity begins at home.  The suggestion has been made that it would be wrong to bring up the Irish case specifically in the United Nations &mdash; that it would be wrong for us, in the words of the former Taoiseach, to become a sore thumb there, and thereby lose any influence or power which we have there. I suggest we are in far more danger of losing our influence, whatever it may be, by dealing with events all over the world to the annoyance of most nations.  They would all much prefer that we should have a look here at our own country and put forward our own case for unity before we start to deal with conditions that obtain in the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>We are not likely to achieve support from other nations in connection with our own problems if we start <Col N="376" /> criticising them for conditions in their own countries.</P>
    <P>Instead of making references to Partition in the U.N.O. during the numerous debates that have taken place, it would have been a far more practical thing to have set down a motion for discussion in the Assembly on the Partition question as it obtains in Ireland and to have asked that it be placed on the agenda for some specified date.  If other nations think that is the correct way of dealing with their problems and if, as we have seen so far, a number of them have been very successful in obtaining special attention in the United Nations and that none of them has, so far, been described as a sore thumb, then I think that, by taking the line I have suggested, we would be doing something practical and something worth while.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that I believe our permanent delegate in that Assembly should be instructed to put down a motion on the lines I have suggested.  I would prefer such a motion to be moved either by the Taoiseach or the Minister for External Affairs.  It is six months since I asked the Taoiseach in this House if this year he himself would go to the United Nations and put the Irish case for reunification before that Assembly.  I suggested that, while there, he should endeavour to get the co-operation of all other nations who had good will towards Ireland in order that they could later help the case he would make in the United Nations Assembly.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it was an oversight on the part of the Government that they refrained deliberately on the last two occasions on which the Minister was at the United Nations Assembly from putting down a motion along the specific lines I have suggested.  I think that is a tragic state of affairs in the light of events taking place at the moment.  There is no question that people outside this House will regard with nothing but cynicism the Government's suggestion that the constitutional approach to Partition is the only approach, when the Government themselves refuse to take the practical <Col N="377" /> steps towards the ending of Partition by constitutional means.</P>
    <P>When he was speaking in the United Nations Assembly, we know that the Minister made passing references to Partition.  Four days after he had made these passing references he was cornered in Boston by reporters who harried and cross-examined him. In the course of this cross-examination, he suggested that a plebiscite for all Ireland would be the answer.  That suggestion should have been made to the U.N.O. in the form of a specific motion.  If the Minister were unable to put that motion himself, he should have instructed Mr. Boland, our permanent delegate, to do so.  He had no business thundering out this idea in Boston where it would not have the slightest effect on the delegates to U.N.O.  It might have been good stuff for home consumption.  It might have made a few Irish-Americans quiet.</P>
    <P>What I want to make clear is that if it is right for other nations to have their affairs discussed in U.N.O. there is nothing wrong in the same course being followed with regard to the Partition of Ireland.  I have here a copy of the <i>Irish Independent,</i> dated September 13th last, which gives the text of a United Nations resolution on Hungary.  In that resolution, there are ten specific paragraphs.  That resolution came about as a result of a United Nations observer team having carried out a most thorough and fair investigation of conditions as they found them in Hungary.  So strong was the feeling on that question that the United Nations assembled a week before it was normally meant to meet, to discuss the terms of the motion.  As the House knows, the resolution got almost unanimous approval.</P>
    <P>We know that the Hungarian Government maintained that the question of conditions in Hungary was a matter for that Government to solve and that U.N.O. was poking its nose into Hungary's domestic affairs.  The same line has been taken by our own Government in relation to events that have taken place in parts of this country. The matter was mentioned in the High Court recently.  However, I do not <Col N="378" /> propose to elaborate on that matter until a further motion comes before the House.</P>
    <P>I think it is absolutely vital that we prove to the world assembly of the United Nations that Partition is an injustice imposed by Britain by military means.  It is vital that we in this part of Ireland prove to the nations of the world through the United Nations that we do not condone the activities of the British Government in the occupied part of our territory.  The best way to show the nations in that assembly what the true position is would be to call on U.N.O. to send here their own observers to study the conditions obtaining in the occupied part of Ireland under this puppet Government set up by Britain.</P>
    <P>Any commission or group of observers sent by the U.N.O. would have no difficulty in seeing for themselves how democratic procedure in that part of Ireland is flouted day by day.  Any such group of observers would have no trouble in seeing how the military forces of the British Government are used all over the occupied part of Ireland to hold in office a puppet group under the auspices of the British Government.  It would not be hard for any team of observers to see the raids that take place day and night on the homes of the Nationalist population; it would not be hard for them to see that the so-called civil police in the Six Counties differ only in uniform from the military forces operating in that part of Ireland.  The armament and training of this so-called police force is exactly similar to that of the British armed forces.  In every raid and at every road-block, British armed forces join with the members of this so-called police force.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into details on this matter because I feel it would be a waste of time in so far as the publicity my remarks will get is concerned. There seems to be a curtain of silence in so far as the newspapers are concerned. They are not prepared to publish what the true position is in the Six Counties at the present moment. I wonder how many people in this House realise the special commando <Col N="379" /> training given to the so-called police force in the North?  Are the members of this House aware of the tremendous amount of heavy armour brought into that part of the country in the past two or three years?</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to this House that what I am talking about I have seen myself.  I have been present at a number of road-blocks which were being laid down and I have seen British troops on this side of the Border with their machine-guns manning these road-blocks while the cement was setting.  Yet we are told that so far as the events in the Six Counties are concerned it is from this side of the Border that all the trouble starts.  That is what I want to get away from.  We want to penetrate that smokescreen which is being laid down here.</P>
    <P>That is where the United Nations observers will be in a position to see the truth.  They will be in a position to see that in one locality alone in the Six Counties there are over 140 young men who have been arrested and held and that at the present time there are over 300 men in Crumlin jail, of whom the entire majority, with the exception of only 17 to 19, are from the occupied part of Ireland.  It is agonising for the Nationalist population up there &mdash; and indeed for the people in this part of Ireland as well &mdash; to find this situation and to find, at the same time, that our political leaders strut the world stage like peacocks, warning, exhorting and advising the major nations of the world on how to conduct their own affairs.  While doing all this, and antagonising at the same time many nations which might be favourably disposed to Ireland, the <Col N="380" /> problem of Partition is being allowed to slide into the background.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is too late to appeal to the Minister to accept this motion.  I am not going to suggest that to-morrow morning the Minister should fire off a telegram to the Permanent Delegate to the United Nations Assembly to tell him that, on receipt of the telegram, he is to ask for this.  What I want the Minister to do is to tell the House that he is preparing the ground and that the necessary instructions have been given to our Permanent Delegate to put down a motion on the lines I have suggested, or a motion as close as possible to it.  I leave the wording of it to the Minister or his advisers who are much more capable than I am of putting it in the appropriate terms, but I think it is in the interests of Ireland that other nations should see that the body which is supposed to represent the people of Ireland, namely, Dáil Éireann, was unanimous in its request to the Government&mdash; willing or unwilling though that Government might be &mdash; and that it was shown by the vote of this House that all Parties were united in calling for those two specific items as at least a step towards solving Partition.</P>
    <P>If the Minister feels sore at me personally and if he does not want to accept it because I move it, I ask him at least to take off the Party Whip and I ask Fine Gael to do the same, and let us have a start to prove that constitutional means can be put into effect.  If we get to the U.N.O. and get the plebiscite, we will be doing a lot to give hope to the younger people and showing that we are serious about ending Partition in our own time.</P>

    <P>Note 1. - The above figures are based on recoupment claims submitted by local authorities and relate to the year ended 30th April.  The figures for 1956/57 and some figures in the earlier years are subject to revision.</P>
    <P>Note 2. - As indicated when the Department's Estimate was being introduced (Dail Debates, Vol. 161, No. 7, col. 900), it is not proposed to allocate grants for schemes in the present financial year. In a limited number of cases, local authorities were allowed continue work for some months beyond 30/4/57 to complete schemes for which grants had already been allocated.  Figures are not available for expenditure on these schemes after 30/4/57.</P>
    <P>Note 3. - Figures marked with an asterisk are estimates only, as final returns have not yet been furnished by the local authority.</P>
