      <P>I replied to similar questions addressed to me in this House on the 1st and 22nd May last.  On both occasions, I pointed out that the only measures of real advantage from the point of view of reducing unemployment are those which develop the economy, increase the opportunities of lasting employment or create assets of permanent value.  Any attempt now to solve our immediate problems by using up, on unproductive schemes, the limited capital resources so necessary for productive purposes would merely be postponing our difficulties and, ultimately, making them greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we took office in March last, my colleagues and I have continued to <Col N="3" /> give the most anxious thought to the methods by which increased production and exports could be encouraged.  Our earliest measures included the relaxation of the Special Import Levies, with a view to reducing their restrictive effect on industrial activity.  In his Budget statement on the 8th May last, the Minister for Finance announced a number of incentives which are due to come into effect from the tax year 1958-59.  These incentives are:</P>
    <P>(1)  the raising from 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. of the relief for profits derived from increases in exports;</P>
    <P>(2)  an alternative concession in the form of a relief of 25 per cent. of tax on profits attributable to total exports of manufactured goods;</P>
    <P>(3)  a 25 per cent. increase in the wear and tear allowance on plant and machinery (other than vehicles);</P>
    <P>(4)  the extension to all securities issued to the public by Irish manufacturing concerns since 1932 of the income-tax remission granted under Section 7 of the Finance Act of that year;</P>
    <P>(5)  a 40 per cent. investment allowance in respect of expenditure on the provision of new ships, instead of the existing 20 per cent. initial allowance; and</P>
    <P>(6)  tax relief for persons who contract to make payments to universities for research.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing these tax reliefs, the Minister for Finance set aside £250,000 for the improvement of the marketing of agricultural produce, £100,000 for increased expenditure on the elimination of tubercular cattle and £50,000 for the benefit of the sea and inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>The capital programme announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement, amounting to £41,000,000, was subsequently increased to £42.65 million&mdash;almost £2.5 million greater than the expenditure in 1956-57.  It includes over £1,000,000 for new industrial development in the private sector.  The provision for housing and sanitary services shows an <Col N="4" /> increase of over £2.3 million on the expenditure in 1956-57, and provision was made for an Exchequer advance of £900,000 to the Road Fund, for the purpose of discharging arrears and enabling a normal programme of road works to be carried out this year.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing, the uncertainty and confusion which existed in respect of the commitments of the local authorities were removed in May last, and funds were made available to enable them to meet their commitments. The local authorities were given access to the Local Loans Fund, not only to meet their commitments in regard to supplementary grants, but also, where they so decided, for the continued payment of such grants.  The limits of income and the limit of farm valuation for the determination of eligibility for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts were increased, and legislation has been enacted to amend the definition of &ldquo;market value&rdquo; in those Acts, so as to cover the proper and reasonable value of a house.</P>
    <P>As a step towards relieving the immediate employment difficulties, the Vote provision for employment and emergency schemes was supplemented to the extent of £250,000.</P>
    <P>The improvement that has, so far, taken place is very much less than we desire, but there are some encouraging signs.  The total number on the live register is now some 2,000 less than it was a year ago.  In mid-March last, the total was more than 16,000 greater than the figure on the corresponding date in 1956.  The volume of net output in the transportable goods industries has also shown some improvement, to the extent that, whereas, in the March quarter of this year the index was 94.1 as compared with 101.7 in the March quarter of 1956, in the June quarter of 1957 the figure was 105.0 as compared with 106.5 a year before.  A similar trend is evident in regard to employment in these industries.</P>
    <P>It is by steady progress in the direction indicated by these figures that we can hope effectively to surmount the economic difficulties which have been experienced in the last year or two.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware, in regard to his reference to the likelihood of more employment being made available through the Special Employment Schemes Office, that the increase of 100 per cent. in the local contribution now payable by would-be beneficiaries will undoubtedly hinder the progress of that scheme and be detrimental so far as employment is concerned and also so far as the interests of those applicants are concerned?</P>

      <P>The acting Minister for Finance had discussions with the Irish Banks' Standing Committee prior to the recent increase in bank interest rates. In view of the rise in interest rates elsewhere an increase in deposit rates was necessary here to safeguard the availablity of funds for the requirements of agriculture, industry and domestic activity as a whole.  This increase in deposit rates necessitated an increase in lending rates.  In adjusting their rates the banks were fully alive to the desirability, in the interest of economic development, of keeping lending rates as low as possible.  The Government were satisfied that the changes in interest rates announced by the banks on 30th September, 1957, were, in the circumstances, necessary and appropriate and no cause is seen for any legislation bearing on this matter.</P>

      <P>Interest rates are only one of a number of factors which may influence the level of employment and it is impossible to isolate the effects of particular factors.  It seems unlikely, however, that the increase of 1 per cent.  in bank lending rates will, of itself, cause any serious setback in economic activity.  It is gratifying that the recent live register figures of unemployment show a substantial reduction on the corresponding figures for 1956 and I am hopeful that the general economic position of the country will continue to improve.  It should not be overlooked that the increase in deposit rates is intended to safeguard the supply of funds for trade and industry and for productive investment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that large areas of State lands comprising folio Nos. 743, 3314, 3775, 5033, 18839 and 19058 in the Billereagh and Kilworth districts of County Cork are at present registered in the Land Registry as the property of the British Principal Secretary of State for War, and, if so, if he will state the reason for State lands remaining under such registration; and, further, if he will ensure that these lands are properly transferred and registered as the property of the State.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the lands comprising folio Nos. 743, 3314, 3775, 5033, 18839 and 19058 are registered in the Land Registry as the property of the British Principal Secretary of State for War.  In 1922 these lands were vested in Saorstát Éireann under Article XI of the Constitution. There was, however, a doubt as to which State authority was the legal successor in title to the British Secretary of State for War and consequently it was not feasible to have the land registered in the Land Registry as the property of any particular State authority.  This doubt continued until the passing of the State Property Act, 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (5) (1) of that Act provides that all land which immediately <Col N="22" /> before the date of the passing of the Act was State land and was not then vested in a State authority should stand vested in the Minister for Finance.  The fact that such lands are registered in the Land Registry as the property of a British authority is of no practical disadvantage in relation to the ownership, management or disposal of the lands.  It is proposed, however, for convenience of administration, to have such State lands vested under Section 7 of the State Property Act, 1954, in the State authority by whom they are administered.  Steps will be taken, as opportunity offers, to have such lands registered in the Land Registry as the property of the State authorities in whom they are ultimately vested.</P>

There has, however, been no avoidable delay.  I may, perhaps, recall that in the Estimates debate in May last I indicated that it was then doubtful if expenditure of the full amount provided for this scheme would materialise in the current financial year.

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he has been advised that the bringing into operation of certain sections of the Offences Against the State Acts constitutes a violation of Article 5 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; and whether there has been any communication with the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe under Article 15 of the Convention, and, if so, if he will state the terms of such communication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been advised that the bringing into operation of certain sections of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940, constitutes a violation of Article 5 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. However, lest it might be thought that any of the provisions of the Act were in conflict with Article 5, the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe was informed by letter dated 20th July last of the bringing into force of Part II of the Act.</P>
      <P>The notice is in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have the honour to inform you that Part II of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940, was brought into force on the 8th July, 1957, when a proclamation made by the Government of Ireland on the 5th July, 1957, under Section 3 of the Act was published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, the official gazette. A copy of the proclamation, together with a copy of the Act, is attached to this letter.</P>
      <P>2.  In so far as the bringing into operation of Part II of the Act, which confers special powers of arrest and detention, may involve any derogation from the obligations imposed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, I have the honour to request you to be good enough to regard this letter as informing you accordingly, in compliance with Article 15 (3) of the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> 3.  The detention of persons under the Act is considered necessary to prevent the commission of offences against public peace and order and to prevent the maintaining of military or armed forces other than those authorised by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>4.  I have the honour also to invite your attention to Section 8 of the Act, which provides for the establishment by the Government of Ireland of a commission to inquire into the grounds of detention of any person who applies to have his detention investigated.  The commission envisaged by the section was established on the 16th July, 1957.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably what the Deputy means by &ldquo;a permit&rdquo; is a travel document costing less than a passport.</P>
      <P>In the early post-war period when travel was again becoming possible, my Department gave consideration to the position of large numbers of citizens travelling abroad on pilgrimages and for other purposes and, with a view to facilitating them, made arrangements with a number of countries, including France, for the recognition of collective passports.  As a result, it is now possible for Irish citizens to travel on a collective passport costing £1 10s. to most of the countries of Western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these arrangements, a properly organised group of up to 50 Irish citizens may be included on a collective passport.  Only the leader of the <Col N="35" /> group need be in possession of an individual passport.  The other members have merely to obtain from their local Gardaí an identity card at a cost of 1/-.</P>
    <P>These arrangements may, of course, be availed of by all persons travelling to Lourdes next year.</P>

      <P>With regard to the last part of the question, there is no power to do what the Deputy suggests.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A reply was given to a similar question on 7th May last and I therefore presume that the Deputy wishes to know what further steps have been taken since then, or are in prospect.</P>
      <P>In answer to the previous question reference was made to the intention of improving the compensation payable for cows taken up under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order, 1926.  This has since been done and the local authorities concerned have been authorised to pay the full market price as compensation for each animal slaughtered.</P>
      <P>A very important further development since May last has been the extension of intensive eradication measures to Counties Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo and Roscommon.  Veterinary inspectors and trained lay staff have been assigned to each of these counties where, also, the purchase of reactors has been in progress since the beginning of October.  I have also placed staff in Counties Cavan, Galway and Monaghan where the canvassing of herd-owners is proceeding and the full intensive measures, including the purchase of reactors, will operate very shortly.  County Donegal should follow by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also directed the extension of intensive eradication measures to Counties Cork and Limerick as a matter of urgency and arrangements to this end are already well advanced. When this takes place, intensive eradication will be in progress throughout more than half the country, including the most important breeding areas.  I might mention that in County Cork a number of progressive creamery societies are showing great interest in the problem and in two large creamery areas tuberculin testing is already proceeding with a view to the early purchase and removal of reactors by the Department.  This is an example that I strongly commend to other creamery societies in Cork and Limerick in <Col N="39" /> preparation for the intensive measures soon to be introduced in those counties.</P>
    <P>The Diseases of Animals (Bovine Tuberculosis) Act, 1957, was passed by the Oireachtas in July last.  This confers on me a wide range of powers for the furtherance of the eradication programme.  As a first step, I recently made an Order requiring all creameries and cream separating stations in the country to pasteurise, or render safe, all separated milk returned by them to their suppliers.  This will take effect on 1st January, 1958.  I have also announced my intention of making an Order declaring County Sligo to be a clearance area as from 1st November, 1957.</P>

      <P>When, as a result of veterinary inspection, an animal is deemed to be affected, what instructions, if any, are issued to the owner regarding its disposal?  I am asking that question because I believe that cattle that have been rejected are then brought to the fair by the owners and sold to unsuspecting parties and that, instead of improving, the position is worsening, if anything.  I would like some clarification on that point as many people are interested in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very surprised if there were any unsuspecting parties in West Cork.  I do not think we have gone as far as we would like to go in relation to the exchange of these reactors.  I am not quite as familiar with all the details of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme as I would like to be, but eventually, and as soon as possible, I would assume that we must take precautions to prevent the sale in clearance areas of cattle affected by T.B.  I am not suggesting we are doing it now.  There is no possibility, of course, of selling a reported clinical reactor.  That beast must be destroyed, but we have not got so far as earmarking the general body of reactors yet.  We shall come to that. Again, I should like to say there are not any unsuspecting people in West Cork.</P>

Apart from that, I think there was a vast overestimation in the beginning in the number of pipes needed and, while I am making a full inquiry into the matter, hopeful to be able to meet the clay products people, at least to some extent, I must take the view that clay pipes are merely ancillary to the main problem, land reclamation.

      <P>The Government have decided to permit the export of horse-flesh for human consumption, subject to certain conditions which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle.  I will give for the information of the House. The conditions are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Exports will be limited to carcase meat in fresh, chilled or frozen form, offals, boneless cuts, and canned meat.</P>
      <P>(b)  The export of sausages or other open-pack meat products containing horse-flesh will not be permitted.</P>
      <P>(c)  The cans in which any canned horse-flesh is exported must be appropriately embossed.</P>
      <P>(d)  Slaughtering of horses will not be permitted at any premises engaged in the handling of meat or meat products of other types.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e)  My Department may prohibit <Col N="43" /> the export of horse-flesh to particular destinations.</P>
    <P>(f)  An existing meat export premises wishing to enter the horse-flesh trade will be required to give up its rights to export any other meat products and also change its trading name.</P>
    <P>(g)  Any trading name used in connection with the export of horse-flesh must not resemble a name used in connection with the export of other meat and preferably should include the word &ldquo;horse&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(h)  Each horse slaughtering premises must comply with such conditions as regards structural suitability, plant, equipment, refrigeration facilities etc. as may from time to time be determined by my Department; each premises must be a distinct self-contained unit and no activities unconnected with the slaughter of horses, the preparation of horse-flesh for export or the utilisation of byproducts may be carried on therein.</P>
    <P>(i)  The preparation, packing and transport of horse-flesh intended for export must be carried out in accordance with such regulations as may be made by my Department from time to time; all such activities will be subject to strict supervision by veterinary and other officers of the Department and veterinary examination fees under the Fresh Meat Acts will be payable; canned horse-flesh will also be subject to inspection fees.</P>
    <P>(j)  Each horse-flesh canning premises must be a self-contained unit with slaughtering and all other facilities, including a properly equipped laboratory staffed by a duly qualified chemist; this has been the policy in the case of beef canning for many years and it is considered essential that the same position should apply to horse-flesh canning.</P>
    <P>(k)  The meat content in canned horse-flesh must consist solely of horse-flesh.</P>
    <P>Subject to compliance with these conditions and any others I may introduce from time to time any firm may be licensed to engage in the trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> The provisions of the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts will be applied to horse slaughtering premises and licensing control over the export of horse-flesh is provided under the Agricultural and Fishery Products (Regulation of Export) Act, 1947.  It is not at present considered that any additional legislation will be necessary.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made from the Dairy Disposal Company, Limited in this matter and have been informed that the company would not feel justified in undertaking the relatively high capital and operating cost of a special lorry service for the collection of the small quantity of milk available from Hare Island.  If, however, the islanders themselves were prepared to organise a cartage system for their milk on the mainland, by employing a local carter or otherwise, the company would assist them as far as possible in making such arrangements and, in an effort to solve the problem and having regard to the difficulties involved, would be willing to contribute towards the cost of such cartage.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the farmers of Hare Island facilitate the Dairy Disposal Board by hauling their milk across the sea to the mainland at Cunamore, which is roughly four miles away from the creamery?  Surely the Dairy Disposal Board, a semi-State board, subsidised from public funds, should give added facilities to the islanders by having the milk transported those four miles to the creamery?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the position still is that the milk supply available on the island is too low to warrant the considerable expenditure and uneconomic running cost which would be involved in the provision and operation of a cream-separating station on the island. If, however, the islanders themselves were prepared to transport their milk co-operatively to a convenient mainland point and organise a cartage system to convey the milk from there to the nearest creamery premises, by employing a local carter or otherwise, the company would assist them as far as possible in organising the mainland cartage system and would contribute towards its operating cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme, 1957, prepared by the Minister for Defence, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under Sections 2, 3 and 5 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932 and Section 4 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, 1938, and laid before the House on the 12th day of July, 1957, be confirmed.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes are made under the authority of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts, 1932 to 1957, and deal essentially with service pensions for members of the Army, the Army Nursing Service and the Chaplaincy Service.  Section 4 of the Act of 1932 provides that no scheme shall come into force unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been confirmed by a resolution of each such House.  It is in pursuance of the obligation imposed by that section that the amending scheme is now before the House for confirmation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> The scheme, as Deputies will see, is primarily devoted to granting increases in service pensions of members of the Army, the Army Nursing Service and the Chaplaincy Service, whose services terminated prior to the 1st November, 1952.  An Army pay increase took effect as from that date and, in the case of anyone serving at that time who later went on pension, the benefit of that pay increase was passed on to the pension by the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme of 1956.  The increases in this scheme are confined to persons who went on pension prior to November, 1952.  They are being given on the same basis as the increases already provided for in the Pensions (Increase) Act of 1956, and in the Army Pensions Act, 1957, which became law in July last.  The increases consist of whichever is the lesser of (a) the appropriate sum as defined in Articles 4 and 6, or (b) the amount which would be payable if the last day of service were the 1st November, 1952, and the rank and service, etc., were the same as on the actual date of discharge.</P>
    <P>This scale is the same as that laid down in the Army Pensions Act, 1957, in relation to Army disablement pensions and in the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1956, in relation to other classes of State pensions.  The commencing date of the increases is the 1st August, 1956, and they are in fact being paid since that date under the authority of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions passed in this House on the 25th July, 1956.  The appropriate sum, I should mention, applies to the rate of pension payable as on the 31st July, 1956, that is, it applies to the full pension where that consists of an earlier rate as later increased.</P>
    <P>I should mention also that up to this, a service pension which when taken alone or when aggregated with a disablement pension came to £450 or more did not participate in a cost-of-living increase, such as this is, and, moreover, in the case of a pension or aggregation of pensions so near to £450 that the grant of the appropriate increase would bring them above that figure, the increase was limited to such amount as would bring the total to <Col N="53" /> £450 and no more.  That restriction is being departed from now and a person with a pension or aggregation of pensions of £450 or more will get an increase of either 6 per cent. or the amount which would be payable if the date of retirement were 2nd November, 1952, and the rank and service in that rank were the same as on the date of actual discharge.  Pensions to be increased, however, are taken as they existed on 31st July, 1956, so that the effect of the previous ceiling of £450 must be taken into account before the rates of increases now authorised are applied.</P>
    <P>The increases apply as well to pensions payable to widows and children of deceased officers and the rates of increases are arrived at by the application of the appropriate sum. The increases which I have mentioned are encompassed in Articles 5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21 and 22.  Perhaps what I have said, taken in conjunction with the explanatory memorandum circulated with the scheme, will be sufficient for an understanding of them so I shall now turn to the general matters included in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Articles 7, 8, 9 and 18 concern certain officers of the Naval Service who were commissioned on a temporary basis and of whom some have had service since the days of the emergency when what is now the Naval Service was called the Marine Service.  In November, 1946, some of the Marine Service officers retired and were paid gratuities under the normal provisions of the schemes in respect of their service up to then.  They were then immediately reappointed to commissions in the Naval Service on a temporary basis in order to maintain the officer strength of the service until such time as young officers could be recruited and trained.</P>
    <P>Provision to pay these former Marine Service officers gratuities related to the period in which each rank was held but not tied to any specified period of service&mdash;as is the case for normal gratuities&mdash;was then made in Article 12B of the scheme.  Some of these officers have had their service extended from time to time in the interests of <Col N="54" /> the service and are still serving with the result that when they come to retire on age grounds or on the expiry of their present engagements they will have over 12 years' service since 1946.  This is the minimum period of service required of a regular officer before he may retire on retired pay, so it has been decided, instead of giving the Naval Service officers in question a gratuity under Article 12B, to make them eligible for an award of retired pay and, if married, a married officer's gratuity in respect of their service since 1946, on the same basis as that applicable to the voluntary retirement of a regular officer.  Articles 7, 9 and 18 achieve this.</P>
    <P>Apart from these officers, there were others who were commissioned on a temporary basis subsequent to 1946 and who had not served in the Marine Service.  They are not entitled to any gratuity under the present terms of Article 12B and Article 8 of the present scheme deals with the matter by bringing them within the terms of Article 12B.  It is necessary to make the amendment retrospective to 28th February last in order to cover the case of an officer who retired as from that date.  The articles also provides an increased rate of gratuity in respect of service in the rank of Lieutenant-Commander and rates for the first time for the ranks of Ensign and Commander.</P>
    <P>Article 12 is a technical measure amending sub-article (6) of Article 20 of the scheme to make clear that the widow of an officer who retired on age grounds with at least 12 years' pensionable service is entitled to a pension under the article.  The article has always been construed on this basis but, in order to place the matter beyond question, it is considered desirable to clarify the position by an explicit reference to retirement on age grounds.  The article is deemed to operate as from the commencement date of the original scheme.</P>
    <P>Article 16 amends the provision governing the method of payment of pensions in order to simplify the calculations.</P>
    <P>Article 17 is another technical amendment.  The scheme as at present <Col N="55" /> was found not to cover certain service of officers who during the emergency period had continuous service but in varying capacities, such as enlisted soldiers, cadets and Reserve officers. The principle that continuous service in such cases should count as pensionable service is not in question and all this amendment does is to write that principle clearly into the relevant schedule.  The amendment is retrospective to cover past cases.</P>
    <P>Article 19 makes one change in the Fifth Schedule to the principal scheme which governs the rank by which married officers' gratuities are to be calculated by providing that, where an officer holding the appointment of Chief of Staff, Adjutant-General or Quartermaster-General is compulsorily retired, or an officer holding the appointment of Chief of Staff retires in circumstances to which Article 6 of the prinicpal scheme applies, a married officer's gratuity, if payable, shall be calculated by reference to the rank actually held by him at the date of retirement.  At present, by reason of the terms of the Fifth Schedule, the possibility exists that an officer retiring in the circumstances mentioned would have his retired pay calculated on his actual retiring rank and his married officer's gratuity on a lower rank held by him 12 months earlier.  This amendment will apply the same rank in the calculation of both retired pay and gratuity.</P>
    <P>I now come to the last article&mdash; No. 23&mdash;which effects an important change in the process of making awards under the scheme.  Up to this, the consent of the Minister for Finance has been necessary to each grant made under the scheme.  Now, however, that the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1957, has taken this requirement out of the Acts it is possible to follow suit in the schemes and this article in effect will remove the Minister for Finance from the granting machinery and enable grants to be made by me without reference to that Minister. Needless to say this will eliminate the administrative procedures involved in referring each case to the Minister for Finance and will, I am confident, <Col N="56" /> improve the administration in my Department and enable awards to be made more expeditiously to those qualifying under the schemes.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the end of my statement on this amending scheme which I commend to the House.  If there are any points on which further explanation is required I shall be pleased to deal with them when I am concluding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very few words to say with regard to this scheme except to welcome it as something that is necessary.  I want also to congratulate the Minister and his Department upon being able to get approval for the principle that when the Minister for Defence decides that a pension is payable it is paid without reference to the Department of Finance.  That is a distinct advantage and will make for easier and better administration.  As the Minister pointed out, a great number of the payments are being made already. Therefore, there is no comment that I have to make except that it is an improvement upon existing regulations.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister at some early stage will try to do something to include N.C.O.s and men in a similar scheme.  There is a question of gratuities for officers but none whatever for N.C.O.s and men.  The time has come when the Minister and the Government should take steps to rectify that position and to see that some gratuity will be given to long-service N.C.O.s and men, who have to obtain homes for themselves on leaving the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the former Minister for Defence in welcoming this motion at this stage. It is not the point that some of these gratuities or payments have already been made.  We must realise that, at a time when it was found essential to reduce food subsidies, to ask the general public to tighten their belts, when we were told we were passing through a crisis as far as finance is concerned, the Minister for Defence blandly comes into this House and tells us that, in regard to the question of pensions, he no longer need go <Col N="57" /> through the agonising performance that he had to go through in the past with the Minister for Finance in order to loosen the purse strings.  Deputy MacEoin congratulates the Minister on what he describes as a great achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do deputies realise what it is improving?  It is allowing officer personnel of the Army to ensure through pressure that they will get what they want.  I wonder are similar facilities made available for the Department of Education when it comes to increasing the pensions or improving the conditions of teachers? Is it left to the Minister for Education to decide these matters without consulting the Minister for Finance, who holds the purse strings?  When it comes to the Army, or what passes for an Army, the Minister for Defence has full sway.</P>
      <P>I should like this question of gratuities and pensions to be postponed until such time as the motion on this Order Paper dealing with defence and all its aspects has been dealt with. The time is overdue for a complete reassessment of defence policy.  As we know, out of defence policy will flow various matters, some of which are included for discussion to-day.  The great nations of the world at the moment are reducing their defence manpower.  Every nation is reducing expenditure on normal weapons of attack and defence.  Every nation is directing its manpower into useful production.  As far as we are concerned, this Minister for Defence is prepared blandly to move along the old lines, making no effort whatever to reorganise the Defence Forces drastically with a view to reducing State expenditure at a time when the State can ill afford luxuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am absolutely shocked at the idea of an increase in Army pensions at this stage and even at the idea that the matter should be discussed.  Deputy MacEoin rightly pointed out that it is rather extraordinary that there should be this emphasis at the moment on ensuring the welfare of the officers, no mention whatever being made of the <Col N="58" /> backbone of the Army, the N.C.O. and private personnel.  I can assure the Minister that the rank and file, the N.C.O. and private personnel, are seething with dissatisfaction at the present time at what they consider the glaring injustice that is being done to them due to the fact that they have nobody to represent them.  There was the previous experience in this House, when certain provision was made to increase Army pay, instead of that money being distributed fairly and squarely and in justice to all sections of the Army, the senior elements dug into the money up to their elbows and fixed themselves up first.</P>
    <P>Now we have another quiet Minister prepared to accept the recommendations of the officer personnel or their representatives.  We have not seen any attempt made by this Minister to see that the conditions of the rank and file or the N.C.O.s are improved.  At present, as far as I can gather, we have a luxury army in which the officer personnel are prepared to regard the army as a part-time job and engage in outside activities as directors of car sales companies and everything else.</P>
    <P>On yesterday's paper there was a photograph of 14 young men receiving degrees, having been trained as radar and signal experts.  It took six senior officers from the rank of lieutenant-colonel upwards to confer the appropriate degrees of proficiency on these 14 young men.  Is any consideration given to the expense involved in all this bluff and ceremonial parade that is going on in connection with these matters?  There was a photograph of six senior officers on yesterday's paper, smiling benignly on 14 young men who had passed their radar tests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there was no indication of the number of junior officers present.  I am sure it was impossible to publish the photographs of all the junior officers who were present at this ceremony that was held to show the wonderful advance that was made. I am not vexed with the men.  I hope that while this Army is functioning, at <Col N="59" /> least, these young men will get a chance of technical training.  I am all in favour of that but I do not like the present position, that, when the rate of emigration is greater than it was ever before, when the unemployment figures are higher than they were last year&mdash;and God knows they were high enough then&mdash;when the poorer sections of the community are finding it impossible to make ends meet and to get a decent meal, a Minister of this Government can blandly walk into this House and propose gratuities and pensions for a luxury defence community.</P>
      <P>Just let us look at what it amounts to, so far as the Army personnel is concerned.  A major-general with up to 32 years' service has a salary of £1,800 per annum, to say nothing of allowances. He will get a gratuity on retirement of over £1,500 and his pension on discharge at the same time will be over £945.  That is for a major-general. If an N.C.O. with 30 years' service is discharged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle will decide what is out of order, not the Minister.  I am entitled, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to point out what is missing.  If it is possible to give a gratuity of £1,500 and a pension of £945 per annum to a major-general, how is it found impossible to give an N.C.O., a sergeant, a corporal or a sergeant-major even a £10 gratuity after 30 years' service?  Do they not do the same job&mdash;or is it because we want to keep up this snobocracy which has come into the Army that the private soldier or the N.C.O. is pure dirt?  Is he not entitled, when he goes out, to a gratuity which will help his family on in the world outside, just the same as the major-general?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear to the House that the highest ranking N.C.O. on his retirement will get a pension which is less than one-third what the lowest ranking officer will get when he retires.  The lowest ranking officer will get a minimum gratuity of £590 on <Col N="60" /> going out; but the highest ranking N.C.O.&mdash;or the lowest ranking N.C.O., whichever way one may put it&mdash;will not get a penny.  Yet this Minister comes in and tells us he has the interest of the Army at heart.  He has the interest of certain sections of the Army at heart.  It is a very significant matter that this Minister is at present courting the officers personnel, for some purpose of his own, while the N.C.O. or the private element is being neglected.</P>
    <P>I gave figures in this House before to show that at the moment, with the officer and N.C.O. personnel, there is one to every one and a half men. Surely it is time to changes that state of affairs.  I ask the Minister, if he intends to go ahead with this scheme as he has outlined it here, to bring in forthwith one which will give equal facilities to the N.C.O.

      <P>I pointed out in my opening remarks that this scheme was merely to apply increases which were given to other classes of State pensioner in 1956 to the officers, N.C.O.s and men of the Army.  I cannot help it if Deputy McQuillan will not take the trouble to read these documents when they are circulated to him.  The fact of the matter is that this scheme applies these increases to N.C.O.s and private soldiers who were discharged before the 1st November, 1952, just the same as it does to officers.</P>

      <P>The scheme which is under consideration at the moment is, as I have said, merely one which applies these cost-of-living increases which were given to all classes of State pensioner last year.  It does not deal with gratuities at all.  It is merely an increase which was given to pensioners <Col N="61" /> to meet the cost of living and it applies to all classes of Army pensioners who were discharged before the 1st November, 1952.  There is no question&mdash;as Deputy McQuillan seems to think&mdash;of any new increases being granted at this stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by both Deputy MacEoin and Deputy McQuillan, of improving the pensions to former N.C.O.s and privates, that matter is under consideration.  I have every sympathy with the view that the present rates are too low, but Deputies will understand, of course, that that is not quite enough&mdash;I have to go into it and see what can be done. At the moment the matter is under review.  I hope to be in a position before long to announce a decision one way or the other on the claims made on behalf of those pensioners.  Since it is still under review, there is nothing further that I can say about that matter at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan also objected to the delegation of the powers of the Minister for Finance, in respect of these matters, to the Minister for Defence.  I am still bound by the regulations, so there is no question of it being left to me to decide &ldquo;off my own bat&rdquo; as to what amount shall be paid.  I am still bound by the same regulations.  This merely means that in the case of individual awards I do not have to go to the Minister for Finance with them.  It is merely a way of simplifying the administrative process in this respect.  On these grounds, I would ask the House to pass this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) (No. 2) Scheme, 1957, prepared by the Minister for Defence, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under Sections 2, 3 and 5 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932, and Section 4 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, 1938, and laid <Col N="62" /> before the House on the 8th day of October, 1957, be confirmed.</P>
    <P>This pensions scheme arises from alterations which have been made in the Defence Force Regulations governing retiring ages for certain officers who, having been granted the 1916 Medal or the Service (1917-1921) Medal or both of these medals, were eligible to have applied to them retiring ages which were higher than those normally applicable.  I should perhaps explain that at present the normal ages prescribed by Defence Force Regulations for the retirement of officers with the 1916 Medal or the Service (1917-1921) Medal are one year higher than the normal retiring ages for officers without those medals.  Furthermore, up to recently an additional extension of two years could have been granted to an officer with either of the medals subject to certain requirements as to health and efficiency and to my being satisfied that it was in the best interests of the Service if he continued to serve beyond the normal age for his retirement.  All such extensions were, of course, subject to the overriding maximum of 65 years of age.</P>
    <P>These extended age limits were brought into force in July, 1949, in so far as the additional year is concerned and in November, 1954, in so far as the extra two years are concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am called upon to go into the reasons which actuated the Governments then in power in granting these benefits to the officers concerned. I am satisfied, however, that the two year extension granted in 1954 did not redound to the general well-being of the Army in that it created a serious sense of injustice in the officers in the junior ranks who had not the medals and whose normal prospects of advancement were suddenly seriously impaired.  The position was aggravated, of course, by the fact that the great majority of the officers benefiting were senior officers.  In the circumstances, I have taken steps to have the authority for granting the additional two year extension withdrawn in the case of officers retiring on or after 1st November, 1957.  The necessary amendment to Defence Force Regulations has been promulgated. <Col N="63" /> Officers who are already serving on a two year extension are not affected by the amendment to the regulations mentioned and they may, if they wish, continue to serve until they reach the extended age limits already approved in their cases.</P>
    <P>I recognise that those officers who up to this have acted on the assumption that they would have the benefit of a retiring age limit extended by two years may feel aggrieved by this amendment to the regulations.  I am fully satisfied, however, that the general well-being and morale of the Army as a whole demand that this two year extension of age limits should be withdrawn.  In order, however, to ensure that the remedying of one grievance will not create another, the Government have authorised me to prepare this pensions scheme which provides that the officers concerned will on retirement be paid supplementary retired pay which, when added to their normal retired pay, will bring their income by way of retired pay and supplementary retired pay up to the amount of the Army pay which would be payable to them if they had continued to serve for a further period of two years in the same ranks as they held at the dates of their retirement. This scheme, therefore, maintains for the officers concerned the financial benefits of a further two years' Army service.  The supplementary retired pay will cease when the officer reaches either the extended age limit which would have been applicable to him if the Defence Force Regulations had not been amended or the age of 65 years, whichever is the earlier. Provision to the foregoing effect is contained in Article 5 of the scheme which Article also provides in effect that an officer in the category concerned who is already serving subject to an age limit extended by two years and who retires voluntarily before he reaches such extended age limit, will likewise be eligible for supplementary retired pay from the date of his retirement and up to the date on which he reaches either the extended age limit or the age of 65, whichever is the earlier.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> Article 6 makes provision for a case where an officer to whom the scheme applies qualifies for a disablement pension on retirement.  In such an event, the supplementary retired pay would be reduced to such amount as would keep the total payable by way of retired pay, supplementary retired pay and disablement pension to the equivalent of his Army pay.</P>
    <P>Article 7 applies to supplementary retired pay certain general provisions of the pension schemes which at present apply to normal retired pay. There is nothing new involved and I do not think it necessary to deal in detail with these.</P>
    <P>As to the numbers of officers affected by these proposals, at present there are 64 officers serving whose dates of retirement, without the extension of two years, fall after the 1st November, 1957.  These officers, therefore, cannot be granted the two year extension of retiring age but they will instead qualify for the grant of supplementary retired pay for two years after retirement.</P>
    <P>There are a further 25 officers serving who have already been granted the extension of two years and whose extended dates of retirement will fall after the 1st November, 1957.  It will be open to them, as I have mentioned, to continue to serve until they reach the extended retiring age.  If, however, they choose to retire before that time, they will be eligible for the grant of supplementary retired pay as from the date of retirement and up to the date on which they would otherwise have retired on age grounds.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost of the supplementary retired pay, it is impossible to give any precise figure as it cannot be stated in advance what the 25 officers already serving on an extension of the age limit will do.  They may decide to retire voluntarily immediately after the 1st November next and, of course, they may not. Apart from those, there are five other officers with medals who must retire at the normal age limit in the period between the 1st November next and the 31st March, 1958.  However, for the purpose of estimating the cost of supplementary retired pay in respect of <Col N="65" /> the remainder of the present financial year, if it is assumed that the 25 officers serving on extensions will retire voluntarily on the 1st November next, the amount of supplementary retired pay payable to them up to 31st March next plus the amount payable to the five who must retire, would be £6,520.  Normal retired pay amounting to £6,630 would be payable concurrently making a total of £13,150.  This additional expenditure would be borne on the Vote for Army Pensions but there would be a saving&mdash;acting on the same assumption as I have mentioned &mdash;on the Vote for Defence of approximately an equal amount for the same period.  Of course there will also fall on the Vote for Army Pensions the amounts payable on foot of married officers' gratuities ordinarily payable on retirement and&mdash;again on the same assumption&mdash;these would amount to approximately £26,000.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter before the adjournment for the Summer Recess and the Minister undertook then to consider it.  The proposals which he has brought forward here seem satisfactory and meet with our approval.  These proposals will, as the Minister mentioned, involve some changes, but the fact that savings on other heads of the Vote are likely means that no extra charge will fall directly on the Exchequer or, if it does, it will be a very small one.  I should like, therefore, to give the proposal our approval.</P>

    <Title>Cross-Channel Shipping Freight Rates&mdash;Motion for Tribunal.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following matters of urgent public importance, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level and structure of cross-Channel shipping freight rates, including through rates; the extent, if any, to which collective arrangements or other restrictive practices obtain in the fixing and application <Col N="66" /> of freight rates; and, if such arrangements or practices obtain, whether their maintenance is contrary to the public interest.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted Press reports to the effect that, on 7th September last, the Irish and British Traffic Conference and the individual shipping companies engaged in the cross-Channel trade, which, together with railway companies, comprise the membership of the conference, announced an increase in cross-Channel freight rates to take effect from 1st October, 1957.  The increase announced was a flat percentage increase at the rate of 7½ per cent., but, after allowing for certain reductions in sea charges, the net increase, I understand, is about 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>That announcement caused grave concern not merely to the Government but to everybody whose business requires the utilisation of cross-Channel shipping services.  This was the seventh increase in cross-Channel shipping freights made by the Irish and British Traffic Conference and its constituent shipping companies since 1950.  All these increases have followed the same pattern of applying a uniform percentage increase to existing freights and there is no indication that regard was had to the financial position of individual companies or to the economics of carrying different kinds of traffic.  Moreover, the tendency in these cross-Channel rates has been consistently upward over the period although, during that time, the ocean freight rates, as is well known, have fluctuated very considerably.  Deputies will, I feel sure, be aware also that, even before this latest increase was announced, there was a growing volume of criticism in this country of the high level of cross-Channel shipping rates.</P>
    <P>Although I say that, I do not wish to prejudge in any way the outcome of the inquiry which I propose should be held.  Indeed I would urge on Deputies who may wish to speak on the motion the desirability of not prejudging the outcome of the inquiry.  I must say quite frankly that I have no information upon which to base an <Col N="67" /> opinion as to whether these rates are justified, the reasons why increases were considered to be necessary, or on the procedure for settling the rates.</P>
    <P>I will assume that most members of the House are in exactly the same position.  We have, of course, seen the recently published report of an economic survey in the Six-County area, carried out by Professors Isles and Cuthbert of Queen's University, in which it was stated that there was reason to believe that the rates for certain classes of cross-Channel traffic, particularly coal, are rendered needlessly high, both because full use is not made of the most economic methods of shipping and of handling the traffic, and because of what is described as &ldquo;monopoly pricing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That report went on to point out that as far as shipping to foreign ports is concerned, the competition of the tramp and of foreign shipping generally keeps rates fairly keen.  They say that cross-Channel shipping is virtually immune from competition and that they are free of all restraint except that imposed by the trade itself.  I do not know what basis or justification there was for these comments in that report, but it is not an unreasonable assumption that the Irish and British Traffic Conference follow a uniform practice in regard to both parts into which this country is divided.</P>
    <P>The importance of shipping charges on the competitive position of Irish exports is obvious.  During recent months there have been discussions in my Department with a representative cross section of firms engaged in the export trade.  These discussions were directed towards ascertaining and remedying the difficulties which impede further development of our exports. With a remarkable degree of unanimity, these firms have referred to cross-Channel shipping arrangements and freights as being one of the greatest deterrents to the full development of their export trades.</P>
    <P>The information which I gained from these discussions might, I think, have led me to propose such an investigation as is contemplated in this motion, even if nothing else had happened to <Col N="68" /> arouse public interest in the position. Immediately following the publication of the notice about these increased charges, on September 10th last, I informed the Irish and British Traffic Conference and the shipping companies concerned that I was perturbed to notice the proposed increases, particularly as they happened to be of uniform order, and that, having regard to the impact of cross-Channel shipping charges on the national economy, I was considering the desirability of establishing a tribunal to make a public inquiry into these charges and into the arrangements under which they were fixed.</P>
    <P>I suggested to them that the operation of the proposed increased charges might be deferred in the meantime. The conference informed me, however, on September 24th, that they found it impossible to defer the introduction of the increases which had been announced, and they claimed that these increases were the minimum additions considered necessary to enable the undertakings to maintain their present standard of shipping facilities.</P>
    <P>There is no statutory authority vested in me, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, or in the Government, by virtue of which direct control can be exercised over the level of cross-Channel or any other shipping rates. Indeed it is in the nature of the trade that effective control of freight rates cannot be unilaterally exercised by the Government here.  In the shipping industry generally, very keen international competition controls freight-rate levels.  I think it is urgently necessary to find out why collective arrangements for the fixing of freight rates have brought about a position in which freight rates in this trade have risen consistently and uniformly over a long period when shipping rates generally were fluctuating.</P>
    <P>The most suitable body to undertake such an examination as is proposed would be the Fair Trade Commission which was set up by the 1953 Restrictive Trade Practices Act.  However, that Act does not apply to services other than those which are ancillary to the supply and distribution of goods which are the subject of inquiry by the <Col N="69" /> commission, and for that reason an investigation into shipping freight rates may not be carried out under that Act as it stands.  The Government has decided, therefore, to set up an inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act of 1921, but we propose to ask the individual members of the Fair Trade Commission to undertake the inquiry.  While the inquiry will be concerned principally with the level and structure of the freight rates of the Irish and British Traffic Conference and of the associated companies operating cross-Channel services, the freights charged for such cargoes as coal and cement carried by tramp shipping between here and Britain will also come within its scope.</P>
    <P>The rates for bulk cargoes are fixed by the British Chamber of Shipping, which is an organisation representative of British shipowners and there have been increases in their rates also, the most recent being in June last.  The object of this inquiry which I am proposing is primarily to establish the facts, and, until the tribunal has reported, I cannot usefully forecast what steps can or should be taken by the Government in relation to cross-Channel shipping rates.</P>
    <P>Before leaving that point, however, I would request Deputies not to confuse the issue raised in the motion with the question of the possible extension of Irish control in cross-Channel shipping operations.  The two issues are quite distinct and separate. The problem of high freight charges and of concerted action to arrange the charges could conceivably arise, even if only Irish controlled companies were engaged in the trade, and indeed a number of the companies which are involved in the arrangement to be investigated are Irish-registered companies.</P>
    <P>It may be, of course, that the inquiry may reveal information which will have a bearing on the other issue, but that is another day's work.  I may say also that there are some discussions taking place regarding the possibility of an extension of Irish control in cross-Channel shipping.  Apart, however, from indicating that the matter is having active attention, I am satisfied <Col N="70" /> that it would not be helpful if I were to say more at this stage.  I am sure the House will agree that the carrying out of this investigation is a matter of urgent public importance and will, therefore, have no hesitation in assenting to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House will be surprised that the Minister had not some more information to give in moving this motion.  While Deputies have not available to them some of the information which is normally available in a Government Department, this is a matter that has, over a long period, attracted public attention and notice and the fact that the Minister has so little information on which to base the proposal before the House is somewhat disturbing.  Not only the Department of Industry and Commerce but the Department of Agriculture is vitally concerned in shipping arrangements.  I believe that it will come as a surprise to a number of people that these various increases, amounting to seven in all since 1950, can have taken place without greater detail being supplied to the Minister's Department and to the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>This increase has certainly focussed attention on the importance to the country's economy of the cross-Channel shipping interests.  While it affects a variety of goods, the live-stock trade is the one which is the most serious from the national point of view.  It is true to say that the sheet-anchor of the national economy is live stock and the protests which were made by the live-stock traders, and other interested parties affected by this increase, not alone reflected their own interests but reflected the effects this increase would have on the economy as a whole.  We have no objection to the inquiry which the Minister proposes, but it does seem that the terms of references are somewhat restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the Minister's desire not to widen the discussion or consideration of this matter.  Quite an amount of comment has been made in the newspapers since this took place.  Articles have appeared as well as letters from correspondents and <Col N="71" /> comments from trade bodies and so forth, all indicating a natural objection to it and a great many expressing the view that either Irish Shipping or some Irish controlled and operated company should enter this cross-Channel service.  As the Minister remarked, it is not as simple as that and not as easy, but undoubtedly there is a volume of opinion that the present arrangements are unsatisfactory and there are good grounds for supporting that contention.  I believe that if public confidence is to be secured through an inquiry of this sort, the inquiry should have power to consider other aspects of the question. If not, it is to be hoped that this inquiry will report quickly and that the other matters will then receive attention.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the traffic, certainly so far as boats carrying live stock are concerned, is one way and that is one of the problems&mdash;that ships travel light.  Obviously, if this matter were as simple as some correspondents and commentators appear to think, people would have entered the business long ago.  On the other hand, the fact that traditionally over a number of years certain firms have had a virtual monopoly in this matter is no reason why, if it is decided in the national interest that that situation should not continue, it should not be ended as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>This increase has followed rapidly on the earlier increases and it is worthy of note that this is the only method whereby inquiry into freight rates is possible.  When the Fair Trade Commission legislation was going through this House, I moved an amendment, which was rejected, that services might be included.  This procedure under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act has been used before. I agree that, in the circumstances, it may be the only satisfactory way of dealing with it, except that it does appear that the terms of reference are limited to the actual increase or the reasons for the increase in freight rates.  It is not certain whether the tribunal to be set up will be able to elicit the facts on which to make a decision; it is not certain that it will <Col N="72" /> be possible for them to secure the evidence necessary, or to compel the attendance of witnesses in a position to supply it.  I hope it will be possible to get the full co-operation of all those concerned.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the easiest way of dealing with this matter is to establish a tribunal of this sort.  I remember that, when similar bodies were established by the previous Government, we were always taunted that we had set up another commission or another committee to inquire into something or other.  I think the Minister himself was one of those who said that when the Government had a problem, they set up a commission to inquire into it.  Some people might even say it is a form of &ldquo;passing the buck&rdquo;.  Nevertheless, the Minister brings it forward here as the only method by which he can discover the facts, and, as such, we are prepared to assent to it.</P>
    <P>I think serious consideration should be given, even while this committee is sitting, to the other aspects of the question which have been uppermost in people's minds since this increase was announced.  If this committee can discover the facts and reasons for these increases, then people will naturally ask: &ldquo;What next?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What will the Minister do?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What will the Government do to deal with the situation?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister adverted to the fact that he had no statutory powers by virtue of which he could direct the companies concerned to take any action.  It has been suggested to me that, in view of the importance of this inquiry and the matters which will fall to be considered, the chairman of the commission should be a High Court judge.  I have no predilection one way or another.  I think the members of the Fair Trade Commission who are named here are quite competent to conduct an inquiry, but some criticism has been voiced from time to time about the manner in which evidence has been taken at the Fair Trade Commission.  It may secure greater confidence if, in a case of this sort, a judge acts as chairman.  Certainly, anything that will enable the commission to secure the maximum respect and to gather the necessary <Col N="73" /> information rapidly and fully is essential in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's view that it is hardly desirable at this stage to consider the other aspects of the question. I have no doubt, however, that those who are anxious to see the answers to the inquiry which this commission will undertake are not alone interested in the facts which it is hoped to elicit but particularly interested in knowing what steps the Government propose to take to deal with the situation, if the replies are as it is generally expected they will be.</P>
    <P>This recent increase has focussed public attention on the importance of the cross-Channel shipping business and, in particular, on the importance to the economy here of having shipping freights at the lowest level at which it is possible to keep them.  We do not oppose the Minister's proposal.  We should be glad to hear from him, when he is replying, if it is expected that a report will be furnished quickly by the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that one should not confuse the issue.  There are not two confusing issues but rather they are all part of the one issue.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister is putting the cart before the horse.  This is the seventh or eighth increase in cross-Channel shipping charges over the past few years.  I feel that, if the recent 7½ per cent. increase had not taken place, the Minister would not now be setting up a tribunal to inquire into the level of freights, and other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal is starting off at a disadvantage in that it is to inquire into a business which to a large extent, certainly over 90 per cent., is owned by somebody else.  I do not want to prejudge the issue, but I foresee certain difficulties when the tribunal endeavours to secure information from the two main participants in the cross-Channel trade, namely, British Railways and the British and Irish Steam Packet Company.  Two small Irish companies are also engaged in the cross-Channel trade but their participation is very small indeed.  I think that, in all, six cross-Channel companies are <Col N="74" /> members of the British and Irish Conference. Strangely enough, there is at least one other English shipping line that is not a member of the British and Irish Conference.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why I put down the motion which appears on the Order Paper was, to use the Minister's own words, to avoid any confusing of the issue.  There is only one issue and the first point to tackle is the present position which is directly responsible for the fact that these increases in shipping charges can go on year after year with impunity.  As long as we suffer the position whereby we have no say whatever in the fixing of the rates, so long will the people who own the shipping interests continue to apply whatever rates they desire.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that consideration is being given to the question of some participation by this country in the cross-Channel trade. My only regret is that the question of this participation was not considered and something done about it over the past 30 odd years.  Previous Governments must share responsibility for the fact that nothing was done in that regard.</P>
    <P>Everybody must agree that shipping is one of our most essential links with the outside world.  We are an island and claim to be an independent nation. If we cannot control or at least substantially influence shipping to and from this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment, we pay out an estimated £15,000,000 to £20,000,000 a year to cross-Channel carriers who, in the main, are foreigners.  The first step&mdash;which is now apparently under consideration&mdash; should be the bringing of a share of the cross-Channel trade under Irish control.  Once that is achieved, the question of rates would be one over which this country would have some say.  Until that is done and until we can control the cross-Channel trade to some extent at least, we cannot hope <Col N="75" /> to utilise some of that £15,000,000 to £20,000,000 a year or ensure that a share of it is expended in this country. I may say this quite honestly: I hope the tribunal will fulfil a useful purpose and secure a lot of useful information, but I do not think it will ultimately achieve any purpose, until the Government tackles the question of the control of Irish shipping.  If I am in order in saying so I should like to see this question considered not only on a purely Twenty-Six County basis.  As the Minister quite rightly said severe strictures have been passed by people who inquired into shipping conditions in the Six Counties and I think it would serve a very useful national purpose if some joint or co-ordinated action could be taken by the authorities in both the Twenty-Six and the Six Counties on the whole question of shipping which affects both North and South.</P>
      <P>I think I am correct in saying that some years ago Irish Shipping Limited had two cargo vessels engaged in the carrying of coal between England and this country.  I understand the Irish Shipping Company had to take off those vessels because of lack of support from the Irish importers.  It seems to me there is not much use in talking about participation until importers and exporters make up their minds that they are going to use shipping owned wholly or partly by an Irish company.  In that regard, there is a tremendous lot to be done in changing trade policy on the part of importers and exporters first of all in utilising the shipping that exists and then on the question of participation in support of an Anglo-Irish venture.</P>
      <P>I wish this tribunal every success, and I hope it will achieve a useful purpose, but I am more encouraged by the Minister's hint that the major question is at issue than I am by the hope that this tribunal will achieve the desired objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to setting up a tribunal but I think the Minister ought to tell us now what he proposes to do when he has the report of the tribunal.  Has he in mind any <Col N="76" /> steps which he would take in the event of the tribunal apprising him that the existing arrangements or practices are contrary to the public interest?  There is not much good in setting up a tribunal and discovering that the existing practices are contrary to the public interest unless you have some plan in mind to deal with that situation if it is found to exist.</P>
      <P>I remember about 18 months ago, or perhaps less, some problem of this character arose with special reference to through rates for live stock and at that time I asked members of the British Federation of Carriers, representatives of the British Railways and shipping interests, and representatives of the Livestock Exporters' Association to come to meet me in the Department of Agriculture.  I think after some discussion we were able to resolve the difficulties and get the proposed increases postponed.  I do not believe there has ever been any proposal to revive the question of their imposition and the difficulties that then obtained were overcome.  Mark you, there is a good deal to be said for that procedure because very often, if you get men round a table, you find, if everybody tries to be reasonable, a way can be found to avoid some change which it appears will be to the detriment of all concerned.</P>
      <P>I am rather surprised that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture in consultation did not send for the shipping companies and the live-stock interests and discuss this proposal with them and see if they could not, by the exercise of argument and persuasion, get both parties to agree to what would be equitable and fair and possibly to point out to the carrying companies that the effect of the increase might very well be to reduce the total volume of traffic that they could reasonably anticipate they could get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister is wrong in coming to the House and saying that he views with grave concern this increase in freight rates and that the only proposal he has to remedy it is to set up a commission to inquire into the facts.  I think he ought to be able to say to us&mdash;and I do not despair of his <Col N="77" /> resolving to do that now&mdash;that he is calling into consultation the parties concerned, with a view to seeing whether by discussion and argument they can be persuaded to abstain from this increase at least until a committee of this kind has reported.</P>
    <P>I do not want to represent to the House that I was able to achieve anything miraculous by the procedure adopted by me but I think we did produce some results and they were of a character which preserved the <i>status quo</i> and prevented any worsening of the position, without setting up any commission at all.  I would be grateful if the Minister could say when concluding what he proposes to do if this commission does report to him that this increase and that the existing practices are contrary to the public interest because I think Deputies ought to be in a position to appreciate what the problem is.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will look at the terms of the motion the tribunal is to investigate among other things &ldquo;the level and structure of cross-Channel shipping freight rates, including through rates&rdquo;.  Many people, when they reflect on this whole problem, imagine it is a problem of getting cattle from the coast of Ireland to the coast of Great Britain.  Of course it is nothing of the kind.  It is true that we sell a good deal of cattle in Birkenhead and Glasgow but the vast bulk of the cattle is sold at the end of pretty long rail journeys in Great Britain and the bulk of this levy of 7½ per cent. will be levied on that part of the journey which is done by rail transport on the British transport system.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister contemplate, if he finds the rail transport system in Great Britain intransigent, providing some alternative means of transport in Great Britain?  I do not want the Minister to think I am just asking him trick questions because I know his difficulty&mdash;who should know it better than somebody who has been Minister for Agriculture?&mdash;that is, that he may not be able to exercise effective control over the bulk of the charge on which the 7½ per cent. levy is being made. When you are faced with this situation, you have to ask yourself what is the <Col N="78" /> best way to deal with it and if you cannot control, you have got to ask yourself if you can persuade them. There is no use battering your head against a stone wall.  That was the view I took 18 months ago.</P>
    <P>It was for that reason I brought them all together round the table and succeeded in persuading the transport authorities in Great Britain to abandon the proposals they had announced they were going to put into operation.  If I had directed them to abandon them, I think I would have got a very dusty answer.  Therefore, I should be glad if the Minister would tell us what he has done with a view to effecting conciliation in this matter.  I should be glad if the Minister would tell us how far the Minister for Agriculture has been consulted in this matter with a view to co-ordinating his exertions with those of the Minister for Agriculture. Has the record of our previous discussions with the British Transport Authority been reviewed in the light of this situation which I believe is material in the discussions between the Department of Agriculture and the British Transport Authority and which might be of value in arriving at an accommodation in regard to this problem?</P>
    <P>There is another point&mdash;one which was mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave. As he said, it is not a point of principle; it is a matter of expediency.  It is one on which I should like to invite the judgment of all Deputies.  Doubtless, the personnel selected by the Minister will effectively discharge the job assigned them by this resolution, but we have got to bear in mind that the shipping companies are more or less in the dock in this inquiry.  They feel that.  We are not going to get very far if they are not prepared to come into the inquiry with a desire to give all the information they can.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember an analogous situation when there was difficulty about the rates being charged by British insurance companies in regard to motor car insurance.  The British insurance companies simply came into the inquiry and said: &ldquo;We will not tell you.  We will not segregate our costs between our English and British business.  We will give the global <Col N="79" /> figure but that is as far as we are prepared to go.&rdquo;  I think that probably arose from the fact that they felt they were in the dock.  They were not going to help in giving substance to a decision which they felt was going to go against them in any case.  If you put this inquiry under the chairmanship of a High Court judge, there might be an atmosphere in which we could get from all parties, transport companies included, a full disclosure of all the circumstances giving rise to this mooted increase, with the possibility of a better informed finding to guide our future course of action.</P>
    <P>I want to sound this note of warning. The Minister's announcement of his intention to establish this commission naturally gives rise to high hopes in the minds of parties aggrieved by this increase in rates.  It is not a good thing to persuade people who believe themselves to have a grievance that you are providing a remedy for them when they have made an enthusiastic contribution by way of preparing a case and bringing in facts before the commission and have got a favourable finding from the commission that the events of which they complain are, in the judgment of the commission, contrary to the public interest&mdash;it is not a good thing for the Government to say that may be the case but that there is nothing they can do about it. If that is the Minister's mind now, it is better to say so.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the Minister has in contemplation a direction to Irish Shipping to provide for an alternative service or the compulsory acquisition of one of the existing shipping companies, he ought to envisage those possibilities now and, when doing so, go on to say how he proposes to integrate the alternative service provided by Irish Shipping or the acquired shipping company with the transport service in Great Britain. Bear in mind that there is no use dumping cattle at a port of entry, if you have not got transport facilities to remove them to the place where you can sell them.  Cattle cannot be left standing in the pen at a port in England because you have not got <Col N="80" /> means expeditiously to transport them to the point of sale.</P>
    <P>This is the time to state quite frankly what the limits are of the resources available to us.  It is even possible to surmount that internal transport problem in Great Britain, if you want to go that far.  Rail transport is a monopoly in Great Britain; road transport is not.  If the Government were satisfied that the existing transport facilities were hopelessly detrimental to the life of industry in this country and were prepared not only to provide transhipment facilities but to organise road transport in Great Britain to service an Irish company that would be prepared to do that, that has to be envisaged.  That possibility could be envisaged and examined on its merits.</P>
    <P>If you are not going to face that, what will you tell people now&mdash;that the ultimate sanction of establishing a completely independent transport is not available to us?  In that event our only rational line of procedure is a process of negotiation with the existing transport services to get the best deal we can.  If you are not envisaging the ultimate sanction of providing a completely independent transport service over land as well as over sea from Dublin, Waterford or Cork to any place in Great Britain, are you sure you are going the right way about it by setting up a commission of this character? Might it not be much better to hold a round table conference with these people and see if you could get accommodation, holding over them the prospect that if you could not get a reasonable answer, you would certainly be forced by public opinion into this procedure?</P>
    <P>If you got from a commission of this character a report that existing conditions were contrary to the public interest, the Government would be forced into an extreme course with which, perhaps, they would not desire to proceed.  I do not mind telling the House, and I do not think it is any breach of confidence, that, when I was approaching the British transport authorities, I told them I was under heavy pressure at home to urge on my colleague, the Minister for Industry <Col N="81" /> and Commerce, to press Irish Shipping to go into this trade, that if they were not prepared to take any cognisance of the difficulties of the Irish live-stock export trade pressure would be brought upon me with a degree of emphasis it would be impossible for me to overcome.  I do not doubt that those representations had more effect in pressing the transport authorities in Britain to mend their hand a bit and it is vitally important that if you stop bluffing, you must hold the cards, referring to what is envisaged, to all the steps that may be involved, if you once embark on this course.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree with me that, once you have set up a commission of this kind, you cannot simply accept a report that these practices are contrary to public interest, and then say &ldquo;So what?&rdquo; You must do something at that stage.  We ought to ask the Minister what are we going to do if we get a report of that character. If dialectic conclusions lead us upon a course far further than we should go, should we not stop now and hold preliminary discussions which would assist ourselves before establishing this tribunal which might lead to results none of us envisage?  If the Minister feels this procedure is going to help him to remedy the present situation, we have no objection to it. Perhaps in his reply the Minister could tell us whether he intended to discuss this matter with the interested parties, even while this proposal was going forward, and I should be grateful if he would give us his opinion on the expediency of providing a High Court judge as a chairman of this tribunal.</P>

      <P>When I read that the Minister was about to set up a tribunal to inquire into the &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;ands&rdquo; of cross-Channel shipping, I welcomed it.  At the same time, I could be excused for asking what good will it do?  I have a suspicion of tribunals and commissions.  We have the experience of the Milk Costings Commission, but I am very glad the Minister has set himself to go into this because it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In years gone by, people were chary <Col N="82" /> about entering the cross-Channel carriage of live stock because there was terrific competition between the old London North-Western and Great Western Railways, and in carriage from Dublin, Waterford and Cork to the various ports where these two railways operated.  They cut prices so low that no private individual had any chance with them.  Now the whole position has changed.  We have British Railways and they have the carrying in England of all the cattle from the ports of entry and are in a very strong position. It is obvious that, since 1950, freight charges have been going up at a rate of more than one increase a year.  The Minister has no statutory powers to pull them up&mdash;British Railways hold the reins in their own hands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has mentioned the matter of bringing the shipping companies and the cattle trade together. That did bear fruit at one time and might bear fruit again, but I would say that here is the biggest export industry in this country and not one pound weight or one ounce weight of it is carried in Irish ships.  We have a very good shipping company in Irish Shipping, Ltd., which is carrying cargoes to and from the ends of the earth.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister, that even though he has no statutory powers, he would have some power if we had ships capable of carring cattle.  Recently, there was an opportunity of trade with France and ships were chartered by private individuals to bring cattle to that country.  The reason that trade was not taken full advantage of at the time was that we were short of ships and we could not get ships.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that, in the shipping programme that is to come, it would strengthen his hand if the type of ship to be built, and which was built by Irish people here before&mdash;I will go into that matter further&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>All right; but in this matter of setting up a tribunal, if the tribunal finds that we are being overcharged, if it finds that restrictive practices are going on and if it recommends to the Minister that we should build ships, then we should build them.  Even if the tribunal did not recommend that, we should go into the matter.  We should build ships capable of carrying live stock, because, even if they are not used for that purpose of carrying cargoes to English ports, then they could be used for some other purposes.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that, in the years before the war, Irish people had ships trading and those ships were acquired after a suitable squeeze was put on by the English companies.  I wish the Minister would look into this. I close by saying that whatever time this tribunal will spend in its sittings will be time wasted.  The only way the English companies will take any notice of the Minister, and the only way the English companies will be made to reduce their charges is by Irish Shipping going into the business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With very special reference to the observations of Deputy Lynch, who referred to the proposed tribunal recommending that Irish Shipping should enter into the live-stock export trade, I doubt that even if it did make that recommendation, and, assuming for a moment that the authorities decided to implement it, it would carry very much weight with the representatives of British Railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out here a few moments ago, even if we had numerous ships of our own engaged in this business and if we had not the co-operation of the railways on the far <Col N="84" /> side, these ships would be of little use. With the present shipping arrangements there is one advantage, that shipments of cattle are guaranteed transport the moment they arrive at the ports and that arrangement is satisfactory.  If the co-operation that prevails on the far side at the present time, whereby carriages are available to take the cattle from the ports to their destination in Britain, breaks down, then the cure will be much worse than the disease.</P>
    <P>This is a motion which is welcomed by everyone in the cattle trade.  It is a motion which, since it was given publicity in the papers as a result of the Minister's announcement that it would be placed on the Order Paper for discussion in the House, has aroused very high hopes in everyone in the trade.  I venture to say that when it was announced that it was proposed to set up this tribunal, those engaged in the shipment of cattle felt that this was a step in the right direction.  We all agree, but they go further than that.  They hope that something good and something useful will come out of it as regards those increases.  I hope they will not be disappointed but I fear they will.</P>
    <P>An inquiry in relation to freight charges is long overdue.  I feel that the real pity in this case is that the tribunal was not set up before the increased charges were effective.  The increases are now in operation and when that is the case, what is there to inquire into?  I do not know if the Minister has set out certain terms of reference for the tribunal.  I am sure that in connection with the setting up of this tribunal terms of reference will be framed by his Department after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture so that that body will know what to investigate.</P>
    <P>The most regrettable feature of commissions and tribunals such as the one suggested is that it takes not months but years before they submit a report.  When a report is submitted there is the usual examination by the various Departments concerned and by the Civil Service authorities, and it takes many months before it is considered by the Government and before <Col N="85" /> the observations of the Government are issued to the public.</P>
    <P>I hope that this tribunal when it is set up will not disappoint those who are interested and who are expecting great things from it.  If we are to compare it with other tribunals and commissions it will be five years from now before there are any results and we cannot expect a speedy or hasty report.  However, in view of the urgency and importance of this matter to be inquired into, there should be a time limit fixed for the completion of these investigations.  I do not know whether that is possible or not, but it is something that should be considered when setting out the terms of reference.  The inquiry should not be allowed to drag on like the milk costings and other inquiries of which we have had experience.  In view of its urgency and in view of the severity of the increased charges on the trade and in view of the expectations of those engaged in the trade as to the outcome, a time limit should be placed on the production of the report so that it will be available to all concerned with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that the authorities concerned with these freight charges will not be behind time in building up a strong case in justifying them.  That will be their job.  I venture to say that they will build up such a convincing case that it will be difficult for any tribunal investigating such charges to find that they are not justified.  However, assuming that the tribunal recommend in their report that the increases are not justifiable, what steps will be taken in this regard?  Will the Minister give us an indication for the information of those engaged in the trade as to whether there will be immediate reductions and whether the increased charges now being made will be refunded in the event of suitable records of the increased payments being kept, so that, if we do have a favourable report from the tribunal, all those at present engaged in the trade and who have experience of recent increases will have suitable refunds made?</P>
    <P>I feel that only as a last resort and <Col N="86" /> only in the event of all possible friendly negotiations breaking down with the British transport authorities and shipping interests should a tribunal such as this be suggested.  I have heard in my own constituency, and indeed outside my constituency, the greatest possible admiration expressed for the able manner in which the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, met very difficult circumstances in regard to increased rates about 18 months ago.  I wonder if the present Minister, since he has taken office, has arranged any such conferences as were arranged by the former Minister for Agriculture.  It is my opinion that a round-table conference, friendly and reasoned discussion on both sides, would be a much better solution for the problem than to have a tribunal examining the situation and submitting long and detailed reports.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage, I would recommend to the Minister that if there have been no such conferences and if there are hopes of friendly negotiations on this matter, in view of the great importance of the matter to our main export industry, cattle, every effort should be made to have negotiations on a friendly basis between the Government here and the British Transport Authority.</P>
    <P>In order that there might be confidence in the findings of the tribunal that may be set up, the Government would be well advised to appoint a High Court judge as chairman of that tribunal.  That opinion has been expressed by Deputy Dillon and other speakers from this side of the House. My reason for making that suggestion is that it would reinforce the confidence of those engaged in the industry and would add to the dignity of the tribunal in the eyes of the authorities from outside this State who would be giving evidence and information to the tribunal.  I highly recommend the appointment of a High Court judge as chairman and hope the Minister will see fit to recommend that course to the Government.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would request that this tribunal should be different from other committees and tribunals inasmuch as that its report should be presented with speed and efficiency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is necessary to emphasise that the inquiry which I am proposing shall take place will be into freight rates only, into the level of freight rates, the collective arrangements or restrictive practices that are operating in the determination of shipping freight rates and the extent to which these collective arrangements and practices can be regarded as detrimental to the public interest here.  This is not a committee to determine policy.  The purpose of this inquiry is to ascertain the facts and report on the facts.  When the facts are known, in so far as it will be possible for the inquiry to produce the facts, then decisions on policy will be taken by the Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave said it was rather surprising that we did not have more information concerning the composition and structure of shipping freight rates and the reasons for increases in these rates over recent years.  We know, of course, that shipping freight rates have gone up.  It was reasonable to have expected that they would have gone up.  Other charges have risen during that period.  Even this recent increase, in so far as it applies to through rates, presumably has some reference to the 10 per cent.  increase in British railway charges announced some time ago.</P>
      <P>The disturbing factor in relation to the shipping freight rates is the regularity of the increases.  Notwithstanding the frequent fluctuations which have taken place in freight rates upon other shipping services, on this cross-Channel service they have gone up step by step almost, as Deputy Lynch said, year by year and they have gone up on the basis of a percentage increase applied to existing rates without any reference to the economics of any particular type of traffic or without reference apparently to the financial position of the individual companies applying these rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon may not have been in the House when I mentioned that I asked the companies comprising this conference and the associated companies to postpone the application of the increase until after this inquiry. They declined to do so and said that <Col N="88" /> the rates were in their view justified and that they proposed to apply them immediately.  Indeed, I doubt from the record whether any such request would have been successful at any time. Deputy Dillon mentioned that he had some discussions with the shipping companies last year.  These discussions, as far as I know, related to the provision of facilities for the transportation of frozen meats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, in that case, was not successful in preventing an increase in the freight rates last year or the previous year or the year before that.  Freight rates were increased by 5 per cent.  last year, by 7½ per cent.  in 1955, by 10 per cent. in 1954 and, indeed, it is not so much the approximately 5 per cent. increase this year which is the justification for this inquiry but that regular pattern of increases over a considerable period, which must inevitably cause us concern.</P>
      <P>While, as I said, we do not have ourselves the information which would enable us to decide whether these increases were justified or that the collective arrangements for determining the rates are or are not contrary to the public interest, it is not unreasonable for us to take note of the fact that the Isles Report relating to the Six Counties made reference to this precise situation and referred to the non-competitive rates applied on the cross-Channel service where, apparently, they said, the only limiting factor was the restraint the companies concerned chose to put upon themselves. I do not know upon what basis of information the comments in that report rested but that report was, as we know, published and it is a fair assumption that whatever conditions apply in regard to trade to Belfast from British ports apply equally to trade to ports in this part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasised that this problem which the committee will be dealing with is distinct and separate from the problem of Irish participation in cross-Channel shipping services.  There are some eight companies engaged in the <Col N="89" /> service at the moment; some of them are Irish registered, two of them, at least, are Irish-owned.  They are all in it together.  They all work uniform rates and increase their freights by collective arrangement and this situation could quite well emerge even if they were all Irish companies.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with the question of charging for a service, not with the adequacy of the facilities or the desirability of Irish participation in that service which, though an important question, is a separate question, and I emphasised that these two questions were distinct and separate because, as I said, some action in regard to the extension of Irish control of the shipping services is proceeding and I do not intend that that action should be impeded in any way by the fact that this inquiry is taking place.  There is no reason why it should be delayed on account of the passing of this motion by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Russell was not quite right in saying that this problem has existed for 30 years and was not considered before and nothing was done about it. It is true that nothing much was done but it certainly was considered on many occasions and the consideration that was given to it brought to light the many substantial practical difficulties which will attend any policy which may be decided upon.</P>
    <P>Whether Irish Shipping, Ltd., should enter the cross-Channel trade is, of course, a major question of policy, and whether entering would have the effect of bringing down shipping freights is a question which has not been answered by anybody.  Some years ago, I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, authorised Irish Shipping, Ltd., to construct two boats suitable for the cross-Channel coal trade. They built those two boats.  They were engaged in the cross-Channel coal trade under charter for some time, and when the charter expired they did their best to get someone else to take it over or utilise the boats on that service, but without success.  Ultimately, the boats had to be adapted for foreign trade, on which they are engaged now.</P>
    <P>The experience of that one effort of Irish Shipping, Ltd., to enter into the <Col N="90" /> cross-Channel business indicated that the problems are considerable and that if it is to be done in the future perhaps some different approach may be required.</P>
    <P>Again I emphasise, however, that that is not the problem we are investigating now.  We are going to investigate the problem of prices charged for shipping services, just as we might in similar circumstances, where collective action or restrictive practices might seem to make it necessary, investigate the prices charged for any other class of goods or service.</P>
    <P>Now the question arises as to how best this inquiry can be conducted.  If the Restrictive Trade Practices Act of 1953 permitted it, I would have referred this question for investigation by the Fair Trade Commission without bothering the Dáil at all with a motion, but the fact is that the terms of that Act preclude the Fair Trade Commission from investigating charges for a service such as this or for any service, except where the need to investigate it arises in connection with an inquiry they are conducting at the time in relation to the sale of goods.  Therefore, I could not get this inquiry under way through the Fair Trade Commission without proposing a motion of this kind in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is intended, as I announced, that it is the Fair Trade Commission which will carry out the inquiry.  I think they are eminently suitable for that purpose. They have the organisation which they use for their ordinary inquiries available to them and they have, of course, experience in the conducting of such inquiries and this will be very valuable to them.  It is not proposed to select an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal for this purpose.  It is the members of the commission who will be asked to conduct the inquiry and that fact not merely guarantees that a thorough inquiry will be made but it is the arrangement which is most likely to give us an expeditious outcome of the investigations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave made some criticism of the terms of reference, but I think what he had in mind was that this tribunal should deal with a policy issue involving the extension of Irish <Col N="91" /> control of shipping services.  I do not intend, and it is not intended, that the issue of policy should arise.  If that policy has to be settled&mdash;as it will at some stage&mdash;it will be settled by the Government in consultation with whatever expert advisers they can avail of. While the information gained by this tribunal may have an important bearing on the decision, this tribunal will not in fact be themselves concerned with that policy issue.</P>
    <P>They have to investigate why these shipping freights on the cross-Channel shipping services have been going up so steeply and continuously in circumstances where freight charges on other services have been fluctuating, where it is obvious that the existence of competition has tended to keep the freights very keen.  They will have to examine why it is that increases which might have been justified on grounds of costs were applied uniformly to all traffics without regard, as I said, to the economics of particular traffics or the effect of the increase upon particular traffics.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned that the live-stock trade have a vital interest in this matter.  They have a very vital interest because, of course, it is by far the biggest traffic offering to these services.  It is reasonable to think that the live-stock traffic will go on, notwithstanding increases in particular charges, whereas other traffics may not be able to go on, if they have to bear an increased burden of shipping charges.  Is this system of making increases which are themselves justified on a flat rate percentage basis also justifiable?</P>
    <P>Then there is, of course, the very big question of the extent to which these companies engaged in this service compete with one another, why freight charges are fixed uniformly and without regard to the circumstances of individual companies.  Is it the situation that the requirements of the least economic, least efficiently run, most costly company determine the charges for all?</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not know the answers to these questions.  I hope we will get the answers as a result of this inquiry and, when we have the answers, it is <Col N="92" /> then we will consider what action we can wisely and usefully take to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon says we should have made up our mind now as to what we propose to do when the report of this inquiry reaches us.  I think that would be the wrong procedure altogether. Surely the right time to decide what to do is when you know the facts, when all the investigations necessary to establish the facts have been completed. To attempt to decide now what should be done or what can be done would be a rather futile procedure, because the inquiry might show that some of the things we might think of now were unnecessary or, alternatively, might show them to be impracticable.</P>

      <P>When the inquiry is over we will consider then the steps which can be taken to deal with this problem of high shipping rates on the cross-Channel services.</P>
      <P>Deputy Russell said that this inquiry might not have taken place at all, if this latest increase had not occurred. Possibly that is true.  I would not like to say that we would have initiated this inquiry now, if the matter had not come to a head with this further increase; but I did say that the examination which we have been making in the Department of the problems of individual manufacturing firms in expanding their export business brought to light the high shipping freights on the cross-Channel services as a major impediment.  Because of those investigations, we might have thought it necessary to have conducted this inquiry, even if there had not been another percentage increase in the charges this year, as there was last year and the previous year and the year before that again.  It is obvious that the possibility of this country expanding in its export trade in many classes of goods could be greatly enhanced if competitive shipping freights were available on those routes and that possibility, on the other hand, is reduced every time those shipping charges are increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> The scope there is available in shipping on those routes for an extension of Irish export activity is, however, a very different question indeed.  However, everybody is agreed there should be an inquiry.  I think the arrangement proposed, to utilise the services of the Fair Trade Commission, will give us the best assurance we can have of an early and comprehensive report.  I think it will be a very valuable document because it will throw light upon a matter which has never been fully examined and investigated.</P>

    <Title>Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Bill, 1957&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a measure which was introduced by my predecessor and which automatically lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil.  It proposes to give statutory effect to the recommendations of the Conroy Commission in their Report on Reversionary Leases and it provides accordingly for the repeal and re-enactment, with certain modifications to which I shall refer later, of the present law about reversionary leases.</P>
      <P>The present law is contained in Part V of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and an amending Act passed in 1943.  Part V of the 1931 Act gave persons holding under certain long leases a right to a reversionary&mdash;that is, a renewal&mdash;lease when their leases expired.  It provided that the terms and conditions of a reversionary lease, including the rent to be reserved, might be settled by agreement between the parties but that, in default of agreement, the terms should be settled by the Circuit Court.  Part V prescribed that the rent to be fixed by the court should be one-fourth of the full occupation rent of the property comprised in the lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of their examination of the working of this Part of the Act of 1931, the Conroy Commission came to the conclusion that the law should be changed in three important respects. Firstly, they considered that the fraction of one-fourth of the full occupation rent which may be asked on the <Col N="96" /> renewal of these leases is too high and should be reduced to one-sixth. Secondly, they found that some leaseholders who are in equity entitled to the benefits of Part V are at present excluded from its scope.  Lastly, they thought it wrong in principle that a lessor who refused to grant a reversionary lease&mdash;and he could refuse in certain circumstances&mdash;did not have to pay compensation to the dispossessed lessee.</P>
    <P>On the first point the commission had evidence that in the great majority of cases the rents reserved by reversionary leases were lower than would have been obtained if the rents had been calculated strictly in accordance with the formula in the 1931 Act, that is one-fourth of the full occupation rent.  While the commission appreciated that there were advantages in leaving scope for bargaining between lessor and lessee, they thought that the fraction of one-fourth was too high and was so divorced from realities that bargaining powers rested only in the hands of the lessors.  The commission were of the opinion that if the rent were reduced from one-fourth to one-sixth of the full occupation rent no reasonable lessor could have any grounds for complaint.  Provision for reducing the fraction is made in Section 17 of the Bill.  Of course, the reduction will not affect the rents payable under leases which have not yet expired.</P>
    <P>Many of the complicated provisions of Part V of the 1931 Act are concerned with determining which of the persons having various leasehold interests in a particular property should get the valuable right to a reversionary lease when the building lease expires.  The 1931 Act, following the practice of the better-managed estates, provided that the lessee to get the reversionary lease should be the person who had acquired the beneficial or proprietary interest in the property, the person who owned, so to speak, the &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo;. This person might be the successor in title of the lessee who had built the property&mdash;the original building lessee &mdash;but, frequently it was a person who had &ldquo;bought&rdquo; the property from the building lessee by taking a long sublease of it at a relatively low rent and <Col N="97" /> by paying a considerable capital sum as well.  If there was such a sublessee (called a &ldquo;proprietary lessee&rdquo;), Part V provided that the reversionary lease should be given to him to the complete exclusion of the building lessee.  It was considered that the sublessee in such a case had acquired the beneficial interest in the property just as if he had built it himself and was in equity entitled to a renewal of the lease.</P>
    <P>The commission found that the rules which Part V had laid down for determining which of the lessees with interests in a particular property should be entitled to a reversionary lease were defective in some respects with the result that some lessees who are now entitled to reversionary leases are not the leasees who have the proprietary interest.  Their recommendations for amending these rules are contained in paragraphs 89 and 95 of the report and have been incorporated in Section 7 of the Bill.  The commission also thought that the benefits of Part V should be extended to cover certain leasehold properties in respect of which no leaseholder has at present a right to a reversionary lease. Section 2 of the Bill (by extending the definition of &ldquo;improvement&rdquo;) and Sections 5, 9 and 19 extend the scope of the 1931 Act to these properties in accordance with the commission's recommendation.</P>
    <P>The third main change which is being made in the present law is that which provides that compensation should be paid to any lessee who would have got a reversionary lease but for the fact that his landlord has satisfied the court that he is going to rebuild the premises or that he requires vacant possession to develop the property or that the grant of a reversionary lease would not be consistent with good estate management. The commission pointed out that where a reversionary lease is refused the lessee will suffer a severe financial loss even though no business is being carried on in the premises and the landlord will receive a substantial benefit.  Provision for compensation on the lines recommended by the commission is contained in Section 15.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> The matters I have briefly referred to cover, I think, the most important aspects of the Bill.  The incorporation in the Bill of the provisions of Part V of the 1931 Act and of the amending 1943 Act, with the modifications now being made, means that all the law about reversionary leases will be contained in one statute and this will be welcomed by practitioners.  Of course, this branch of the law is complicated by the fact that several leasehold interests frequently exist in one property and that the law has to be framed to deal with a host of individual transactions many of which were originally entered into over 100 years ago and which have since been the subject of fresh transactions. The technical language of the Bill is a reflection of the resulting complexities.  It is fortunate that when the provisions of the Bill were being formulated there was available a report as comprehensive and lucid as that presented by the Conroy Commission. I should like to add my voice to that of my predecessor in thanking the chairman and the members of the commission for having performed a valuable public duty.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill, which is, I think, a non-controversial measure, to the House and I ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the first amendment is to change the name of the Bill.  It was introduced as the Offices (Conditions of Employment) Bill.

I believe if we maintain the original name it may be confusing.  Because of that and the similarity of the names of earlier Acts I propose to change it to the Office Premises Act, 1957, which is, I think, a far more suitable and precise definition.</P>

      <P>This amendment and amendment No. 10 are linked; one is consequential on the other.  There was a point of difficulty as to the desirability of bringing within this Office Premises Bill people employed on clerical work in shops.  The best way of resolving that difficulty is to make all shop workers, whether employed on sales duties or office duties, come within the scope of the Shops Act which was passed some years ago.  That Act relates to physical conditions of employment in shops and covers things like ventilation, facilities for rest and all the other matters to which this Bill relates.  The effect of this amendment, with No. 10, is to take clerical workers outside the scope of this Bill and bring them for the first time within the scope of the Shops Act.  That will prevent any overlapping or any difficulty in determining if a particular employee in a shop comes under one Act or another.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> Before Section 17, but in Part III, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>17. (1) All floors, steps, stairs, lifts, passages and gangways shall be of sound construction and properly maintained.</P>
    <P>(2) For every staircase in a building or affording a means of exit from a building, a substantial handrail shall be provided and maintained, which, if the staircase has an open side, shall be on that side, and, in the case of a staircase having two open sides, or in the case of a staircase which, owing to the nature of the construction thereof or the condition of the surface of the steps or other special circumstances, is especially liable to cause accidents, such a handrail shall be provided and maintained on both sides.  Any open side of a staircase shall also be guarded by the provision and maintenance of a lower rail or other effective means.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is, firstly, to include lifts with the parts of premises which should be properly constructed and maintained, and, secondly, to require the provision of handrails on stairs.  The inclusion of lifts is a logical provision in the section which provides for safe means of access to offices.  The existing section leaves details about handrails, and the like, to be fixed by regulations.  It seems to me, however, on reconsideration, that specific provision can, and should be, made in the Bill for handrails.</P>
    <P>With regard to things like floors, stairs, passages and the like, it does not seem that anything can be added by way of regulation to the provision in the Bill that these shall be of sound construction and properly maintained. Consequently, there is no need to take power to detail the obligations of employers under the Bill, beyond what is normally stated in the section itself.</P>

      <P>I have half a mind to move that amendment myself, in the absence of the Deputies concerned. If the Chair will allow me to speak about the amendment, without its being moved, I should like to say that I have given some thought to the desirability of accepting it.  There is no provision in the Bill about fire preventive facilities.  There is no provision of that kind in the Factories Acts either.  The principal argument against making provision in that regard is that any such provision would have to include arrangements for the regular inspection of appliances, for the keeping of records of inspection, and so on.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it would be difficult, I think, to frame general regulations prescribing standards of fire fighting equipment to be maintained in offices because the standards that would be suitable to any office would be determined by its construction, state of preservation and the general layout of the building.  It seems to me that it would be difficult to cover all offices by a general provision.  Nevertheless, I do not see that any great difficulty would be created if the amendment were accepted.</P>
      <P>The amendment would empower the Minister to make regulations for any class or description of office requiring that provision be made for fire preventive facilities.  In so far as it leaves the matter on that basis, and that the Minister would act only after consulting the Advisory Committee, I do not see that there is any harm in the insertion of this amendment in the Bill.</P>
      <P>If the amendment were moved, I would accept it, even though I should like it to be understood that I can see quite considerable practical difficulties in dealing with this question of fire-fighting facilities by way of regulations such as are contemplated.</P>

      <P>Is it not clear that the Minister himself has used arguments sufficient to demonstrate <Col N="105" /> why the amendment should not be included?

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such provision in the Factories Acts. Clearly, it is in relation to factories that fire-fighting equipment is most definitely required.  We have framed this Bill as far as possible upon the Factories Acts.  If the amendment were pressed, I would accept it because it merely gives the Minister power to make regulations which I do not think he would make.  On the whole, it would be better to leave it out.  It would be anomalous to have this in this Bill and not to have it in the Factories Acts.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> The purpose of this amendment is to make permissive provision for the payment of remuneration to the chairman of the Advisory Council.  I do not want it to be taken that remuneration will be paid.  However, if it should be decided at any time to make some payment to the chairman of the Advisory Council, in the absence of the provision, it might create certain difficulties in so far as it could be argued that the intention of the Oireachtas was not set down in the legislation.  The need for this amendment in this Bill arose because of certain arguments between my predecessor and the Minister for Finance in his Government concerning the pay to the chairman of the Advisory Council under the Factories Acts.</P>

    <P>The existing section provides that an owner or occupier charged with an <Col N="109" /> offence may make the plea that he has used all due diligence to comply with the law and may bring before the court the person whom he alleges to be the actual offender.  That is the provision in the corresponding section of the Factories Act.  I have come to the conclusion, however, that the procedure is inappropriate in the case of offices, especially so in the light of the rather simple provisions of the Bill. The proposed new section merely states that the plea of due diligence shall be a good defence.  Of course the State may, on its own initiative, take proceedings against a person other than the owner or occupier if it is thought an action lies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are, firstly, to provide for the continuance of powers in relation to certain miscellaneous social welfare schemes which were conferred on local authorities by three Emergency Powers Orders made under the Supplies and Services Acts, which are due to expire on the 31st December next, and secondly, to remove doubts which have arisen in the interpretation of the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts, 1914 to 1930.</P>
      <P>The social welfare schemes concerned are the cooked meals scheme, the cheap fuel scheme and the public assistance footwear scheme.  In relation to the cooked meals scheme I should explain that, to meet the possibility of the dislocation of essential services, the Government decided in 1941 to invest county borough corporations with power to establish emergency food centres either directly or in association or by arrangement with any other person or body.  The Emergency Powers (No. 109) Order, 1941, was made accordingly.  The Order has been used in Dublin and Limerick as the authority for payments by the corporations concerned to voluntary bodies to assist them in providing meals for poor persons.  There is no cost to the Exchequer, the subsidies being borne entirely by the local authorities, but the Minister's sanction is necessary to the operation of any scheme.  It is proposed to continue the powers contained in the Emergency Powers Order substantially unchanged and Section 2 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
      <P>Turning now to Section 4 of the Bill. The cheap fuel scheme was introduced as an emergency measure in 1942, when fuel was scarce, to ensure that fuel would be available at a low price to poor people in areas then classified as non-turf areas.  The service is operated in 16 cities and towns mainly on the eastern seaboard. A modified service is operated in Limerick City.  During the winter months&mdash;November to March inclusive &mdash;one cwt. of fuel (turf or timber) is provided each week for households in the following categories:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> (a) home assistance recipients free of charge, the cost being met by the public assistance authority,</P>
    <P>(b) persons in receipt of old age, blind and widows' and orphans' pensions, who pay 6d. per cwt.,</P>
    <P>(c) unemployment, assistance recipients with dependents, who pay 1/- per cwt.,</P>
    <P>(d) persons with low weekly incomes, outside the above categories, who pay 2/- per cwt.</P>
    <P>The net cost of the fuel supplied is recouped from the Social Assistance Vote, No. 62, to local authorities operating approved schemes.  The amount voted for the current year is £161,750 and there will be no increase in this amount as a result of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Certain of the powers given to local authorities in Emergency Powers (No. 108) Order, 1941, and (No. 310) Order, 1944, are necessary for the operation of this service.  The No. 108 Order empowers county councils and urban authorities to acquire, fell, transport, use, sell and dispose of timber.  Article 18 of the No. 310 Order empowers them to purchase, sell or dispose of turf.  It is proposed to continue these powers for urban authorities as provided in Section 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The public assistance footwear scheme is operated by public assistance authorities under the Public Assistance (Footwear Regulations) Order, 1944, made under the Public Assistance Act, 1939.  The scheme, which was initiated in 1944, was designed to ensure that a proportion of the leather then available would be utilised for footwear for children up to the age of 16 years, whose parents or guardians were in receipt of home assistance, or were deemed by the public assistance authorities to be unable to provide footwear for their children.  Home assistance recipients receive the footwear free of charge, and other recipients pay a contribution, fixed by the public assistance authority, according to their means.</P>
    <P>The annual sum voted for the scheme under the Social Assistance Vote is £37,500.  Within this limit half <Col N="113" /> the net cost of expenditure on footwear is recouped to public assistance authorities, No extra cost is involved in the proposed provision.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Powers (No. 351) Order, 1945, provides safeguards relating to inspection, sale, purchase and use of the special footwear manufactured for the scheme and also for penalties for abuse.  In practice, it has not been found necessary for many years to utilise any of these powers, other than that of inspection which has, in general, prevented abuse of the scheme.  It is considered necessary, therefore, to continue only the powers of inspection by inspectors appointed by the Minister and by the public assistance authorities and the associated penalty for obstruction and these are provided for in Section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Reverting now to Section 3 of the Bill as regards the school meals scheme, operated by urban authorities under the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts, 1914 to 1930.  Certain doubts have arisen in connection with the administration of the schemes following the consideration of questions raised by the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to the Appropriation Accounts for the years 1951-52, 1952-53 and 1953-54.  In general, the Act is designed to provide for the supply of school meals on a contributory or repayment basis but provision is made for remitting part or all of the cost where the parents are unable to pay and for supplying meals free of charge to children who are unable, by reason of lack of food, to benefit from the education provided for them.</P>
    <P>Since the inception of the service as far back as 1914, the schemes have been operated mainly on the free-of-charge basis, the cost of the food being met out of the rates in the first instance.</P>
    <P>One half the cost of the food supplied in the meals is recouped from the Exchequer to the local authorities. The amount provided in the Social Assistance Vote for the current year is £77,500.  There will be no increase in this amount as a result of the proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>The view has always been held that <Col N="114" /> local authorities were entitled, to operate non-contributory schemes only if they so desire despite the provisions relating to contributory schemes.  I have been advised however, that this interpretation of the Acts is not free from doubt.  I have also been advised that the only cost which under Section 3 of the 1914 Act may be met out of the rates is the cost of food and that the cost of preparing a meal, over and above the cost of the provision of the food, cannot legally be met out of the rates.  In fact, of course, the preparation of food &mdash; the cutting and buttering of bread, the slicing of meat and preparing cocoa or stew &mdash; is essential to the provision of the meal and the cost involved is inseparable from the cost of the meal and has to be met.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill proposes to set this matter right by amending the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts, 1914 to 1930, so as to place beyond doubt the right of local authorities to continue to operate non-contributory school meal schemes under Section 3 of the Act of 1914 and to defray the cost of preparing the meals.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is quite clear.  As the Parliamentary Secretary said, it is a Bill to assist the administration of the scheme and to clear doubts which have arisen.  I think it meets those requirements. Accordingly, we have no objection to the Bill and trust that its intentions will be achieved.  As the Parliamentary Secretary stated, there is always difficulty in relation to the preparation and operation of meals in various places.  I do not know how the Parliamentary Secretary can say that there will be no additional charges. The chances are that there will.  It ought to make for the more extensive use of meals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all very glad that the Parliamentary Secretary brought in this Bill to clear up any doubts that may have existed.  The fuel scheme is in operation only from November to March, and I thought, when the Parliamentary Secretary was bringing in a Bill such as this, he would have made the fuel scheme apply all the year round.  Old age pensioners. <Col N="115" /> especially those living on their own, find it very difficult at any time of the year to provide themselves with fuel out of the miserably small pensions they have.  This is especially the case, as I have said, when they are living on their own.  I think the least the Government should have done was to ensure that the free fuel scheme would have applied the whole year round.</P>
      <P>With regard to providing meals in the county boroughs, the Parliamentary Secretary might have gone further and allowed public authorities in other towns, where unemployment is so rife and where people are not able to get a meal, to provide free meals.  He should have brought in a section to enable this to be done by the other local authorities.</P>
      <P>I have received complaints now and again that the footwear provided under the footwear scheme is of very poor quality.  People who have to contribute quite a share towards the cost were very aggrieved when they found the quality of the footwear supplied was so poor.  I know there are inspections, but these inspections are concerned more with ensuring that the right people get the vouchers and do not hand over their vouchers to others. I think there should be more inspections to ensure that the quality of the footwear supplied is better than it has been.  I am glad to learn that matters in regard to the charges for and preparation of school meals have been cleared up.</P>

      <P>On the point made by Deputy MacEoin, we have found that there was abuse of the free meal scheme, particularly in the City of Dublin.  Bread and food were pegged about and the Minister's predecessor in office investigated this and tightened up the whole scheme.  There was a considerable saving as a result of that investigation and there will be a considerable saving in the present year. The last Deputy who spoke referred to the free fuel scheme operating the whole year round.  The experience in the Department was that practically no one availed of a summer fuel scheme which was in operation in the years after the <Col N="116" /> last war.  On that account, it was scrapped.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the suggestion of extending the free meal scheme all over the country.  I do not subscribe to the welfare state at all and the more we can avoid it, the better.  People stand on their own feet in this country. They supply their children with meals and take pride in supplying them with substantial meals.  I would hate to see the day when we would do away with that system.  In cities like Dublin and Cork, there may be a case for it; but, subject to the approval of the Minister, while I am in this position, there will not be any extension of the scheme to other parts of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies are aware that the Supplies and Services Act will expire on December 31st.  That Act had its origin in the emergency legislation which was enacted on the outbreak of the war and which gave the Government wide powers of control over the supply, distribution and prices of goods, to be exercised over the whole period of the war and its aftermath.  Some time after the war ended, however, the scope of that emergency legislation was very considerably reduced, but through the Supplies and Services Act, the powers which were given to the Government on the outbreak of war, regarding control of prices, were continued. It was in accordance with these powers that various price control Orders were made from time to time since then.  That temporary Act which was initially passed by the Dáil for one year only has been continued by annual continuation Acts every year since.  It is now finally coming to an end and, with its passage, we have to consider the extent and the form of the legislation relating to prices and control of prices which should have a permanent place on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> There is a pre-war Act, the Control of Prices Act, 1937, still on the Statute Book.  That Act which was to be permanent was, of course, passed by the Dáil in conditions entirely different from those which operated during the war and post-war years.  To some extent, it could be described as a product of the political conditions prevailing at that time.  It is, however, still on the Statute Book, and, as an alternative to enacting new legislation, it could be brought back into operation again.  That course was considered by the Government, but we decided against it.</P>
    <P>The 1937 Act provided for a permanent Prices Commission with independent powers of investigating prices, and provided also for the making by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of maximum price Orders, relating to either goods or services, on receiving from the commission a report which justified the making of them.  It provided also for a controller of prices who was empowered to make investigations of individual complaints. His powers related not to the general survey of prices charged everywhere for particular goods which the commission might investigate, but to prices charged for particular products in a particular locality, or even to prices charged in an individual transaction to a single customer.  He was empowered to issue certificates relating to such transactions, even certificates relating to individual transactions, requiring in some instances a refund of any overcharge which he thought had taken place.</P>
    <P>It is our view that the machinery of the 1937 Act is too cumbersome.  It proved to be so in operation in the pre-war years.  The principle of that Act was to maintain machinery capable of carrying out the continuous investigation of prices charged for all commodities, even as I said in the case of individual transactions and irrespective of the general trading conditions applying to any class of goods or in any area. In our view, that type of price control legislation would be unsuited to our present circumstances.  To some extent, when it was in operation, it did operate to discourage the development of industry. <Col N="118" /> It did so not to any great extent &mdash; certainly not to the extent that the continuation of the war-time powers, long after the war had passed, had operated to discourage industrial development.</P>
    <P>When one comes to consider the desirability of relying upon the 1937 Act, one cannot leave out of account what has happened since.  We think it would be undesirable to provide for continuous investigation of prices through organisations or individuals empowered by Statute to act independently in that regard.  We think that legislation, if relied upon now, would have the effect which we think the emergency legislation has had in recent years, of discouraging people from engaging in industrial and other forms of production in the hope of making a reasonable profit on their investment.  It is proposed, therefore, in this Bill, which contains our proposals for permanent price control legislation, to repeal finally that 1937 Act.  Deputies will, of course, have gathered from my remarks that that Act has been out of operation since the beginning of the war and there is now in existence none of the machinery for which it provided.</P>
    <P>The Government considered whether it was desirable to have price control legislation at all.  We could have allowed the Supplies and Services Act to lapse at the end of this year without taking action to bring the 1937 Act back into force and have left the situation such that no powers of price control would be available to the Government, although we might have to have in mind the need to deal with an emergency situation.  In the absence of a permanent Act we would have to deal with an emergency situation if it occurred by <i>ad hoc</i> legislation brought to the Dáil in the light of that emergency and justified because of its requirements.</P>
    <P>We decided against that course although it has certain attractions. We think that, taking the conditions prevailing in this country at present and likely to prevail for many years to come, it is desirable that the Government should have available to it powers which it can use when it thinks <Col N="119" /> it necessary to use them to carry out an investigation of prices in particular instances and to take action regarding those prices when investigation shows it to be desirable or necessary.</P>
    <P>When the Control of Prices Act of 1937 was being debated here before the war it was in an atmosphere in which it was generally contended that all price increases which occurred were due to one cause and one cause only, namely, excess profit taking.  Deputies who were active in politics in those days will recollect that the contention that price rises were all attributable to that one cause was common, and the belief was spread amongst the people, a belief which has not been completely demolished yet, that preventing prices from rising was merely a matter of controlling the profit margins taken by producers or distributors.</P>
    <P>We have had 20 years' experience of continuous inflation since then, 20 years during which the various, Governments that held office have not merely had available to them the powers regarded as necessary in 1937 but the far wider and far more drastic powers conferred by the legislation passed when the war began.  The experience of those 20 years, the record of continuously rising prices due to inflationary forces which no system of Government regulation, investigation or control was able to check has, I hope, helped to educate public opinion in regard to the forces that affect prices.</P>
    <P>It is now certainly more generally realised if not universally realised, that profits, whether the profits taken by manufacturers, importers or wholesale and retail distributors, are a very small part of prices and that systems of controlling profits have very little effect against powerful inflationary forces.  Deputies will be aware that I have been trying to get my view regarding the ineffectiveness of price controls in inflationary conditions understood generally and have been trying to destroy any lingering illusion that may be left that any system of control can prevent prices going up when costs are going up.  As I have now to come to the Dáil to recommend <Col N="120" /> the enactment of this Prices Bill I want to make it clear that I have no desire, by advocating it to the House, to help in keeping alive any illusion that it is possible to devise a system of control which will prevent prices rising when costs are rising.</P>
    <P>I have for less desire to revive the campaign against profits when all our experience is that the profit margins in industry are in many instances too low to permit of a rate of expansion in industry such as we would desire to see. The advice which we have got from outside experts who were from time to time brought here to advise upon Irish economic development is that profits in industry are inadequate to encourage investment in industry.  In the light of that advice it would be clearly unwise to enact legislation or take any other measure which would help to spread the mistaken notion that there is a desire to limit profits further or to prevent those who may be induced to invest in Irish industrial expansion getting a reasonable and adequate return for their enterprise.  Neither have we any desire to suggest that profits in distribution where competition is effective require any special supervision. Where there is genuine competition for trade between suppliers, profits are limited by a far more effective method than anything that can be given by legislation.</P>
    <P>It is the view of the Government, which I have had to reiterate upon many occasions in public speeches recently, that the most effective price regulator is competition and, therefore, I want to make it clear beyond all possible doubt or misunderstanding that the Government does not contemplate utilising the powers which will be conferred on it under this Bill where competition is active.  If competition is active, there will be no need for either investigation or regulation.  There are, however &mdash; and this is the justification for the Bill&mdash;circumstances which may limit competition and in certain instances these circumstances are more likely to arise in this country than in other countries.  Because of that, we think we need legislation here which other countries have not seen the need for or have long since discarded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> The circumstances which may operate to limit competition are of three kinds. First of all, there is the possibility of agreements, covenants, between suppliers of any class of goods to restrict competition amongst themselves.  We have, of course, passed the Restrictive Trade Practices Act and set up the Fair Trade Commission to deal with restrictive agreements of that kind, and where recourse to that Act can restore competition in any trade, then there will be no need to use the powers to be conferred under this Bill; but where the Fair Trade Commission has to report that it is unable completely to eradicate restrictive arrangements of that kind in any trade, where, notwithstanding any Orders we may make here or any fair trading rules they may publish, competition is being limited by these agreements amongst suppliers, then we can have recourse to the powers of this Bill to fix prices on consideration of a report from the Fair Trade Commission to that effect.</P>
    <P>Because of the smallness of the Irish market it is, of course, to be expected that something akin to monopoly conditions may apply to some commodities, not because of any undesirable restrictions or agreements, but because the limited size of the home market makes it economic for only one supplier to operate.  In all cases of that kind which exist at the moment, I think we can have confidence in the desire of those who are responsible for the direction of those industries not to exploit their position to the public detriment, but in some such cases, existing now or in the future, the need for regulation by price Orders may arise, and in such cases the power to make them will exist under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The second case which may require action under the Bill is where there are unnecessarily high costs prevailing in any industry from causes which are within the control of those in the industry, causes which could be eradicated, if action was taken by those engaged in the industry.  If there is an undue exploitation of a tariff by the retention of obsolete techniques or by reason of restrictive practices of any kind which push up costs, then, following an inquiry by the committee <Col N="122" /> acting under this Bill, action to control prices may also be taken.</P>
    <P>The third circumstance under which that action might arise is where the Government decides that there are emergency conditions in existence, or likely to arise, which may have the effect of restricting supplies.  The most recent example of the type of emergency we have in mind in that regard arose last year with the Suez Canal development.  In these cases, and in these cases only, subject to certain qualifications which I will mention later, the Government can control prices, but it can do so only after an investigation by the Fair Trade Commission has brought out the fact that there is an artificial restriction of competition or monopoly conditions arising from any cause, or investigation by a committee under the Bill has shown that these unduly high costs, capable of being remedied and not remedied, still exist, or where the Government decides that there is an emergency situation which requires special action.</P>
    <P>It will, however, be understood by Deputies that the remedy for unduly high prices arising because of a restriction of competition or inefficient production or obsolete production methods may not be price control.  There are many commodities in respect of which price control is not practicable at all, commodities which are sold in such a wide number of varieties that no common price could be fixed and in many cases with such little difference between one variety or quality and another that only the expert could judge between them.</P>
    <P>Tea is, perhaps, the outstanding example in that regard.  When we did exercise control over the price of tea, we had to have a standard tea, only one quality, on sale and when it was decided to restore the pre-war freedom in relation to varieties of tea, then, of course, price control had to go as well.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, a situation should arise where, either because of the prevalence of monopoly conditions, or restrictive practices, or because of unduly high cost, action has to be taken, that action need not necessarily <Col N="123" /> be the making of price control Orders. Where price control Orders are not suitable, a remedy will have to be sought by other means.  It may be thought necessary to reduce protection in some cases, but the intention would be that where a problem exists, where price control is not the answer to the problem, <i>ad hoc</i> measures will be taken to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, considered that because of the limited size of the Irish market and the limited number of producing units in industry, the policy of protection obliges the Government to take powers of investigating what is happening and to check on undesirable developments.  That was the main justification for the pre-war Prices Act.  It was argued in justification of that Act that when the Government had, in the interests of national economic development, limited or prevented competition from imports, there was an obligation on them to keep under constant examination what was happening in the protected industries so that any undesirable development resulting from protection could be checked in the interests of the consumers of the products.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, gives power to control prices generally only on three conditions: first, where investigation has revealed that a monopoly situation, arising either out of the circumstances of a particular trade or contrived by agreements among those engaged in the trade, is leading to unduly high prices and where no other method can be found to rectify the position; secondly, where investigation has shown the prevalence of unduly high costs in a protected industry from causes which are capable of being remedied and where no other suitable method is available: and thirdly, in temporary conditions, such as the Suez crisis, on decisions by the Government.</P>
    <P>We think that a permanent and costly investigating body is not necessary. What is proposed in the Bill is that a committee should be set up, whenever it is thought necessary to undertake an investigation, drawn <Col N="124" /> from a panel of persons who have already agreed to be available to act for that purpose when required.  That committee, of course, will have all the powers which are usually regarded as necessary to carry out a thorough investigation. I have mentioned, however, only the general powers of control which the Bill will confer.  It is considered desirable to retain power to control the prices of a limited number of essential commodities even without a prior investigation.  These commodities are bread, butter, sugar and milk.  These are commodities which are capable of being subject to price control Orders and in regard to them the danger of developments requiring action taking place must always be deemed to be there and a protracted investigation might be undesirable and, indeed, in some cases unnecessary.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, decided to keep in this Bill power to make price control Orders without prior investigation in regard to bread, sugar, milk and butter.  In the case of milk and butter the Minister for Industry and Commerce is required to act in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture. There are, it is true, other Acts upon the Statute Book under which the price of bread and milk could be controlled, and we did consider whether it was desirable to rely on these earlier Acts or to make provision in this Act on the lines I have indicated.  We think it is just as well to have one Prices Act to which people can refer when they want to ascertain the Government's power, and a uniform procedure for all price-regulation activities.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, appreciated by Deputies that the prices of bread and butter are not at present controlled. The retail price of sugar is at present controlled although there may be some question as to the necessity for retaining control and the price of milk is controlled only in certain limited areas.</P>
    <P>I have now mentioned the general provisions of the Bill giving power to exercise control in the case of any goods or services after investigation, and where investigation has shown the need for it arising out of some factors operating to limit competition, and these more specific powers of control <Col N="125" /> in relation to a very limited number of commodities.  It is, of course, intended to exclude from the scope of the Bill certain commodities in regard to which Ministers other than the Minister for Industry and Commerce have primary responsibility, or for which there is already statutory machinery for maintaining any controls that are considered necessary.  Therefore, the power exercisable under this Bill will not apply to prices paid to producers for agricultural produce.  That is, of course, a central aspect of agricultural policy and is the concern of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not apply to prices paid to producers of fish who are the concern of the Minister for Fisheries. It does not apply to professional services which it would be impossible to control by price regulation, anyway. Nor does it apply to prices controlled under any existing legislation administered by any other Department than the Department of Industry and Commerce or by any local authority.</P>
    <P>I do not want to present this Bill to the Dáil as a measure of major importance. I do not regard it as such. I think we have now got a situation where we can hope that the free play of competition will be effective in dealing with the prices of most commodities and it will certainly be the general aim of Government policy to promote competition so that the need for any other type of regulation or control will disappear.  Nevertheless, we think it would be undesirable to let the Supplies and Services Act lapse at the end of the year without putting something in its stead in the shape of a Prices Act, and it was because of the feeling that circumstances could arise which would justify investigation and perhaps action that this Bill was framed, and it is solely in circumstances in which competition is not fully effective that it is intended to use it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said so much against the Bill or against the idea of making price control effective that I wonder why he has introduced it at all.  I agree, to a considerable extent, with the view that competition is the most effective method of price <Col N="126" /> control.  In fact, I doubt if in present circumstances, there is any faith in the effectiveness of price control in this country.  We have had a succession of debates and discussions here over the years.  We have had occasional alterations in legislation.  In the main, the discussions have centred round the annual renewal of the Supplies and Services Act.  Our experience of operating price control here has not been such that there is much public confidence engendered in it.</P>
      <P>For that reason, I was interested in the Minister's concluding remark that he did not regard this as a measure of major importance.  I suppose experience has taught Deputies on both sides of the House but it is possible that both sides have contributed to the illusion that prices can be controlled by Government action or by some statutory authority.  Experience in recent years, however, has demonstrated that, with occasional exceptions, that is not so.  In fact, experience of wartime and emergency conditions has shown that, with the exception of the special circumstances pertaining to wartime or emergency conditions and then only in relation to goods which are either rationed or within the control of the Government, it is not possible to make price control effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister has dwelt on the control which it is proposed to retain in respect of some essential commodities.  He dwelt at some length on the control of the price of bread.  Early this year, when the Budget was introduced, bread was decontrolled as a result of the reduction in the subsidy and there was immediately a very steep increase in the price.  After a few days, the Minister intervened and made a price control Order.  The effect of that was to reduce the price slightly in relation to bread manufactured by bakers for a short period.  After a lapse of time, the Minister withdrew the control that had been imposed.  There may have been good reasons for that action, but I believe that when action of that sort is taken, the public lose faith in the effectiveness of price control.  Either the original price charged as a result <Col N="127" /> of the reduction in the subsidy was a fair and reasonable one or the price fixing Order should have been retained. Either one or the other is true and, if one is correct, then in either case action taken has the effect of misleading the public into believing that price control can be effective.</P>
    <P>As the Minister remarked, it is possible to make price control effective in a uniform commodity where there is a central buying authority and where the commodity is centrally controlled and issued.  He instanced the case of tea in relation to which there was a uniform variety during the war or emergency years.  The real problem here is not so much the belief which was current because of our experience of wartime and its aftermath, that profits were a considerable factor in prices; the Minister remarked that the inflation of the war and post-war period has shattered that illusion. What we have got to face, and so far nobody seems particularly attracted to the desirability of dealing with the problem, is that we have here a high-cost economy.  That has come about as a result of deliberate national policy and it is not easy to change now.  Certainly it would not be easy to change without causing difficulty and possible hardship.</P>
    <P>The advent of a free trade area may force a change.  In fact, if the free trade area evolves as it is expected to evolve, it will inevitably cause changes. But, unless and until that aspect of the problem is considered, price control by Government action or by a statutory authority can have only a limited effect and very likely for only a limited period.  The wisdom of retaining a permanent system in circumstances as normal as we are likely to get is, I think, open to question.</P>
    <P>I notice that, in the main, the Minister has in this Bill followed what was in the Supplies and Services Act, as amended by the subsequent establishment of the Prices Advisory Body. That amendment was inserted to deal with circumstances which arose as a result of the outbreak of the Korean war.  Whether or not it is a desirable <Col N="128" /> form of permanent legislation is another question.  This Bill follows more or less the pattern in which a body &mdash; in this case, a number of <i>ad hoc</i> committees appointed by the Minister &mdash; will investigate and report. The Minister has apparently decided, after consultation with the Government, that this system of price control is better than the permanent and rather cumbersome machinery introduced in the 1937 Act.  It has the merit that it enables action to be taken quickly and it gives the initiative to the Minister.  I believe that one of the reasons why there is a lack of public confidence in this matter is that the public feel that Governments act only on the prodding or the initiative taken by a section of the community, or the amount of public interest focussed on a particular question here in the Dáil or in some other public discussion.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, to tackle two distinct problems.  One is whether greater public confidence would be shown in an independent statutory body which could itself initiate action, but which might consequently take decisions which would, of course, impinge either on public policy or on policy which would have a bearing on the Government's political fortunes, if no others.  On the other hand, the difficulties in the machinery envisaged in this Bill are, I think, that the initiative rests with the Minister, and while there is a rather interesting preamble in the Bill setting out the circumstances in which it is considered desirable to operate a system of price control, it is left to the Minister's decision to initiate a particular inquiry as to whether the price charged for a commodity or commodities is fair and reasonable, and, after investigation, he can take action.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely satisfied that in normal circumstances &mdash; in so far as they are normal having regard to present circumstances&mdash;it is worth while trying to operate a system of price control. As the Minister remarked, competition is the most effective means of control, and in that regard I am to some extent surprised that some commodities have been included here.  At least, if oranges are included, I submit <Col N="129" /> there is an equally good case for including such commodities as tomatoes and apples.  Again, this comes within the remarks which the Minister made concerning the variety of a particular commodity.  At the present time, any one can go into a fruit shop, or even go to a barrow in Moore Street or elsewhere, and get a wide variety of the one commodity.  I recently had experience of asking about the different prices.  One can buy an article at 5d. or at 3d., but one can readily see that there is a difference in size and quality.</P>
    <P>Surely, in those circumstances, <i>caveat emptor</i> ought to be a condition under which a person makes a purchase. If people can see the article they intend buying, if it is not an essential article in the public interest, normally speaking, if it is not an essential foodstuff, then the public should have some choice.  Those offering articles of that sort should be allowed to do so on the basis that if they sell a range of commodities differing in size and quality, the purchaser is an equally good judge as to what he wants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is reasonable, but a number of the commodities here are, or have been up to recently, subject to control&mdash;butter, for instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is reasonable. In some shops, at the moment, they display different grades of oranges at different prices.  However, I feel that in those circumstances it is better to leave it at the discretion and the wisdom of the prospective purchaser, rather than to try to operate a system which cannot work to the extent that would engender public confidence.  Undoubtedly, the view which was expressed at a number of inquiries or by experts who came here, particularly from America, is that our profits are too low.  Compared with conditions in America and in other countries where economies are expanding, our rates of <Col N="130" /> profit are unfavourable.  In this matter again, a number of things must be considered. The size of the markets here is infinitesimal as compared with those of some of the people who come here. We have, by deliberate policy, embarked on what is called a high cost economy.</P>
      <P>If a decision altering tariffs and quotas is taken, we must arrive at it with our eyes open and on the basis that it is in the national interest that changes of this sort are to be carried out.  Up to the present, in the main, any decision to alter the rate of profit not alone evoked a protest from those interested but had an immediate effect on the whole economy of the district or the town where an industry is located.</P>
      <P>With the introduction of the free trade area, that situation may change. If it does, it will certainly involve a radical alteration in the whole question of price control; it would mean radical alterations in more than price control because it would involve the whole question of protection and assistance for industries.  This Bill has two main purposes.  In fact, I think, it is really a continuation, with slightly different effect, of the provisions already enshrined in the Supplies and Services Acts, extended and continued.  Whether it is worth enacting a measure of this sort in present circumstances is open to question, but if the Minister and the Government feel there is some advantage to be gained from it, I do not think there will be any opposition to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points I should like to raise on this measure.  First of all, I should like to know from the Minister how he would arrive at the decision to have an inquiry put in hand.  We know that when inquiries of the nature envisaged are held, they involve the particular industries or trades concerned in very heavy expenses.  I have a feeling that some inquiries held in the past were initiated on the protests of a number of people who were, in my opinion, not very responsible and whose complaints were, in many cases, frivolous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my own opinion that, before the Minister arrives at a decision to <Col N="131" /> hold an inquiry, he should have the complaints which are made to him on the application for an inquiry examined very closely in order that the trade concerned will not be put to tremendous expense in order to justify its existence.</P>
    <P>Another aspect in relation to prices which should be discussed on a measure like this is the question of the cut-price shop.  On my way into Dublin this morning, I saw in a shop window an advertisement saying &ldquo;Cut-Price Shop&rdquo;.  I understand that in practically every department of trade, prices are cut.  The purpose would seem to be to attract customers of other shops throughout the city to that particular place because they will get things a couple of pence cheaper.  I do not think that is a very good business.  The Minister told us already that profits are not a big factor in prices.  If this system of cut-price shops were to spring up throughout the country, it would involve all trades in immense difficulties.  People seeing prices cut in these shops will begin to get the impression that other honest and responsible traders are mulcting them unnecessarily. We all know that shops in the retail business find it difficult enough to pay the wages of their staffs and to keep their premises in a proper condition with the small profits which the Minister has already admitted and which have very little bearing on prices.</P>
    <P>I think some form of investigation into the cut-price shop should be taken side by side with any inquiry into the legitimate trade of legitimate traders.  It is quite wrong that legitimate traders should have all their business inquired into while this type of trader to whom I have referred should be allowed carry on simply because he is going to cut prices below the normal level.  That aspect should be very closely inquired into.  I, of course, never like to see a Government interfering in any business, but I realise it is necessary in certain circumstances, that the price which people have to pay for normal goods should be inquired into from time to time.</P>
    <P>The only reason I stood up was to <Col N="132" /> ask the Minister for an assurance that no inquiry will be held until he has something in the nature of proof that an abuse is taking place in regard to a particular commodity and that he will not hold an inquiry simply because there is a suggestion that prices in a particular commodity are being abused. I made these few remarks, firstly, to get information and secondly, in the hope that the Minister may at some time do something to prevent the type of trading I have mentioned and which I believe is not justifiable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that this Bill represents a very much more realistic approach to the whole question of prices than we have had heretofore. There is only one point on which I would disagree with the Minister and that is when he described the Bill as not being of major importance.  That is a matter of a point of view, but from the point of view of the business community, I would regard it certainly as of major importance.  I would also regard as being of major importance the comments which the Minister has made on the question of profits.  The unfortunate thing is that up to recently the very idea of somebody making a profit was regarded as, if not illegal, at least highly improper.  How people were expected to continue in business without making a profit was always a mystery to me.</P>
      <P>I welcome very much the very strong statement which the Minister has made and which was confirmed by Deputy Cosgrave, that the rate of profits in Irish industry is far too low.  The dismal fact still exists that public opinion is far from convinced on this point. One other reason why public opinion has been influenced in this way is that in the public inquiries by the Fair Trade Commission, the most irresponsible criticisms have been made, as Deputy Loughman has pointed out also.  It is those criticisms of Irish industry which have hit the headlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way in which those criticisms could fairly be met by Irish industry would be a complete and public disclosure of the details of a company's accounts.  It is grossly unfair to expect any business to disclose <Col N="133" /> its accounts in public, except in a case where some gross impropriety is being alleged.  But the atmosphere in the Fair Trade Commission has always been that the industrialist is guilty, unless and until he can prove himself innocent.  That has been largely due to the fact that irresponsible people have been allowed to make criticisms which they are not bound to substantiate. For that reason, I greatly welcome the provisions in this Bill for prices advisory bodies and I note there is no specific reference to public sittings.</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody to believe for a moment that I&mdash;or any other person engaged in industry &mdash; am frightened to let people know how the business is run and how much money is being made, but at the same time it is unfair that these inquiries should take place in public.  I hope that these prices advisory bodies, appointed by the Minister, will act not in public but in private.  There would be considerably less cost involved for all parties. I feel that if those bodies are properly selected &mdash; as I anticipate they will be &mdash;and have the influence of men who have experience of industry and business generally they will be able very rapidly to advise the Minister as to whether monopoly conditions exist.  I think the Minister can make up his own mind whether there is a temporary emergency, without asking anybody's advice.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that responsibility for initiating any action lies with the Minister.  I think that is the place where the responsibility should rest.  That brings me back to Deputy Loughman's point that irresponsibility may creep in if you have a body which is not directly responsible to anybody else but is just sitting there looking for trouble, as it were.  No Minister for Industry and Commerce will be sitting in his office looking for trouble but he will adopt a responsible attitude in this way.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill represents mainly a reservation of power to be used only when necessary and that it will not mean a regular routine of price inquiries which can only be upsetting both to producer and consumer.  There <Col N="134" /> is a lot to be said for the reservation of that power in the hands of the Government and that threat alone should prevent any tendency towards unduly high prices.</P>
    <P>I am very glad, too, that Deputy Loughman raised the question of the cutting of prices.  This is a matter which has been raised with me on a number of occasions and not so much by those engaged in trade or industry as by consumers who have come to me and said: &ldquo;We are frightened of the cut-price shop because the shop where we have always dealt is being put out of business, and we prefer to deal with those with whom we have always dealt &mdash;people whom we know and can trust.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only way to deal with the cutting of prices is by allowing some system of retail price maintenance.  I do not want anybody to think that that means collective price fixing, which is an entirely different thing.  Retail price maintenance still retains the element of competition between suppliers.  Each supplier can state the retail price at which his product shall be retailed and he should be allowed to withhold his product from those who will not maintain that price.  The only danger that could arise would be where a number of suppliers all agreed on one price and then you would get a price ring. However, individual price maintenance is entirely different.</P>
    <P>Only when the Fair Trade Commission allows an individual to maintain his prices will the cut-price shop go. Once price maintenance is allowed, as it must be allowed, the cutting of prices will stop &mdash; and that does not mean that excessive profits will be made.  It simply means that there will be stability in industry and in commerce and that there will be a fair chance to make a reasonable profit. With reasonable profits, there is a chance for industry to put something in reserve, which is in the interest of the workers, because, without reserves, there can be no guarantee of continuity of employment.</P>
    <P>I welcome, therefore, the Bill which is before us today.  I hope it will receive detailed consideration at a later stage, but, in general principle, I regard <Col N="135" /> it as showing a very much more realistic approach to the whole matter. I would ask all Deputies and the Press to give the maximum publicity to what the Minister has said on the question of profit.  Do please appreciate that profit is not improper and that there is no evidence of excessive profit-taking in Irish industry to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that this Bill is intended to give reserve powers.  When the Bill becomes an Act, it will be put upon a shelf and taken down from the shelf only when some set of circumstances arises which, in the view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Government, requires its utilisation.  These circumstances would obviously arise if there were another Suez crisis, leading to the drying-up of supplies of essential goods, producing scarcity conditions in the shops which could be exploited to the detriment of consumers.  If that should happen, the power to deal with it will be there.  Power will also be there, which can be used at the discretion of the Minister, in the other two circumstances I mentioned&mdash; monopoly conditions which cannot be broken up by the Fair Trade Commission, and the evidence that high prices in protected industries are traceable to excessively high costs which those engaged in the industry could remedy, if they were forced to do so.</P>
      <P>I have characterised the Act, therefore, as giving reserve powers.  The next point to make clear is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to whom the powers are given, cannot himself use them arbitrarily at his own discretion, except, perhaps, in relation to the four commodities I have mentioned, namely, bread, butter, milk and sugar.  In every other case, before he can use the powers, he has to have an inquiry carried out &mdash; an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, if monopoly conditions are to be dealt with; an inquiry by a committee set up under the Act if excessive costs have to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We therefore have a picture of reserve powers usable only after an inquiry. By whom is the inquiry to be held?  The Fair Trade Commission is <Col N="136" /> there to handle a monopoly situation, but, in any other case, a committee drawn from the panel to be set up under the Bill is intended.  There is a Prices Advisory Body in existence, consisting of a number of people, some of whom are remunerated on a more or less whole-time basis, who have not at present a great deal of work to do and have not had for some time past. We do not think it desirable to have an organisation of that kind.  One reason is that it involves a much higher cost than we think is justifiable, but it is mainly because we think that an organisation of people who are remunerated for the purpose of being in existence to do a job of that kind, if they are given any independent powers, will inevitably seek to use them, even if it is only to justify their existence.</P>
    <P>That is one of the main arguments against bringing back the 1937 Act. There, you had a Prices Commission permanently functioning, the members of which were paid on a whole-time basis and who naturally poked around looking for things to inquire into.  We do not think that desirable or necessary in our circumstances.  We think there should be no inquiry at all unless there is an obvious need for it &mdash; and the decision upon the need for it will rest with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It will have to be left to his discretion to decide where an inquiry is needed.  I am sure he will be helped in that matter by questions, motions and proposals in the Dáil, if Deputies are aware of circumstances which require investigation.</P>
    <P>The idea is that there will be chosen now a panel of persons who will serve on these committees.  The idea of a panel is to avoid the Minister's having to go around looking for people to conduct an inquiry, when he thinks it necessary.  It is contemplated that a certain number of people will be asked to agree now to be available for such inquiries, when necessary.  That obviates the need for delay when an inquiry will have to be held.  It will also help to remove any possible suspicion that the members of the inquiry are being hand-picked, as it were, for the purpose of a particular <Col N="137" /> investigation.  Such a committee can hold an inquiry in public but the decision whether the inquiry will be held in public or not is taken not by the committee but by the Minister.</P>
    <P>What the Bill provides is that no part of the inquiry will be held in public, unless the Minister so directs. That is to enable a flexible procedure to be followed.  If it is more likely that a full and informative inquiry will be made by the committee hearing the evidence in private, then no authority to hold public sittings will be given. I think there will be cases where the Minister's decision will be that a public inquiry is the most effective instrument because of course a very large part of the purpose of legislation of this kind is to help to educate public opinion about matters on which it is agitated and, secondly, one of the methods of using legislation of this kind is not to bring it into actual use but to have it available to bring into use and probably the prospect of a public inquiry might in many cases be more effective in getting a situation remedied than the actual publication of a report.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I am in agreement with the views expressed by Deputy Cosgrave.  I think we are now all coming to the same point of view that whatever case there was for the elaborate machinery of price control during the war and post-war years, it no longer exists, that, in a free enterprise society, competition can be relied upon to take care of prices and the main purpose of policy must be to make sure that competition is functioning, and that we need the powers of price control only to deal with rather exceptional conditions.  We have a special requirement arising out of our own experience &mdash; to prevent any public misunderstanding of what can be done by official control of that kind.  We have learned what it is causes prices to go up.  Price rises are rarely due to circumstances that can be dealt with by Government regulations.  When costs are increasing, when inflationary forces are at work, there is no hope that rising prices can be stopped by the simple process of making Government Orders prohibiting them.  We <Col N="138" /> have learned that by our experience and I think public opinion has come to accept now the lessons of that experience.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal with this general question of price cutting.  It is a term which is used to apply to the selling of goods on a margin of profit so small that it could not sustain the costs involved and the wages which would have to be paid in running a normal trading establishment.  We hope that competition will force prices down and force people to work upon the minimum reasonable margins; but there is rather a special problem which Deputies have in mind when they use that term &ldquo;cut-price shops&rdquo;.  It may have been noticed that a request has been made to the Fair Trade Commission by certain industries which are particularly affected by that practice, to be allowed to operate retail price maintenance methods.  On previous occasions and from both sides of the House, I have expressed my strong personal view that retail price maintenance &mdash; in the sense of not cutting the price which the manufacturer thinks should be charged upon the article and a right to the manufacturer to refuse to supply the article to anyone who sells it under the price fixed by him&mdash; is not necessarily objectionable, when there are several manufacturers of the same kind of article in open competition with one another.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the procedures are by which the prices of cigarettes are fixed.  As far as I know, there is no getting together by manufacturers and, as far as I know, the same applies to certain alcoholic drinks.  There is one predominant manufacturer in each case who has to be followed by all the others.  They, apparently, cannot charge more than that predominant manufacturer chooses to charge and are usually in such a weak position that they cannot afford to charge less. Therefore, we get what is known as the &ldquo;price leader&rdquo; who is, in fact, the determinating authority when prices are arranged.  The actions of the Fair Trade Commission have been primarily directed &mdash; and should, in my view, continue to be mainly directed &mdash; towards breaking up any attempt at collective <Col N="139" /> action to fix prices.  It is the collective action that can be prejudicial to the public and lead to undue exploitation of the consumers.</P>
    <P>Where there is sufficient competition between the suppliers of any class of goods, then it seems to me there can rarely be any danger to the public arising from normal retail price maintenance procedures.  However, that is a major issue of policy which hardly arises on this Bill.  We discussed it here fairly extensively when the Restrictive Trade Practices Act was going through the House and it may arise again on certain measures which I will have to bring forward soon either to confirm or to amend Orders based upon reports of the Fair Trade Commission, and perhaps we can discuss the theory and practice of retail price maintenance more fully then.</P>

      <P>The original motion I have in front of me here reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann is of the opinion that the Government should forthwith release from custody the members of Dáil Eireann who are imprisoned and other persons imprisoned under the Offences Against the State Acts.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am not anxious for difficulties at all.  I am anxious that my office would be protected from charges which cannot be substantiated.  Let us be clear on the matter.  The first motion was exactly as I have read it.  The Deputy sought to mend his hand by making this improvement: &ldquo;That Dáil Eireann is of the opinion that the Government should forthwith release from custody the member of Dáil Eireann and other persons interned under the Offences Against the State Acts.&rdquo;  That should be a second motion and should take its place at the bottom of the list. There was an agreement that there should be a composite motion which would be placed first, and it reads as it now appears on the Order Paper.</P>

There is a note also on the bottom: &ldquo;This motion is in substitution for two related motions already circulated.&rdquo;  The motion is: &ldquo;Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the Government should forthwith release from custody the member of Dáil Eireann and other persons interned and imprisoned under the Offences Against the State Acts.&rdquo; With the evidence of this, I do not think there is any use in proceeding any further with this discussion.

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of the opinion that our permanent delegate to the U.N.O. should be instructed to seek in the Assembly of that body (a) the immediate dispatch of U.N.O. observers to the occupied part of the national territory, and (b) the setting up of the necessary machinery whereby a national plebiscite of the whole people of Ireland on the question of Partition may be held under U.N.O. auspices. &mdash; Jack McQuillan, Patrick Finucane.</P>
      <P>It can be accepted that for a long time the general public and those people who are interested in solving the problem of Partition have looked anxiously to the various Governments that have been in office here for a practical approach towards this problem.  On numerous occasions in this House suggestions have been made of a practical nature, suggestions which if adopted would, in the opinion of many, help towards solving Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have only to remind members of some of the motions which appeared on the Order Paper over the past four or five years, motions which called upon the Government and the Dáil to allow the representatives from the Six County area, from occupied Ireland, to take their rightful places in the <Col N="147" /> National Parliament.  That motion was discussed here on at least two occasions within the last four or five years. The extraordinary thing about it was that at the first time it was discussed the inter-Party Government was in office.  On the second occasion the Fianna Fáil Government was in office.</P>
    <P>Neither Government showed any welcome whatever for that approach to the problem.  Both Governments produced the same arguments against allowing in the representatives of occupied Ireland.  The argument they used was that it would lead to jealousy in internal politics down here and that it would do more harm than good.  I do not propose to go any further on that matter except to point out that many of the events which have taken place in the past two years would not have taken place if this House had seen fit to make a practical constitutional approach towards solving Partition. When that motion was discussed, the Leader of the inter-Party Government, Deputy Costello, said that, while he would disapprove of the motion, at the same time he was prepared to consider an alternative, namely, the setting up of a unity council, a council on which the representatives from the Six-County area would have an opportunity of meeting representatives of his Government to discuss matters of importance relating to occupied Ireland.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact a number of members of the Six-County Parliament, if I should so describe it, met the then Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs here in Leinster House in January, 1955.  They discussed for a period of three hours the possibility of setting up such a council, and they expressed themselves, both Government spokesmen and the spokesmen for the Six-County area, on the necessity for such an arrangement. That was in January, 1955, and that was the end of the unity council.</P>
    <P>We had a position in which the younger generation were becoming more disillusioned with regard to the political Parties.  The younger people began to feel there was no possible opportunity of seeing the Border going in their time if they were to depend on <Col N="148" /> the constitutional approach of the politicians in office.  The result of their disillusionment has been seen in no uncertain fashion.  The responsibility for the recent events in occupied Ireland, tragic though they may be, can to a great extent be laid at the door of the Governments of this country for the past 35 years.</P>
    <P>I could have put down a motion again appealing to the Government to give representation to the representatives of occupied Ireland, but I felt that we had insulted the people in that part of Ireland sufficiently without having their case once more thrown out.  I felt instead that it was up to me and other members of this House to impress upon the Government as firmly as we could the necessity of taking our place in the United Nations Assembly so that there we could plead the case for Irish unity.  Deputy Costello, the then Taoiseach, on a number of occasions in this House, confirmed to me that the Government themselves were anxious to take their place in the U.N.O.  It may be that Deputy Costello and I disagree on the reasons why we should be admitted, but I am firmly convinced that the first duty our delegates should have in the United Nations is to put forward Ireland's case for unity.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland has been accepted as a member of the United Nations, we have had a change of Government.  The former Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Cosgrave, spoke at length last year in that world assembly.  He made what was described in this House and outside as a statesmanlike speech.  I think that in the course of his criticism of various nations of the world and of their activities he did mention in a passing way that a problem did exist here in Ireland.  That is as far as he went.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that when a change of Government came, the leader of the new Government, the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, would himself go on this occasion and there use his high prestige and the esteem in which he is held abroad &mdash; and note the word &ldquo;abroad&rdquo;&mdash; for the purpose of gaining support from other freedom-loving nations for Ireland's case for unity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> In case that proposal would slip the Taoiseach's mind, I raised a question in the Dáil some six months ago and urged him to lead the Irish deputation to the United Nations.  In the course of a parliamentary reply, I was told that the team had not been selected yet for the United Nations meeting.  I still hoped that when the team would be selected, the leader of the team in this House would see fit to go himself.</P>
    <P>For reasons best known to himself, the Taoiseach decided that the Minister for External Affairs would represent him.  Many people have objected to the speech made by the Minister for External Affairs before the United Nations Assembly.  Many people at the moment are critical of the terms of the speech and some people are trying to make political capital out of his remarks.  As far as I am personally concerned, he was welcome to talk as long as he liked on the matters to which he referred, but my criticism of his action there is that he did not put Ireland's case first.  He spoke at length of the position in Algeria.  He gave the Russians and the Americans the benefit of his experience and advice in regard to the Iron Curtain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is broad enough for any Deputy to satisfy himself on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will put the Deputy up in the next Sputnik that is made.  My main concern with the Minister's action in the <Col N="150" /> United Nations Assembly is that he spent quite a considerable amount of time dealing with the position in Algeria and Hungary, in advising the Russians and the Americans to withdraw their forces from Central Europe and, having dealt with that wide sweep of country, disappearing behind the bamboo curtain to see what job he could do on China.  All this, I am sure, was very interesting to the big nations of the world.  I feel sure that the gadfly activities of the Minister for External Affairs for Ireland will galvanise into action the Governments of these great nations.  It is a tragedy, however, that while he could see what evils there were in other countries, while he could offer suggestions about the danger of world wars, and so on, he could not see his way to offering any solution or looking for any aid in the United Nations Assembly for the problem that lies on his own doorstep.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me to develop the theme of the problem that lies at his own doorstep, but surely it is not too much to expect that, when the Government have seen fit to invoke legislation of the nature of the Offences Against the State Act, in their own words: &ldquo;in order to ensure that peace is preserved within the State,&rdquo; they would use the forum of the United Nations in order to gain support from other nations that would help us to get the British out of the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>I think all Deputies, whether they belong to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, or are Independents, are in agreement with me.  If the motion is left to the individual Deputy and his conscience, there is no doubt as to the way he will vote.  I should like to ask at this stage that the Whips should be left off and that each Deputy should be allowed to make his own decision on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for External Affairs takes part in this debate, I know that he will state that the Government intend, in their own time and when the opportunity presents itself, to bring Ireland's case before the United Nations.  At least, that is the text of the remarks he made to a group of Pressmen in Boston three or four days after delivering his major speech <Col N="151" /> in the United Nations Assembly.  It is indeed a pity that the Minister had to wait until he went to Boston and meet the Pressmen to make his case against the British occupation of the Six Counties.  When he was cross-examined by the Pressmen in Boston he said that as far as Ireland was concerned he was hoping the question of a plebiscite would be considered and that Ireland's proposition on that would be brought in due course before the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister means by &ldquo;in due course&rdquo;.  All the nations of the world that are members of the U.N.O. that have internal problems or problems arising from occupation forces are anxious to use the machinery of the United Nations to right their wrongs, and I do not think that it would be unfair to suggest that Ireland should not take second place to any nation when she wants to have her case heard.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that, the mentality displayed by certain Deputies in this House should be tolerated, namely, that we should not be a sore thumb in the United Nations Assembly.  It is the nations that have shown themselves to be sore thumbs that have got results.  The nations that are members of U.N.O. have enough problems on their minds without dealing with the Irish problem if they can afford to shelve or evade it.  There is no use in approaching a representative of another country and saying: &ldquo;I should like to tell you all about our problem.&rdquo; He may listen kindly but that is as far as he is prepared to go unless we are prepared to bring the matter on to the floor of the House.  Many countries, especially India, are very anxious to help Ireland in its problem.  Have we sought the aid of India?</P>
    <P>We are spending about £80,000 a year in keeping a permanent delegate and staff in U.N.O.  I do not know what we spend on the annual Government delegation.  There should be some return for the money that is spent.  Surely we have more practical things in mind, as far as U.N.O. is concerned, than advising other countries about how to run their affairs.  If <Col N="152" /> our representatives continue to pursue the line that they have adopted over the last two years they will get little or no heed in years to come from the members of U.N.O.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is now ripe for a representative group such as would be selected from the U.N.O. to examine thoroughly the condition of affairs in occupied Ireland.  We all know that at the moment the ordinary laws are suspended there.  We know that internment without trial is an everyday occurrence.  We know that that artificial Border is manned day and night by British troops, by B Specials and by the regular police units of the Six Counties.  We know that the Nationalist population there, which has always unswervingly held to the idea of a united Ireland, are hounded, arrested, searched and have no means of redress.  We know that in public life gerrymandering has deprived the Nationalist population of its due share of control in local government and other spheres.  We know that in all aspects of government the Nationalist population is getting anything but a fair share.  Surely it is not unfair to suggest, then, that, under the auspices of the U.N.O., a group of trained observers should be brought into the Six Counties to examine as neutral persons the conditions which obtain there at the moment.  In addition and at the same time our permanent delegate to the United Nations should seek the necessary machinery for the holding of a plebiscite of all Ireland.  Now it is very important at this stage that we emphasise that it is not a plebiscite of occupied Ireland but a plebiscite of all Ireland on this question of Partition.</P>
    <P>From what I know of our permanent delegate in the United Nations, I cannot think of an abler individual, a more capable man, to put Ireland's case lucidly, clearly and effectively; and I have the utmost confidence that if our permanent delegate is instructed on the lines I have suggested in this motion, he will be successful in obtaining support from other nations for the two parts of this motion, namely, the dispatching of U.N.O. observers to the occupied part of Ireland and, secondly, <Col N="153" /> the setting up of machinery whereby a national plebiscite of the whole people of Ireland on the question of Partition will be held under U.N.O. auspices.  I feel that if the Government move at this stage, it will help to lessen tension in this part of Ireland.  I feel that if the youth see that our Government is really serious in its approach to this problem of ending Partition, we may be able to channel into constitutional avenues their energy and enthusiasm to-day.</P>
    <P>The illness which affects the people, the young people, to-day is an illness which shows itself in cynicism about public life, in distrust towards politicians, in a feeling of hopelessness, that various Governments can do nothing to improve conditions economically, socially and so forth.  That cynicism can be wiped out if the Government at this stage give a lead, a practical lead, on the question of ending Partition.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether other Deputies have better propositions in mind. If they have, then I hope they will let us hear them in the course of this debate.  This one which I have here is not new in the sense that it was only thought out recently.  Many very responsible people outside this House have given considerable thought and time to this problem.  There are thinking people, outside this House, who, as peaceful citizens, with a constitutional approach to all problems, deplore the use of force for the solution of partition, but they are the very people who are anxious that the Government of the country should give the lead on a constitutional line.</P>
    <P>It is a tragic thing to say that over the past 35 years no real effort on constitutional lines was made to end Partition.  I make that statement and if Deputies do not like it, they have an opportunity here in this House on this debate, and I would like them to challenge that statement of mine and contradict it, if they have evidence to the contrary.  I am speaking now from the point of view of the younger people.  I know that men and women in Ireland who are younger than I am, a good deal younger, do not believe for a moment that any effort was made by a Government to solve Partition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> It is a waste of time for any politician in this House, from the most senior down to the most junior, to try to convince the youth to-day that any practical step has been taken towards solving Partition.  When that is the case, surely it behoves this House to give some proof and some evidence of sincerity?  One immediate step that can be taken is unanimity in this House in support of this motion.</P>
    <P>There are many things that I could say in criticism of the various Governments here, on their lack of a practical approach over the past 35 years.  I am not going to say them.  I am trying to point out the feelings of the young people to-day, and any Deputy &mdash; to put it bluntly &mdash; who has his ear to the ground, realises that what I am saying is perfectly true.  The tragedy of it at the moment and for the past few years has been that the youth who were so anxious to achieve the freedom of this country and willing to sacrifice their lives in the effort to achieve freedom, have become so disillusioned that they are getting out of the country as fast as they can.</P>
    <P>Many of the evils apparent in Ireland to-day stem from Partition.  There are many people in Ireland, and many Irishmen outside Ireland who seem depressed and who have the feeling that they have lost confidence in the nation. It is due in great measure to a feeling of frustration which has come about as a result of the division of this country.</P>
    <P>That feeling of frustration and hopelessness is common to both parts.  Let it not be thought for a moment that we have a monopoly of the feeling of hopelessness. It is quite apparent in the Six Counties, too.  The figures of emigration, the numbers that stream through this part of Ireland on their way to Cork, is a proof that the same feeling is apparent there.  Ireland as it stands to-day, whether one looks at it from the point of view of the Orangeman or from the point of view down here of the Nationalist, is like a bird with one wing.  I do not care which wing you belong to &mdash; that bird will not fly on one wing, that bird cannot soar into the heavens or have a feeling of happiness in life, nor can it fulfil its <Col N="155" /> purpose properly in life, unless it has two wings.  The two wings of Ireland have been severed, and it is up to us on this side to take every possible step we can to get this country buoyant, to get a pride in it once more, to get a feeling in the people that there is a possibility, constitutionally, of bringing the whole of Ireland under the one Flag and under the one Government. If we sit here with a feeling of hopelessness and think it might be dangerous to do this or that, that it might be dangerous to let in representatives of the Six Counties, that if we go to the United Nations, they may say we are &ldquo;a sore thumb&rdquo;, that we had better sit at home, then we are setting the example of hopelessness in this House.</P>
    <P>No matter what may be said, the majority of our people still look to their elected representatives for guidance in matters appertaining to the welfare of the nation.  If they do not get that guidance and leadership here, they will turn for it elsewhere and, if they do, then the members of this House can blame only themselves.  I am asking Deputies to forget Party politics and to support this motion unanimously.  Remember, this debate will be read many miles away from here and, if we want to bring our case with dignity and present a united front in the United Nations, we shall have to show that Dáil Eireann is behind the idea of observers in the occupied part of our territory and of a plebiscite amongst our people.  I appeal to Deputies, irrespective of Party affiliations, to support this motion unanimously. If they show by their action here that they are in agreement with taking this first constitutional step, I have no doubt that it will help to relieve the tension that exists throughout the country at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  We in the Labour Party do not have to change our views because our views to-day are the views we have always expressed in relation to this subject. <Col N="156" /> I am more than amazed, in view of the statement made by Deputy McQuillan, that the Minister has not seen fit to avail of his opportunity to speak in this debate.  I would consider it more important to listen to his views, since they would be the views of his Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan has outlined the viewpoint he holds in relation to a possible solution of this problem. Other people may hold different views. Solving the problem of Partition would be a major achievement in our political growth and it would mean more to us than anything we can ever dream of achieving.  It would mean much more to some of us than the speeches made by our Minister for External Affairs offering solutions for the economic and military problems of Europe and Asia. We have been tinkering with this problem too long.  The policy over the past 30 years seems to have been to say as little as possible and to do even less &mdash; to do nothing at all, in fact.  We give full credit to those who played a noble part in the liberation of the Twenty-Six Counties.  The tragedy is that too many of those who played their part seem to be content now to live on the glories of the past.  They forget that succeeding generations are not satisfied with merely hearing a tedious repetition of the history of the past.  They are looking to the future. Just as their fathers before them were not content to bow their heads to an ascendancy, so the young boys and girls of to-day are not content to live under foreign domination.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on all of us to tackle this problem in a really serious manner.  Our approach will have to be more direct than it has been in the past.  I do not wish to say anything which might make a difficult situation more difficult still for some of our young Irishmen who are languishing in jails, both North and South, without any hope of reward.  So long as our approach remains what it is at the moment, so long shall we have the problem of Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped, like all the members of the Labour Party, that we would be able to avail of the platform offered by our membership of U.N.O. to bring before those who seem so anxious to <Col N="157" /> solve the problems of other partitioned countries the fact that we have a Partition problem here.  Many of these people seem to forget that we have that problem.  Surely the Government could instruct our permanent representative in the United Nations to expose to the world a policy which is keeping in subjection our people in the Six Counties.  The policy adopted here of loving one's enemy almost to extremes is not bearing fruit, and, in the long run, it will not prove of advantage to democratic government here.</P>

      <P>Those are the people who are dominant in the political situation of the Six Counties.  I would say the time has come for the coordinated efforts of all Parties to end the abomination of Partition in this country.  It is about time that a democratic form of Government was appointed to look after the interests of all our national territories.  It is a crying shame to see so many of our young people, from Cork and elsewhere, suffering in internment camps because of this abomination of Partition. It is about time that all our people realised that, though we may have Party ties, though we may redouble our efforts to secure better social conditions and a better economic life for our people here, we must also tackle this problem of Partition in an effective way.  We must, in the very near future, end this problem which has been the ruination of the country during the past generation.  I believe that the more pressure we can put through organisations like the U.N.O. the nearer we will get to having this problem solved so that all Irishmen living in our national territory will have the same measure of political freedom as we enjoy in the South.</P>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan, I am afraid, did not address himself to the actual terms of the motion.  He did go over the history of certain resolutions that were tabled here in the past relating to Partition and to various efforts that were made in relation to that problem.  There is no necessity to urge the members of this Assembly to declare themselves against Partition or to declare their determination to see its end.  In this House we are all agreed that Partition is a crime against the Irish people, that it is a wrong that must be undone and that it is against the whole trend of thought in the democratic world at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to have peace in the world, true peace, it must be based on law and on justice.  Peoples, whether they be small or large, must have allowed to them the right to determine their own future.  We have, in the past year or two, seen how Britain has demanded that Germany should be reunited. We hope that the German people will be reunited before long. The British Prime Minister, in his communications to the Russians, declared that it was in the British interest that Germany should be reunited. He rejected the Russian plea <Col N="159" /> that German reunification should depend upon the East German Government and the West German Government coming together and agreeing upon the terms upon which Germany should be reunited.</P>
    <P>All we want from Britain for Ireland is what Britain demanded of Russia for Germany.  We hold that the Irish people, the ancient Irish nation, is the unit for self-determination and that it was wrong that Britain should have selected six of the north-eastern counties to be cut off and held for herself. We have always rejected the idea that there should be self-determination for six of the Irish counties and self-determination denied to the 32 counties of which Ireland consists and which have been a unit from ancient times.</P>
    <P>We trust that the considerations which brought Britain to reject the Russian plea that German unity should depend upon the conjunction of wills of the East German Government and the West German Government will bring them, some day, to admit that the unity of Ireland should depend, as the unity of Germany should, upon the free will of the whole people of Ireland expressed in a plebiscite or general election.  It is a fact, as Deputy McQuillan said, that there are young men, and some not so young, who have arrogated to themselves the right to settle this question by force of arms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not the first to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not, unfortunately, and notwithstanding what we may say here or how much we may regret it, they will not, perhaps, be the last, unless good sense prevails.  The reason they have taken up arms, despite the wishes of the vast majority of the people here, is that the propaganda made by Deputy McQuillan and others has been rendered effective by the neglect of the British people and the British Government to accept in our regard what they demand for Germany. It is wrong for Deputy McQuillan, or anybody else, to put the blame on this Government or any other Irish Government. The people responsible are the <Col N="160" /> British Government.  It is they who brought it into being; it is they who are keeping it in being.  It is they who show by their actions that they regard it as in the British interest to keep Ireland divided just as they declared it to be their interest that Germany should be reunited.</P>
      <P>It is wrong for Deputy McQuillan and others to be placing the responsibility for Partition on the lack of industrial or agricultural development in these 26 counties.  There is also a great lack of development in the Six Counties which would maintain the population there in full employment, or reasonably full employment.  There are as many people, proportionately, unemployed in the Six Counties as there are here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly agree.  If we had been reunited, if this country had got freedom 20 or 30 years ago, we would have had this task &mdash; to keep pace with other highly industrialised countries.  Divided, however, both sections suffered and suffer as they are suffering to-day.  There are great efforts being made in Europe and other places to get large free trade units, or areas, and here this small country has been divided.  The result has been that it has rendered it more difficult for industry in both sections to have that increased market that Irish unity would give and which would make for the prosperity of their industries.  It is wrong to decry, however, and it gives a wrong impression to the people in the Six Counties to decry, the efforts that have been made there, and the success that has been achieved in industrial and other production.  It is only foolishness to expect, and it is only the people who are foolish who will expect, the same rate of development here as in other countries. Twenty years ago we were practically altogether an agricultural community. We had practically no industry and we found ourselves competing, in the start of new industries, with countries that were highly developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had got freedom for the whole of the country back in the 19th century, <Col N="161" /> it would have been easy for us to keep pace with the developments in other countries.  In those years, the increase in production throughout the world was at a very small rate.  By the 1920s, it had got up to 3 per cent. per annum, but under the pressure of war and the high mechanisation that the war necessitated, some of the highly industrialised countries were able to reach an increase 10, 20 and even 25 per cent per annum.  We have, in certain good years, reached the 3 per cent which the United States of America reached in the 1920s.  If we preach the despair and the hopelessness which came in every other sentence of Deputy McQuillan's speech, we will not have the confidence and the determination to carry on until Partition is finished, however short or however long it may be.  This hopeless type of approach of Deputy McQuillan, that we must get it by this date or another date, is completely and absolutely wrong.  We must set no date by which we must end Partition or surrender. We must determine and say to Britain, and other people, that no matter how long it takes, it will be ended some day and that we will never as a people rest content until it is ended.  We have a lot of work to do in this part of the country to increase our resources and to get our production going at a rate that will give all our people a rising standard of living.  But the people in the Six Counties have an equally hard task.  They must recognise that if the two parts of the country were together, it would be for our mutual benefit.</P>
    <P>The question embodied in this motion is whether we should raise this matter at the United Nations and call for a team of United Nations observers to come to the Six Counties and call for the setting-up of a national plebiscite for the whole of Ireland.  In making this a plea for that, Deputy McQuillan went as near as he could to saying that I had not mentioned Partition at the United Nations, that I had shown no interest in the question of Partition until I went to Boston.</P>
    <P>In the speech in the United Nations, I referred to the case of Ireland.  I pleaded for the acceptance of the principle <Col N="162" /> of self-determination for all countries in the Irish situation that were divided or that were still altogether occupied.  We could go to the United Nations and, every time we rise in that Assembly, speak about nothing but our own troubles.  However, we would have, I am afraid, about as much effect on the general policy of that Assembly as a Deputy in this House who speaks about nothing only the smaller cases in his own constituency.  If we want people to take a general interest in the policy that would serve our interests, in common with the interests of mankind, we must be prepared to take an interest in the affairs and troubles of other countries that are equally important to us as they are to them, and are equally important in the effort to get established a general rule of law based on justice.  In speaking at one of the debates in the United Nations, I said this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Like many of our fellow-members here, we are a young State but a people with a proud and ancient history. Our own outstanding national problem, the division of our country, must eventually be solved by the practical application of the principles of the charter and specifically the principle of self-determination of peoples.  We have never ceased to demand the application of that principle in our own as well as in other cases and from it we have nothing to fear.  Indeed, it would be useless to deny that in joining this Organisation the hope that our action might advance the attainment of this end was present in our minds.  It is as such a country that we speak here to-day in the hope that our profound conviction, born of long experience of tragic frustration, may carry weight with this Assembly.</P>
    <P>The principle of self-determination of peoples ought, we believe, to be the great master-principle by which this Assembly should be guided in its quest for a just and peaceful world order.  That principle holds, for example, the key to the solution of the problem of German reunification, of the Cyprus question and also of one of the most acute and <Col N="163" /> urgent of the contemporary conflicts which threaten world peace, the conflict in Algeria.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are, as Deputies are aware, many cases throughout the world where a solution to the problems of certain powers has been sought through the partition of smaller and weaker countries.  We have tried to show, whenever we got an opportunity of discussing these questions, that in fact it is no solution, that it is not only unjust but that in present circumstances it is most unwise.  We have tried to show that in modern circumstances the &ldquo;brush fire&rdquo; idea, the limited war idea, is out of date and that to have revolutionary situations against occupying Powers may affect not only the country in which these revolutionary situations are but affect their neighbours, and that to expect that they can be limited or smothered is quite foolish&mdash;that the idea of the limited war, trusting that it will not spread, is as foolish as to allow a small boy to let off squibs in a powder magazine.</P>
    <P>We have pleaded in private and in public that if we are to avoid total war, we must be prepared to make total peace based on law and justice; that we need not expect miracles but that we have to do from day to day and <Col N="164" /> from year to year and from one United Nations session to another what is to our hand, and tackle the problems that come up for discussion.</P>
    <P>Every thinking person in the world is aware of the danger which mankind faces at the present time.  The world had never to face a similar danger.  In times gone by, if war started, even between larger Powers, people could reasonably hope that more would survive than would be killed in the process of that war, but we have reached the stage with modern weapons when nobody knows if anybody would survive. It is up to us, therefore, to try to relieve all situations that cause trouble, situations that can be used by one big Power against another to stir up trouble in each area.  It is up to us to use the interval before war becomes inevitable to settle questions such as the Partition of Ireland, such as the problem of German reunification, such as the situation in Algeria, such as the situation in Korea and other situations of that kind.</P>
