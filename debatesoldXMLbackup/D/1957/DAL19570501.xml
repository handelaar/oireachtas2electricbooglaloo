    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Unemployment in Dublin.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy" hpid="Mr. J. Murphy Mr. J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what immediate measures the Government proposes to put into operation in order to ease the existing heavy unemployment in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Rúnaí Parlaiminte an Taoisigh (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (thar ceann an Taoisigh) Rúnaí Parlaiminte an Taoisigh (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (thar ceann an Taoisigh)">
      <NameTxt>Rúnaí Parlaiminte an Taoisigh (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (thar ceann an Taoisigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming into office, the Government have been giving the most anxious consideration to the grave problem of unemployment&mdash;and that, not in Dublin merely, but in the State as a whole.  The only schemes of real advantage, of course, are those which would develop the economy, increase the opportunities of continuous employment or create assets of lasting value.</P>
      <P>In the consideration of the Budget, which is to be introduced next week, the Government have kept the unemployment situation constantly in mind. The difficulties of the task are, however, immense&mdash;increased by the present shortage of capital and the fact that certain constructional works which gave large-scale employment in the past have been completed or are quickly approaching completion.  I can only assure the Deputy that the search for what can effectively be done is being earnestly pursued.</P>
      <P>We hope that the general stimulus given by such measures as the change in regard to the Special Import Levies will lessen the difficulties of the task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> The seasonal reduction in the unemployment figures is, this year, relatively rapid and the general trend is not unhopeful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy" hpid="Mr. J. Murphy Mr. J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is still widespread unemployment in the building industry, would the Taoiseach consider taking more drastic measures to bring about a revival of house building?  In Dublin City, we have no concert hall, no proper Houses of Parliament and we need more modern municipal buildings. The country needs these things very badly and they would give much-needed  employment to building workers.  I speak, Sir, with a sense of urgency which springs from looking at unfortunate men trying to survive in present conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Deputy in his approach, but there is the difficulty that, with the shortage of capital at the present moment, it would be extremely difficult to engage in work such as the Deputy has suggested. The capital that is there has, in the main, to be directed towards productive purposes and I am afraid that the projects indicated, while they would undoubtedly help to give employment, would do so at very great cost and would not be immediately productive.</P>
      <P>I am sure every Deputy in the House realises that we are really in an emergency situation from an economic point of view and that relief measures that would be possible at other times are at the present time simply not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Dublin citizens have been laid off recently in the port by the Port and Docks authority, apparently as a result of financial difficulties?  Will the Taoiseach indicate that this matter will receive early attention, particularly in view of the fact that there are many worthwhile schemes for development of the port and docks which can be of benefit to the city and the country, if development schemes on hands, which need mainly financial assistance, were proceeded with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware there is one project coming to an end and that <Col N="447" /> there is another under active consideration. Anything that can be done to provide necessary finances&mdash; which is, of course, the root of the whole trouble&mdash;for projects of that sort, will be done.  Where works were likely to be carried out at a later date, we are trying to advance the carrying-out of these works in order to provide necessary employment.  I have not the precise details to give Deputies, but I know that such a scheme exists with regard to the Port and Docks Board, and I can only assure the House that we regard this of fundamental importance, but unfortunately &ldquo;let it be done&rdquo; is not sufficient.  If we had the power of getting things done by fiat it would be done as, indeed, I am sure, it would have been done by others previously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach how the agreement in relation to the settlement of the boundary between the Twenty-Six and the Six Counties was ratified by this State; whether the Government has taken or proposes to take steps to repudiate such agreement; and whether he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the agreement referred to in the Deputy's question is that included in an instrument described as an &ldquo;Agreement amending and supplementing the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo;, 1925.  The Treaty (Confirmation of Amending Agreement) Act, 1925, purported to confirm this instrument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the instrument purported to determine a boundary between two parts of Ireland, it has long since been repudiated by the declaration, in Article 2 of the Constitution, that &ldquo;The National territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its <Col N="448" /> islands and the territorial seas&rdquo;.  Any formal action specifically repudiating the articles of the instrument which concern Partition is unnecessary and would seem to give to those articles a significance which they do not, in fact, possess.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Position of Attorney-General.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (1) the salary and other emoluments of the Attorney-General; (2) whether the said office is part-time or whole-time, and if part-time, the number of hours per day or per week that the Attorney-General is required to devote to its duties; and (3) the names and period of office of persons who have held the office of Attorney-General since the establishment of the State and who (a) carried on their practice at the bar during their term of office, and (b) carried out the duties of the office on a full-time basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>The salary of the Attorney-General is £3,000 a year. Fees payable to him in virtue of his office, such as those for Letters Patent and fiats, are surrendered to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Attorney-General is at liberty to engage in such private practice as may be compatible with the full and proper discharge of the duties of his office.</P>
      <P>There are no official records which would enable me to give a precise answer to the third part of the question. With some of the Attorneys-General, there was an understanding not to engage in private practice; with others, there was no such understanding. In the latter cases, there is no information as to whether or to what extent the liberty to practice was availed of&mdash;or, indeed, could be availed of, since the volume of official business has varied considerably from time to time and at certain periods was very heavy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the present holder of this office, when he held the office formerly, did so on a full-time basis and did not utilise his part-time in private practice?  Will the Taoiseach now state why that form of procedure has been departed from? We now have the procedure where the Attorney-General is paid £3,000 and at <Col N="449" /> the same time he is in a position to make another £3,000 or £4,000 a year in private practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about figures.  I am not responsible for the figures stated by the Deputy.  As regards the main part of the question, the position is this.  First of all, there are good reasons why an Attorney-General should be allowed to practise. He is head of the profession and the judges from time to time have intimated that they would wish to see the Attorney-General practise in the courts.  Also in that connection an Attorney-General sometimes has, like others who leave their work to take up a public appointment, to go back and try to resume this work.  It is not fair to ask a person to go out of practice completely.  However, notwithstanding these reasons, which I fully appreciate, I tried to get a rule followed which would mean that the Attorneys would not engage in private practice.  That rule, however, was not followed by succeeding Governments and I felt it would not be right that it should appear that an Attorney-General under our Government should have an inferior status to that of other Attorneys-General, but the whole question as to whether an Attorney-General should or should not engage in private practice is an open one.  I had great difficulty in making up my mind originally.  I did do so, however, and I got an understanding with a number of Attorneys-General that they would not engage in private practice. But one has to get, or should try to get, the best lawyer one can have for this post.  If you want to get the best, you have to see that too big a sacrifice is not expected from him in leaving his position as an active practising lawyer and going into State employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two wrongs do not make a right.  It is immaterial whether or not another Government set up this precedent.  Surely the fact that the State sees fit to pay an allowance of £3,000 per year shows that the State considers that that, in itself, should be sufficient in order to keep the particular occupant in reasonable comfort <Col N="450" /> during his term of office?  Do not the same reasons apply then with regard to Cabinet Ministers and others who would normally practise at the Bar? They have to give up practice when they take a Cabinet post and why should not the same procedure be adopted in the case of the Attorney-General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is equally true of Cabinet Ministers.  Very often, it would be possible to get a person you would like to be a member of the Cabinet, but you cannot get that person because of the sacrifice that would be demanded from him if he were to enter the Cabinet.  Some are prepared to do that for public and other reasons but, generally, if you want a particular person, you must try to see that the sacrifice that is demanded is not too great.  As regards one Government and another, the only question is that there must be uniform practice.  Otherwise, you will have it suggested that one person is of inferior status to that of another.  As regards which is the right principle to adopt, the inclusion or exclusion of private practice, the question can be argued very strongly on both sides.  I might take one view and the head of another Government another view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state (1) the number of people who received blue cards under the Health Act, 1953, in 1955/56; (2) the average time which elapses between the application for and the receipt of blue cards (a) in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Water-ford,  and (b) in rural areas; and (3) the number of people who received medical attention under the red ticket system in each of the five years prior to the institution of the blue card scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first part of the question, I have not the precise information requested by the Deputy but the number of medical cards issued between 1st August, 1954, when the relevant regulations came into operation, and 29th February, 1956, was 174,237 covering 584,454 persons.</P>
      <P>The information requested in the second part of the question is not available in my Department and, in order to obtain it, it would be necessary to inquire as to the position from every health authority concerned. Each of these authorities would have to extract all recently decided applications from their records and compute the time lag between the date of application and the date of decision in order to ascertain the average.  This would involve an expenditure of time and labour in the offices of every health authority which, in my view, would not be justified.  If, however, the Deputy has reason to believe that there is an unreasonable time lag in particular areas, and furnishes me with particulars, I shall be glad to investigate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the third part of the question, the only information available in my Department in regard to the number of persons who received medical assistance under the former system is that contained in returns furnished by district medical officers of new cases attended on &ldquo;dispensary&rdquo; or &ldquo;visiting&rdquo; tickets in each half-year.  The Deputy will probably be aware that experience has shown that in many cases these returns were <Col N="457" /> grossly inaccurate.  They have now been discontinued.  In these circumstances, it would be futile to attempt to extract the information required from the source mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state the average weekly cost to local authorities of maintenance, at subsistence level, of old age pensioners or other destitute persons in county homes for the years 1950 to 1956, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the implication in the question that old age pensioners are destitute persons. Many of them have means other than their pensions and in any case if they satisfy certain conditions they are entitled to an income in the form of an old age pension, which places them outside the category of destitute persons who are normally regarded as <Col N="458" /> being persons without means or without the expectation of means.</P>
      <P>I am not clear as to what the Deputy means by maintenance at subsistence level.  In any case, separate particulars are not available of the actual cost of maintenance of the different categories of persons, including old age pensioners, maintained in county homes.</P>
      <P>The average weekly cost of the maintenance of all persons in County Homes according to returns furnished by health authorities for the years 1950/51 to 1955/56 was as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the primary responsibility rests with the health authorities concerned.  The schools dental service generally, including the equipment provided, has been improved considerably in recent years but I understand that in some areas the position is still not satisfactory. In such cases, as opportunity offered, steps have been taken to bring about an improvement and this process is continuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953 requires a health authority to provide institutional services for (a) persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952; and (b) adult persons whose yearly means are less than £600.  It is presumed that practically all soldiers are in one or other of these two categories.  No exception from the provision of Section 15 has been made in the case of Army personnel and, consequently, health authorities would appear to be liable for the provision of institutional and specialist services for such personnel under the section mentioned to the same extent as they are responsible for making available such services for other members of the community in the corresponding categories.  The cost of providing such services will be met in the same manner as the cost of other services provided under the section in question.</P>

      <P>Does that mean that, in the case of County Kildare, which maintains three military establishments at the Curragh Camp, Kildare and Naas, the ratepayers of the county <Col N="461" /> will be liable to bear a substantial proportion of the cost of providing this treatment, although the personnel for whom they are providing the treatment, are a personnel who serve not only the county alone but the entire country?  Is it proposed that the Department of Defence which, up to now, met these charges will in future be exempt from paying charges peculiar to the maintenance of health standards for Army personnel?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>County Kildare is in no different position from that of any other county in regard to providing these services for those who live in County Kildare.  If, however, the Deputy's view is that the maintenance of Curragh Camp imposes an undue burden on the County of Kildare, perhaps he will put down a question asking the Minister for Defence whether he is prepared to transfer Curragh Camp to some other county.</P>

      <P>The answer I have got from the Minister is typical of the irresponsibility he displays and I hope that Deputy Dooley will now take note of the way in which the ratepayers in County Kildare will be treated by the new Minister for Health.  I am putting to the Minister this consideration: does he think it fair that a substantial portion of the Army, that is, the portion quartered on three barracks&mdash; the Curragh, one of the largest military establishments in the country, Kildare barracks and Naas barracks&mdash;should become a liability on the ratepayers in County Kildare, when, in fact, the services which they render to the community are services given to other counties just as generously as they are given to Kildare?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for the establishment of a bacon factory in the Bandon area have been put before my Department on various occasions over the years.  It has been made clear that the necessary operating licence would be forthcoming on the provision by the promoters concerned of satisfactory premises and facilities for the operation of the business.</P>
      <P>I should, perhaps, point out that, taking the country as a whole, the present capacity of pig slaughtering premises has been adequate for the numbers hitherto available and likely to be available in the foreseeable future.  This aspect of the matter would need to be carefully considered by any interests contemplating the establishment of a new bacon factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that many proposals have been made to establish bacon factories in that area by various people.  I looked up the history of this.  Nobody has been refused a licence if he has a suitable premises and fulfils all the conditions.  I would like, however, to warn the Deputy that if anybody is thinking of entering into this business now, the capacity for killing pigs and curing bacon is already more than adequate to deal with all the pigs available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate nobody has been refused a licence.

      <P>As regards the first part of the Deputy's question, I am not aware that the system of ground limestone distribution in the Crookstown district, County Cork, is unsatisfactory. Under the ground limestone transport subsidy scheme, the subsidy covers the cost of delivery of ground limestone in County Cork to the purchaser's premises from any plant within a radius of 35 miles.  If delivery is effected from a plant outside this radius, the extra cost of transport over 35 miles must be met by the purchaser or the supplier except where the nearest plant to the purchaser is over 35 miles.</P>

In addition the universities and secondary schools award a number of entrance scholarships but I have no information as to the exact number of such scholarships; (3) I am not in a position to furnish the information which the Deputy requires in regard to the percentage of children who obtain no further education beyond the primary school level but an estimate prepared in relation to the 1954-55 school year showed that of children in 14-15 age group 60.9 per cent. were in wholetime attendance at recognised schools; the corresponding figure for the 15-16 age group was 47.5 per cent.; (4) (a) the total number of national schools on 30th June, 1956, was 4,871; (b) the number in which either rural science or nature study was taught was 173.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state (1) the total number of national schools which require replacement because they are insanitary, unhygienic and unfit for human occupation or otherwise medically condemned, and of that number, the number so classed in (a) 1947, (b) 1951, (c) 1953 and (d) 1956; and (2) at the present rate of replacement of such schools, how long it will be before suitable schools are provided where they are badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at present <Col N="480" /> 843 national schools which, it is considered, should be replaced by new schools.  Schools considered to be in need of replacement are not classified in categories indicating the grounds on which they are regarded as unsuitable. Of those at present listed for replacement there is, regrettably, a number in which conditions are such that new schools are required as a matter of great urgency.  In the case of a considerable number of schools which it is proposed to replace, the need for new schools is, however, comparatively non-urgent.</P>
      <P>Grants have been sanctioned by my Department for the erection of new buildings in 158 of these cases.  In 1953 there were 650 cases of schools requiring replacement and grants for new schools had been sanctioned in 70 of these cases.  The figure in 1956 was 822, including 139 in which grants for new schools had been sanctioned.  I regret that I am not in a position to give figures for 1947 and 1951, as the records of the Department are not in such a form as would make it possible to compile the information.</P>
      <P>There are a number of factors, financial and other, which make it impossible for me to answer precisely the second part of the Deputy's question, and I am unable to say when the position will be reached when new schools will have been provided in all the cases in which they are needed.  All I can say is that every effort is being made, and will continue to be made, to achieve that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I hear the Minister aright that the figure for replacements in 1956 was greater than that for 1953?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a higher figure. It became higher by reason of an examination made by the Department's inspectors.  One hundred and forty cases arose as a result of these examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be fair to say that the Department are not only unable to keep up with necessary repairs and replacements but that they are falling badly behind, and while the Minister referred to financial and other considerations, surely the considerations <Col N="481" /> of children's health and of teachers' working conditions should weigh much more with the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>Because of financial and other reasons it is not feasible to formulate a definite plan to provide for the erection of a particular number of schools annually over the next five years.  As I have informed the Deputy in reply to his earlier question to-day, everything possible is being done and will continue to be done to achieve the maximum output of new schools which circumstances will permit.</P>

    <P>An líon dalta atá ag freastal ar meán-scoileanna, tá sé ag dul i méid i gcónaí leis.  Tríocha míle, naoi gcéad a seasca is seisear a bhí ann sa bhliain 1932-33 agus 61,974 a bhí ann i 1956-57. Lena rá ar shlí eile, le 25 bliana anuas, tá an líon dalta atá ins na meán-scoileanna tar éis dúbailt, agus tá 2,668 de bhreis ann i mbliana ar an mbliain seo caite.  Ceithre chéad agus ochtó is a h-aon de mheán-scoileanna atá ann i mbliana, an áit ná raibh ann ach 311 cúig bliana is fiche ó shoin. Ar na 481 de mheán-scoileanna san, tá an teagasc á thabhairt tré Ghaeilge go h-iomlán nó i bpáirt i 231 acu, agus ar an 231, tá 85 ina bhfuil an teagasc a thabhairt tré Ghaeilge ar fad.</P>
    <P>Sé lion múinteoirí atá ag tarraing breis-thuarastail i 1956-57 ná 2,713, sé sin, 113 níos mó ná mar bhí ann sa bhliain roimhe sin.

I dtaobh na scrúduithe san, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil fúm fiosrúchán a dhéanamh féachaint an bhféadfaí béal-scrúdú a bheith mar chuid de scrúduithe na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ainneoin na méadaithe sin go léir, tabharfar fé ndeara go bhfuil an meastachán iomlán don mheán-oideachas, <Col N="497" /> sé sin, £1,814,700, go bhfuil sé anuas de £5,410 ar Mheastachán na bliana so caite.  Sé is cúis leis sin ná go bhfuil an soláthar do na deontais caipitíochta bunaithe ar dheich fén gcéad de laghdú a dhéanamh ar na gnáth-rátaí.  Bhí an gearradh san fé bhreithniú agam ach i ngeall ar deacrachtaí i gcúrsaí Airgeadais bheith ag leanúint mar atá, acht is oth liom nach féidir an gearradh a thabhairt ar ais sa bhliain reatha.

Ní miste a lua i dtaobh na n-ardaithe sin gurb é atá iontu den chuid is mó ná cúiteamh in ardú sa chostas maireach-tála amhail mar a fuair seirbhísigh phoiblí eile ón gcéad lá de mhí Shamhna, 1955.  I mí Eanáir seo caite do ghlac an Rialtas a bhí ann ins an am leis an moladh úd ó Bhord na hEadrána ach do shocraíodar ar gan é a chur i bhfeidhm go dtí go mbeadh soláthar déanta dó i gCáin-Fhaisnéis na bliana so.  Sin é an fáth ná fuil an tsuim úd do na meán-mhúinteoirí luaite i Leabhar an Mheastacháin.  An Rialtas so, tar éis dóibh teacht ann, do dheineadar an scéal do bhreithniú agus do shocraíodar ar éifeacht a thabhairt don mholadh ina iomlán.  Táthar chun soláthar a dhéanamh dá réir sa Cháin-Fhaisnéis agus íocfar an méadú tuarastail sin comh luath is is féidir tar éis an Meastachán breise is gá ina chóir a rith.</P>

    <P>Teaspáineann an Bhóta so £11,930 de laghdú glan ar an Bhóta £196,040&mdash; don bhliain so caite.  Sé is cúis leis an laghdú ná go bhfuiltear ag súil gur lú an líon páistí a bheidh ins na scoileanna san i mbliana ná anuraidh.</P>

Dhá mhíle, sé chéad agus beirt chailín agus 2,126 buachaillí a bhí fé choimeád cothrom an lae sin bliain roimhe sin. Ar an mbonn san do b'fhéidir a rá go raibh scoileanna na gcailíní timpeall leath-lán agus scoileanna na mbuachaillí dhá dtrian lán, i leith a bhfuil de shlí iontú.  Dea-thuar é go bhfuil an líon ins na scoileanna so ag dul síos.</P>
    <P>Do tugadh laethe saoire do thimpeall 1,800 de na páisrá sin i 1956.  Tá an Roinn sásta gur lig bainisteoirí na scoileanna na páistí abhaile ar saoire i ngach cás inar bhféidir é sin a dhéanamh agus gur le leas na bpáistí é.  Sé an tsaoire is faide a tugtar ná lá is triocha.  In aon chás nár bhféidir nó nár le leas páistí iad a ligint abhaile, do deineadh socrú chun iad a thabhairt amach ar thurasanna fén dtuaith nó chois trá nó a leithéid.  Bhí naoi scoileanna ann a chuir campaí samhraidh ar fáil do na páistí.</P>

Seo í an chéad bhliain dó bheith fén Aire Oideachais.  £671,640 ar fad atá á sholáthar.  £4,160 de mhéadú glan é sin ar sholáthar na bliana so caite, agus sé is bun leis an méadú ná £5,000 breise atá á riar do Choláiste Mhagh Nuadhat i mbliana, ó ná fuair an Coláiste sin aon bhreis anuraidh nuair a fuair Col-áistí eile breis áirithe.  Ina éadan sin tharla £840 de mhion-sparáil.</P>
    <P>Sin iad na figiúirí agus na fíricí, ach, ainneoin, ar dhúras cheana, ba bhocht liom mo scéal d'fhágáil i dtaobh le figiúirí agus fíricí amháin, óir ní h-iad sin smior agus smuas an oideachais. Ní fada atá caite agam fós i mbun na gcúrsaí seo, ach ní gá do dhuine bheith ina Aire Oideachais lena thuiscint go bhfuil tábhacht bhunúsach ag baint leis an oideachas.  Ba mhian liom dá réir sin roinnt smaointe a chur fé bhúr mbraid a tháinigh i mo cheannle déanaí.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir gurbh é ní is mó a chuir ionadh agus alltacht ar an dtír le tamall fada ná an t-eolas a nochtadh anuraidh go bhfuil an t-aos óg ag imeacht uainn ina sluaite, sluaite is mó ná mar a bhí ann aon uair ach amháin in aimsir droch-shaoil.  Ina thaobh san is clos dúinn go léir ar gach aon taobh go geaithfear nóos mó oibre a chur ar fáil, go gcaithfear táirgeadh na tíre a mhéadú, go gcaithfear seirbhísí sóis-ialta bheith againn a bheidh ionchurtha leis na seirbhísí atá ann ins na tíortha go bhfuil lucht na h-imirce ag tabhairt aghaidh orthu.  Ach ar éigin atá éinne againn ná fuil aithne aige ar dhuine éigin atá tar éis post maith agus roinnt d'ollmhaitheas an tsaoil a fhágáil ina <Col N="501" /> dhiaidh chun aghaidh a thabhairt ar shaol an-aithnid thar lear.  Ní féidir aon mhilleán a chur ar an té atá díomhaoin má théann sé ar lorg oibre pé áit a bhfuil an obair le fáil aige.  Ach nuair a neadaíonn cancar na h-imirce i gcroí na ndaoine ná fuil díomhaoin, leis, tá sé in am a thuigsint nach é réiteach iomlán na faidhbe a thuille postanna nó a thuille seirbhísí sóis-ialta, ach gurab amhlaidh atá cnuimh éigin i gcroí an ubhaill.  Sí cnuimh í sin ná galar éigin spioradálta, galar ar a dtugaim féin &ldquo;locadh meanman&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is mian liom a chur rómhaibh go bhfuil ana-bhaint ag an scéal brónach san leis an oideachas, cé nach é an t-oideachas a thús is a dheireadh.  Ní féidir liom gan bheith ag cuimhneamh, dá gcuirfimís, pobal Éireann, níos mó spéise sa chóras oideachais atá againn, go mba mhór an chabhair é sin do na múinteoirí.  Dá mbéadh an tsuim cheart ag an bpobal á chur i gcúrsaí na scoileanna, ní bhéadh na múinteoirí scaite amach leo féin sa chath atá ar siúl acu de shíor ar mhaithe le hintleacht na h-óige; is mó, is dóigh liom, a chífí dóibh iad féin agus an pobal i gcoitinne bheith i gcomhar, agus b'fhearr an toradh a bhéadh ar obair na scol amach anso ná an toradh, b'fhéidir, atá á bhaint amach fé láthair.  Ar aon chuma, tá slí ann chun saghas éigin crosáide a chur ar bun i gcoinnibh na h-imirce gan gá, ach nílim ró-chinnte gurb iad lucht polaitíochta ná na múinteoirí a b'fhearr i gceannas crosáide dá leithéid.</P>
    <P>Nuair a thráctaim ar an toradh úd a fhéadfaí a bhaint amach, ní hamhlaidh atáim ag cuimhneamh ar theagasc ceirdne ná ar eolas acadúil in aon chor.  Tá, dar ndóigh, a n-ionad féin acu san agus is tábhachtach, gan amhras, an t-ionad é, ach ag an bpointe seo níl i gceist agam ach cothú meona agus dearcaidh.  Mura dtuga duine leis ón bhfoghlaim intinn shásta in éineacht leis an scil agus leis an gceirdne, níl ann ach gur túisce a bheidh ar chumas an duine sin a dhúchas is a thír a thréigint.</P>
    <P>Sin taobh amháin den scéal.  Ach thairis sin, ní fhéadaim glacadh leis nach córas maith é an córas oideachais atá againn nuair chuimhním ar mhianach is ar thréithre na múinteoirí a bhfuil sé d'ádh orainn iad a bheith <Col N="502" /> againn i ngach aon chineál scoile dá bhfuil sa tír.  Ná habradh éinne liom gur maith nó gur dona é aon chóras oideachais mar chóras.  Is maith nó is olc é do réir mhianach a chuid múinteoirí.  Is leor, súil a chaitheamh ar stair na hÉireann chun sin a léiriú; nuair nach raibh ag na múinteoirí ach córas fíor-Ghallda, ba bhreá náisiúnta féin an mheoin agus an intinn a thugadar don aos óg.</P>
    <P>Im' thuairimse, is éachtach mar dheineann ár gcuid múinteoirí, idir chléir agus tuath, ón mbunscoil amach go dtí an Iolscoil, a gcuid oibre.  Is beag a chloisimid fén obair sin a deintear ó lá go lá agus is beag a chímid dhí, ach tá na múinteoirí, dar liomsa, ag tabhairt &ldquo;soiscéil dhílis&rdquo; d'óige na tíre.  B'fhéidir, áfach, gurb amhlaidh gur chliseamairne, an pobal, ar ár múinteoirí ó thaobh meas agus áird a bheith againn ar a gcuid oibre.  Chaitheamar, mar shampla, ualach trom aithbheochana na Gaeilge ar na múinteoirí agus bhí súil againn le míorúiltí uathu, ach cé mhéad againn a fhéadfadh óna chroí amach a rá gur chomhoibrigh sé leis na múin-teoirí sa saothar san a chuireamar orthu?  Cé mhéad againn arbh fhiú linn Gaeilge d'fhoghlaim nó cé mhéad againn a raibh Gaeilge againn agus gurbh fhiú linn í labhairt.?</P>
    <P>Gheibhimíd locht ar thoradh saothair na múinteoirí mar seo nó mar siúd agus bunaímid ár gcuid argóintí ar chásanna ar leith, ach a ndeintear dáiríre, sa tír seo léirmheas beacht, iomlán ó eolas nó ó thaithí leitheadúil ar na scoileanna ná ar an gcóras?  Níl, is eagal liom, sa tir seo an múnladh deariartha sin dá dhéanamh ar thuairimí fén oideachas go mbeifí ag súil leis, agus a threoródh intinn an phobail ar an mbóthar ceart i leith an oideachais. Sé is géire atá uainn, ina thaobh san, níos lú den ghleo mór agus den tais-peántas a bheith againn, agus níos mó go mór den dúthracht is den díoghrais a caitear le hobair sna scoileanna ós íseal, lá i ndiaidh lae, gan aon fhothram ná maíomh.</P>
    <P>Tír bheag í Éire gan puinn mhór de mhaoin an tsaoil aici agus í suite i gceart-lár domhain atá ag síor-chúngú. Ins na cúrsaí sin séard atá ag teastáil uainn go speisialta&mdash;spiorad láidir <Col N="503" /> náisiúnta, spiorad den tsórt arbh fhéidir leis na múinteoirí é do chothú agus go bhfuilid á chothú ionainn ach sinne ár bpáirt féin do dhéanamh. Sé soiscéal laethúil na múinteoirí leis na scoláirí, agus linn go léir, mar do bhí ag Tomás Dáibhis &ldquo;Gentlemen, you have a country&rdquo; ach fé mar a tharla in aimsir Dháibhis, tá an teachtaireacht san á cur ar nea-mbrí ag an mbeag-is-fiú agus ag an mbeag-uachtach atá, fáiríor, le mothú in ár bpobal.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfadh sé a bheith fíor go bhfuil locht ar ár gcóras ar shlí amháin nó ar shlí eile.  Is féidir, cuir i gcás, go bhfuil iomad páistí de chumas áirithe meabhrach i saghas amháin scoile agus go mba chóir iad bheith i saghas eile scoile.  An tslí fhurasta a gheibheann lucht cáinte as a leithéid ná bheith ag éileamh go mba cheart don Stát an córas do ghlacadh ar láimh agus tuairimí an lucht cháinte do chur i bhfeidhm le héigeantas.  Is minic a deintear dearmad go bhfuil comh-pháirtíocht ag baint leis an gcóras oideachais sa tir seo agus nach i seilbh an Stáit atá na scaranna ar fad.  Séard a leanfadh éileamh den tsórt atá luaite agam ná go gcuirfi ar dtúis pionós airgid ar na scoileanna agus ar na tuismitheoirí nach ngéillfeadh don chóras Stáit agus go mbeadh orthu géilleadh sa deireadh thiar.</P>
    <P>Tá ráite agam cheana gurab ionann mórán is 13% den chaiteachas ar na seirbhísí soláthair an méid a caitear ar oideachas.  Ar an gcéad fhéachaint is mó duine a cheapfadh an méid sin do bheith mór le haghaidh seirbhíse amháin, ach má breathnaítear ar an scéal i dtíortha eile a bhfuilimid i gcomórtas leo, beidh sé soiléir go bhfuilimid, ón dtaobh san de, íochtarach go maith ar an liosta.  Is féidir gurab é is mó atá ag cur as dár gcóras nach bhfuil dóthain airgid á chaitheamh air, rud a shíolraíonn ón locht go bhfuil tagairt déanta agam dó cheana féin&mdash;easba tuairimíochta bunaithe ar dhoimhin-mhachnamh.</P>
    <P>Mar sin má thagaim chugaibh arís nó arís eile ag lorg a thuilleadh airgid, tá súil agam go mbeidh sibh go léir liom im iarratas.</P>

      <P>Aontaím go mór leis an rud a dúirt an tAire i ndeire a oráide faoi thábhacht na múin-teoirí i gcóras oideachais na tíre seo ach dob fhéidir a rá gur ceann de na rudaí atá ag cur daoine amach as an tír seo ná an saghas gearáin atá ar siúl ag a lán daoine i dtaobh a lán rudaí sa tir. Tá a lán daoine ag gearán mar gheall ar an gcóras oideachais sa tír seo ach i mo thuairim féin tá na daoine ag imeacht as an tír seo go tíortha eile&mdash;áiteacha nach bhfuil an córas oideachais leath comh maith iontu agus atá sé anseo.  Is maith liom go mór, dá bhrí sin, go raibh an tAire i ndon a rá go raibh súil aige go n-imeodh an laghdú sé fén gcéad a gearradh ar na deontaisí do na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais agus go n-imeodh cuid den laghdú ar na deontais caipitíochta do na meán-scoileanna. Mara mbeadh go raibh géar ghá leis an laghdú sin&mdash;agus beidh a fhios ag an Aire nuair a bheidh sé tamall eile in oifig&mdash;ná cuirtear an laghdú ar an airgid sin.</P>
      <P>Ní dúirt sé aon rud mar gheall ar fhoirghimh maidir le cúrsaí gairm-oideachais. Tá a lán scoileanna ceaptha ag cuid de na coistí ar fuid na tíre agus tá géar-ghá le cuid acu.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire i ndon a insint dúinn i rith na bliana go mbeidh an t-airgead ann chun cuid de na scoileanna gairm-oideachais a thógáil, bíodh gur dúradh le déanaí in a lán freagraí a fuarthas sa Dáil go bhfuil an t-airgead gann agus pé méid de atá ann go gcaithfear é choimeád le haghaidh obair a chur chun cinn a dhíolfadh aisti féin. Ní féidir cuid den obair a dhéanamh gan roinnt eile airgid do caitheamh ar chúrsaí oideachais sa tír seo.</P>
      <P>Tuigim go maith go bhfuil an tráth ró-ghairid chun mórán a rá mar gheall ar oideachas i gcoitinne, ag féachaint don seal ghairid atá caite ag an Aire san Aireacht go dtí seo.  Tá rud tábh-achtach ann.  Ba mhaith liom go n-abródh sé linn, más féidir leis é in aon chor, cad tá ceaptha aige i dtaobh na moltaí a bhí idir lámha agam de bharr obair an Comhairle Oideachais&mdash; na moltaí maidir le Bun-Oideachas agus na scoileanna náisiúnta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuair do hiarradh ar an gComhairle cúrsaí na mbun-scoileanna do bhreith-niú <Col N="505" /> níor hiarradh ortha ach iad do bhreithniú suas go dtí dá bhlian déaga &mdash;an cheist do scrúdú agus moltaí a dhéanamh suas go dtí an aois sin.  Tá an Comhairle ag obair anois ar chúrsaí meán-oideachais agus is gairid go mbeidh toradh obair an Chomhairle againn.  Ní foláir nó go mbeidh staid in obair na scoileanna nó na smaointe a bhí ag a lán daoine mar gheall ar an obair a bhí á dhéanamh thar an dara blian déag go dtí go mbeidh sé socair ag na bainisteoirí conas a bheidh an scéal ins na scoileanna náisiúnta suas go dtí an dara blian déag.</P>
    <P>Más féidir leis in aon chor é ba mhaith liom go bhféadfadh sé a rá linn go n-aontaíonn sé leis na tuairimí a bhí ceaptha ag an Rialtas deireannach mar gheall air.  Beidh air féin agus ar lucht na Roinne dul i gcomhairle leis na bainisteoirí agus leis na múinteoirí chun na moltaí sin do chur ar siúl.  Beidh sé deacair aige an rud is fearr nó an rud is fónta a dhéanamh dtaobh na moltaí go dtí go mbeidh ar a chumas a rá go bhfuil sé chun líon na múinteoirí ins na scoileanna d'ardú. Beidh a fhios aige gur cheapas gur cheart glacadh le cuid den mholadh a dhein an Coiste i dtaobh tuilleadh múinteoirí a chur ins na scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Sa chéad dul sios, ba chóir go mbeadh sli níos fearr chun a thuilleadh múinteoirí do thréineáil.  Go dtí go ndéanfar sin ní bheadh oiread múinteoirí dos na scoileanna 's go bhfuil gá leo.  Do réir mar is cuimhin liom, thógfadh sé dhá bhliain, nó mar sin, agus £125,000 chun foirgnimh nua do chur suas chun na múinteoirí breise do thréineáil. Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh an t-airgead le fáil i mbliana nó bfhéidir an bhliain seo chugainn chun é sin do dhéanamh. Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh ar chumas an Aire a rá go cinnte cathain a glacfaí leis an moladh sin.  Ar aon chuma, tá mé cinnte go dteastóidh ón Aire an chuid sin den mholadh do glacadh nuair a dhéanfas sé ceist na scoileanna náisiúnta agus an méid oibre atá le déanamh iontu do chur faoina bhráid. Bíodh sin mar atá, tá socrú déanta aige faoi.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bheadh meastúcháin ag an Aire ón gComhairle mar gheall ar chúrsaí meán-oideachais do bheadh sé <Col N="506" /> réidh ansin chun a iarraidh ar an gComhairle dul i mbun na hoibre atá le déanamh agus an scéal d'aithbhreithniú agus moladh a dhéanamh faoin sórt oibre go mba cóir a bheith á dhéanamh ag leanaí tar éis dóibh 12 bliana d'aois a chaitheamh, go háirithe leanaí ins na scoileanna náisiúnta.  Pé ar bith é, is dóigh liom gur obair phráinneach í sin.</P>
    <P>Fé mar a dúras cheana, tá mórán daoine ag clamhsán mar gheall ar chúrsaí oideachais sa tír seo.  Duine ar bith a léigh tuarascáil na Comhairle ar bhun-oideachas go dtí aois a 12, do bheadh fhios aige agus tuiscint aige go bhfuil obair an-mhaith dá dhéanamh cheana féin.  Tá mé cinnte, nuair a gheobhaimíd an tuarascáil i dtaobh cúrsaí oideachais ins na meán-scoileanna go mbeidh sé sáite go daingean in intinn an phobail go bhfuil an córas bun-oideachais sa tír seo chomh maith is atá in aon tír eile agus nach bhfuil le déanamh ach an foirgneamh d'ardú air sin.</P>
    <P>Tagaim anois go ceist an ghairm-oideachais. Tá tuiscint agus obair mhaith atá comhgarach do, agus a bhaineann go dlúth le saol ár ndaoine ar siúl ins na scoileanna gairm-oideachais sa tír seo.  Tá obair iontach á déanamh i cuid des na scoileanna a bhaineann le gach gné de shaol mhuintir na tuaithe agus freisin tá sár-obair ar siúl i mBlá Cliath i gcúrsaí ceirde, agus mar sin de, ins na scoileanna gairm-oideachais.  Tá an obair sin bunaithe ar bhun atá chomh maith le haon ní atá le fáil in aon tír eile.</P>
    <P>Nuair a cuireadh tús leis an obair sin deineadh tosach ana-mhaith ar fad.  Do bhí baint ag cuid mhaith de múinteoirí an Choláiste Ealaíon leis an obair sin agus do cuireadh bunús maith faoin obair sin.  Tá an obair atá á déanamh an lá atá inniu ann ag na múinteoirí agus ag na stiúrthóirí ar aon-chéim leis an dea-obair a deineadh ins na scoileanna sin nuair a cuireadh ar bun iad den chéad uair timpeall 50 bliana ó shoin.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire gurb í seo an chéad uair d'Aire a bheith freagarthach anseo i dtaobh ceisteanna airgeadais na n-oll-scoileanna.  Im thuairimse, is maith sin.  Sílim gur deineadh faillí <Col N="507" /> i gcuid d'obair na n-ollscoileanna, mar, go dtí seo, dob é an tAire Airgeadais a bhí freagarthach don Teach seo maidir le cúrsaí na n-ollscoileanna.  I ngach gné de shaol na tíre tá glaoch níos láidre ar airgead chun rudaí do chur ar siúl.  Ní gá ach féachaint ar an liosta mór atá anseo, ag dul siar go 1948-49, chun a thuiscint go bhfuil muintir na tíre seo ag déanamh a ndíchill chun nios mó airgid do sholathar do bhun-oideachas agus meán-oideachas.  Ina theannta sin, tá méadú mór ar an méid airgid atá á thabhairt anois i gcomparáid leis an méid airgid a bhí ar fáil, cuir i gcás, ag deireadh téarma an Chogaidh Mhóir. Ní foláir níos mó airgid a sholáthar freisin do na hollscoileanna.</P>
    <P>Go dtí go ndéanfaidh an Rialtas tuilleadh machnaimh ar chúrsaí airgeadais agus caithimh na n-ollscoileanna, ní dóigh liom go mbeadh ar chumas an Aire aon ní do rá i dtaobh cad tá beartaithe maidir leis an bhfoirgneamh is gá a chur suas i dtreo is go mbeadh slí a ndóthain do na scoláirí atá ag dul go dtí an Coláiste Ollscoile anseo. I gcaitheamh na mblianta, tá faillí déanta ar an gColáiste Ollscoile.  Tá siad ar mhullach a chéile ansin&mdash;go háirithe maidir le hEalaín agus le hinnealltóireacht.  Tá siad chun deiridh go mór ansin toisc easpa slí agus easba cóir oibre.  B'fhéidir, más féidir leis, go dtabharfadh an tAire roinnt eolais dúinn ar an gceist thábhachtach sin go léir, dá laghad í.</P>
    <P>Tuigim nach féidir leis an Aire mórán á rá mar gheall ar an Roinn go léir. Pé scéal é, ba mhaith liom a rá ná raibh éinne sa Roinn Oideachais go dtí seo a raibh aon chomhairle cheart aige ar chúrsai ollscoile.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh sé ar chumas an Aire a rá nach bhfuil an chomhairle cheart le fáil aige i dtaobh cúrsaí ollscoile sa Roinn.  Déarfainn go bhfuil daoine sa Roinn a bhfuil sé ar cumas dóibh dea-chomhairle agus cabhair a thabhairt dó chun ceisteanna ollscoile do scrúdú.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go dtuigfeadh éinne, nuair a hathraíodh cúram cúrsaí ollscoile ón Roinn Airgeadais go dtí an Roinn Oideachais, go gcuirfeadh an tAire Oideachais a lámh ró-fhada nó ró-throm isteach i gcúrsaí ollscoile.  Ba <Col N="508" /> chóir go dtuigfí nár deineadh an t-athrú chun é sin a dhéanamh ar chor ar bith. Nuair a thosnaigh na hollscoileanna ar a bheith ag iarraidh airgid ar an Rialtas agus ar an Aire Airgeadais ní raibh sé sin ró-chompordach don Aire Airgeadais agus bhí gá le duine éigin do chur idir an tAire Airgeadais agus na hollscoileanna. Déarfainn gur maith an rud é an tAire Oideachais do chur idir na hollscoileanna agus an tAire Airgeadais ós rud nach n-éistfeadh éinne leis an Aire Oideachais nuair ná raibh aon chúram poiblí air faoi sin.  D'éist-feadh lucht na hollscoile leis agus d'éistfeadh an Roinn Airgeadais leis, ach b'shin í an méid.  Is fearr an córas nua ach ní ceart a thuiscint as sin go bhfuil an Stát ag cur isteach ar na h-ollscoileanna i slí éigin ná raibh ann roimhe.</P>
    <P>Tá mórán rudaí práinneacha, tábh-achtacha maidir le hoideachas agus sé mo thuairim go mba cheart don Aire bheith sásta leis an dea-obair agus an obair fhónta atá á dhéanamh ag an gcoiste oideachais, agus ligean dóibh dul ar aghaidh leis an obair sin go dtí go gcríochnófar í.  Tuigfidh gach éinne cad tá á dhéanamh i bhfad níos fearr tar éis an obair atá déanta ag an gcoiste maidir le bun-oideachas agus an obair atá á dhéanamh acu anois maidir le meán-oideachas ach amháin smaoineamh i gceart ar an tuarascáil agus na moltaí atá tugtha cheana.  Sí an bhun-táiste atá ag baint leis an scéim sin ná go bhfuil seans ag gach éinne a thuairim a thabhairt agus is féidir na tuairimi go léir agus na moltaí a chur le chéile agus a bhreithniú.  Is féidir le muintir na Roinne agus leis an Aire an fhaisnéis sin agus na moltaí do scrúdú agus a moltaí féin a dhéanamh.  Is féidir na moltaí sin do chur go dtí na bainisteoirí agus na múinteoiri agus gach uile dhream go bhfuil cúram orthu fé obair na scoile.  Mar sin is féidir pé rud a socraítear idir an tAire agus an Rialtas do chur i bhfeidhm.  An fhaid is atá sé sin ar siúl beidh an tAire i gcomhairle arís leis na bainisteoirí agus leis na múinteoirí mar gheall ar an tslí is fearr chun an córas nua do chur i bhfeidhm.  Ní hionann an clár oibre i scoileanna aon-oide agus i scoileanna dhá-oide agus trí-oide ach tá dlúth-bhaint idir na múinteoiri agus Cumann <Col N="509" /> na Múinteoirí agus an Roinn agus idir an Roinn agus na bainisteoirí agus níl amhras ar bith agam go réiteofar pé fadhbanna a bheas le réiteach.  Socrófar iad níos fearr tré theacht le chéile mar atá ann anois.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom a chlos gur féidir leis an Aire a rá go bhfuil sé socraithe aige an moladh eadrána maidir le meán-mhúinteoirí a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>

      <P>Tá sé socraithe ag an Roinn Oideachais trí ábhair úra a chur ar chlár na mbun-scol&mdash; tuaitheolaíocht, líníocht agus gleacaíocht. Níl aon dabht ná go bhfuil na h-ábhair seo go maith iontu féin agus ba mhaith liom fhéin tuaitheolaíocht a fheiceáil ar an chlár ach ba mhaith liom dá ndéanadh an tAire athscrúdú ar an cheist go bhfeiceadh sé caidé mar rachadh na h-ábhair seo i gcionn ar na h-ábhair eile atá ar an chlár cheana féin.  Tá fhios ag na múinteoirí uilig, agus go mór mór ag na múinteoirí atá i mbun scoileanna dhá-oide, go bhfuil an clár thar a bheith lán cheana féin. I gcuid de na scoileanna seo tá os cionn 90 ar na rollaí agus tá sé iontach doiligh an clár a chríochnú fé mar atá sé.</P>
      <P>Deir an Roinn go mbeadh siad sásta le caighdeán níos ísle i scríobh na Gaeilge agus an Bhéarla ach caidé is ciall le &ldquo;caighdeán níos ísle&rdquo; agus caidé mar rachadh sé i bhfeidhm ar an chaighdeán don teastas bun-scoile?</P>
      <P>Ag caint fán teastas bun-scoile, ba mhaith liom a iarraidh ar an Aire ceist an scrúduithe so a iniúchadh.  Ní thiocfadh liom a rá caidé an mhaith atá inti ach tig liom a rá go bhfuil dochar á dhéanamh d'oideachas na bpáistí.  Tá sé ag cur cosc ar oideachas measardha leathan a thabhairt do pháistí ins an rang deiridh a mbíonn siad ins an bhunscoil, sin é rang a sé. Is minic gur mhaith leis an múinteoir rud éigin a dhéanamh dóibh a cuideodh le na n-aigne a leathnú ach chomh luath a smaoitíonn sé air caithfidh sé é a chur as a aigne láithreach mar tá an scrúdú ag teacht.  Tá sé níos tábhachtaí do réir dealraimh a bheith ag foghlaim aistí de ghlan-mheabhair agus formulae de ghlan-mheabhair agus cleasanna le ceisteanna nach dtuigeann siad a fhreagairt ná a bheith ag fáil oideachais mar is cóir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> An dara dochar atá á dhéanamh ag an scrúdú seo ná go bhfuil sé ag milleadh labhairt na Gaeilge.  Sa scol-bhlian deiridh atá ag an pháiste nuair a ba cheart an oiread cleachtadh i labhairt na Gaeilge agus is féidir a thabhairt dó tá páistí an 6ú rang ag síor-scríobhadh freagra ar pháipéiri scrúdúcháin.</P>
    <P>D'iarrfainn ar an Aire, fosta, caighdeán an scrúduithe seo a iniúchadh fhaid is tá an scrúdú ann.  Dá n-amh-arcadh duine ar, abair, páipéirí uimhríochta onóracha na Meán-Teistiméireachta agus ar pháipéirí uimhríochta an Teastais bun-scoile is beag má bhéadh sé ábalta a rá cé aca an páipéir Meán-Teistiméireachta agus cé aca an páipéir bun-scoile.  B'fhiú don Aire amharc ar na páipéirí atá luaite agam don bhlian 1955 agus uimhir 1 (Meán-Scol) a chur i gcomparáid le uimhir a 3 (Bun-Scol) agus uimhir 2 (<i>a</i>) (Meán-Scol) a chur i gcomparáid le uimhir a 1 (Bun-Scol) agus ansin smaoitiú go bhfuil ar a laghad trí bliana idir aoiseanna na bpáistí.  Tá páipéirí Gaeilge ann don scrúdú bun-scol agus is beag má tá na múinteoiri féin ábalta iad do thuigbheáil.  Níl ansin ach samplaí ach tá sé so-fheicthe go bhfuil rud éigin contráilte.</P>
    <P>Fá theagasc na Gaeilge mar ábhar scoile ní thiocfadh a rá nach bhfuil sí á teagasc go maith ins na bun-scoileanna ach thiocfadh a rá nach bhfuil toradh maith ag teacht as i gcoitinne.  Sé an aidhm atá againn ná an Ghaeilge a chur ar labhairt go foirleathan ar fud na tíre.  Gidh gur fhoghluim aos-óg na hÉireann Gaeilge ar scoil tá muid i bhfad ón aidhm sin go fóill. Mo bharúil fhéin gurb é an dóigh a bhfuil clár na Gaeilge leagtha amach ag an Roinn is cúis leis seo. Támuid ag iarraidh scoláirí Gaeilge a dhéanamh de na páistí in ionad cainteoirí Gaeilge a dhéanamh díobh. Tá muid ag claoi barraíocht le scríobh agus le léamh na Gaeilge, scríobh go h-áirithe.  Sílim go mba cheart scríobh agus léamh na Gaeilge a chur siar i bhfad níos fuide ar an chlár ná mar atá agus 'na áit chuirfinn comhrá Gaeilge, drámaí agus cluifí.  Ní thig le gach páiste nach dtig leis teanga a fhoghluim nuair a fhoghluimuíonn sé <Col N="511" /> í ar an dóigh nádúrtha.  Nuair nach dtig leis léamh agus scríobh go maith, tig beag uchtach air agus nuair a fhágann sé an scoil bíonn áthas mór air fáil réitithe leis an Ghaeilge.  Caidé tá le cailleadh?  Cé mhéad páiste a fhágann an bhun-scoil agus nach bhfaghann a thuile oideachais a scríobhann litir as Gaeilge nó a léamhann leabhar i nGaeilge?  Má bhíonn labhairt na Gaeilge aca tiocfaidh an léamh agus an scríobh go nádúrtha.</P>
    <P>Tá mé go mór i bhfathach le scrúdú béil ag scrúduithe na dTeastas Meán-Scol, fiú dá laghdófaí an caighdeán scríofa Gaeilge.  Tá sompla maith agam den dóigh a théas an scrúdú seo i gcionn ar labhairt na Gaeilge.  Tá riail an Bhéarla ar obair i gColáiste Brighde i Rann na Feirste.  Má labhrann páiste Béarla ar bith cuirtear 'na bhaile é.</P>
    <P>Bionn páisti ó na Sé Chontae agus ó na 26 Contae ag freastal ar an Choláiste seo.  Ní thig cead a thabhairt do pháistí na mBun-scoil as na Sé Contaethe freastal ar an Choláiste sin mar is beag Gaeilge atá aca.  Tá Gaeilge fíor-mhaith ag páistí na mBun-Scol ins na 26 Contae a bhíonn ag freastal ar an Choláiste sin.  Ar an dtaobh eile dhe, fuarathas amach go raibh an Ghaeilge níos líofa ag na páistí ó na meán-scoileanna ins na Sé Chontae ná mar bhí ag na páisti ó na meán-scoileanna ins na 26 Contae.  Sin cionns go bhfuil scrúdú béil le déanamh ag na páistí ins na meán-scoileanna ins na Sé Chontae agus nach bhfuil scrúdú béil le déanamh ag na páistí ins na meán-scoileanna ins na 26 Contae agus, mar sin, molaim go mba cheart go mbeadh scrúdú béil ins na meán-scoileanna ins na 26 Contae.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister entered on his new office only a short time ago, I do not want to take advantage of him by asking any embarrassing questions, but I do want to put one or two points of view to the Minister for consideration, in the hope that, when he has familiarised himself with the functions of the Department of Education, he will be able to devote some time and consideration to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> I do not know whether the speech which the Minister read is an official brief or whether it represents his own thoughts on the subject of education and the method of operating the whole machinery of education in this country. I hope it does not represent his own thoughts.  It seems to me that there is an element of complacency in the speech which I do not think is warranted and which is not justified by the state of the public mind to-day on the whole question of education.  One has not to travel far to find a very considerable measure of disquiet and perturbation in the public mind as to whether we are getting full value from the sum of money we are at present spending on education.</P>
    <P>I take the view that this country is too poor to economise on education. We have got to spend more and more money in equipping our people for the battle of life.  In the fields of technological and higher education, there are limits to which we should endeavour to attain but which, in fact, may tax our physical resources if we attempt to do so.  I want to see money generously spent in getting good value from the educational machine.  I must say I have considerable doubt as to whether we are getting good value for the money being spent to-day.  I believe many parents in this country also have doubts as to whether they are getting full value for the money being spent.</P>
    <P>I do not want to lay the responsibility on any particular factor or group for that feeling of disquiet; but I think it is there.  Anybody not living with his head in the sands must feel it is there.  One has only to talk to any group of parents at random in order to be satisfied that there is a feeling they are not getting from the educational machine what they expect.  For example, I do not think that the child coming out of the primary school to-day is as well equipped with knowledge as the child who came out of the primary school 40 years ago.  Recently, I asked a number of children certain questions relating to what books they had read and I reflected on my own time at school.  They did not know some of the books, although to-day they are still commonplace items of literature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> I think it is true to-day that if you were to ask a number of children coming out of the primary school who were the signatories to the Proclamation of 1916 and ask them also what actors and actresses appeared in recent films, they would be more accurate in telling you the names of the cinema artists than they would be concerning patriots whose names are and ought to be immortal in this country.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister try that experiment himself with school children and I am sure he will get as disappointing a result as I have often got by giving that test to children.  So long as a situation of that kind continues, we cannot afford to be as complacent in regard to teaching methods as this speech indicates.  I do not know what is responsible.  It is because I do not know that I think we ought to have some inquiry to ascertain whether we are getting the best value we can from our educational machines or whether there are imperfections and deficiencies there which call for remedying.</P>
    <P>I did not notice in the Minister's speech any reference to the Council of Education.  I want to know what has become of that body.  I want to know what it has done over the past 12 months.  I want to know what it is doing.  I was one of those who advocated the establishment of a Council of Education, but I did not then think it would prove to be the kind of body that it has apparently turned out to be.  I thought it would be a live, vigorous, vibrant body.  I thought that it would apply the talents of its members to inquiring into our entire educational system and that it would be restless in its desire to give us the best system of education it could devise.  I have not seen any of that kind of activity on the part of the Council of Education.  I have not seen any evidence that it has faced up to our basic problems.  It has certainly not made any impression on the public mind.  I know of nobody who would say, either to-day or to-morrow, that the Council of Education has done a first-class job.  It may have done something. I do not want to decry its activities, but I do want to know what <Col N="514" /> it is doing, what direction its activities are taking, what report has it to make to the public of its activities, what recommendations affecting our educational curriculum have been made, what are the recommendations, are they of a worthwhile character and, still further, which of them has been implemented.</P>
    <P>Frankly, we have reached the stage now wherein we ought to undertake an inquiry into our whole educational methods.  Are we teaching in the right way?  Is there no better method of teaching?  Have we selected the right subjects?  Are we getting the best return from our present methods?  Is it wiser to teach Irish as a separate language or to teach all subjects through the medium of Irish?  Where can all subjects be taught through the medium of Irish and under what circumstances should they be so taught?</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us some information as to the number of secondary schools in which other subjects are taught, partly or wholly, through the medium of Irish.  There are no similar statistics so far as national schools are concerned.  We should have some inquiry now on that and some information made available as to our success or failures in relation to our teaching methods in the fields I have indicated.  I will not blame the teacher in this matter at all.  I think the teacher does a very good job under handicaps; but nobody, of course, suggests that the teacher has formulated the teaching programme or that the teacher controls the educational machine.  The teacher has as many complaints against the educational system as anybody else.  The teacher feels that his talents and his experience are not being availed of as they ought to be in order to perfect the machine.  The teacher feels that he is all the time, in the main, kept outside the door when vital decisions are being made.  He has never been taken into the confidence of the machine.  He believes he has a part to play, but he has never been permitted to play that part; he has never been given the opportunity of playing the part he desires to play in moulding the character of the machine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> I know of no reason in the world, except the desire to continue the present policy of self-deception, why there should be any demur at the idea of assessing our educational methods at the present time.  One of the worst practices of which we can be guilty is the practice of self-deception, the practice of imagining things are all right when, in fact, they are not, of imagining things are going well when those who ought to be benefiting in a very substantial way are not deriving all the benefit they should, and where educational methods are such that our children are not getting the amount of knowledge they ought to get.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of making all our children bilingual.  Whether we are trying to do that in the best way is open to question.  Whether there is not another way, and a better way and one that does not show the deficiencies of the present system, is a matter upon which I am not prepared to pontificate; but I am prepared to entrust an inquiry into that matter into the hands and heads of people who are capable of undertaking such inquiry and of securing, in the course of that inquiry, testimony from teachers, from parents and from all those in a position to make observations on the subject of a kind useful for the purposes of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the human material with which the teacher has to deal to-day is different from the material available to teachers 40 and 50 years ago.  There is no doubt in the world, and our children's courts every day prove the truth of my assertion, that the advent of the film has made a consideable difference in the outlook of young and growing children to-day. There is no doubt, too, that some of the incidence of juvenile delinquency to-day is clearly connected with the kind of things which the young, growing and imaginative child sees portrayed. It may well be that the slickness of outlook, which is a product of many films, though not of all, has given the character of the young, growing and imaginative child twists that did not present a problem for the teacher, 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  Whether there be any portion of the responsibility for <Col N="516" /> our present situation attributable to the influx of certain films and their influence on school children is a matter upon which I am not prepared to dogmatise.</P>
    <P>I am fully convinced that we have now had a sufficiently long experience of our teaching methods, which in the main are the same as they were in 1923 or 1924.  They may vary here and there but in the main they are the same.  I do not think the results they are producing are as good as the results which were produced 40 years ago.  Of course there are others who will disagree with that point of view.  I do not mind if they do.  In a matter of this kind, a clash of reason on reason is something calculated to fertilise the minds of all of us.</P>
    <P>I know of nothing against the good old principle of taking stock.  If it is good for a business, it ought to be good for an administrative machine.  The greatest mistake any Department or Minister could make is to feel that everything is right and everything is lovely.  Some self-criticisms by Departments and Ministers are really virtues&mdash;although they are inconvenient virtues.  I recommend to the Minister that during his period in the Department of Education he ought to consider taking stock, to ascertain whether we are getting the best results from our present teaching methods.  If we are, then we are all confirmed in our satisfaction and we can all afford to be complacent. If we are not, then we owe it to the children of to-day so to alter our teaching methods so that those children will get the full benefit of the limited time which the bulk of them spend on education, as a result of their attendance at our primary schools.  So far as the overwhelming majority of our children are concerned, the only education they get is at the primary schools.  It is vital to them, therefore, that they should get all they can and the best they can get while attending primary schools.</P>
    <P>Is the present method of teaching giving them all they can get and the best they can get whilst attending there?  I am afraid it is not and I think there will be many others who share that view.  Whether the numbers be <Col N="517" /> large or small, stocktaking is a useful practice.  There would be public acclaim for an inquiry into our teaching methods, to ascertain whether we cannot improve on the methods which are in operation to-day.</P>

      <P>Le blianta anuas ó bunaíodh an Stát seo is mór an líon scol náisiúnta nua a tógadh sa tír seo.  In theannta sin, in imeacht an achair chéanna cuireadh cóir ar riar maith de na sean-scoltacha agus cuireadh seomra nó dhó lena lán acu chomh maith.  Ach bfhacthas dhom le deireannas gur bheag nár héiríodh scaradh den obair sin ar fad.  Ní feasach mé cén fáth a bhí leis sin murabh é beartas an Rialtais a bhí i réim ansin ba siocair leis, nó ganntanas an airgid bfhéidir. Tá an Rialtas sin imithe, buíochas le Dia, agus ceann nua anois ann.  Caithfidh an tAire Oideachais nua, agus an Rialtas nua, luí isteach leis an obair aríst agus dul ar aghaidh go breá gasta le tógáil na scol agus lena leasú agus a gcóiriú mar bha cheart.</P>
      <P>Maidir le téamh agus le glanadh na scol fré céile, sin ceist atá fíor-achrannach, mar is eol don Aire agus do dhaoine eile.  Dár ndó bíonn deontas Stáit le fáil agus cúnamh áitiúil, mar tugtar air, ach níl iontu sin ach sop in ionad na scuaibe.  Is minic a bhí mé fhéin ag smaoineamh ar an gceist achrannach seo agus tá an tuairim seo agam fúithi. Ba cheart go n-iarrfaí ar an údarás áitiúil, an Comhairle Chontae nó an Bárdas, teacht i geabhair ar na scoltacha agus deontas foirlíontach a chur ar fáil dóibh.  Ba cheart go mbeadh sé de roghain ag an gComhairle Contae nó ag an mBárdas a leithéid de dheontas a thabhairt.  Cuirfí ar na ráití é, béidir.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an deontas sin ann agus é bunaithe ar an méid a thuganns an Stát.  Níl ansin, ámh, ach smaoine a bhuail isteach im cheann. Ar chaoi ar bith, chabhródh sé go mór leis na scoltacha a choinneáil glan te, gan cur isteach ar dhualgaisí agus cúram an bhainisteora i leith téamh agus glanadh na bun-scoile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní mé go baileach cé mhéad páisti scoile a maraítear nó a gortaítear ar na bóithrí chuile bhliain, ach is maith is eol domh nach bhfuil lá san aer nach <Col N="518" /> mbíonn timpisti den tsórt sin le léamh.  Ar mhaithe leis na páistí bochta sin, is dóigh liom go mba cheart tuille eolais ar &ldquo;Aire Dhuit&rdquo; a scapadh ins na scoltacha.  Sé mo thuairim go mba cheart do na Gárdaí Síochána an obair sin a dhéanamh.  Ba cheart don Aire Oideachais dul i gcómhar leis an Aire Dlí agus Cirt agus scéim a leagan amach chun &ldquo;Aire Dhuit&rdquo; do na scoltachta a leathadh.</P>
    <P>Sílim féin gur mó an aird a tabharfaí ar an nGárda agus é ag teacht isteach ins na scoltacha, ná tabharfaí ar an múinteóir.  Is ait an rud é sin a rá, ach sin é mo thuairimse.</P>
    <P>I rith na bliana atá caite, d'fhuagair an tAire Oideachais a bhí ann go raibh glactha aige féin agus ag an Rialtas san am sin, le moltaí na Comhairle Oideachais le trí ábhair léinn nua éigeantacha a chur ar chlár na bun-scoile. Siad na hábhair a bhí i gceist aige An Liníocht, Eolas ar Nádúr agus an Corp-Oiliúint.  Sílim féin go raibh dul amú ar an Aire, agus ar an Rialtas freisin, a leithéid de rud a dhéanamh. Tá súil agam go gcuirfear an bhreith sin ar neamh-ní agus go ndéanfar sin gan mórán moille.  Táim-se lán-chinnte go ndéanfaidh na h-ábhair nua sin dochar don Ghaeilge agus don Bhéarla, gan trácht ar an dochar a dhéanfas siad do na hábhar eile atá ar an gclár cheana.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol don tsaol Fódlach, tá furmhór mór na scoileanna sa tír seo fá chúram múinteóra amháin nó beirte. I láthair na huaire, bíonn ar an múinteóir bocht sin ceithre nó cúig ranga a mhúineadh, is a cheart féin a thabhairt do gach ábhar atá ar an gclár. Téann sé rite go leor leis an múinteóir é sin a dhéanamh.  Amach anseo, muna gcuirfear an bhreith sin ar neamh-ní, beidh ar an múinteóir trí ábhair breise a mhúineadh.  Má bhíonn, go bhfóire Día ar na múinteóirí.</P>
    <P>Is rí-shoiléir nach raibh mórán múinteóirí náisiúnta ar an gComhairle Oideachais a mhol an t-athrú sin. Maidir leis na daoine a mhol é, táim thar a bheith cinnte nár chaith a lán aca mórán ama riamh taobh istigh de scoil náisiúnta ag plé le ceithre nó cúig ranga agus le clár na scoile mar atá sé.</P>

    <P>I was rather amused at the pious platitudes that issued from the former Minister for Education and at the complacency <Col N="520" /> he displayed with regard to the vocational education committees. I have here in my hand a very interesting document.  I am not very familiar with the procedure of the House and I do not know if I may quote from this document which gives a report of an interview between the former Minister for Education and the Irish Vocational Education Society on the 6th October, 1955.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <P>The Deputy is entitled to refer to the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>The report states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister, reiterating that the Department was deeply interested in the development of vocational education in the Gaeltacht areas, said that it was erroneous to suggest that any unnecessary delay had taken place in the sanctioning of Gaeltacht schemes.  The Department was willing to assist the western counties with grants beyond those available for other counties, but only by relating those grants to the local rates, as the relief of local rates by grants from the Central Fund was not a sound principle.  Further, the local councils, if they want these additional funds for their areas, must show their interest in Gaeltacht development by providing a portion of the funds necessary.  The recent changes made by the Department in the financing of vocational education schemes represent a substantial improvement for the western counties, and he asked that the new arrangement be given a sympathetic trial.  If, however, even this proves inadequate in a particular case, Section 103 provided a means for the Department to give further assistance, and he assured the association that the interests of the Gaeltacht areas would be carefully watched.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We in County Galway are faced with a loss of £5,169 in the coming year, despite the fact that we have the largest Gaeltacht area in Ireland and that we are catering for more Gaeltacht schools than any other committee in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hard on the heels of the 6 per cent. <Col N="521" /> reduction, we were notified that the two and one grant would not operate in our county unless the local contribution was 13 pence in the £.  We increased it to 1/2 in the £ and we still have not benefited.  Some of the economies we have had to resort to as a result of the wrong interpretation of that scheme are as follows: we had to cut down expenditure on instruction; we had to reduce part-time instruction and cut our four wholetime teachers; we had to cut down on repairs, on building and on equipment; we had to reduce scholarships, and it was further directed that in the event of our being able to get a £20,000 loan from the Irish National Insurance Company to finance the erection of a school for hotel training in Athenry, if we succeeded in getting the loan and in getting the necessary sanction to borrow the money, the loan charges would have to be met by further reductions under the headings given.</P>
    <P>That has been our experience in County Galway.  The western counties, particularly Galway, are now in grave financial difficulties.  We have raised the maximum amount from the rates for vocational education.  What about the promises made to us by the former Minister?  The people of Carna and Cornamona have been waiting for 20 years for vocational schools.  The same thing applies to Athenry and Glenamaddy.  These areas have no post-primary education facilities of any kind, though in both areas there are between 30 and 40 national schools.  I should like to ask the new Minister to re-examine the position with regard to the difficulties facing the County Galway Vocational Education Committee. We are asking only for fair play.  I have made my case and I trust the Minister will give our application a much more sympathetic hearing than did his predecessor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>One point to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is the lack of any course of instruction in agriculture in our primary schools.  This lack has existed for a considerable time past.  It is a serious failing in our education system that we do not give, at least in the <Col N="522" /> rural areas and small towns, some course in agricultural instruction in our primary schools.  Pupils should be given even the most elementary foundation in agricultural knowledge.  Such instruction was given in the British days, but has been completely neglected by successive native Governments.</P>
      <P>I should now like to ask the Minister again to provide instruction in elementary agriculture in the national schools.  Children could be taught simple everyday things, simple facts about live stock, crops, soil analysis, the uses of fertilisers.  Such knowledge could be worked in without taking up a lot of time.  Of course, the Minister will tell me that at present the time of teachers is overloaded.  I know that to be the case, but in a country like this, predominantly agricultural and in which, even in Dublin, no one is longer removed from the land than two generations, a big effort should be made to teach children something about the vocation to which so many of them will belong.  It is not good enough that the entire problem of agricultural instruction should be left to the fathers of sons who will inherit holdings of land.</P>
      <P>I think it was a pity that some type of agricultural instruction was not included in the curriculum of the primary school.  After all, agriculture is now moving along very scientific lines. Against my submission, the Minister may also say that there is some instruction given in nature study.  Such instruction may be useful in its own way, but the other side should not be neglected.  It would be immensely useful to those who stay on the land in later years.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make I have made before in the House.  I am still of the opinion that the compulsory teaching of Irish is doing more harm than good.</P>

Deputy Cunningham may try to wriggle out of it on a technicality, but we cannot get away from it that there is compulsory teaching through the <Col N="523" /> medium of Irish.  I am as anxious as any other Deputy to see Irish restored, but I do not think the method that has been used and is being used is the best one.  Children learn a certain amount of Irish which they have by rote when they leave school, and a year after when they stay at home or go to work, they have forgotten almost every bit of it.  That is proof that a new approach to the teaching of Irish should be found and followed.</P>
      <P>Results are proving that we are no more Irish-speaking now than we were. We just know a little.  Forcibly feeding children with Irish will only create apathy to the language.  If we are going to reinstate it, we must do it by some different method.  We should not expect quick results in changing over to Irish.  We must remember that it took England the best part of 300 years to crush Irish out of the country and while I do not attempt to prophesy that it will take 300 years to reinstate it, we cannot bring it back overnight, and I submit the method we are using is not the correct one.</P>
      <P>The Minister might ask me what is the proper route to take.  I cannot tell him but it should be possible for the experts of his Department to seek out some new methods.  Perhaps they will not succeed at the first or second attempt but a new approach to the problem should produce the results we are seeking.  I should like to see Irish more widely spoken than it is.  It is no more a load for anybody to carry than any other branch of education.  I do, however, deplore the fact that children leaving school forget the language so that they cannot even tell you what is being said on the radio during the Irish news or other such broadcasts.  I am not blaming the children; I think the system is the real trouble.  Everybody is anxious to get Irish re-established too quickly and anything done in haste will not be done in the best possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I want to impress on the Minister the necessity for the teaching of the elements of agriculture in the schools.  This would be immensely useful at least in the rural districts. in <Col N="524" /> rural towns.  At the moment, all the children learn about the land is what they assimilate from their parents, but they learn it the hard way and it very often does not sink in.  We have at the present time an excellent group of agricultural instructors for the farmers' benefit and it would be wonderful if those who inherit the land and remain on it could acquire some better knowledge than they already have.  We should assist young farmers of 18, 20 and up to 25 years of age to avoid many of the costly mistakes that are made.  That could be done in the national schools through the medium of such courses there.</P>

      <P>Tá sé d'aidhm ag an Rialtas agus ag gach Rialtas a bhí sa Stát seo an Ghaeilge a chur á labhairt ar fud na tíre arís.  Tá a lán déanta ar mhaithe leis an aidhm sin le 30 bliain anuas, agus ní ceart dúinn staonadh pioc ón aidhm sin. Tá daoine ann a deir gur ceart dhá-theangachas a bheith ann ach sílim féin gur ceart dúinn i gcomhnaí ár n-intinn a dhíriú ar an bpríomh-rud, sé sin, an Ghaeilge a chur ar ais á labhairt ag gach duine sa tír.  Má bhíonn Béarla aca, tá sé sin ceart go leor ach an príomh-rud muintir na hÉireann a bheith ábalta an Ghaeilge a labhairt, a scríobhadh agus a léamh. Ba cheart don Roinn Oideachais gach cabhair agus cuidiú a thabhairt don aidhm sin.</P>
      <P>Is mór an trua an rud a dúirt an t-iar-Aire Tailte&mdash;dúirt Teachta eile an rud céanna anuraidh&mdash;i dtaobh &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo;.  Nil sé sin fíor.  Sé an riail atá ag an Roinn Oideachais ná, nuair atá an t-oide ábalta eolas a mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge agus nuair is féidir leis na daltaí an t-eolas sin a shú isteach, ní go dtí sin is ceart ábhair mar uimhríocht, stair agus tír-eolas a mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Luaigh an t-iar-Aire Tailte nach raibh dul ar aghaidh chomh maith i labhairt na Gaeilge déanta againn agus ba mhaith leis.  Cé go bhfuil cuid den fhírinne san méid a dúirt sé, ní fíor a rá nach bhfuil dul chun cinn ar bith déanta le 30 bliain.  Tá a lán dul chun cinn déanta i labhairt, léamh agus scríobh na Gaeilge.  De bhárr na hoibre a cuireadh isteach i múineadh na <Col N="525" /> Gaeilge ins na scoltacha, forbairt na Gaeilge ag na buíonta go léir mar Chonnradh na Gaeilge, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, ., tá feabhas mór tagaithe ar an nGaeilge, ach níl an dul chun cinn do réir an méid oibre a cuireadh isteach san iarracht.  Sílim féin gur ins na scoltacha is féidir an leigheas a fháil ar an scéil sin.  Aontaím go bhfuil barraíocht béime curtha ar seríobh na Gaeilge, ar ghramadach na Gaeilge, agus b'fhéidir ar léitheoireacht na Gaeilge ins na bun-scoltacha.  Nuair a caitear barraíocht ama le gramadach, scríobh agus léamh d'fhoghlaim, níl an t-am le sparáil ar an gelár do shíor-chomhrá Gaeilge, agus is tré shíor-chómhrá is féidir an Ghaeilge do phiocadh suas agus a fhoghlaim ar an dóigh is fearr.  Piocann na páistí suas teanga an teallaigh ó chómhrá an athar agus na máthar agus ó bhaill den teaghlach.</P>
    <P>Sé an prionsabal is ceart a úsáid ná an prionsabal céanna sna bun-scoileanna, sé sin, cómhrá idir an t-oide agus na daltaí, cómhrá idir na daltaí iad féin, drámaí agus mar sin de, agus dá bhféadfaí níos mó ama a thúirt do labhairt na Gaeilge sna bun-scoileanna is fearr an t-eolas agus is suimiúla spéis na bpáistí dá bharr sin.  Cuireann sé déistean orthu bheith ag plé le ceisteanna gramadaí sa gceathrú rang nó sa geúigiú rang agus nuair a thosnaíonn said ar scríobh, caitheann siad, sul a dtosnaíonn siad ar rud ar bith a chur ar pháipéar, eolas maith a bheith acu ar an rud sin i dtosach.</P>
    <P>Sílim féin nach ceart Gaeilge scríofa a bheith ar siúl ag páistí bun-scoile go dtí an tríú nó b'fhéidir, an ceathrú rang agus nach ceart tosnú ar léamh na Gaeilge go dtí an tríú rang.  Thabharfadh  sé sin cuidiú an-mhór do labhairt na Gaeilge.  Sin í an aidhm atá againn, an Ghaeilge do chur dá labhairt go líofa.  Nuair a bheas eolas acu gur féidir leo an Ghaeilge do labhairt go líofa, beidh níos mó suime acu i scríobh, léamh, gramadach, agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart don Roinn agus don Aire euidiú leis na háiteacha ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge beo bríomhar&mdash;an Ghaeltacht agus an Bhreach-Ghaeltacht.  Má tá an rud adúirt an Teachta Cárthaigh fíor: go bhfuil ag teipeadh ar na <Col N="526" /> gairm-scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht agus gur gá i geontaethe áirithe na hoidí gairm-scoileanna agus na hoidí páirt-aimsire do chur ar ceal, is ole an rud é go mór mhór má tharlaíonn sé sa Ghaeltacht.  Is brónach liom a rá ón eolas atá agam féin mar gheall ar an mbaint atá agam le coiste gairm-oideachais le bliain anuas i dTír Chonaill go bhfuil an scéal sin amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Gearradh go mór ar dheontais na Roinne le haghaidh na gcoistí gairm-oideachais agus tarlaíonn sin an uair is gá breis cuidithe a thúirt don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghaeilge.  Ba cheart don Aire rud éigin a dhéanamh. Má théann an tAire isteach sa scéal tchifidh sé na moltaí a rinneadh leis an iar-Aire ar an bpointe sin.</P>
    <P>Is ins na contaethe iartharacha atá an leathnú mór ag teacht ar ghairm-oideachais anois agus an rud atá go maith do chontae amháin mar Bhaile Atha Cliath, nó contae ar bith eile, ní ceart an scéal céanna agus an túirt amach céanna airgid a thúirt do chontae nach bhfuil ach ag tosnú ar nós Thír Chonaill agus Contae na Gaillimhe. Tógadh na scoileanna gairm-oideachais i dTír Chonaill tuairim is deich mbliain ó shoin agus nílimid ach leath-bealaigh leis an obair sin fós.</P>
    <P>Pé rud is féidir leis an Aire agus leis an Roinn Oideachais a dhéanamh chun cuidiú leis an Ghaeltacht, is ceart dóibh sin a dhéanamh.  Cuidiú amháin atá dhá thúirt don Ghaeltacht le mórán blianta is ea deontas an chúig phúnt.  Sílim go bhfuil na cigirí ró-chruaidh ar fad sna scrúdaithe le haghaidh na ndeontas seo.  Má tá teaghlach sa Ghaeltacht a bhfuil duine amháin ann nach labhrann an Ghaeilge de bharr cuis amháin nó cúis eile, b'fhéidir nach raibh sé i ndon dul ar scoil, ach is leor sin de réir na Roinne gan an deontas do thúirt don dalta sin.  I gcás na Gaeltachta, sílim féin gur ceart an deontas a thúirt do na páistí go léir.</P>
    <P>Ní fíor a rá go bhfuil páistí de 14 bliana d'aois ag fágáil na scoile gan eolas acu ar labhairt na Gaeilge. Tugaim faoi deara i ngach cuid den tír, nuair a stopaim agus nuair a labhraim le páistí den aois sin in nGaeilge gur féidir leis an bpáiste iarracht ana-mhaith <Col N="527" /> ar fad a dhéanamh, fiú amháin i gceantair Ghalltachta, chun an teanga do labhairt agus freagraí a thabhairt ar na ceisteanna.  Ach, idir 14 bliana agus 17 bliana cailleann na páistí mórán den mhéid Gaeilge a d'fhoghluim siad ar scoil, fiú amháin páistí atá ag dul go dtí na scoileanna gairm-oideachais. Sílim gur gá do na scoileanna gairm-oideachais béim níos mó do chur ar mhúineadh na Gaeilge.  Is féidir mórán do dhéanamh do chúis na Gaeilge nuair a fhágann na leanaí sin an bhun-scoil.  Is fíor nach dtéann gach páiste ar scoil gairm-oideachais mar níl ár ndóthain scoileanna den tsórt sin againn ach ba chóir don pháiste gan a ligean dó féin imeacht ar fad ó fhoghlaim agus ó labhairt na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Do rinneadh moltaí chun trí ábhar nua do chur ar chlár na mbun-scoileanna. Is maith agus is úsáideach agus is riachtanach go mbeadh eolas ag páistí na hÉireann ar an Nádúir. Is maith, freisin, an ghleacaíocht.  Mar sin féin, cuimhnigh ar an méid atá le déanamh cheana féin sa mbun-scoil. Tá a lán de na hábhair ar an gclár riachtanach.  Cuimhnigh go bhfuil dhá theanga á múineadh&mdash;scríobh agus labhairt na Gaeilge agus an rud céanna i mBéarla, agus mar sin de. Ní fheicim féin gur féidir an t-am do sparáil don dhá ábhar eile sin, an Nádúir-eolaíocht agus an ghleacaíocht. Ceapaim féin nach cheart don Roinn iarracht a dhéanamh ar líníocht a chur ar chlár na mBun-scoileanna ar chor ar bith, bíodh sé éigeantach nó neamh-éigeantach.  Ní haon mhaitheas a rá gur féidir an t-am a bhaint ó ábhar éigin eile.  Má theastaíonn ón Roinn na hábhair bhreise sin do chur ar an gelár ní foláir di a bheith beacht faoi.  Ní foláir dóibh a rá go bhfuil sé riachtanach uair an chloig sa tseachtain a thúirt don Nadúir-eolaíocht a mhúineadh, mar shampla, agus gur féidir an uair an chloig sin sa tseachtain a thógaint ón ábhar seo nó ón ábhar siúd.  Muna ndéantar é sin, déarfainn nach féidir leis na scoileanna na hábhair sin do mhúineadh.</P>
    <P>Tá rud anseo agam a dúirt an Teachta Díolún ar an 24 Aibreán, 1957.  Ag <Col N="528" /> colún 180, den Tuairisc Oifigiúil, léimíd an méid seo a dúirt sé nuair a bhí sé ag caint ar Mheastachán na Roinne Tailte:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As I listened to his statement to-day, it struck me that he was still suffering from a certain nostalgia for ministerial prizes which have been denied not only to him but to Deputy Corry as well.  I must say it makes me blush to realise how great an army desired to succeed me&mdash;but that is one of the afflictions of agriculture in this country.  Every national teacher, every doctor, every pharmaceutical chemist, every engineer, every lawyer, every tram conductor, thinks he knows all about agriculture.  Now, which one of these particular categories of persons would not be intensely indignant if the farmer went in and told him how to run his chemist's shop, his dispensary or his school?  Yet all of them feel that they have full and adequate qualifications for going in on any farmer's land, large or small, and explaining to him how he could make his fortune if only he would do what he was told.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ní théann timpeall 80 fén gcéad de pháistí na tíre go dtí aon scoil ach amháin an bhun-scoil.  Sa mbun-scoil gheibheann siad an t-oideachas a chabhraíos leo sa tsaol nuair a fhágfas siad an scoil.  Faoi láthair, is féidir le hoide scoile, gan eolas ar an nádúir a bheith ar chlár na scoile mar ábhair chor ar bith, múineadh do thabhairt ar thalmhaíocht do na páistí&mdash;nílim ag caint anois ar an smaoineamh chun an t-ábhar sin do chur ar an gclár. In obair na scoile bíonn ar an múinteoir na ceachtanna do mhíniú do na páistí agus ansin iad do phlé leo agus, sa mhíniú agus sa phlé sin, is féidir leis an múinteoir go leor eolais a thúirt ar thalmhaíocht do pháistí na tíre. Is féidir leis é sin a dhéanamh agus is riachtanach gur féidir leis é do dhéanamh.  Einne a déarfadh, fé mar a dúirt an Teachta Díolún an tseachtain seo chaite, nach ceart go dtabharfadh oide bun-scoile comhairle d'fheirmeoir, tá sé ag caint tríd a hata.</P>

      <P>Ní fheicim é sin ón méid a léigh mé amach cúpla nóiméad ó shin.  Nuair a bhíos oide ag múineadh uimhríochta, is féidir leis eolas maith a thabhairt mar gheall ar churadóireacht, agus mórán rudaí i dtaobh talmhaíochta.</P>
      <P>Muna n-aontaíonn an Roinn ábhair eile do ghearradh amach as clár na scoile, ní dóigh liom gur féidir an Nádúir-eolaíocht do chur ar an gclár mar ábhar scoile gan dochar do dhéanamh do na hábhair atá ar an gclár cheana féin.  B'féidir go mbeadh am le spáráil, ach ní dóigh liom é.</P>
      <P>Dúirt an Teachta Ó Neachtain go raibh na tuismuitheoirí a casadh air ag gearán mar gheall ar an gclár scoile agus ar an méid eolais a bhí á thúirt ins na scoileanna.  Cén fath nár chuir sé ceist ar na páistí a chas air?  Gheobhadh sé amach nach raibh an scéal chomh dona agus ba mhaith leis é dhéanamh amach anseo.  Dúirt sé gur chuir sé ceisteanna ar na páistí maidir le &ldquo;literary works&rdquo; a bhí dhá léamh aige féin ins an scoil náisiúnta fadó.  Geallaimse dhó go bhfuil cuid de na &ldquo;literary works&rdquo; a bhí ins na scoilleanna náisiúnta i mblian 1920, nó mar sin, imithe ar shlí na firinne fadó.</P>
      <P>Tugtar eolas maith do na daltaí maidir le scríobh, áireamh agus tíreolas agus gí nach n-aontaím leis an scrudú bun-teastais, cruthuíonn torthaí an scrúduithe sin go bhfuil an caighdeán an-árd ag na páistí a fuair pas ins an scrúdú sin.  Ni aointíonn sé sin leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Ó Neachtain. Buníonn sé na rudaí a luaigh sé ar an bhfaisnéis a fuair sé ó na tuismuitheoiri, ach sílim nach bhfuil an t-eolas sin i gceart aige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rud eile a luaigh sé: &ldquo;the signatories of the Easter Week Proclamation&rdquo;. Sin rud a bhí i gceist go minic ins na díospóireachtaí ar an Vóta seo.  Sé nós atá acu i gcuid de na scoileanna, an chéad tréimhse den stair a thógaint <Col N="530" /> i mbliain amháin, sin é an tréimhse go dtí Teicheadh na nIarlaí, agus tógtar an tréimhse ón am sin go dtí an lá inniu an bhliain ina dhiaidh sin.  Ní múintéar stair na tíre seo ó 1913 go dtí an lá inniu ach aon uair in dhá bhliain agus ag deire chlár na mbliana sin.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh eolas níos fearr ag páistí an lae inniu ar &ldquo;modern history&rdquo; mar a tugtar air, ná mar atá.</P>
    <P>Sin moladh a dheineas cheana go mba ceart go múinfí an tréimhse sin gach aon bhliain.  Chuirfeadh sé sin feabhas ar an eolas atá ag an aos óg ar an tréimhse sin dár staire agus do bheadh sé acu níos fearr ná atá anois.</P>
    <P>Sean-cheist í seo, ceist na múintéoirí a chuaidh ar pinsean tar éis 1950. Ní gá a luadh arís an obair a rinneadar ar son oideachais, ar son na teangan agus ar son na tíre nuair a bhí an obair riachtanach.  Chuaidh siad ar pinsean ach toisc gur tháinig siad amach roimh an aonú lá d'Eanáir, 1950, ní bhfuair siad pinsean ar bith ar dtúis; ansin fuair siad cuid amháin; in a dhiaidh sin, fuair siad trian eile. Sílim más ceart an trian a thabhairt dóibh gur ceart an trian eile a thabhairt dóibh.  Má tá ceart mórálach ann ní haon mhaitheas bheith a rá go bhfuil gantannas airgid ann.  Tá airgead le fáil i gcóir rudaí eile nach bhfuil chomh riachtanach san.

Fuair siad an t-airgead ar ais nuair a chuaidh oidí óga amach ag teagaisc agus sílim go mba cheart cloí leis an sean-nós sin agus mholfainn don Aire an cheist sin a bhreithniú arís.</P>
      <P>Dúirt an t-iar-Aire go raibh an Coisde Oideachais tar éis staidéir a dhéanamh ar pháistí bun-scoil agus ar chlár na mbun-scoil go dtí an dara bhliain déag, ag déanamh staidéir ar chlár na meán-scol agus bun-oideachais ón aos sin amach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sé an rud a bhí im intinn agam nuair bunaíodh an coisde seo go raibh tuairim éigin ann chun leanúint den rud atá ar siúl sa mBreatain&mdash;11-plus an Grammar School.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil rath tagaithe ar an scéim sin sa Bhreatain.  Níl na buntáistí a shíl siad i dtosach ag teacht.  Aontuím leis an iar-Aire nuair deir sé go bhfuil an córas oideachais sa tír seo go maith. Tá sé go maith.  Tá lochtanna anseo agus annsúd.  Níl córas oideachais ar bith sa domhan nach bhfuil lochtanna air agus lochtanna níos mó ná mar atáar chóras oideachais na tíre seo, agus is féidir gan an córas atá againn d'atharú ar chor ar bith ach na lochtanna a chur ar ceal.  Is córas maith oideachais an córas atá ins na bun-scoltacha agus is maith liom fheiceáil gur thug an tAire moladh do na múinteoirí atá i bhfeidhil bun-oideachais na hÉireann. Tá an moladh sin tuilte aca.  Is le déanaí a fuaireadar scoileanna níos fearr.  D'obair siad ar feadh i bhfad <Col N="532" /> i scoileanna nach raibh go maith.  I dtús báire, ni raibh na scoileanna mar ba chóir.  Ní raibh na gléasanna ceart aca.  Ní raibh an Ghaeilge ag mórán aca agus, maidir le tuarastal, ní raibh sé sin go ró-mhaith ach oiread.</P>
    <P>Nuair a smaoiníonn duine ar na deacrachtaí go léir a bhí ann, níl iontas ar bith orm go dtugann an tAire moladh do na múinteoirí agus tá cuid mhaith den mholadh sin tuilte ag na meán-mhúinteoirí agus, go speisialta, ag na múinteoirí gairm-oideachais. Táim ar choisde gairm-oideachais le bliain anuas agus chím fhéin go bhfuil obair an-mhaith á déanamh ag gairm-mhúinteoirí ar fud na tíre agus go speisialta ar fud na tuaithe in áiteanna a bhfuil gá níos mó le gairm-oideachas.  Téann siad amach ist oíche tar éis obair lae a dhéanamh.  Bíonn ranganna aca i hallaí nach bhfuil go ró-shláintiúil. Téann siad ar aghaidh leis an obair agus tá toradh na hoibre sin le feiceáil i measc muintir na tíre.  Chítear daoine a bhí ag freastal ranganna adhmadoíreachta ins na gairm-scoltacha ag feabhsú tithe agus ag feabhsú tithe na bhfeirmeacha agus ag déanamh mórán oibre den chineál sin.  In áiteanna a dtéann na daoine go tíortha eile, ní ualach ar bith ortha eolas ar adhmadóireacht agus rudaí eile bheith aca.  Cuidíonn sé leo nuair a théann siad i gcéin.</P>
    <P>Níl a lán eolais le fáil ó ráiteas an Aire.  Is trua liom go bhfuil laghdú tagaithe ar an méid airgid a bhéas le fáil i mbliana don ghairm-oideachas. Is mór an trua é sin.  Tuigim nach bhfuil leigheas air, ach ní cheart an laghdú sin maireachtaint i bhfad.  Is maith liom a chloisint go ndéanfaidh an tAire a mhór-dhícheall chun breis airgid a chur ar fáil chó luath is féidir é.</P>
    <P>Nil an tAire fada go leor i bhfeidhil na hAireachta le go mbeifí ag súil go mbeadh eolas aige ar gach aon roinn d'obair na hAireachta.  Tá a lán oibre le déanamh ins an Aireacht sin, obair atá fóinteach don tír agus do mhuintir na tíre.  Pé aca a fhanann siad sa bhaile, nó a fhaigheann siad obair sa bhaile, nó pé aca a théann siad thar lear, is maith an rud oideachas maith a bheith aca.  Is gádh é sin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> Deir mórán daoine gur mór an tsuim £13,000,000 a chaitheamh ar oideachas. Aontaím leis an Aire gur tairbheach an rud airgead a chaitheamh ar oideachas. Má caitear airgead chun oideachas a thúirt don aos óg, na daoine a bheidh i bhfeighil cúrsaí na tire seo ins an am atá le teacht, gí nach mbeidh an toradh le feiceáil go luath, beidh an toradh le fáil ar ball agus fé chéad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this important Vote, we must decide whether we are on the side of idealism or the side of realism.  We all appreciate and value idealism, but, having regard to the problems that confront the people at the present time, particularly the school children, it is important to concentrate more on realities rather than to wish for something that in our time cannot be achieved.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers, I think it only fair that I should say to the Minister that I have nothing to which to draw his attention, in view of the fact, as he stated in his introductory speech, that he has been in office only for a short time.  I will be looking forward at the end of 12 months to seeing what the Minister has achieved.  In relation to the subjects before us, much has been said about national schools, or as we term them in the country and as they are so well known in other areas, the primary schools.  One speaker earlier in the debate deplored the lack of vocational schools in a certain part of the country.  In South Cork, vocational schools are not plentiful; they are few and far between.  Because we have not the advantages of many vocational schools, I think we should concentrate more on the problems relating to primary schools.  In passing, I think it is fair to pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor for the part he played in trying to provide new primary schools more rapidly and in trying to improve some of the schools which were not in too bad a condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we discuss education in this country, undoubtedly one of the biggest problems in the rural areas is the problem of very bad national schools. How long we must put up with the present position of having so many of them in a bad state is hard for anyone to say.  For the last few years, we <Col N="534" /> have been told that the financial problems facing the country are so bad that we will have to forget about schools. We cannot, or we do not want to forget our own schooldays and in relation to those days, we can always remember the condition of the buildings in which we had to spend so many hours from Monday to Friday.  If the schools were bad in our times and if our parents were anxious to have them improved, we must continue with that line of thought and try to speed up their improvement.</P>
    <P>Deputies Norton and Blowick and other Deputies mentioned a problem that people are discussing every day, the question of compulsory Irish. Deputy Norton explained the views of the Labour Party on this and I agree with every word he said.  As one who has at all times taken an interest in the Irish language, I believe that compulsory methods in any subject have never paid dividends in any direction. I understand that many people, even middle-aged people, of the 1920 and 1921 period, went to Irish classes at a time when it was unpopular to learn Irish.  Nowadays, the position seems to be reversed.  Of course, we can hardly expect to get children, at a tender age, to understand the vital importance of learning their own language. It is hard to say what is wrong, but there is this problem.  I have known children who were learning all subjects through the medium of Irish up to a certain stage.  They find themselves in difficulties at home because their parents cannot help them in relation to what we term their &ldquo;tables&rdquo;.  Their parents are anxious to give them that help but they do not understand Irish.  This is a perpetuation of something which we had hoped to get rid of for some years, but I am afraid we will not be successful, if we continue in the way we have been going for the past 35 years.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should admit that it is about time we examined the whole system.  There is nothing wrong with examining not alone the system itself but the results of it during that period of time.  Some Deputies seemed to be worried about the overall standard of education of children at the present time.  I do not know <Col N="535" /> if they are right because it is very hard to come to any decision in this respect.  There are a few bright pupils in each class and the danger is that the teacher is inclined&mdash;and we cannot blame him if he has a large number of boys and girls to teach&mdash;to base the standard of ability not on the lowest but on the brightest pupil in the class. Because a few boys and girls are able to grasp the different points explained by the teacher, then it seems, unfortunately, that the other pupils struggle along from one term to another, never hoping to be able to catch up on some of the subjects that have been discussed and never hoping to be able to understand half of what they should know when the school term is over.</P>
    <P>All of that seems to be coupled with the unnatural desire for getting good examination results.  Nothing seems to trouble the parents or the teachers but examination results, but of course it does trouble the pupils.  From primary and intermediate to leaving certificate, the accent is on examinations. The danger in concentrating on examinations is to channel the mind of the pupil into a certain line of thought in order to be able to answer certain questions when sitting for examinations. That, in itself, I believe, is weakening the whole standard of education of the rank and file of boys and girls going to the primary schools and probably some of them afterwards in the secondary schools.  They are so anxious to secure results that many other subjects, such as the agricultural subjects mentioned by Deputy Blowick, are forgotten.</P>
    <P>It is more important that children having acquired a solid foundation in the primary school, should be made to understand that in their everyday lives in the future they can improve their educational standard by reading, writing and understanding the experiences of daily life.  By connecting educational matters with thoughts of idealism&mdash;in themselves, very fine&mdash;I believe we are keeping both the minds of the children and of their parents away from the hard facts of everyday life.  These are the hard facts that will confront these young people when they <Col N="536" /> are looking for jobs in five or six years time.</P>
    <P>Every member of every Party here deplores the thought of emigration. Unfortunately, many of our men and women must of necessity emigrate. Are we prepared to say that it is vitally important for them to be educated in such a way that they can hope to succeed in other countries?  We know that that is not true at the moment.  I believe that in the minds of the boys and girls going to school here at present we have material equal to the best of boys and girls in any other country.  Furthermore, by concentrating on Irish as a subject, I believe they can improve their knowledge of it.  At the same time, they can concentrate on the other subjects in the same manner as was done under the old system, and, as a result, there will be no weakness in such subjects as reading and writing in the English language and mathematics.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if it would be possible, as a result of discussions he may have with officials of his Department and school authorities in the coming 12 months, to find out the overall effects of the primary and intermediate examinations.  I am not referring to their effects on those who succeed in passing those examinations, but to their effects on those who cannot keep up with the successful students.  Deputy Blowick spoke about the importance of having an agricultural bias in our educational system. I was glad to note from the Minister's speech that about 13 per cent. of the overall amount of the Estimates was being allowed for education.  We would all like a lot more but nevertheless that percentage is not bad.  Over the years, we have not fallen back, so far as education is concerned.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Blowick, what strikes me most forcibly about agriculture in education is this.  In counties such as Cork, instead of people being anxious to take advantage of the agricultural bias in the national school, a most alarming situation has developed. Students who are successful in county council examinations are not prepared to take scholarships in agriculture.  If education is to help concentrate attention <Col N="537" /> on the importance of rural life, it is vitally important that the people themselves should understand the advantages to be derived under our educational system.  It is amazing, but nevertheless true, that farmers could not advise their children to accept scholarships in agriculture.</P>
    <P>We realise that everyone benefits from the money expended on education. It embraces the boys and girls at primary schools, vocational schools, secondary schools, colleges and the universities.  There is one feature we cannot forget.  If we compare the amount of money spent per head on primary education as against university education, we find a most interesting result.  In regard to primary education, the parents of the boys and girls attending primary schools know the advantages to be derived from it; but there are many people taking advantage of State-sponsored university education who do not realise they owe a debt to the community.  If we had in some of these educational establishments some of the spirit shown by that outstanding body of educationists, the Irish Christian Brothers, perhaps this country would be the better for it. Not only in the universities but also in some of the colleges, &ldquo;snobocracy&rdquo; reigns supreme.  These people seem to forget that they are State subsidised to a certain extent.  In return for the money we are providing for them, we expect from these people the same acknowledgment of what they owe the country as we expect from the unfortunate boys and girls who never go beyond the primary school and who have to emigrate, if unable to find jobs at home.  That is the tragedy of education in this country.  We must have a clear understanding of the obligations of the State, the students and the parents of the students.  Only in that way can we understand how the problem should be tackled.</P>

      <P>Sílim gurb é an rud is measa a bhaineann le córas oideachais an lae inniu ná go bhfuil an iomarca le déanamh ag na hoidí.  Sé an Taoiseach é féin a dúirt gur fearr beagáinín a dhéanamh agus an beagáinín sin a dhéanamh go maith.  Ní mó ná sin is féidir a dhéanamh ins na <Col N="538" /> bun scoileanna.  Más féidir leis na páistí léamh, scríobh, áireamh agus labhairt na Gaeilge a dhéanamh go maith nuair atá siad ag fágaint na scoileanna, beidh obair mhaith déanta ag na hoidí.</P>
      <P>Go mór mhór ó tháinig an teastas bun-oideachais isteach, tá na páisti ag fágaint na scoileanna i bhfad níos luaithe: tá siad á bhfágaint anois nuair atá dhá bhliain déag slánaithe aca.  Chomh luath agus tá an scrúdú déanta aca, fágann siad na scoileanna. Téann cuid aca isteach ins na scoileanna gairm-oideachais; téann cuid eile cuig na meán-scoileanna; ach tá a gcuid oideachais críochnuithe ag an bhformhór nuair a gheibheann siad an Teastas Bun Oideachais.  Má tá na páistí seo i ndon léamh, scríbhneoireacht, áireamh agus labhairt na Gaeilge a dhéanamh go maith, tá obair mhaith déanta ag na hoidí.</P>
      <P>Bhéinn an-bhuidheach de dá mbeadh sé ar chumas an Aire rud éigin a dhéanamh i dtaobh na bpinsinéirí. Rinne siadsan obair mhaith ar son a dtíre agus is mór an náire don tír é go bhfuil an scéal amhlaidh acu.  Ba mhaith liom chomh maith go mbeadh céim ollscoile le fáil ag múinteoirí agus iad ag teacht amach as na coláistí tréin-éala. Ba cheart go mbeadh sé furasta é sin a dhéanamh.  Tá na cáilíochta agus an caighdeán san oideachas acu agus ba cheart céim a thabhairt dóibh. Sílim freisin go mbeadh baint níos dlúithe idir na trí rannóga san roinn oideachais Brainse an Bhun-Oideachais, Brainse an Ghairm-Oideachais agus Brainse an Mheán-Oideachais.  Laithreach tá deighilt mhór eatarthu.  Tá, freisin, ceist na bpaistí atá mall ag foghlaim.  Tá na ranganna ró-mhór dóibh sin ins na bun-scoileanna agus tá na páistí sin fágtha i leath-taoibh. Ba cheart go mbeadh seans níos fearr ag na páistí sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an gcigireacht ins na scoileanna, go mór mhór i geás na noidí óga, tá sé riachtanach go dtaispeánfadh na cigirí dóibh conas ba cheart an obair a dhéanamh in ionad tuarascáil a chur síos i leabhar an chigire.  Dá dtaispeánadh sé don oide céard atá ag teastáil uaidh, dhéanfadh sé i bhfad Éireann níos fearr.  Tá gearán le <Col N="539" /> déanamh agam i dtaoibh múineadh na staire.  Faoi láthair tá ar na múinteoirí stair ón ré chloiche anuas go dtí an lá atá inniu ann a mhúineadh taobh istigh de chúpla blian.  Sílim go mbeadh seans níos fearr acu obair mhaith a dhéanamh dá mbeadh orthu an stair ón ochtú aois anuas go dtí an lá inniu a mhúineadh, go mbeadh tuiscint níos fearr ag na páistí air agus go mbeadh dul chun chinn níos tuisciní ins an ábhar.  Rud eile fós, ba mhaith liom go rachadh an tAire i gcomhairle leis na múinteoirí níos minicí fá na ceisteanna éagsúla.</P>

      <P>Aontaím leis na smaointe a nocht an tAire nuair a dúirt sé go mba cheart do mhuintir na tíre suim níos mó a bheith acu i gcúrsaí oideachais.  Is ceart a rá nach bhfuil formhór na dtuismuitheoirí chomh cúntach nó chomh cabhrach agus ba cheart doibh a bheith.  Ní chuireann siad a ndóthain suime ins na scoileanna, cioca iad na bun-scoileanna, na scoileanna gairm-oideachais nó na meán-scoileanna.  Sílim gur féidir le muintir na tuaithe i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh chun cabhrú leis na scoileanna agus go mor mhór gur féidir le cumainn mar Mhuintir na Tíre agus na Feirmeoirí Óga i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh ins an obair seo. B'fhéidir go bhfuil siad mí-shásta agus ní fheadar cén áit a bhfuil an locht&mdash; an iad na scannáin, na nuachtáin nó na leabhra atá ag dul ar fud na tíre. Pé scéal é, b'fhéidir leis na cumainn a luaigh mé níos mó a dhéanamh chun daoine óga a dhéanamh níos sásta ná mar atá siad.</P>
      <P>Maidir le gairm-oideachas, in iarthar Luimnuigh, tá easpa mhór scoileanna againn go mor mhór i mbailte mar Ráth Caola agus Cill Mocheallog. Rinne an coiste contae obair mhaith ach ní bhfuair siad cead go fóill scoileanna a chur ar bun ins na bailtí sin.  Dá bhrí sin, tá ar cuid de na páistí sé míle a chur uatha chun freastal ar scoileanna gairm-oideachais. Ba cheart go mbeadh seans níos mó chun gairm-oideachas a fháil ag na buachailli agus na cailíni óga ins na bailte agus ins na sraid-bhailte.  Sílim go mba cheart dúinn níos mó múinteóirí taistil a sholáthar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> Ba mhaith liom tagairt bheag a dhéanamh don teastas bun-oideachais. Sílim nár cheart chuile dhalta atá sa séú rang a chur isteach ar an scrudúchán seo.  Tá na múinteoirí macánta go leor na daltaí a phiocadh. Ní déanann sé aon dochar do na daltaí an scruducháin seo a dhéanamh ró-luath ina saol scoláireachta.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bunaíodh an scrúdú seo, sílim go raibh sé oiriúnach do pháistí cheithre bliana déag d'aois; ach ós rud é gur leathnaigh an meán-oideachais ar fuid na tíre, agus go bhfuil meán-scoileanna ag éirí flúirseach anois tá páistí na mbun-scoileanna ag imeacht, roimh ceithre bliana deag d'aois, agus tá siad ag dul go dtí na meán-scoileanna, más rud é go bhfuil ceann sa cheantar, nó téann siad go gairm-scoileanna, cé go bhfuil siad ann le tamall.</P>
    <P>Sin é an fáth go n-aibríonn daoine fé láthair nach bhfuil an t-oideachas céanna ar na páistí as na bun-scoileanna atá ag imeacht as na scoileanna.  Ní dóigh liom go n-aontaíonn a lán de na daoine leis an tuairim sin ar fad. Is íontach an rud é anois an méid páistí a théann go dtí na meán-scoileanna agus go dtí na hollscoileanna.  Tá fhios againn go bhfuil méadú mór ansin. Ní dóigh liom go dtaisbeánann sé sin aon rud ach go bhfuil dul ar aghaidh tagaithe ar oideachas sa tír seo.</P>
    <P>Labhair Teachta ansin i dtaobh &ldquo;rural bias&rdquo; ins na bun-scoileanna. Ni fheadar conus is féidir é sin a dhéanamh níos fearr ins na bun-scoileanna fé lathair ná mar atá sé. B'fhéidir gur féidir rud éigin a dhéanamh le leabhra níos oiriúnaí a chur ar fáil.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh foillsitheoir ábalta ceachta a chuir isteach ina na leabhra le go mbeadh siad sin ar fáil sa léitheoireacht.  Múineadh an &ldquo;rural science&rdquo; ins na scoileanna go dtí roinnt bliain ó shoin, ach ansin tháinig gluaiseacht níos géire ar an nGaeilge agus d'éirigh cuid mhaith de na scoileanna as.  Sílim gur mór an chabhair do ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge go mb'fhéidir leis an Aire agus leis an Roinn cabhair a thabhairt le paipéirí grinn mar &ldquo;Our Boys&rdquo; do chur ar fáil do na leanaí scoile. <Col N="541" /> Sílim gur mar sin a fhoghlaimíonn na páisti a lán de na rudaí a fhoghlaimíonn siad fé lathair&mdash;i bpáipéirí ar nós na &ldquo;comics&rdquo;.  B'fhéidir gur féidir rud éigin a dhéanamh leis na rudaí sin a chur go flúirseach ar fud na scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Aontaím leis an Teachta a dúirt go bhfuil cúrsaí na Gaeilge anois i slí gur féidir iad a dhéanamh ó bhun go barr ins na scoileanna. B'fhéidir gur féidir é sin a dhéanamh nios líofa, ach amháin na leabhair a húsaídtear sa scoil a bheith oiriúnach don leanbh.</P>
    <P>Ni dóigh liom go dtugann na daoine an chabhair is cóir do ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge, fé mar a tugadh ins na blianta a caitheadh.  Sa bhlian 1920, mar adúirt Teachta, bhíodh ainmneacha na ndaoine scríofa ós cionn na siopaí agus ar thaobhanna na gcairt.  Bhí na daoine ag tabhairt cabhair do ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge agus don náisiún.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an chabhair chéanna le fáil fé lathair.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na trí ábhair nua, ba mhaith an rud é go raghadh an Aireacht i gcomhairle leis na bainisteoirí agus na múinteoirí, go mór mhór ins na scoileanna tuaithe.  Ní féidir an caighdeán céanna a bheith ins na hábhair atá ann fé lathair agus ábhair nua a chur isteach.  Más rud é go mbíonn am le baint de ábhar amháin, is féidir linn a rá ansin nach mbeadh an caighdeán ins an ábhar sin chomh hard agus atá sé fé láthair.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ar chumas an Aire rud éigin a dhéanamh do shean-mhúinteoirí.  Sílim gur dhein siad san, ins an am atá thart, obair mhór ar son oideachas sa tír seo agus ar son an náisiúin.  Ós rud é nach bhfuil a lán fágtha anois, más féidir leis an Rialtas rud éigin a dhéanamh gheobhaidh siad buíochas na ndaoine.</P>

      <P>Dúirt an Teachta Ó Neachtain gur chuir sé an cheist ar dhaoine óga áirithe, faoi ainmneacha na ndaoine a chuir a naimneacha le Forfhógra na Poblachta i 1916 agus gur theip orthu sin na hainmneacha sin a lua.  Cad na thaobh gur chuir sé an cheist sin chucha, munar thuig sé go raibh ré nua tagaithe sa tir seo?  Má thuigimid mar sin é, <Col N="542" /> nach fíor gur cheart dúinn an rud seo a bheith ar aigne againn, gur Gael sinne?  Más mar sin atá an scéal againn, nár cheart dúinn, fé mar a dheineann siad i ngach tír féin ngréin, ár dteanga féin a bheith go maith againn agus í a mhúineadh ins na scoileanna?  Dá bhrí sin, níl sé ar na daoine óga ins na scoileanna againn inniu a dteanga fhéin a fhoghluim ar chlár na scoile, ach díreach mar a dheineann siad i ngach tír eile ar fuid an domhain, a bhfuil teanga fé leith aici.  Ní ceart a rá gur &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo; é sin.  Is rud nádúra é ár dteanga fhéin a bheith á múineadh ins na scoileanna.  Is dóigh liom fhéin go bhfuil obair an-mhaith á déanamh ins na scoileanna.  Chímíd an toradh sin sa Teach seo inniu agus chítear é amuigh nuair a bhíonn ár ndaoine óga ag cruinniú áirithe poiblí.  Is féidir leo a smaomte a nochtadh&mdash;a lán de na daoine óga, pé ar domhan é&mdash; in a dteanga féin.  Is maith an comharthá é sin.</P>
      <P>Na daoine óga atá ag fágaint na scoileanna anois bíonn eolas maith acu ar a dteangain féin ach ní cuirtear in úsáid í i gcónaí agus ní bhíonn an taithí acu é sin a dhéanamh.  Caithfaimid slí a thabhairt dóibh, ins na gluaiseachta atá sa tír seo, cruinnuithe den G.A.A., Connradh na Gaeilge, Muintir na Tíre, agus cumainn eile den tsaghas sin, úsáid a bhaint as a dteangain dúchais.</P>
      <P>Dubhras go minie gur cheapas go raibh na ceachtanna ins na bun-leabhair scoile ró-fhada ar fad, gur fearr ceacht gairid a bheith ann i dtreo is go mbeadh sé go maith ag na daltaí nuair a bheadh an ceacht thart.  Molaim é sin go mór mhór ins na scoileanna amuigh fén dtuaith nach bhfuil ach beirt mhúinteoirí iontu agus b'fhéidir, uaireanta, múinteoir amháin, chun ceathair nó cúig de ranganna a mhúineadh i dteann-ta a chéile, ag iarraidh ceacht a mhúineadh agus ag an am céanna súil a choimeád ar na daoine eile.  Is deacair dóibh puinn a dhéanamh má bhíonn ceacht mór fada ann.  Caithfidh sé na páistí a fhágáil leo féin ar feadh tamaill chun an ceacht a fhoghlaim tar éis an méid múineadh atá déanta aige a bheith i leath-taobh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Duirt daoine áirithe anseo go raibh <Col N="543" /> an iomarca scríbhneoireachta ann, ach cad a dhéanfaidh na daltaí eile nuair bheidh ceacht á mhúineadh ag an múinteoir don cúigiú nó don séú rang? Cad a dhéanfaidh an múinteoir ach na daoine eile a chur ag scríobh, agus má bhíonn siad ag scríobh beidh siad ag foghlaim na bhfocal a bheidh á scríobh acu?</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liom go bhfuilimid ag dul ar aghaidh go maith agus, le cúnamh Dé, má leantar ar an mbóthar chéanna, tiocfaidh an teanga ar ais sar i bhfad agus beidh grá ag páistí na tíre uirthi nuair a bheidh sí ag an athair agus an máthair sa tigh.  Cé nach mbeidh sí go líofa acu beidh eolas áirithe acu ar a dteangain féin agus beidh siad i ndon cabhair a thabhairt do na daoine óga atá ag fás suas.</P>
    <P>Very steady progress is being made with the Irish language.  It is not correct to call the teaching of Irish in our schools compulsory Irish any more than it is to call the teaching of French in France or of English in England compulsory French or compulsory English.  Surely, it is a natural thing for us to have our own language taught in our schools, not merely as a subject but as a medium of instruction and gradually developed according to the capacity of the teachers and the ability of the pupils to absorb what is being taught.  Those who condemn Irish and speak about &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; Irish are merely trying to discourage the teaching of Irish at all in the schools.  They want to place some obstacle in the way and so they aver that children are being needlessly forced to learn their own language. Children have to learn arithmetic.  They have to learn all the other subjects in the curriculum.  The teachers are obliged to teach these subjects.  We must accept the fact that we are Irish. Our schools are Irish schools.  Our land has its own traditions and, after years of bondage, we have come again into our own way of life.</P>
    <P>Many of the lessons in our prescribed books, both in Irish and in English, are far too long.  In many of the schools, especially in the rural areas, there are only two teachers.  Each teacher has <Col N="544" /> to teach four or five classes.  If he passes from one class to another, he has to rely on the children he has left to do a certain amount of work on their own.  If the lessons are long, he has not time to do a whole lot in the half hour.  He must, therefore, set the children to learning off the lesson on which he has given some instruction. In that way, he tries to get some results for his efforts.</P>
    <P>The textbooks need to be revised. There has been a complaint as to the unsatisfactory nature of the arithmetic in the higher standards.  It has been stated, too, that there is not a proper link between our various systems, between primary education, vocational education and secondary education. Surely there is such a link.  The basis of our whole educational system is primary education.  When that is completed, the child passes into the vocational school or the secondary school.  Children who have an aptitude for manual work will gravitate to the vocational school; those who are good at literary subjects will gravitate to the secondary school.  There is a definite link.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be quite impossible to correlate these three systems. Vocational teaching is very often given at night to students who actually work during the day.  The teachers have to travel around to various centres, sometimes in very bad weather and with very poor transport.  Some extra recognition is always given to those who work after normal hours and under difficult circumstances.  The children who pass on to secondary school eventually try for appointments in some of the State services, the Civil Service, the E.S.B., C.I.E., or with local authorities.  All children do not develop in the same way and all children cannot be educated for the same walk in life.  They will have to take their chance in the various occupations open to them and prepare themselves for them.  I think there is too much talk about the correlation of the systems of education because they all lead to different fields.  The national schools are the foundations of the whole lot and from them the pupils advance on the different roads which <Col N="545" /> lead them to a chance of an occupation in life.</P>
    <P>With regard to the primary schools, I agree with what Deputy Jones said. We had a good deal of talk to-day about the teaching of agricultural and rural science and subjects of that kind in the primary schools.  The time is not there for it.  He is quite right. We could have lessons in the various books dealing with the different aspects of these subjects.  If facilities were made available to teachers, they could have demonstrations in regard to the growing of plants perhaps in the school garden and these would be more effective than anything else.  At least, it would give the pupils a rudimentary knowledge of, or perhaps a taste for, these subjects which they could follow up subsequently in vocational schools, where the subject would be treated more exhaustively.</P>
    <P>We have not enough vocational schools.  Every village or town which has an industry should have a vocational school to cater for the boys and girls in that industry.  They would thus be enabled to carry out improvements or developments in that industry. They might perhaps improve the output of an article upon which they were working with regard to both its quality and design.</P>
    <P>It is not always necessary to build a new school; sometimes a building becomes available where a start could be made.  We heard some member from the West saying that they were waiting in two or three centres for 20 years for a vocational school.  If a suitable building became available in which a start could be made at small expense, expansion could come subsequently, but continuation education is very necessary to-day in a competitive world in order to have our children well trained and prepared for the battle of life.</P>
    <P>Some said that our standards are not as good as they are elsewhere. That depends on the way you look at the matter.  We have two languages in our national schools and there are very few countries in the world in which that position obtains.  Our children are trained bilingually.  That certainly takes a certain amount of <Col N="546" /> time; it takes a good deal of trouble and enthusiasm from both pupils and teachers.  During a visit which I made some years ago to the United States, I contacted some of the religious Orders there who deal with education. Some of them had been teaching in Ireland and had transferred to schools over there.  Their candid opinion was that fundamentally our system of education was as sound, and our pupils as bright, as those in any other country.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we see the examination papers and in some subjects the standard set might be a bit higher than in others; but if it is a question of developing the mind and training the individual to educate himself more fully subsequently by reading and the study of the various topics and by going to continuation schools and lectures, we have a population as readily able as any other to absorb that, with the fundamental training they get and with their national and religious outlook. I think we can be very proud of the standards of our people in that respect.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing which is very necessary at the moment.  In addition to a vocational school attached to every village or town where there is an industry, there is a great demand for technological education, particularly in chemistry, science and subjects of that type.  The development of industry calls for that day after day.  All that costs money, but where there is a will there is a way, and if we have any idea of keeping abreast of the times and educating our population in that way to meet the future, we should not neglect these things.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister, being a new man in the Department, will have a fresh approach to the whole subject. He will have the contacts necessary to apply his knowledge to the educational systems of this country in accordance with the needs of the people and I am sure that he will make a great success of that Department and of the sphere which is now in his charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill empowers Bord na Móna to borrow for capital purposes with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance by the creation of its own stock&mdash;stock which may be secured on the property of the Bord and which may be under-written and guaranteed by the Minister for Finance and which will rank as trustee securities.  The Bill empowers the board to raise money in that way to a total of £2,000,000 but it is not proposed to alter the limit of £14,000,000 which was authorised for turf development purposes under the Turf Development Acts of 1946 and 1953.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, it can be said that the provisions made in this Bill in respect of Bord na Móna are similar to those made in 1954 for the E.S.B.  In that year, the E.S.B. was authorised to borrow for capital purposes by the issue of stock in a similar way.  On that occasion I put forward the considerations which justified allowing the E.S.B. to have direct access to the capital market and the same considerations apply in respect of Bord na Móna.  The introduction of this Bill, therefore, in a sense represents a further development of the policy initiated by the E.S.B. Act, 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was prepared in the Department of Industry and Commerce during the time of the previous Government but it represents a further development of a policy with which I had some association and I want to make it clear that I am in complete agreement with that development.  I mentioned that under the earlier Turf Development Acts authority was given by the Dáil to expend through Bord na Móna for turf development purposes capital sums to the limit of £14,000,000.  Of the expenditure authorised by these Acts, £10,500,000 has already occurred and there is now unused authority available to the board of £3,500,000&mdash;£3.4 million to be <Col N="548" /> precise&mdash;which will be sufficient, so far as we can see at present, to cover the board's estimated requirements for a few years.  At the end of that time, new legislation will be required but it is perhaps not desirable to avail of this Bill to raise the limit because the Dáil may wish to have and should, I think, seek to have an opportunity of reconsidering the position when the £14,000,000 expenditure stage has been passed.</P>
    <P>The total estimated cost of the programmes which the board was authorised by the previous Acts to undertake was £20,000,000.  That expenditure was related to a turf development programme which aimed at the realisation of certain production targets by the year 1960.  The targets fixed for Bord na Móna under these earlier Acts, and which the £20,000,000 was provided to enable them to realise, involved the production of 900,000 tons of sod peat by 1960, 2,500,000 tons of milled peat, 50,000 tons of turf briquettes which the Lullymore factory is capable of producing, and providing for expanding production of peat moss as the market for it developed.  These targets, both for sod turf and milled peat were fixed in relation to an E.S.B. programme which at that time contemplated installed capacity by 1961 of 1,022 mwts. The programme for the construction of new generating capacity by the E.S.B., to which this turf development programme relates, was published to the Dáil early in 1954 and was approved of by the Dáil at that time.  By early last year it had become clear that the growth of demand for electric power here was contracting.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1955 the demand for current increased at an average annual rate of 13 per cent., that is, the amount of current required to meet the demand in each year was 13 per cent. higher than in the previous year, on the average.  The E.S.B. programme for the construction of new generating stations had to be based on the assumption that the expansion of demand would continue at that rate.  It became clear towards the end of 1955 or early 1956 that the rate of growth in the demand for current had fallen off.  Indeed, in 1956, demand for current <Col N="549" /> exceeded the demand for the previous year by only 7 per cent.  The E.S.B. therefore decided to revise its programme for the construction of new generating stations.  Its present programme, as revised, contemplates having installed capacity by 1961 of 728 mw. as compared with 1,022 mw. visualised in the 1954 programme.  That curtailment of the E.S.B.'s construction programme involved a revision of the Bord na Móna programme as well.</P>
    <P>A large part of the sod peat production and all of the milled peat production was designed to be used in power stations.  The alterations in the E.S.B. programme involved the deletion from it of new stations or the reduction in the size and capacity of other stations to an extent which meant a considerable diminution in the outlet that would be available for milled peat by 1960.  Of the new generating capacity dropped from the E.S.B.'s programme, 180 mw. was intended to be based upon milled peat.  The curtailment of the programme affected all the bogs designed for the production of milled peat.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps make it clear at this stage that I am not accepting that the growth in the demand for power will not expand again as, I hope, industrial development is accelerated, nor that the E.S.B.'s new generation programme should be based upon the 1955-56 experience.  I have not yet had an opportunity of going into the matter in the detail I would wish or of considering what further revision and extension of the E.S.B. programme may be required if the growth in the demand for power should recover.  It might be optimistic to hope that we could get back to the same rate of growth as was experienced before 1955 but some improvement on 1956 may, I think, with some confidence be anticipated. If there is an improvement to be expected then it is obviously necessary to have a look at the E.S.B. programme because we could not contemplate a situation arising in which possible industrial developments might have to be delayed or might be limited by any delay in supplying them with electric power.</P>
    <P>The particulars which I am now able <Col N="550" /> to give the House relate to the E.S.B.'s programme which is now authorised. As I have informed the House the programme will be reconsidered and it may be that I will have another opportunity of giving the House some further information regarding it because, apart altogether from any question of revising the programme, certain legislation affecting the E.S.B. must be introduced in the course of the year.  I have mentioned that when the 1953 Turf Development Act was being passed the targets contemplated for 1960, that is the outputs it was intended that Bord na Móna should be able to achieve in 1960, were 900,000 tons of sod turf and 2,500,000 tons of milled turf.</P>
    <P>The present targets for 1960 involved a slight increase in the output of sod turf in that year.  As against the 900,000 tons which it was intended they should by then produce, it is now to be 960,000 tons.  That arises by reason of the fact that the power stations which were designed to use sod turf, and in connection with which these sod turf bogs were developed, have proved to be substantially more efficient than was anticipated when they were designed.  Their output is greater and the requirements of fuel are larger than was originally contemplated. Consequently, Bord na Móna has to keep pace with that improvement in the performance of these stations and meet their full turf requirements which involves that slight increase by 1960 over the target originally set for that year.</P>
    <P>Of the 960,000 tons of sod turf which the board will be producing by 1960 more than half, 500,000 tons or over, will go to the generating stations at Portarlington, Allenwood and Lanes boro'.</P>
    <P>The big contraction which is now contemplated in Bord na Móna's production by 1960 will take place in milled peat.  As against 2,500,000 tons which it was estimated would be required by that year for the new E.S.B. stations, the present figure is 1,300,000 tons.  As I have said, if the demand for power expands-that will depend on the rate at which the national economy <Col N="551" /> develops-the rate of milled peat production will expand also, but I do not think it would now be practicable to aim in any circumstances at the achievement of the output of 2,500,000 tons of milled peat contemplated for 1960.  I do not think that target could now be realised, but I certainly hope that circumstances will make it necessary to expand the existing target of 1,300,000 tons.</P>
    <P>The contribution which Bord na Móna can make to our electric energy requirements is, therefore, in part postponed.  In the meantime we are continuing to depend heavily on imported fuel to meet these requirements. One of the matters that I think is worthy of examination is the economy of bringing the new milled peat-fired stations into production earlier than at present contemplated even if it might mean the reduced use&mdash;for a time&mdash;of existing stations designed to use imported fuel.</P>
    <P>That is a matter of arithmetic and I do not think anybody would contemplate at the present time incurring capital expenditure which was not obviously needed in that field.  Apart from the advantages and employment which would arise if we could justify bringing these milled peat stations which were dropped from the programme back into the programme again, there would be a clear gain in present circumstances if we could reduce or avoid the importation of fuel for the production of power.  I have made it clear that that is a matter for re-examination in my view.  I do not want to suggest that any conclusions have been reached.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another development of which I think the House already has some knowledge and that is towards the expansion of the production of turf briquettes.  In view of the alteration in the position of Bord na Móna which became necessary when the E.S.B. decided it was necessary to reduce its programme, the board put forward to the Government of the time, in May of last year, proposals for the establishment of additional briquetting capacity.  The board has, of course, been producing turf briquettes at <Col N="552" /> Lullymore since 1940.  Indeed before 1940 they were produced at Lullymore by a private company and there has been a steady growth in the demand for them.  They have secured public favour, and with the increasing cost of imported coal that favour becomes greater.  The plant at Lullymore has a maximum capacity of 50,000 tons a year and it is now working and will continue to work to that capacity, but that output is very far short of the potential demand for these briquettes.</P>
    <P>That demand has been growing in volume as the cost of coal rose.  The possibility of expanding production of briquettes was considered previously when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce and I received a report from Bord na Móna early in 1954 which seemed to show that the capital cost of a new factory for the production of briquettes would be so high as to make the briquettes uneconomic if sold at a price which would be economic at the then price of coal.</P>
    <P>That situation, I think, persisted during the whole of 1954 and, certainly during that period, as far as I can ascertain, it was the view of the board that the possibility of producing briquettes here in greater volume and selling them at an economic price did not exist.  They changed their mind in August, 1955.  By then the price of coal had risen to a point at which Bord na Móna considered that it would be possible to establish a new plant for their production and sell them at a price which would be so competitive with coal as to ensure a ready sale for them and in that month the board proposed to reconsider the position in view of the new circumstances that had arisen, that is to say, the higher price of coal which quite obviously was going to persist.</P>
    <P>At that time, however-and it is necessary that this point should be understood-the expectation that it would be necessary to curtail the E.S.B.'s programme had not arisen. At August, 1955, the E.S.B.'s 1954 programme stood unchanged and an examination of the position showed that increased briquette production could be undertaken only by cancelling one of the milled peat stations in that <Col N="553" /> programme, involving its replacement, as it was then considered, by an oil-burning station.  That proposal was turned down by my predecessor and on the assumption of the time, particularly the assumption that the 1954 E.S.B. programme was to be completed as planned, he took, I think, the right decision but, by March, 1956, the position had changed.  The E.S.B. had then decided that it was necessary to cut down considerably upon the 1954 generation programme and that revision involved the curtailment of milled peat production for power purposes.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, Bord na Móna revived its proposal for the establishment of a new briquetting factory and finally put it forward again in May, 1956.  After some consideration of the wisdom of having one factory of substantial capacity or two factories of lesser capacity, it was finally proposed by the board that two factories should be established, one at Derrygreena in Offaly and the other at Boora.  That decision was linked to the fact that the power station which it had been originally intended to establish at Derrygreena bog had been reduced in the E.S.B. programme from a capacity of 80 megawatts to 40 megawatts and the station which it was planned to establish on the Boora bog had been reduced from 100 megawatts to 60 megawatts.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that that reduction in the requirements of the power stations which it was intended should be established in these bogs involved the availability of resources there which could be utilised for the production of peat briquettes and towards which a substantial development has already taken place.  These proposals to establish these two factories for the production of peat briquettes were approved of by the then Government subject to the limitation that only one of the proposed factories should be proceeded with at once.</P>
    <P>The total capital required by the board for these two stations will be £1,800,000 and it will be appreciated, therefore, that the original provision for the purposes of Bord na Móna contemplated <Col N="554" /> by the earlier legislation of £20,000,000 must therefore be increased by that amount.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that Messrs. Arthur Guinness and Company, Ltd., have decided to lend Bord na Móna £500,000 towards the cost of that first briquetting factory.  I think that this is the occasion upon which I should express, as my predecessor expressed, appreciation of the willingness of that firm to give that very practical assistance to an important national under-taking. The substantial investment in that undertaking by a firm of the reputation and status of Messrs. Guinness and Company will, I hope, encourage others to show similar faith in the country's future.  One of the purposes for which this Bill is required is to enable that arrangement between Bord na Móna and Messrs.  Guinness and Company to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The board has made very steady progress in all its activities and, indeed, for one who, like myself, was in at the beginning of that undertaking and who remembers the doubts that were expressed as to the wisdom of proceeding with it and the prospect of its succeeding the board's accounts of to-day are very pleasant reading. Up to the present it has, in relation to its production programmes which I mentioned, exceeded its target in regard to sod peat.  Because of the upset due to the alteration of the E.S.B. plans, the 1956-57 production, the production in the last financial year, of milled peat was only 205,000 tons, against the original target set for that year of 400,000 tons.  However, the developments planned are going ahead now and the production of milled peat this year will be increased to something over 400,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Not merely has the board achieved all that it was given to do in the matter of the physical organisation of the production of turf fuel for power and other purposes but the financial results of its operations are also very satisfactory.  The board has already paid off to the Exchequer its liability in respect of advances which were made to its predecessor, the old Turf Development Board.  These advances amounted to £358,742.  I am sure the <Col N="555" /> Minister for Finance of the day regarded it as a rather doubtful debt and even though there was incorporated in the Act which set up Bord na Móna the provision which put on them the obligation to pay off that amount already expended by the Turf Development Board there may not have been much hope that it would be able to do so.  In fact, it has now cleared off that liability entirely.  It has already commenced the repayment through half-yearly annuities of £4,000,000 of the capital cost of the first development programme.  The first development programme contemplated an expenditure of £6,400,000 and the repayment of the first £4,000,000 of that sum has already commenced and the repayment of the balance, £2,400,000, will commence in October of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that figure.  I may get it for the Deputy. The total amount paid to date under all heads by Bord na Móna to the Exchequer is £1,500,000.  This Bill of course is just an enabling Bill.  I do not want the Dáil to take it on its enactment, on this giving to the board this legal power to borrow, that the power will be availed of immediately otherwise than to complete the arrangements with Messrs.  Arthur Guinness under which £500,000 is made available for the turf briquetting factory.  I should hope to see an early development of a situation in which Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. and other statutory organisations of that kind could be allowed to finance themselves by going to the public for money, and issuing their own stock.  It will be appreciated of course that they will be entitled to expect to get the support of the Exchequer in the form of underwriting <Col N="556" /> arrangements and guarantees which will facilitate them in arranging funds on favourable terms.  The amount which we are proposing to authorise by the issue of stock in this Bill will represent only a small part of the capital already invested, and to be invested, in this undertaking.</P>
      <P>The Bill, indeed, can perhaps be regarded as the forerunner of other measures, assuming that everything goes according to plan, which will eventually perhaps relieve the Exchequer of the obligation of finding capital for this development.  We can recommend this Bill in the full knowledge that the undertaking which it is designed to assist is a successful undertaking, successful beyond the expectations of many and it is giving every promise of being just as successful in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, as the Minister has said, is to enable Bord na Móna to obtain their finance other than by direct advances from the Exchequer.  It is obviously desirable that Bord na Móna should have the enabling powers so that, if the circumstances warrant or make it desirable, they should obtain their finances separately from the Exchequer. I do not think that this is the right time or place to enter into a discussion with the Minister as to whether it is desirable that there should be single issues for national purposes as there were in the last financial year, a sort of multiplicity of issues.  These are matters which could be more fully debated on another occasion.  In general I must say that, in relation to that, there has been far too great a tendency to overwork it.  It is the one pool of available resources, unless we get some adventitious additions to the pool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The generous and patriotic offer of Messrs. Arthur Guinness is such an adventitious addition and it was because of that fact that it was welcomed most emphatically by the previous Government.  The manner in which Messrs. Arthur Guinness have shown their belief in the briquetting plants and their faith in the development of our country is worthy of the highest <Col N="557" /> praise.  I hope it will strike a keynote for other firms of the same sort which may, by this undertaking, be induced to follow their lead.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of the Bill is to enable Bord na Móna to obtain finance other than from the Exchequer.  The immediate purpose of the Bill is to give those powers now so that the arrangements with Messrs.  Arthur Guinness can be concluded.  I imagine that it will be necessary when this Bill has been enacted for the Minister for Finance to follow with a similar arrangement in the Finance Bill, as was incorporated in respect of the powers given to C.I.E. and the E.S.B. in relation to interest and to the nondeduction  of income tax at source. That arrangement, which would be a necessary counterpart to this Bill, should not be in this Bill and must be in a Finance Act.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister, if I may say so, rather went outside the scope of this Bill when he was speaking, particularly in relation to the electricity programme.  The Minister purported to give the impression to the House that the estimate that had been made of electricity generation prior to the White Paper of which he had charge, was the estimate produced by the E.S.B.  That is not the fact, and this is a matter on which I can speak with personal knowledge because I myself went to the greatest trouble in trying to elucidate why certain estimates had been taken, and the fact of the matter was that those estimates were made by Deputy Lemass, as Tánaiste, contrary to the technical advice that he obtained at that time.</P>
    <P>The estimates that were included in the White Paper were based on the immediate post-war, post-emergency periods.  It was obvious that there would be a growth in electricity consumption in Ireland, because during the war there was not anything like the number of appliances available to meet the demands.  It was obvious that there would be a growth in demand in that period which would flatten out as, what I may term the emergency hunger in power and appliances, was met.  The estimates put forward at that time by the Tánaiste were not realistic and it fell to us in <Col N="558" /> the inter-Party Government to bring the stage back to realism.  Bringing a development of that sort back to realism and ensuring that money would not be wasted by the production of power for which there was not a demand was never likely to be a popular task, but it was a task that was essential in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that we are going to get an opportunity on another occasion of discussing the whole E.S.B. programme.  I would welcome that opportunity because, quite frankly, I did not think that this Bill was a proper matter for such a discussion to-day.  I would welcome the opportunity of showing that the advances on which the previous White Paper was based were not estimates which had any foundation in fact and which, as we all know now, were not realised.  The decision that was taken by the previous Government to switch from milled peat to briquettes was one that had to be taken at the very outset because the production of milled peat requires the development of bog in an entirely different way from that required for briquetting purposes.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand why the Minister when speaking of the £1.8 million that is required for briquetting purposes said that it was to be added to the £20,000,000 programme because at other times he was suggesting that the programme had to be contracted. It seems if there is an increase on one aspect for briquetting plants there will be equally on the other side a contraction in the production of milled peat as it will not be needed.  It would be most disloyal of me not to say this. The Minister in his speech to-day attempted to imply that the errors in estimation of the power load and the change in that estimation last year were errors of the E.S.B.  That is not correct.  The E.S.B. estimates were realistic and very much nearer the actuality as the years went by than those which the Minister superimposed on them.</P>
    <P>We saw also that, if the White Paper figures were allowed to run on ahead, there would be moneys utterly wasted &mdash;capital sums paid for bringing stations into commission before they were needed, power that could not be <Col N="559" /> drawn upon.  It was because of that we deemed it essential, in the national interest, that the capital should not be invested in that fashion.  Any blame the Minister attempted to imply to the E.S.B. in his opening statement is entirely without justification and foundation.</P>
    <P>One of the things that cannot be decided upon in relation to the load that must be catered for is what margin of safety is required, particularly in relation to hydroelectric schemes.  A wet summer, wet spring or wet autumn brings us very great difficulties from the sowing point of view in spring, the harvesting point of view in autumn and perhaps from the point of view of haymaking in summer.  At the same time, it does ease to a very great extent the task of the E.S.B. in supplying power. The amount which one must allow for variations in our climate is one of the things about which there will always be two opinions.  In present circumstances, it seems to me desirable that the margin should not be excessive and that the capital available from the saving caused by cutting that margin, could, therefore, be used for other purposes.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the capital figure in relation to the repayment of advances by Bord na Móna to the Exchequer is quite as rosy as the Minister was inclined to imply.  At any rate, it is satisfactory that the repayment of the first programme has started.  It is also satisfactory that the obligations of the old Turf Development Board have been paid off.  Obviously, they should be paid off because Bord na Móna has had all the advantage of previous work done, although to my recollection they got that completely interest free.</P>
    <P>As I say, this is an enabling Bill solely for the purpose of enabling the board to borrow otherwise than from the Exchequer.  Its introduction is necessary at this juncture because of the generous and patriotic gesture of Messrs. Arthur Guinness, Son and Company, Limited.  I think all Parties here should be grateful to that firm for that gesture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was quite easy to see <Col N="560" /> that, with access to greater knowledge, the Minister was much better informed on E.S.B. plant and E.S.B. difficulties than he was when he was in Opposition. I remember the Minister sitting in the Opposition Benches last year, working himself into an intense fury about the cutting down of E.S.B. plant and saying that this was all part of a measure which fiendish people in the last Government had devised for the purpose of cutting back on E.S.B. development.  All these charges are proved to be almost pretence and fraud in the light of the facts.  The last Government did nothing to cut back on E.S.B. development.</P>
      <P>In a parliamentary question to-day, I asked for information as to the amount of money spent on rural electrification since 1952.  Anybody who takes the trouble of reading the reply will see that during the past three and a half years we spent much more on rural electrification than was ever spent in the whole history of the scheme.  Last year, the sum of £3,500,000 was spent on rural electrification.  That is not the action of a body which is concerned with cutting back on the fruitful development the E.S.B. might wish to undertake.</P>
      <P>The plain fact of the matter is that the cutting back in the E.S.B. plant programme was necessary because the E.S.B. realised they were not able, and did not want, to undertake the plant programme which was envisaged in the White Paper of 1954.  I take it that the Minister has since had an opportunity of looking at the file on that subject.  That file is a most interesting and revealing one.  It shows that the Department of Industry and Commerce engaged in correspondence with the E.S.B. for the purpose of ascertaining what was the anticipated increase in the demand for electricity. The battle ebbs and flows.  The Department says: &ldquo;This will be the estimate.&rdquo; The E.S.B. come back and say: &ldquo;We do not think it will be that.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been on my feet for only two minutes and I cannot get so much detail into that time.  However, the essence of the matter is that the Minister is now much wiser.  In 1954, the E.S.B. programme was based on grotesque estimates of the anticipated increase in the demand for electricity. It was then anticipated that the demand for electricity would double itself in five to five and a half years.  It has not done anything of the kind.  Last year, the increase was about 7 per cent.; the year before, it was 9 per cent.  Bear in mind that 9 per cent. is not an unusual percentage when contrasted against the requirements of this country.  The O.E.E.C. Report shows that 9 per cent. was the approximate increase in electricity in the whole European setup. In 1954, the amateur planned what the increase would be.</P>
      <P>There is a letter on the file from the then Minister for Finance, the present Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, saying that the Department of Finance did not accept the view that the demand for electricity would double in the period of five to five and a half years.  The E.S.B. took the view that the demand would not increase nearly as much, but notwithstanding the views of the Minister for Finance, notwithstanding the views of the E.S.B. which was in close touch with affairs, the White Paper was issued on the direction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce telling the board what they should plan for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The E.S.B. proceeded to plan on the assumption that this increased demand for electricity would continue.  It did not continue, as the board had said, but the E.S.B. was given overriding <Col N="562" /> instructions how to get planted to meet that demand.  Bord na Móna, on the other hand, was told to produce sod and milled peat for the purpose of satisfying that demand and when, in early 1956, we asked the E.S.B. what their programme was they came to us and said: &ldquo;Look here, we do not want this plant; we cannot use that plant; we are over-planted as we are, and with the plant which we have and which we have in sight we will be over-planted until 1961 or 1962.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I tried to get Bord na Móna to go ahead on the Bangor Erris bog.  The E.S.B. told me, and it is on the files, that the earliest they could use the produce of the Bangor Erris bog would be in 1962 or 1963 because of the fact that they were geared up to a planting programme which was unrealistic and grossly in excess of their requirements. That is known now; and it is a pity it was not known earlier that the E.S.B. was given these false riding instructions and that it was following these riding instructions so that Bord na Móna, an innocent victim, had to cut back extensively on its milled peat programme.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna believed quite naturally that it could develop its bogs.  That involves long planning and considerable advance drainage arrangements. These arrangements had to be made on the assumption that the E.S.B. would go ahead with its White Paper programme.  The programme proved to be unnecessary; a great deal of the plant was unwanted for four or five years to come, and Bord na Móna, having geared itself to drain its bogs and to produce milled peat, had to cut back to such an extent that it does not now require all the milled peat that would satisfy the supposed requirements of the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>In that set of circumstances I discussed with Bord na Móna the possibility of utilising some of the bogs for the production of more briquettes.  In 1954 the board was producing about 35,000 tons of briquettes at the Ticknevin  factory.  That was brought up to 40,000 tons soon afterwards and to 45,000 tons last year.  Eventually we got it up to 50,000 tons, the optimum annual production of that plant.  After the discussions with Bord na Móna, I went to <Col N="563" /> the Government and recommended a proposal which had been certified by Bord na Móna for the erection of two turf briquette factories, one at Boora bog and the other at Derrygreena. The object of this was to produce 100,000 tons of briquettes in each factory each year, a total of 200,000 tons of turf briquettes.  The plants would cost £900,000 each, but the 200,000 tons of briquettes would be equivalent in calorific value of 130,000 tons of imported coal.</P>
    <P>I believe that was a good proposal and I recommended it to the Government and they approved of it.  Bord na Móna was consequently given instructions to erect these two briquetting plants.  I had hoped at one stage that it might be possible to erect another briquetting plant on the Bangor Erris bog, where the peat, unlike other places, is quite suitable for the production of briquettes.  However, Bangor Erris is rather remote from the centres of population where the briquettes would be likely to be consumed, and the carriage of the fuel from that area would probably make it expensive and provide an unfavourable comparison with the price of briquettes produced elsewhere and perhaps also with imported fuel.</P>
    <P>I think the decision to embark upon the installation of these two turf briquetting plants was a good national investment.  The briquettes so produced will stand comparison with imported fuels and I have no doubt Bord na Móna will be able to sell all the briquettes it so produces, particularly if coal remains at the present high level as appears likely at present. Indeed, if we could induce our people to recognise the national advantages to be derived from consuming peat as a fuel here, we could render ourselves, in the course of time, still more independent of imported fuels.</P>
    <P>Recently, however, briquettes have come into popular favour and I have no doubt that the output of the two factories at Boora and Derrygreena will be sold easily when the product is available.  But I would not like to think that Bord na Móna would just <Col N="564" /> stop there, as I believe this fuel has a good future before it and that with the development among our own people of a consciousness that they would help the national economy by using it, there should be no difficulty whatever in disposing of whatever large quantities of briquettes are produced in the plants immediately contemplated and those which I hope will follow.</P>
    <P>I want to join with the Minister in paying a tribute to Bord na Móna.  I think it is a first-class State-sponsored enterprise.  It has been confronted with difficulties which were sufficiently numerous and complex to deter the very stoutest hearts, but Bord na Móna's administrative staff, technical staff and labour staff have looked upon these difficulties as something to be surmounted.  They have been able to get through the most appalling difficulties and I should like especially to pay a tribute to those of the staff, at management, executive and worker level, who successfully settled down to work on these bogs, these remote, wind-swept areas, in order to make these bogs usable and exploitable for the benefit of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna has done a first-class job and I think this Bill, which is the same Bill as we had drafted before the change of Government, to give Bord na Móna the right to go to the public market for money, represents a logical development of the board and represents the arrival of the board at a stage which might be described as its financial manhood.  The very fact that a firm of the standing of Arthur Guinness and Son Limited have seen fit to lend the board a sum of £500,000 is an endorsement by such a firm of the creditworthy efforts of Bord na Móna.  It marks, too, by that firm their conviction of the soundness of the whole enterprise and is, at the same time, a demonstration of their confidence in the future of turf and in the future of the Irish nation.  I should like to repeat, in this context, the tributes which have been paid already to the firm for its magnificent generosity and for its excellent example.  I hope at the same time that the good example thus shown by the firm of Messrs. Arthur Guinness. Son &amp; Co. <Col N="565" /> will be emulated by others who are in a position to lend money to Bord na Móna to finance its further development.</P>
    <P>However, may I suggest this to the Minister and through him to the Government?  If Messrs.  Arthur Guinness regard the shares or the scrip or the IOUs of Bord na Móna as good security for £500,000 which they lend the board, then I think it is not too much to expect that the Central Bank might likewise take into its portfolios the IOUs of Bord na Móna and substitute Bord na Móna scrip or share certificates for the scrip and share certificates which represent the borrowings of another country.  After all, if Messrs.  Guinness think Bord na Móna an excellent enterprise and well worthy of being lent money for developmental purposes, surely the same scrip or the same share certificates are as good security for the Central Bank as many other things which they take into their portfolios as a receipt for moneys which they lend or cause to be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>I would hope that bodies like the E.S.B., Bord na Móna, Irish Shipping and Aer Lingus&mdash;all of whom have by now reached financial manhood&mdash;would find that they could have their borrowings financed through the Central Bank, if for any reason it is not possible for them to get the finance which they require by direct appeal to the lending public.  They are all first-class enterprises.  It is most unfair that any of them should find themselves compelled to adopt a policy of retardation instead of a policy of progress, merely because of the difficulty of finding the money to finance their activities.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying that I welcome this Bill.  Indeed, I welcome every Bill calculated to expand our turf production activities and to make for the extended growth of Bord na Móna.  I think the organisation has done a good job, from those who work on the bogs to those who direct their activities.  Any help which this House can give that organisation in pushing ahead with its work, this House should willingly give.</P>
    <P>May I mention one matter to the <Col N="566" /> Minister which engaged my attention but which was not completed when we left office?  One of the bad features of Bord na Móna employment is that it takes on a large number of persons in March, April and May for the purpose of cutting and harvesting work; and in September and October those people are paid off, with the result that their problem each year is to find work to keep them going from October until the following February, March or April, as they live in the turf development areas, where there is no normal alternative employment.  I have examined the possibility of seeing whether Bord na Móna could not be given other work to do, which could be started about October or November and which would finish about February or March, so that the workers could be transferred from that winter work back on to the bog work and, at the end of their period on the bog, switched over again to the alternative work.  The only immediately available work which one could think of is the possibility of giving planting activities to Bord na Móna; in other words, to allow them plant timber in the winter months so as to provide employment for the staff who otherwise would be paid off.</P>
    <P>I had that discussed on a number of occasions with the Land Commission, but the Land Commission regarded the planting of timber as its special preserve and numerous discussions failed to produce any agreement&mdash;or, indeed, enthusiasm&mdash;on their part for a scheme by which Bord na Móna would do some supplementary timber planting.</P>
    <P>However, I think the idea is well worth following up.  It may well be, of course, that Bord na Móna cannot plant on cutaway bog because the method of developing the bog does not provide for having cutaway bog immediately available.  The bog is cut under modern conditions at a uniform depth each year over a long period of years, so that the whole bog is virtually cut away about the one time at some date in the distant future. There is, therefore, no cutaway bog of any substantial size or acreage immediately adjoining the existing bog.  I think Bord na Móna has to be given power, if it is to do its work, to <Col N="567" /> acquire land on the perimeter of the bogs, land where turf is not deep enough for cutting but tractable enough for the planting of timber.</P>
    <P>It will continue to be a blot on the character of the employment which Bord na Móna provides&mdash;and that employment is valuable employment, especially in the areas where it is provided&mdash;so long as there is so much casualisation associated with it.  I think the only way in which we can surmount the difficulty is by making Bord na Móna a timber planting agency as well as a turf cutting agency. If that can be done, it would provide a valuable medium for steady employment with Bord na Móna.  It would give the workers concerned a full year's work, instead of six or seven months' regular work, and then none or possibly intermittent employment for the other five months.  It is something which will have to be dealt with some time.  As I say, the question has been discussed already with the Land Commission.  I think it is along that line that Bord na Móna can most usefully fill in the lacuna which is caused by the paying off of staff in September or October and not being able to find useful work for them until turf cutting starts the following year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as something calculated to develop still further our turf production potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As is obvious from this discussion, there is general agreement on the aims enshrined in this Bill.  In fact, this Bill was introduced originally by the previous Government. As was mentioned by the Minister at the outset, the main purpose is to increase the borrowing powers of Bord na Móna and, in addition, to enable Bord na Móna to accept an offer of an investment of a sum of £500,000 by Messrs.  Arthur Guinness. Son and Co. in the proposed two new briquetting factories.  Both the previous Government and this Government have publicly expressed appreciation of that magnificent gesture.  It is a unique occasion for such an investment to be made.  So far as my knowledge goes, no firm has in the past made a similar investment.  The <Col N="568" /> fact that Messrs. Guinness are prepared to do so is, in itself, not only an expression of that firm's faith in the decision to establish two briquetting factories but is a gesture of confidence and an expression of their confidence in the fundamental soundness of the national economy.</P>
      <P>Messrs. Guinness is a firm which has deep roots in this country.  In fact, few firms have any deeper or stronger ties.  In addition, it is a company with not only considerable resources here but considerable resources abroad. The fact that such a firm is prepared to make an investment of this nature in this enterprise is a headline that may well be followed by other firms.  Individual firms may wish to invest in a particular enterprise rather than in a national loan.  For a variety of reasons, these firms or the directors of these firms may feel that Government policy or public expenditure on certain projects is not what those firms or their directors might themselves favour; consequently, if other firms wish to follow this example, I believe they should be facilitated and, where necessary, measures should be introduced which will provide opportunities, should firms wish to express their support of an undertaking of this nature.</P>
      <P>Such an investment may, of course, affect the over-all pool available for capital development, and, if that occurs, it will have an effect on the over-all availability of capital for development purposes or for development schemes which the Government wish to finance in a particular year or over a period.  On the other hand, it may be that such an investment would be an investment over and above the supply of capital which would normally be invested by firms of that nature in national loans.  Only time can show whether the prospect of similar investments in national undertakings will be forthcoming.  Certainly this one was most welcome and I am sure the members of the House, and also the public, appreciate the public-spirited action of this firm which is in conformity with its great record in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not enlarge on the matters that have already engaged the attention of the House in connection with the different rates of development of <Col N="569" /> the E.S.B. generating programme or the alteration in the Bord na Móna programme.  However, there is one important matter that should be borne in mind, that once a scheme of development is undertaken by Bord na Móna in a locality, any alteration in that scheme affects seriously the interests of a large number of those employed in it and so far as is possible agreement should be reached on the proposed rate of development so that people who are employed do not get the impression that long-term employment will be available without an alteration in the programme as a result of a change in either the type of development, because that has an effect on the numbers employed, or in the rate of development.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I want to refer in connection with the proposal to develop the briquetting plants.  As a result of the high cost of imported fuel, demand for these briquettes has grown considerably, and while this may be more appropriately a matter for the administration of Bord na Móna, I have received, as I am sure other Deputies have from time to time, complaints from traders, particularly small traders, that they cannot get a quota of briquettes. Briquettes not only have a value to the trader from the immediate sale point of view but they also attract custom very often because of the suitability of these briquettes for domestic fuel consumption.</P>
    <P>I believe that Bord na Móna or any other such organisation has a duty to see that supplies are made available as widely as possible to traders who wish to avail of them and that monopolistic tendencies should not be allowed to develop concerning the distribution of these briquettes.  Very many small traders find it difficult to get supplies. On the other hand, it may be that they are new in the trade and that others have established contacts which have existed over a period.  Nevertheless, I believe from my experience&mdash;and I think other Deputies have had similar experience&mdash;that care should be taken to see that they are made available, even on a restricted supply basis, to traders who wish to avail of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> They are, as most people have come to realise, a very efficient and suitable fuel, and, with the increase in the price of coal, the demand for them has grown accordingly.  I merely wish to support the proposals enshrined in this Bill and that we may experience similar examples of faith, not only in the proposal we have before us here, namely the two briquetting factories, but also the example of Messrs. Guinness which may well be followed by other firms in other spheres of national development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to rake over the fires of old controversies but, with regard to this argument as to whether I induced the E.S.B. to engage on a construction programme in excess of what they thought necessary, I want to put an end to it once and for all, so that neither Deputy Norton nor Deputy Sweetman will have the hardihood to refer to it again.</P>
      <P>I assert here and now that the programme for electricity development announced in the White Paper in 1954 was prepared by the E.S.B. and submitted to the Dáil in the form which it reached me from the E.S.B., without the alteration of a single figure.  Deputy Norton says that was a grotesque estimate of the future requirements of electric current in this country forced on the E.S.B. by me.  When did he discover that?  When did the E.S.B. tell him that that programme, involving them in excessive generating capacity, had been forced upon them by me?  Does he remember that?  It certainly was not after the change of Government in 1954.  It was not even in 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned already that when this question of establishing the briquetting factory was first brought forward by Bord na Móna, when they proposed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day that a bog that they were developing for the purpose of supplying a generating station could be diverted to supplying a turf briquetting factory, the E.S.B. said that if that one single station was taken out of their programme they would immediately have to make plans to replace it by another station, involving <Col N="571" /> the use of imported fuel; and by November, 1955&mdash;and that was a long time after the change of Government and a long time after the Minister of the day had had an opportunity of finding out whether the board had been forced into an excessive pro-programme, and a long time after the board had had an opportunity of telling him that that was so, if it was so&mdash; the Minister decided that Bord na Móna could not be allowed to proceed with this briquetting project of theirs and, in a letter which he sent, or directed to be sent to Bord na Móna on 23rd November, 1955, he said that he had been advised by the E.S.B. that the abandonment of Derrygreena station would necessitate the installation of an equivalent oil or coal plant elsewhere, probably at Dublin; and, on the basis of that understanding in November, 1955, that the programme for electricity generation prepared in my time, in 1954, was not merely a realistic programme related to the estimated requirements of current but was also one that could not be modified in any single degree, he turned down the briquetting project.</P>
    <P>As late as 1955, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce rejected the plan for the establishment of a briquetting factory, and not merely was there no suggestion in 1955 that the E.S.B.'s programme for a new generating station was not excessive, not merely was there such little foundation for the suggestion that the programme was one into which the E.S.B. had been forced by me against their will, knowing it to be excessive, but in December, 1955, the E.S.B. came to the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day and proposed to extend the programme by including in it the addition of further generating capacity in Dublin, to be based upon the importation of oil. Now, in the light of these facts, am I right in contending that I have disposed forever of this preposterous suggestion that the E.S.B. were forced, or allowed themselves to be forced, by me in 1954 into embarking upon a new generating programme which was substantially in excess of the country's estimated requirements at that time?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has asked me to read the file.  I have not had time for exercises of that kind since I resumed office.  In the light of the suggestion that the E.S.B. was forced into an excessive programme of new generating capacity, will Deputy Norton explain why, in 1955, he turned down a proposal by Bord na Móna to divert one of their bogs to briquette manufacture on the ground that, if that one station was taken out of the E.S.B. programme, another station would immediately have to be provided in its stead?  Will he explain why, even after he had turned down that proposal to establish a briquetting factory in Derrygreena in 1955 on that ground, even after he had decided that the programme for the E.S.B. published in the White Paper of 1954 was to stand unchanged, the E.S.B. came back later to extend that programme by including an additional 60-megowatt oil-burning capacity in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that early in 1956 the E.S.B., knowing what had happened in 1955, came back to say that their programme was then excessive, having regard to the change that had taken place since 1954.  Deputy Sweetman tried to suggest that I was holding the E.S.B. to blame by reason of the fact that the 1954 programme proved to be excessive in 1956.  I have never attempted from either side of this House to blame the E.S.B. for that.  In 1954 there was no possible alternative except to estimate the new generation programme upon the basis of experience to that date and experience to that date showed that for every year since the end of the war the demand for electricity had grown on the average by 13 per cent. per annum and it would have been a dereliction of duty on the part of the board or the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to have prepared a new generation <Col N="573" /> programme upon any assumption which did not involve a continuation of the growth of demand at that rate.</P>
    <P>I am always prepared, I will admit, to make my plans for the future on optimistic assumptions.  I am certainly not prepared to make them on pessimistic assumptions.  If there is any blame attaching here, then it is to go on the shoulders of the Government during whose period in office this contraction of the national economy took place and, once again, we have evidence that when the national economy begins to contract in any sphere repercussions of that contraction are felt everywhere.</P>
    <P>We had in this country, in each year up to 1954, a growth in demand for current at an average rate of 13 per cent.  When, in 1956, the E.S.B. found that the growth in demand was only 7 per cent. they had to revise their programme.  Of course they had to do that and I am not criticising them for the revision of the programme which they adopted then.  Neither am I criticising the Government of the day for having accepted that revision.  I have said, and I repeat, I am not yet prepared to agree to the new revised programme involving the postponement of many of the projects contemplated in 1954 and the limitation of the production of milled peat from a target of 2,500,000 tons to a target of 1.3 million tons.  I am not prepared to agree that that revision must stand.  We are not yet in a position to make any assumptions as to what expansion in the national economy may become possible. As I have said, I am having examined the economics of proceeding with developments which will involve the use of native resources even if they also involve the non-utilisation for a period of power stations that depend upon the importation of fuel.  These are matters for examination and any decision which may be taken as a result of that examination will be communicated and will, I am sure, be quite easily justified to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked why, in view of the fact that Board na Móna's programme has been curtailed in consequence of the curtailment of the <Col N="574" /> E.S.B. programme, it is necessary to add to the £20,000,000 provided by legislation for Bord na Móna purposes under previous enactments the £2,000,000 that will be required by them for the financing of these briquette factories.  The answer, of course, is that the programme of Bord na Móna still stands.  It may not now be possible to complete this programme by 1960 but it certainly will be completed when it is practicable to complete it.  The money required for that programme will certainly not fall short of the £20,000,000 originally estimated for it.  I do not think that under any circumstances it will now be possible to achieve the 2,500,000 milled peat target by 1960, but I hope circumstances will require in that year a greater production than is now contemplated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to the seasonal nature of Bord na Móna's employment and told the House that he had, as Minister, tried to persuade his colleague in the Department of Lands to adopt an arrangement under which Bord na Móna would do in the winter months work for the Department of Lands in fulfilment of its planting programme.  There is no doubt that the seasonal nature of part of Bord na Móna's employment is a problem we would all like to solve.  There seems to be some obvious relationship between seasonal employment on turf production and seasonal employment in forestry planting.  Each is done in alternate seasons of the year.</P>
    <P>I do not know that that necessarily involves the entrustment of the work of planting to Bord na Móna, but so far as the workers are concerned I am sure it will not matter to them whether they are employed by Bord na Móna or the Department of Lands but it should be possible to effect some co-ordination of both activities so as to make possible all-the-year-round employment for the workers concerned.  I have also discussed that matter with my colleague in the Department of Lands and I hope I will be more successful in my discussions than Deputy Norton was in his.  I will not follow Deputy Norton into his suggestion with regard to the <Col N="575" /> utilisation of the Central Bank funds. I take it he was not expressing Coalition policy.</P>

He is aware of the fact that the payment of the board's obligations is done on an annuity basis and because it is on an annuity basis it is obvious that the first payments must contain a very small element of capital repayment.

      <P>The E.S.B. programme is based upon an estimate of power required.  It was estimated originally that 1,022 megawatts would be required by 1961.  That has been cut down to 750 but how that power is to be provided is another question. My anxiety to get ahead with the development of power stations using turf is based upon a general consideration of the possibility of atomic energy being available to this country in between 15 and 20 years and a desire to see the bogs cleared of turf, believing that the areas now covered by bog could be made fertile and productive and recognising the chance of getting rid of them at a profit exists now and may not exist in 15 or 20 years.  If we do not succeed in getting the bogs cleared now a time may come when it may not be as economical to do it. That is a consideration which would justify examining the possibility of proceeding now with stations to use turf as fuel even though it meant that existing stations using imported oil might have to work at less than full capacity for a year or two.  That is a question of calculating advantages and disadvantages.  It would be a consideration in my mind that a time was coming when atomic energy would undoubtedly be the most economic method of producing electric power.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for office workers the protection similar in character to that provided for industrial workers by the Factories Acts in regard to such matters, cleanliness, temperature, lighting and general safety of the places where they work.  The introduction of legislation for that purpose was recommended by the Commission on Youth Unemployment which reported in 1951.</P>
      <P>The problem about this Bill is that while many people have in the past urged the need for it very few have expressed a view as to the form it should take.  The Commission on Youth Unemployment, while recommending the introduction of legislation to protect office workers in regard to several aspects of their employment, did not give any suggestions as to the form which the legislation should take. So far as I have been able to ascertain, there is no similar legislation in any other country.  There is no I.L.O. Convention on the subject and, in regard to legislation of this kind, one would naturally turn to the I.L.O. records for guidance.  I understand that the I.L.O. are undertaking an inquiry which might lead to the formulation of a convention but the outcome of that inquiry is not yet known.  There is therefore a problem for the Dáil in relation to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were framing the factories Act we could draw upon our own experience for fifty years of the operation of legislation relating to factories. We could, if necessary and in fact did, to a great extent, turn for guidance to <Col N="578" /> the legislation of other countries and approach the whole task of framing that Bill in the realisation that we could make a fairly good job of it and that we were not likely to leave anything out, because the legislation of other countries and our own experience would tell us what to put in.  The preparation of legislation for office workers is on a different basis.  There is no legislation elsewhere which we can turn to.  There is no advice available even from the Commission which recommended that such legislation should be introduced.  There is no I.L.O. Convention on the subject.</P>
    <P>The text of this Bill is similar to that which was circulated in February last by the previous Government.  I do not want that to be taken as meaning that I am in full agreement with that text.  I felt however that it was wise to start off by putting that text back again before the Dáil and telling the Dáil that the form and scope of it will be considered and inviting all Deputies to examine it and to submit their amendments to it.  I decided upon the course of circulating the Bill which had previously been before the Dáil unchanged because, amongst other reasons, I felt it would help to secure proper consideration of the problems and also because the text of that Bill had been circulated to a number of organisations all of whom had been invited to submit their views.  Very few of them did so.  Indeed, the absence of comment from a number of trade organisations that often complain they are not consulted about legislation of this kind should be noted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That always happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps my observation on the matter now will produce some comment which will be valuable. With the text of the Bill an explanatory memorandum was circulated.  I presume, therefore, it is not necessary for me to refer in detail to its provisions. The general scheme of the Bill is to place upon the occupiers of office premises an obligation to provide for their workers clean and safe surroundings, properly lighted, heated and ventilated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> Then it gives the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to go beyond that general obligation by making regulations which will prescribe in a detailed way the standards to be met in particular instances.</P>
    <P>While that is the general scheme of the Bill, the detailed provisions of which have been explained in the explanatory memorandum so that it is not necessary for me to go into them again, there are one or two points on which I should like to make a comment.  The Bill applies only to premises in which five or more persons are employed on clerical work.  While making it quite clear that every section of the Bill is open to debate and amendment by the Dáil and that it is not in any sense a Party measure from any point of view, I would urge the Dáil not to press to extend that provision further in order to apply the provisions of this initial Offices Bill to premises in which a lesser number of clerical workers are employed.  Indeed, I think quite a strong argument could be made to confine this initial attempt at legislation to larger concerns employing clerical workers in fairly substantial numbers. The obligations imposed by the Bill may involve some expenditure in many cases and, while that expenditure will perhaps press fairly lightly on the larger and more solvent concerns there is a danger in relation to smaller concerns that the placing upon them of the obligation to incur this expenditure and the prospect of being subject to inspection to ensure that the requirements of the Bill are met may lead to a decision to disemploy one or two clerical workers rather than face these obligations.  Therefore I think we should approach with considerable care the question of the size of the concern to which the measure should apply.</P>
    <P>The second point which I think requires some mention is the proposal that the enforcement of the measure should be entrusted to the sanitary authority.  It is not proposed to set up for the purpose of this Bill a new and separate inspectorate for its enforcement.  The Factories Act is enforced by an inspectorate service <Col N="580" /> employed by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is intended, and, indeed, it would obviously be the most convenient arrangement to have these factory inspectors to do any inspection that arises under this Bill in connection with offices associated with factories.  However, in relation to all other places where clerical work is carried out, it is proposed to give responsibility for its enforcement to the sanitary authority.  On the whole I think it is probably the better arrangement.</P>
    <P>Objections could be based upon the fact that experience may show that local authorities may not be very active or very enthusiastic in its enforcement or that some local authorities will be more effective in its enforcement than others or on the ground that enforcement by sanitary authorities will mean that there cannot be any report on enforcement giving a picture of the problems that arise and the effect of the measure such as is available under the Factories Act, or because the local sanitary authority will not have any contact&mdash; cannot have any contact&mdash;with the Advisory Committee which is to be established under the Bill.  I have considered these objections, but nevertheless I think there is not any more suitable arrangement for the enforcement of the measure than using the sanitary authorities.</P>
    <P>In the main, the enforcement of the Bill will turn upon the provision of proper sanitary arrangements&mdash;toilet arrangements and arrangements for drinking-water facilities&mdash;cleanliness, fire safety and other matters which are the normal concern of local authorities. The Department's factory inspectors will look after the offices attached to factories.  They will also be responsible for the enforcement of the measure in other Government Departments. That is not a task I am looking forward to with any enthusiasm but that is what is in the Bill and, presumably, somebody had to do it.  Outside these two spheres, the sanitary authorities will operate.  Perhaps I should make it quite clear at this stage, because it will certainly be clear to all Deputies next week, that <Col N="581" /> I am not prepared to consider any proposals which will involve additional administrative costs in the Department.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that all organisations that are concerned with, or are likely to be concerned with the present Bill, organisations representing traders or other business interests which employ clerical workers, have been asked to submit their views.  I think in regard to a measure of this kind the aim should be to secure the greatest measure of agreement possible.  I therefore propose to leave quite a substantial interval between the Second Reading of the Bill and the Committee Stage to enable all these organisations to consider the Bill as carefully as they like and to permit of consideration of any suggestions or proposals they wish to send in, and also to permit Deputies to consider amendments.</P>
    <P>I should like to urge on both, the organisations who may be considering it and the Deputies contemplating amending it, that they should approach this first piece of legislation&mdash; and I emphasise it is the first because no other country has pioneered in this field of legislation dealing with the conditions of office workers&mdash;with the aim of producing a practicable, workable and reasonable measure rather than that we should strive towards some theoretical ideal which may be unattainable in practice, or rather than seek to set out to draft a code to regulate in every detail the working conditions of office staffs.</P>
    <P>I think if we can secure an effective measure which will deal with the things I have mentioned, lighting, cleaning, heating, ventilation, toilets and so forth, we will have done all that is practicable in the present circumstances and it is in the expectation that the Bill can emerge from the Oireachtas in a form which can achieve these results that I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one which would be much better discussed on the Committee Stage than on the Second Reading.  I hope that when the Minister fixes the date for the Committee Stage at the conclusion of this <Col N="582" /> debate, he will fix a date a considerable time ahead, so as to enable the members of the House to consider the Bill in detail before the Committee Stage and also in the hope that outside organisations may be reminded that this is a Bill which may quite seriously affect them and, therefore, one which they should consider and one in respect of which their advice and views would, I know, be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Personally, in regard to the two points mentioned by the Minister, I should like to say that I entirely agree with him.  I think it would be bad policy for the House to restrict still further the low number, that is, five, employees in the establishments that will be affected by this Bill.  So far as the other point he mentioned is concerned, I think it would be very undesirable and highly objectionable that there should be any new body of inspectors.  The arrangement by virtue of which the sanitary officer can make the inspection is an arrangement which in the country, at any rate, will mean that there will be no necessity for additional inspectors on the one hand, and on the other, that the local sanitary inspector who is more likely to be attuned to, and acquainted with, the circumstances of the rural town in which an office may be situated than an inspector operating from the Department in Dublin would be, will do the work.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that might arise if the Factory Acts inspector were to go outside the limits of the offices attached to the factory to make the type of inspection that is envisaged in this Bill, in rural areas particularly. While some type of legislation on these lines is desirable, there is undoubtedly a very great danger that in endeavouring to put clerical workers into too much cotton wool, we will reduce the number of clerical workers who will be employed, and the House should approach the Bill in this spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>About 18 months ago, when I came to consider with the officials of my Department the question of drafting a Bill which would give to office workers protection and facilities with due amenities, similar to those <Col N="583" /> given to factory workers, those who discussed the matter were all conscious of the fact that in the field of legislation we had nobody's brains to pick. We, therefore, had to set out to try to devise a Bill of this kind dealing with the conditions of office workers, having to rely all the time on our own resources, our own experience and our own ingenuity to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as originally drafted, was wider and perhaps more rigid than the Bill now before the House, but by subjecting the draft Bill to the tests of reality and by attempting to import into it the maximum measure of flexibility, we were ultimately able to get this Bill.  I think the officers of the Department who have been associated with the drafting of this Bill have done a first-class job, especially when one remembers that it is a pioneering piece of legislation not only so far as this country is concerned but so far as many countries of the world are concerned.</P>
      <P>I never intended the Bill to represent the last word so far as legislation affecting office workers is concerned. At best, I hoped at the outset that it would be not merely a protective measure in certain respects, but that in the main it should constitute itself as a signpost to the conditions which ought to be provided for office workers.  The scheme as envisaged in the Bill, as the Minister said, enables the inspection of offices associated with factories to be done by the visiting factory inspector who, when he is on the factory premises can quite easily see that the offices associated therewith comply with the requirements of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that so far as offices generally are concerned the inspection should be done by the local sanitary authority because it is felt that a local inspection of that kind is not only much cheaper than a centralised inspection but is much more convenient in every way.  The local inspector will know the local people and there will be an element of understanding in the inspection that would not be there if the inspector comes down from a centralised bureau to tell a local <Col N="584" /> office owner what he should do in his own office.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that inspection by the local authority will not only mean a saving in the matter of administration, but will make for the smoother and probably more understanding type of inspection which I think is necessary to ensure the success of a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the view expressed by the Minister and, I think by Deputy Sweetman&mdash;I have some misgivings&mdash; and always had misgivings&mdash;about one section of the Bill.  I let it go, however, in its final form, not with any enthusiasm but rather to test the feelings of the Dáil on the subject.  It may be felt that I am ahead of my profession in this field, but I personally dislike the provisions of Section 3, which provide that the Bill does not apply to an office in which the number of persons employed on clerical work does not exceed five.  So far as the larger offices are concerned, it does not matter whether this Bill is passed or not.  The good employer who has a social conscience and who is a good businessman realises that if he is to get good work from his staff and give the impression of a well-run business he must have good offices where conditions are good and where everybody appears to be working under ideal conditions. So far as that type of office is concerned, this Bill has not the slightest effect.</P>
    <P>This Bill is intended for places which are really garrets and not offices, places where workers are almost warehoused and where the conditions are very far from attaining a satisfactory standard.  It is in the small office that the worst offences are committed from the point of view of overcrowding, cleanliness, sanitary conveniences, washing facilities and seating.  It is in the small office where the exploitation of the unprotesting boy or girl takes place.  The big offices look after themselves. They present no problem.  They are all run in a first-class manner.  It is the person employing one, two or three, who does not pay them, who often looks for a fee to engage them, who expects them to tolerate the worst of conditions that I should like to see <Col N="585" /> this Bill dealing with, and dealing with effectively.</P>
    <P>Although I allowed five to stand in the section, I was going to say to the Dáil that, as far as I am concerned, I would welcome an amendment to that section.  I certainly would not oppose an amendment of the section designed to apply the Bill to offices employing less than five.  It is at that point that the possibility of flouting the reasonable provisions set out here is most serious and it is at that point that those who work in offices of that kind need the maximum measure of protection. There may be cases where a single person is employed in an office associated perhaps with another business who is not all the time engaged in the office but is rambling through the building in the course of his or her duties.  It may be undesirable to cater for a case of that kind in a Bill such as this but the main considerations remain, that it is in the case of the small office where the conditions are not good that it is desirable to have some power to deal with the problem and to lift them up to a standard to which many of them do not at present conform.</P>
    <P>I share the present Minister's view that the Bill represents an effort to get together a code of offices legislation which would do things in a reasonable and a flexible way.  In that respect it is very largely an enabling Bill.  Any Deputy who looks through the various sections will see that most of them give power to the Minister to make regulations, the advantage of that being that, if you can make a regulation, you can revoke it or amend it in the light of experience or make another one which better fits the situation.  That is much better than having a rigid Bill prescribing something which cannot be amended except by subsequent legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill also has the merit that in Section 24 it sets up an advisory council which will be representative of people who have an interest in this whole problem, that is, those who would represent workers, those who would represent employers, those who would have an interest in social welfare activities, the idea there being <Col N="586" /> that regulations would be submitted to this advisory council, that there could be an impact of reason on reason from the different sides of the advisory council and that, ultimately, whatever regulation came out of the council would have the benediction of the different groups who would be represented on the council.  That was designed to ensure that the regulations would not be milled out by an impersonal department concerned only with ensuring that its ukases compelled respect.  The idea of the advisory council and the submission thereto of the regulations was to ensure that you would get a human point of view beamed on the regulations, a practical point of view, which would enable the regulations to work.</P>
    <P>All that was done, as I said, for the purpose of ensuring that this Bill when it became an Act would be administered in a way that would bring about improvements in the conditions of office workers without at the same time producing extensive irritations in its administration while at the same time providing basic rights for workers who earn their livelihood in offices.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister, I had intended to allow the Dáil to exercise its skill and ingenuity on the Bill regarding the principle only as the desirability of protecting office workers but, as to the methods by which it should be done, leaving that to an open vote in the light of the merits associated either with the section as drafted or with any amendments which would be submitted. If the House approaches the Bill in that spirit I am sure that we can get through the House in respect of offices a Bill as satisfactory as the Bill we got through the House in respect of factories and which is now operating smoothly as an Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply desire to express a word of welcome for this legislation. There is an extremely big difference between the conditions of clerical workers and those of workers in factories. The conditions of factory workers have been won by progressive legislation in countries outside this country and in this country.  They were brought to a very high stage of perfection in this country under the very <Col N="587" /> recent Factories Act.  It is heartening to see this first attempt at legislation for the clerical workers.</P>
      <P>I venture to say that the conditions in many offices, in the small towns at least throughout this country, are scandalous. Many of these offices have no sanitary accommodation of any sort, no provision for washing and very little heating or lighting.  The conditions in general are as described by Deputy Norton, plus bad pay conditions.</P>
      <P>The two points in this Bill that lend themselves to amendment have been more or less taken from us by the Minister in his opening speech.  I can see the force of his request that we must make haste slowly, that if we are to have this type of legislation, we must do it gradually and that the very first effort is not the time to make a Bill completely watertight.  In my opinion the fact that offices employing less than five do not come within the provisions of the Bill means that the Bill will not apply to practically every small town in the country.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, it practically wipes it out.  It is in those small towns that the scandalous conditions exist.  I would suggest to the Minister he should seriously consider leaving it to a free vote as to whether that number of five should be reduced.  I am not particularly struck by the force of the argument that, because of the expense of providing better conditions, some firm will decide to do without one or more workers.  I doubt if any employer is employing clerical workers under those conditions.  The question of how much he would do to put his office into reasonably good conditions should not be largely based on wondering if he would dismiss somebody or not.</P>
      <P>On the question of inspectors, it is not their efficiency that I worry about. Deputy Norton said that they will know the local people but I am more afraid that the local people will know them.  I suggest that the Minister should consider widening the Bill to include a provision giving the right to inspectors, at the request of an organisation or trade union, to carry out an inspection of a particular office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> I think that would meet in some way the opposition I have to leaving this matter wholly to the local authority health inspectors.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to express my appreciation of the work done by the Minister's Department and in particular of the interest taken in the promotion of this Bill by the previous Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the principles set out in this Bill that office workers should have decent conditions in which to work.  I find myself in substantial agreement with the attitude adopted by the Minister in regard to this Bill, especially in so far as he expressed the view that, in formulating unprecedented legislation of this kind, it was very much better to creep rather than to walk.  It is always possible to improve one's first effort but very often there is grave hardship if, through excessive zeal, one imposes unnecessary burdens on people who are trying to earn their living.  I do not mind confessing to the House that I am more familiar with conditions in business places in rural Ireland than with business places in our cities.  When I think of every rural business establishment in Ireland becoming subject to the impact of legislation of this kind, I begin to ask myself a question.  Take a section like Section 22.  It provides that in every office where five clerks or more are employed &ldquo;there shall be provided and maintained so as to be readily accessible one or more first-aid boxes or cupboards suitably equipped&rdquo;. I cannot help asking myself what do we need first-aid boxes for in the average office?  Is it to rescue a clerk who stabs himself with a pen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I apprehend that a provision of that kind is really rather extravagant. It seems to be quite irrelevant to the conditions with which I am familiar in rural Ireland.  I can see good grounds for making provision that there shall be cleanliness and no overcrowding, reasonable heating, lighting and ventilation; I am not so sure it is necessary to have a constant <Col N="589" /> supply of drinking water in the offices, unless it be to dilute the bottle which the Minister seems to imagine may occupy the first-aid box.  I could not imagine that it is an essential minimum requirement of decent offices.  I do not think it is necessary to provide washing facilities in the office. Naturally, there should be adequate heating and sanitary arrangements annexed to the premises where the office is, fire safety and so on, but Deputy Norton feels that in having an office defined, for the purpose of this Bill, as a place where there are five or more employed is going farther than he would have thought prudent.</P>
      <P>I think that if we want to deal with offices as we have dealt with factories in a different code of legislation, we might well have begun with an office of ten persons and, later, if that was found to be inadequate to deal with any remaining abuses, reduce the figure.  If one imposes statutory duties on a relatively small business, it may cripple that business.  To steer an even course between imposing statutory obligations that the business cannot afford and tolerating a business carrying on at the expense of its employees is not an easy job.  I think it would be better to try to regulate all offices and define them as being places where more than ten clerks are employed and then, if found practicable, to extend the definition to cover premises where seven are employed.  The next stage, if necessary and practicable, would be to extend it to five.  If we were to follow Deputy Norton's thought to confine the definition simply to an office where a clerk is employed, I begin to think of all the solicitors' offices where young men are starting out in life employing one clerk and living and working in the same conditions as that one clerk and glad to have that accommodation.  They might find that accommodation, which they could not afford to better, might not comply with the minimum requirements of the Bill.  What are they to do if that thought is extended to smaller businesses and shopkeepers in rural Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister is well advised when he says that this is unprecedented <Col N="590" /> legislation.  It would be a great pity if in trying to do the right thing, we wrecked the effort by trying to do too much too soon.  Let us vindicate the principles first; then let us gradually extend the definition of clerical establishment to cover as wide a field as may be desirable and practicable. I have no doubt that if the approach adumbrated by the Minister in submitting this Bill on Second Stage is maintained in the Committee and later stages, our joint wisdom should be able to produce a workable version of this Bill.  Therefore, I agree with Deputy Sweetman that further detailed comment upon it would be better reserved for the Committee and later stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the other members in welcoming the introduction of this measure.  As the Minister said in his opening statement, in this Bill we are adopting a principle.  I think that in it the Minister and his predecessor have something to be proud of.  When this Bill has been examined&mdash;sympathetically, I trust&mdash;by the members of the House and becomes law, I believe it will be a landmark in progressive legislation.</P>
      <P>I have no experience whatever of the situation in rural Ireland, but I am afraid I cannot agree with the view expressed by Deputy Dillon when he said that the Minister might consider applying the principle of the Bill to those employed in clerical establishments with a staff of ten or more. Those of us who have some knowledge of the situation in the city are aware that, in organisations where a large number of clerical workers are employed, the problems this Bill is intended to deal with are to a large extent non-existent.  Such organisations of employers or single employers employing large numbers of clerical workers realise it is good economy to provide reasonable working conditions for their employees and that it is false and unsound economy to crowd office workers into badly ventilated offices, lacking heat and light.  The inevitable result of this type of action is a high degree of absenteeism, due to illness and the like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem in our cities is the problem <Col N="591" /> of those employing small numbers of clerical workers.  They may be organisations employing clerical workers; they may be solicitors, as mentioned, or other professional people; they may be organisations engaged in trade.  As far as the general public are concerned, when they enter these places of business, they may observe a very well appointed front office and a very well appointed front desk with somebody to receive them.  However, the office workers who carry on the necessary clerical work may, and very often are, compelled to carry out their duties in the most unsuitable, uncomfortable and unhealthy conditions.  I think it is true to say that in the City of Dublin, even in the more important shops, where to all intents and purposes the employees appear to enjoy reasonable conditions of employment, behind the facade of beautiful show-cases and counters, those who carry on the accounting work have to do so in very different and difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when he says that this is the type of Bill that will require careful consideration.  I have no doubt that his appeal to outside organisations to take an interest in this Bill, to submit their recommendations and observations on it, will now be responded to.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I should like to mention: the enforcement of the regulations, when they are made. Again it is a question of the varying conditions that exist between rural and urban areas.  I would ask the Minister to examine again the regulation which requires the sanitary officer to be the inspecting and enforcing officer.  I think the duties of the sanitary officers in the City of Dublin are more than adequate and would allow them little time to carry out this work.  Furthermore, the type of work they carry out would not suit the purposes of this Bill.  They are called upon to examine the sanitary defects of dwelling-houses, to examine rooms in tenement buildings and to certify whether there is sufficient ventilation for the number of people residing there.  I do not think that from experience of their duties, they would <Col N="592" /> have any training for dealing with the desirable level of heating, cleanliness or ventilation required in offices.  As far as urban areas are concerned, these duties could be much more readily performed by experienced officers attached to the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to the possibility of making the Bill applicable, not only in cases where there are more than five persons employed, but even in cases where there are less than five persons employed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should again like to welcome the Bill and in particular compliment the Minister on introducing it so early in his period of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anything has been said which would call for much comment.  We all agree that it was necessary to provide by legislation for the regulation of conditions of office workers.  The only question now left is the form of details which might be enshrined in the Bill later. That is a matter with which the Dáil can most usefully deal in Committee. I suggest we fix the Committee Stage for June 5th, which, even allowing for all the work we have to do in the meantime, will give us sufficient time to give this measure the necessary consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the more important Estimates to be considered by the Dáil.  I should like to say initially that over many decades much ink has been spilled on the subject of education, and no doubt we could to-day <Col N="593" /> engage ourselves for a considerable time in examining all aspects of the matter.  There are just one or two remarks which I should like to address to the Minister.  In particular, I should like to refer to the general position in regard to the primary education of our children.  According to the Minister, the approximate number of children attending primary schools at the present time is in the neighbourhood of 500,000.  In the course of his opening statement, the Minister suggested that the percentage of children between the ages of 15 and 16 years receiving full-time education was 60.  He also suggested that the number of children between 16 and 17 years of age receiving full-time education was 40 per cent. of the whole.</P>
      <P>One wonders what has happened to the other very large percentage, those children who leave school at 14 years of age and who do not for one reason or another receive any further education. The reason I pose the question about these children is this: the Estimate under the heading &ldquo;Primary Education&rdquo; sets out a figure of something like £5,000,000 for that type of education.  However, less than 50 per cent. of the children covered by the services provided in that Estimate go on to receive secondary, vocational or higher education.  Accordingly, does the money spent represent an investment of real benefit to the children? Does the expenditure of these very substantial amounts annually on primary education serve the purposes for which they are intended?</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to adumbrate here at any length the purposes of education.  However, there are far too many children who do not appear to have received the education provided for them.  I should like to make it quite plain that I join with the Minister in the tribute he paid to the national teachers.  We are all aware of the devotion shown by these teachers to the children placed in their charge.  I do not know what the experience is in rural areas&mdash;maybe there is closer contact there between the teachers and their charges than in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is true to say there are <Col N="594" /> many children in the City of Dublin to-day who leave the primary schools at the age of 14 years, to all intents and purposes, illiterate.  I would ask the Minister to look into the problem of education not only from the point of view of the children who go on from the primary schools to secondary schools, technical schools and universities, but also of the children who do not have these opportunities and are compelled, possibly because of economic circumstances, to enter into employment directly they leave the primary schools.  The Minister might satisfy himself whether the training given to those children in the primary schools is of real value to them in making their way in life afterwards.</P>
    <P>I note in the Estimate for Secondary Education that the number of those attending the secondary schools in the past 30 years has doubled, I think.  It is indeed gratifying to see that there is an increase; but can we be satisfied with the rate of progress in these years, in providing facilities for secondary education?  Deputies from various parts of the country&mdash;and in particular Deputies representing city constituencies&mdash;are well aware of the fact that a number of secondary education establishments in the City of Dublin have very long waiting lists.  I do not know whether it is actually true or not, but it is frequently said that to obtain admission, you require some degree of influence.  Of course, this situation should not exist as regards children seeking to obtain higher education.  It exists mainly because of the shortage of secondary schools.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw the Minister's attention to the situation which has existed for a number of years in the City of Dublin.  Consequent upon the rapid development of our city and the flow of our population out from the city centres, there has been a need for new schools.  This need has continued to develop.  Efforts have been made by those responsible to deal with it as rapidly as possible.  Nevertheless, the situation still exists whereby children require to travel from outlying housing areas four or five miles to attend the school near where they resided previously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> The actual condition is that, even though the plans of the local authority to provide houses have been known well in advance and sites have been made available as speedily as possible, the construction of the schools necessary in the new areas has not been completed for one, two or even three years after the families went to live in the new areas.  This has caused hardship on the children and economic hardship on the families, and it has contributed a great deal to absenteeism from schools.  There are many hundreds of parents in and around the City of Dubin who are very seriously concerned because of the difficulty in obtaining places in schools for their children near their homes.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister indicates that he has accepted, and will operate in full, the recommendation of the last arbitration on teachers' salaries.  I think that should be noted with approval by this House.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister again if he will examine carefully the position of primary education from the point of view of the child whose only education is primary education, because that is vital to the education system and vital not only to the children at present but to future generations of our citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject under discussion is of sufficient importance, I suppose, for each Deputy to make some contribution, however brief. Sometimes our silence is likely to be interpreted as acquiescence in the present system, or as meaning that all is well, whereas few Deputies will agree that all is well in the matter of primary education or, for that matter, of secondary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various Ministers time and again have made suggestions.  One Minister recently made a novel suggestion, that of setting aside one day in the week, in which the teacher could indulge in any type of programme he decided on.  It was an admirable suggestion but I do not recollect what the outcome was.  So far as I know, no action was taken about it at the time.  Most <Col N="596" /> people agree that the curriculum is overcrowded at the present time and that in the schools&mdash;particularly one-teacher schools, which are so plentiful, unfortunately, throughout rural Ireland, due to declining averages&mdash;it would be impossible to cover adequately all the subjects the teachers are supposed to cover.  I found it a good suggestion at the time, and if one day were set aside on which the teacher could choose any subject he pleased, whether general knowledge, rural science or any other topic, or even ordinary discussion, it might be a very useful thing, as it would create a taste which the children have not very often developed in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister can hardly be expected at this stage to have had time to work out any new or revolutionary changes in the system.  I submit it is a system which lends itself to close examination time and again, with a view to bringing in the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>Coming from a constituency like Donegal, one is necessarily interested in the more important aspect of education&mdash;the vocational continuation education. We are concerned mainly with the lack of funds for the full development of educational facilities in our area.  Unfortunately, many of our people cannot afford the luxury of secondary education and the technical school is the only prospect for the thousands of children who cannot look forward to getting&mdash;let alone an education in some of the snob schools&mdash; education in the ordinary secondary schools throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We look to the vocational schools to provide a much needed want and give to those children a continuation of education which otherwise they must go without.  Sometimes it is said: why send children to vocational schools when they have to emigrate afterwards? Better provide work before you provide them with better educational facilities.  My answer to that is: whether they are to emigrate or not, better send out into the world fit to meet whatever hazards they may have to overcome in life; better send them out to do a more useful job for themselves and the country they represent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> Equip them to meet the world whether it be at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>We should have reached a time when vocational educational facilities should be at the disposal of every poor family in the country, particularly in the congested and Gaeltacht areas where there is very little of such facilities at the moment.  This year we received bad news with regard to our grant.  I do not want to say any more other than to express the hope that that is only a temporary setback which will be overcome in the future.</P>
    <P>Vocational education, too, is something which should be re-examined with regard to a particular bias, and our experience already goes to show that it is necessary in the rural schools to give it a rural bias.  Rural science, agriculture, horticulture, anything related to the land, is essential if we are ever to restore not merely a love for the land but even a slight incentive for the youth to remain on the land.</P>
    <P>There are other branches of vocational education which are not properly developed along the western seaboard.  Perhaps our best hopes for the future must be based on the fishing industry.  We have scarcely a marine school, scarcely a subject related to marine products, to fishing or navigation, taught in any school.  I would like the Minister to examine the possibilities of introducing in the technical schools established on the western seaboard subjects covered by competent teachers relating to the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is becoming, and I hope will more rapidly become, more scientific day by day.  If our young people are to adapt themselves to the changing methods of the more up-to-date system and the various contrivances which are now applied to the industry, we must train the youth in order to give them an opportunity to play a full part in the development of the industry and thereby give to themselves employment which they can find at home or are likely to find at home if the necessary development takes place.  If we find there are not sufficient schools in which to have these subjects taught on the western seaboard&mdash;and when I say the western <Col N="598" /> seaboard I mean from Donegal to Kerry, and I do not think one would find very many technical schools on that coast&mdash;then let us set about providing those schools.</P>
    <P>Why should we devote the preponderance of the money voted in this House to providing schools in the larger cities to equip youth for unproductive employment?  Any expenditure in the way of continuation education now should be closely related to production and unless we concentrate on agriculture, horticulture and other subjects related to the land and to the fishing industry, we cannot say our expenditure on those schools in education of that type is going towards productive employment.  Not merely is it important in that it would be related to production but also in that by being so related it would be related to the furtherance of practically the only potential industry on the western seaboard.  If we are to save the western seaboard, if we are to keep our people there at all, it is only by concentrating now on what is likely to equip them for the main industries which belong to those areas.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that he should devote a good deal of study and thought to the question, firstly, of providing additional schools in the areas where they are most needed and, secondly, of providing therein the type of education which will equip our young people for employment which they are likely to get in their own country.  A good deal of money is required for any project of a useful kind nowadays.  One is not likely to undertake the spending of vast amounts unless one is satisfied that it is going towards a useful purpose. I do not think that any commission who would inquire into the suggestion I make, or any Minister who would give the necessary study to the problem, would fail to come to the conclusion that any money spent in that direction would be spent in a proper manner and in a manner which would ultimately give better results to the country, to the educational system as a whole, and to industry which is crying out for the necessary development and a better technical know-how to pursue that industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> In conclusion, I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to give some serious thought to that matter in connection with the forthcoming Estimates, so that next year when we come to discuss this Estimate we will find that greater progress has been made towards the provision of technical schools in the congested and Gaeltacht areas, of a more suitable curriculum to provide the type of continuation education of which our youth in the congested areas are sadly in need at the moment.  I want to express the hope also, as I said, that the curtailment of the grant towards the development of our educational facilities is only a temporary setback which will be made good in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat surprised to-day by the answer the Minister gave to the question I raised, and particularly the second part of it.  I fail to understand how the Minister could have taken anything from it other than the cost of subsidy per thousand ton lot from three different works: (a) from the sugar company, Mallow and (b) and (c) from the two local works in Crookstown.  At this stage, I want to draw the Minister's attention to certain figures given to me.  I know that he has the advantage in his Department of being able to get the information necessary and, perhaps, he would then check this information and compare one with the other.</P>
      <P>We agree that the subsidy is essential in the case of ground limestone, which is a very important commodity indeed; every penny spent on it is well spent.  I come now to the figures given by the Minister.  Within a radius of ten miles, there is a subsidy of 5/9 per ton.  That would work out, in relation to 1,000 tons supplied from the local limeworks, at £287 10s.  From the information I secured in relation to a distance of 31 to 35 miles, 1,000 tons which could be provided in the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> Crookstown area by the local people at a cost of £287 10s., costs £708 6s. 8d. when it comes from the sugar company, since the subsidy is increased owing to the longer mileage.</P>
    <P>In this district at the moment, there is an order going through for a little over 5,000 tons through a local combine of farmers.  Now the Minister may say that they will get this lime cheaper from the sugar company. Possibly that is so.  They may get it at about 1/6 a ton cheaper.  If that is the case, the farmers will gain £375 by giving the order to Mallow.  There are roughly 200 to 250 farmers involved and that means that the £375 must be divided between them.  In order to give the farmers that £375, there will be an additional loss to the State on the 5,000 tons of £2,104 3s. 4d.</P>
    <P>In the Crookstown, Bandon and Enniskean area, it is estimated that nothing less than 26,000 tons of ground limestone will be required this year. Every ton of that will be needed.  If the farmers procure it from this company, they will again make a profit. That profit will amount to £1,950. Roughly 500, or more, farmers will be involved.  While it is considered economic to give the order to this company in order to gain £1,950 the State is nevertheless prepared to lose £10,941 13s. 4d.  We were told here to-day that there is no money for anything.  There is no money for housing.  The problem, in relation to everything, is money. Yet, here in this one instance, we have a figure of loss to the State of £10,941. It is well that people should know how much is being paid out in subsidy.  We are all agreed that a subsidy is necessary but, in the case of 26,000 tons, the State is prepared to pay £7,425, and we are prepared to support that payment. That is the cost of subsidy on 26,000 tons at 5/9 per ton.  Apparently, however, that will not do.  Instead of paying £7,475 at a time of financial embarrassment, the State is prepared to pay a total subsidy of £18,416 13s. 4d. That leaves a balance of £10,941.</P>
    <P>I do not know what line the Minister will take.  He certainly gave no indication to-day and he made no attempt to get the matter straightened out.  I am not interested in rings, cartels or combines, <Col N="601" /> whether they be in lime or anything else.  One particular point in the answer to-day is worth remembering. We were told that the maximum distance was 35 miles.  The Minister stated to-day that 35 miles is the limit, except where the nearest plant is over 35 miles distant.  That is the crux of this matter.  The idea seems to be to wipe out the small firm, to throw the local man on to the unemployment register.  When the small firms are wiped out, the 35 miles can be wiped out; when the small firms disappear there will be no more competition. Then the field will be open to the strong combine and, using the Minister's own words, where the nearest plant is over 35 miles, the subsidy still stands.  Are we to continue this policy? What are we going to do about it?  Are we prepared to fool ourselves by saying we believe in competition?  There is no competition because it is a wellknown fact that the subsidy itself is allowed by Government decree, provided that the price per ton is not over 16/&ndash; If the rate to be charged is not over 16/&ndash; then the subsidy rate stands. I can tell the Minister that I have the facts and can get the records from the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that because of such keen competition in the off-season a company can slash the price from 16/&ndash; to roughly 8/6.  We had experience in the past of people supplying goods at prices which everyone knew were sometimes not giving a profit. The idea seemed to be to remove the opposition, remove the small firms, put them out of business and leave the big firms to do what they like.  Will that be the position here?  It should be possible for the Minister to consider some system of zoning.  It should also be possible for the Minister again to consider the price in relation to what is allowed by the Department in connection with the costs versus subsidy.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to say what the price of the ground limestone should be by the firm.  Between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of industry and Commerce we ought to be able to hammer out a scheme which would give a fair return in regard to profit and cost on the <Col N="602" /> limestone.  We should then consider the subsidy.  If that is not done we will have to continue paying subsidies in cases where there is no justification.</P>
    <P>It is well for the Minister to remember that&mdash;and this comes from people in the trade&mdash;it is an admitted fact, openly stated by these people, that the profit is not really in the lime but in the subsidy allowed for the cartage of it.  Therefore, the longer the haulage of the lime, the bigger the profit for the firm concerned.  It is about time this matter was gone into.  As I said at the start, it is essential that we allow the subsidy based on the figures given by the Minister to-day.  We agree with that.  What we do not agree with is a system which is wiping out local industries which in itself means that by the removal of the small local industries the large firm can then take over.  The people who tell us at times how to run this country are running the limestone system very well under this subsidy allowed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>While the Minister failed to give an answer to-day&mdash;I do not know whether or not it was convenient for him to do so&mdash;I would ask him now to consider the matter, otherwise many awkward questions will be asked here in relation to (a) all the projects for which we have not money and (b) some of the projects upon which we are throwing away money in order to give extra profits to more firms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what Deputy Desmond said.  We have the same difficulty in Carrigtwohill area in East Cork.  I see no reason why this should not be zoned.  You have a big firm, State subsidised and State owned, coming in now and commencing to wipe out the smaller industries. There are something over 100 men employed in two ground limestone plants in my area within four or five miles of me.  Those two ground limestone plants are now getting the same dose.  In my opinion the whole of that subsidy has been wrongly used.  It was used in the first instance to subsidise C.I.E. and it is now being used in the same manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to call the Minister's <Col N="603" /> attention also to the fact that the couny council and ratepayers of Cork have to maintain the roads used by those heavy lorries.  If the zoning system were adopted and enforced for the past two years we would have £1,000,000 in the funds now of the limestone subsidy instead of the £500,000, which the Minister told me a fortnight ago was all that was left. That will not last another nine months and it would not pay the C.I.E. subsidy for 12 months.  That is the present position.  It is about time that we closed in and zoned the areas within a 20-miles radius.</P>

      <P>With regard to the two firms to which the Deputy referred in his question.  I looked up the figures and I find that in one of the firms the tonnage delivered during March and April was 27,000 in 1956 and 30,760 in 1957.  Again, last year another one of them delivered 15,626 and this year, during these two months, 18,000. Therefore, if 40 men were disemployed this year there must have been more disemployed last year, because in fact, they have delivered more lime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not say that it is an easy matter to settle and give a subsidy upon the delivery of ground limestone having regard to the fact that the plants in which it is produced are not spaced like the pieces on a draught board, equi-distant all over the country.  You have some areas in the country which are 50 miles from any possible source of supply and you have other places where there are plenty of limestone deposits and in which crushing plants can be erected every couple of hundred yards.  However, if <Col N="604" /> you try to zone and give a firm a monopoly within a certain radius it certainly will not have a good effect on the price of lime as far as the farmers are concerned.  Leaving the option of giving the subsidy for a certain distance and then giving no subsidy over that distance unless the farmer is more than 35 miles away from any possible source of supply, helps to keep lime cheap for the farmers in these particular areas.  But in regard to the concerns referred to by the Deputy to-day, it has not reduced the output of lime.</P>
    <P>One thing we want is to get all the lime possible distributed on land that requires it.  We want to get that done as quickly as possible and, from the farmers' point of view, we want it done at the cheapest possible rate. The price which these concerns might charge the farmer in order to get the subsidy is fixed at 16/&ndash;.  That was done by the Minister whom Deputy Desmond supported for quite a number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, however, it has been found by the firms he spoke about to-day and by others that they are prepared to sell it to the farmers for 10/&ndash;, 11/&ndash; or 12/&ndash;.  That certainly represents a good saving for the farmer and it is a good thing for the country that some of the lime deficiency is being made up.</P>
      <P>The way out of this situation is to get the farmers to spread more lime. We are spreading only about 1,000,000 tons although 2,000,000 tons are being bleached out of the soil every year.  It is estimated that there is a deficiency of about 12,000,000 tons in the land of the country.  That is why we want more and more lime spread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lime subsidy has been considered several times.  When the former Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, the late Deputy T. Walsh, took office there was no distance limit to the haulage of lime.  He introduced a system which imposed a limit and that helped to save on subsidy in relation to very long hauls which, in turn, enabled the amount of money available <Col N="605" /> to be spread over more tons of lime.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to examine any reasonable proposition as to how this lime subsidy could be better handled, bearing in mind the fact that we want it to be sold to the farmer at the cheapest possible price.  I have no fixed ideas on the matter.  My mind is quite open to accept any suggestion which can be worked out satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>With regard to those concerns to which the Deputy alluded to-day, the production of lime has gone up this year as against last year and I hope it will continue to rise.  It would be particularly desirable if the output of lime from these plants would rise at this time of the year because the right time to put lime on the land is during the summer months, particularly on grassland.  The heavy spreaders can be loaded up at the lime plant and when the land is dry and firm, as it is during the summer months, they can drive over most of the land in the country. It would also mean that the work at the plants would be spread out so that the lorries and the men would be employed the whole year round.  Obviously, if they are employed for 12 months of the year on the production of ground limestone it is bound to reduce the overheads, spreading them over more months of the year, rather than concentrating on producing and delivering the lime in just a few months in the late winter and early spring.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see from advertisements in the various local papers, all <Col N="606" /> the ground limestone producers are giving inducements to farmers to buy ground limestone during the summer months and in the early autumn.  The farmers should accept that inducement because a lot of the land badly needs to have acidity corrected and the sooner the farmers apply the ground limestone the better and the more profitable it is for themselves if they apply it at those times when it is offered cheaply to them by the ground limestone producers.  As I have said, it is offered to them at a cheaper rate during the summer months.  I hope they will take advantage of that offer and do something to correct acidity of the soil because that acidity is handicapping farm production.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Corry or anybody else has any suggestions to make as to how this scheme can be better handled I am quite prepared to give it every consideration. I do not think, however, his idea of a tight zone into which no one can deliver lime except the men in the locality would have any effect other than that of driving up the price of lime to the farmer, which is something we do not want to happen.  However, if he or anybody else has some scheme thought out or can think out any scheme that will have the effect of saving on subsidy and at the same time getting the lime cheaper for the farmers, I am quite prepared to give it every consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state in respect of the year 1956/57 (a) the total estimated expenditure on primary school buildings, the amount actually expended, and the number of schools involved, and (b) the total number of cases in which over £5,000 was expended and the total amount spent on such schools; and if he will give an estimate along similar lines of his proposals for 1957/58.</P>

      <P>The estimated grant expenditure on the building and improvement of national schools during the year ended 31st March, 1957, was £1,350,000.  The actual expenditure during the year was £1,408,496 and the number of schools involved was 668. On each of 54 schools expenditure exceeded £5,000 and the total amount expended on these 54 schools was £917,120.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount provided for grants in aid of the building and improvement of national schools in the Estimate for Public Works and Buildings for 1957/58 is £1,550,000.  It is anticipated <Col N="492" /> that of this sum £1,425,000 will be expended on 261 major works (estimated to cost £500 or more) already in progress or authorised and £70,000 on an unspecified number of smaller works. The balance of £55,000 provided in the Estimate will be allocated during the year in respect of further cases of very great urgency, the number of which it is not possible to state at present. It is further anticipated that on each of 45 projects expenditure will exceed £5,000 and that the total expenditure on these works will be £970,000.</P>
