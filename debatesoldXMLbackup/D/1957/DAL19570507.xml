      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether provision is made in the census forms for an accurate recording of the number of itinerants using our public highways as camping places, and, if so, if he will state (a) the number of such people as revealed in the most recent census, and (b) whether in relation to previous returns the number has increased.</P>

      <P>In the household schedules used at the 1946 and 1956 Censuses of Population provision was made for the classification of families by type of residence, &ldquo;Itinerant family&rdquo; being one of the categories distinguished.  The total number of persons in such families in May, 1946, was 5,554.  Subsequent to the data of the 1956 Census it was decided on the grounds of economy to limit work on this census to the production of figures of population classified by sex and area.  In consequence the figure for persons in itinerant families derivable from the 1956 Census is not available.</P>

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not think from the information given that this is an urgent and serious problem?  Is it not the fundamental duty of the Government to protect the property of the people and protect the people from undue annoyance by those itinerants and, since there is more or less a break down in the law as it relates to the control of those people, would he not consider setting up a Committee of this House and getting the views of those familiar with the type of life these itinerants <Col N="766" /> lead and the nuisance they cause occasionally, in the hope of assisting the Department to finalise rapidly any proposals they consider for the more effective control of these people?</P>

      <P>Questions relating to housing accommodation were not asked at the 1951 or 1956 Censuses of Population, the most recent Census of Population at which the particulars required by the Deputy were collected being that taken in the year 1946.  I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the desired information in respect of this Census and the two preceding Censuses of Population.</P>

    <P>There are 46 import items in respect of which customs duty or Special Import Levy has been reduced or revoked since 20th March, 1955.  Separate import statistics are not kept for most of these items and the task of extracting the import values from the relevant customs entry documents over the last two years would involve undue expense in these cases.  In the case of some items&mdash;perhaps one-third or so of the total&mdash;import values for the two years could be obtained without much difficulty and if the Deputy wishes to have these I would ask him to repeat his question in a week's time when the information should be available.  I should add that import values are on e.i.f. basis and f.o.b. values cannot be supplied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture what are his proposals for expediting the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="OA" LHead="Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions. Oral Answers." RHead="- Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Aiken):">
    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Aiken):</Title>
    <P>One of the first problems I examined in the Department was how to speed up the eradication of tuberculosis in <Col N="769" /> cattle.  In view of the fact that the British authorities estimate that they will have all their herds under test by 1960, it is of the utmost urgency that we should be in a position by then to ensure that all the cattle we export are tuberculin tested from tuberculin tested herds; otherwise the utmost confusion will arise in the cattle trade, with disastrous consequences for our farmers.</P>
    <P>The position at the moment is that the intensive eradication scheme is in operation in only two counties&mdash;Sligo and Clare, as well as Bansha, and that pre-intensive measures are being taken only in eight other counties.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to press forward with the complete eradication in the areas I have named, and, for that purpose, 25 additional lay inspectors are being recruited as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that there are 16 counties in which intensive eradication has not yet been put into operation, and these include all but one of the intensive creamery areas in which the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle is the highest.  In order to make a start in these counties, pending the extension of the intensive scheme, herd-owners will be encouraged to avail to the widest possible extent of the accredited herd scheme.  In addition, it is proposed to take measures to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis by intensifying the removal of open or clinical cases in all herds by paying better compensation for such cases reported under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order, 1926.  It is hoped that farmers will realise that it is in their interest to have these open cases removed from their herds as quickly as possible so that their stock will not be infected by them, and that the number of reactors to be removed later under the intensive scheme will be reduced.  The Minister for Finance has approved of giving better compensation for clinical cases, and he will refer to it in his Budget speech.</P>
    <P>One other acute source of infection is the separated milk returned to the farmers from the creameries, and it is of the utmost urgency that all such <Col N="770" /> milk be pasteurised so that the young stock may be saved from infection.  It is proposed to speed up the installation of the regenerative pasteurisation plant in all creameries, and to take legislative powers to compel pasteurisation by the use of such plants or by steam injection into the separated milk.</P>
    <P>Legislative powers will also be sought to secure the removal of reactors in the intensive areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to what the Minister means by 25 lay inspectors.  Is this the scheme where-under lay inspectors will be substituted in the meat factories so as to release a number of veterinary surgeons for work in the anti-T.B. scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No. We are trying to speed up the intensive scheme and, as the Deputy knows, we are limited in that by the number of veterinary people.  We intend to take some of the ordinary work from the veterinary surgeons, that is, the evaluating of cattle, ordering their removal from the herds, and work of that kind, which could be carried out by trained laymen, thus allowing the trained veterinary officer to concentrate on his own particular work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers):</Title>
    <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
    <P>The Deputies, I feel sure, will understand that it would be invidious and improper to single out for publicity such landowners as are negotiating with the Land Commission or whose lands are merely the subject of tentative consideration.  In County Galway there are at present 47 such cases and in County Kildare 49 cases.  I am entirely satisfied that individual publicity in respect of these cases would be contrary to the public interest.</P>
    <P>I can therefore give the Deputies the information requested only in respect of such compulsory cases as are published in pursuance of the Statutes; this information is in the form of tabular statements which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Following are the statements:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" />
      <Col N="774" />LIST of compulsory cases in (1) Co. Galway and (2) Co. Kildare in which Provisional List or Notice of Intention to resume has been published and in which possession has not yet been taken.</P>

      <P>I regret that I cannot furnish the Deputy with separate figures for West Galway.  My Department's acquisition records are maintained on a county basis and it would involve the expenditure of an undue amount of official time to extract information relating to a large part of a county.</P>
      <P>The position for County Galway as a whole is that at a recent date my Department had on hands a total of 254 offers of land for forestry purposes, with a total area of approximately 29,500 acres.  Of these, 198 offers involving a total area of over 21,000 acres had been inspected and reported on and 56 offers with a total area of 8,500 acres were awaiting inspection.  Preliminary investigations into registered ownership, rights, etc., involve a lapse of time between the date on which an offer is received and inspection but I can assure the Deputy that my Department is only too anxious to have areas offered to it inspected as rapidly as staff resources permit.</P>

Of these, five offers with a total area of 9,200 acres have been inspected and found unsuitable for afforestation purposes because of soil quality and exposure.  One of the areas rejected comprising 5,500 acres will, however, be reconsidered in a few years' time when the results of experimental planting undertaken on similar soil types in the West become available.</P>
      <P>The sixth offer received comprises a one-seventh share of a commonage of 3,500 acres in the townland of Ballycroy.  This commonage will be inspected as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The scheme of improvements to be carried out at Kildare post office was postponed until the <Col N="778" /> present financial year for economy reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is on the file in the Board of Works a letter indicating that tenders were being invited and that it was expected early in February that this work would be put in hands in the course of the next three weeks?  Does the Minister's reply mean that the matter has been further postponed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only further information I can give the Deputy is that in November, 1955, as a result of a request for tenders a figure was obtained which was then considered too high.  The following January, 1956, a further tender was sought and the figure then had risen by almost 100 per cent.  Following the receipt of that tender in January, 1956, for economic reasons this matter was then postponed and so far as I am aware no further tenders have been invited. However, the decision apparently was taken some time ago to postpone the matter until the financial year 1957-58.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that these repairs and alterations are considered necessary in this office, which is a tiny office and one in which it is extremely difficult for staff to work, would the Minister cause the matter to be brought to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance with a view to having work started as soon as possible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly do as the Deputy requests, but I think it is rather strange that, when this job could have been done in 1955 at a reasonable cost and was not gone ahead with, the Deputy, who was then a Minister, did nothing to get his colleague to do something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The district mentioned is one of a number in the Dublin City area where applications for telephones have been deferred pending the laying of additional underground cables.  It will take a considerable time to carry out underground schemes in all the districts in need of relief, particularly now that such work is restricted because of capital difficulties.  The number of waiting applications in the Ashdale Road district is not abnormal. It is hoped to complete a relief scheme there within the next 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In his concluding remarks last week the Minister paid a well deserved tribute to his predecessor in office and, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I should like to associate myself with his remarks.  His predecessor was a man who gave <Col N="782" /> lengthy service to the Parliament of this country and I, for one, am glad that the present Minister took the opportunity of paying tribute to him and of wishing him long years of happiness in his retirement.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a man who, when on the Opposition Benches, was a very vigorous and active Deputy.  I should like to congratulate him now on his appointment and to express the hope that he will carry his vigour and energy into the Department over which he now presides.</P>
      <P>The work of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is one which has an impact on the lives of all our people. The fact that the annual wage bill of the Department falls not very far short of £1,000,000 per annum gives some idea of the magnitude of the work and the number of employees involved in it.  In asking a supplementary question earlier to-day, I referred to the fact that the telephone service seems to show a substantial profit from year to year.  In the figures the Minister gave us in his opening statement that position is being not only maintained but improved.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that for the year 1954-55 the overall deficit in his Department was £246,000 odd.  He mentioned that it had been anticipated that the following year, 1955-56, would show a deficit roughly about double that for the year 1954-55, but that did not occur in fact; while there was a deficit, and a larger deficit than in the year 1954-55, the position was considerably better than had been anticipated.  For the year 1955-1956 he gave figures showing a deficit in postal services of £264,000 odd, in telegraph services of £238,000 odd and a profit in that year of something over £134,000 on telephone services.  The Minister had not got the actual figures for the overall deficit in 1956-1957 but he pointed out that it was estimated at in or about £146,000 while, in the same year, the telephone services are estimated to show a profit in the neighbourhood of £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He pointed out that the improvement was due partly to increased revenue and partly to the fact that <Col N="783" /> substantial savings had been made by the application of modern and more economical methods, particularly in the telegraph service.  I think it is worth while underlining that.  All of us are aware of the criticism which is levelled against Governments because of the height of public expenditure.  I think it is worth while underlining the fact that in regard to the administration of this Department for the year 1956-1957, the Minister is able to come into the House, referring as he naturally is to the year under the supervision of his predecessor, and point out that there has been a big improvement in the position and that the improvement is not merely because of increased revenue but also because of the work of the Department and, we may take it, of his predecessor in bringing about substantial savings with modern and more economical methods in the telegraph service.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned it is anticipated that in the year 1957-1958 further improvements will take place.  He referred to the good relations between his Department and the staff and to the conciliation council set up under the arbitration scheme for civil servants.  I think all of us will join in expressing pleasure that the conciliation council which was set up is apparently proving to be a very worthwhile instrument and that it has maintained good relations between the Department and the staff.  Talking from recollection, I think the Minister mentioned that in respect of about 14 claims which had been dealt with it was possible to secure agreement on all except one.</P>
    <P>He referred also to the sub-postmasters' consultative council which had been established by his predecessor. That council is, I understand, to cater for sub-postmasters who do not come within the ambit of the arbitration scheme.  He mentioned that this council was also proving to be a most helpful and worthwhile body.  I refer to these things because I think it right that when the review of a year's work in a Department has been so satisfactory, as the Minister is able to report in relation to this particular Department, <Col N="784" /> we should, as I mentioned earlier, underline the fact and we should mention it again as a tribute to the work of the Minister's predecessor who is no longer in this House.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by mentioning one item which may appear to be rather small but to which I would like the Minister to give some attention during the forthcoming year.  Every now and again Deputies ask the Minister questions in this House about the erection of public telephone kiosks and very often the reply received is that it is not proposed to erect the particular kiosk in question because the use which is likely to be made of it is unlikely to warrant the cost of erection. I want to appeal to the Minister again, having regard to the fact that the telephone services are undoubtedly the paying end of his Department, that he should not regard this question of erecting additional public telephone kiosks purely from the point of view of hard economics.  I do not suppose that any Deputy can disagree that in most of the cases, where requests for the erection of these public telephone boxes are refused, the Department are justified in refusing them on economic grounds&mdash;refusing them because they feel that, taken over the year, the number of calls that will be made will not be worth while, worth while in the sense of contributing seriously towards the cost of erection.  In many cases these public kiosks are required in areas where, again looking at it from the economic point of view, it would be virtually impossible ever to make out a strong case as to the user of the box meeting the cost within a comparatively short time.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, in view of the fact that telephone services are the paying end, I feel that there should be some elasticity in the approach to this question and that, as far as possible, the Minister should go out of his way towards seeing to it that, even if it is not possible to meet the economic cost of the erection of these kiosks, they should, nevertheless, be erected.  That applies not only in rural areas but in some areas in the City of Dublin where it is not very easy for people in a dense population to get to the available  <Col N="785" /> public boxes.  I do not think there is anything else I want to say on this Estimate.  Again, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I hope he will be able to report as successfully to this House at the end of his first 12 months in office as he was at the end of the last 12 months of his predecessor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has only taken over the duty of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, it would be unfair to discuss this Estimate in any embarrassingly detailed way.  I do not, therefore, propose to do that, as the Minister obviously has to get a chance to find his feet.  I do, however, want to bring some matters to the notice of the Minister.  If he is able to reply to them to-day well and good&mdash;I shall be glad&mdash;but if not perhaps the Minister would in due course let me have his views on the matters.  I can quite appreciate it may not be possible for him in the short time at his disposal to give answers to these questions which, no matter how much you try to simplify them, nevertheless, assume a technical aspect when dealing with the Post Office Department.</P>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister refer to the fact that the relations with the staff are good.  They are good.  I think they are better than they have ever been in the history of the Post Office.  It is only fair to say that many people on the administrative side of the Post Office, as well as those who represent the staff, have been responsible for bringing about that rather cordial climate.  The whole process has been immensely aided by the introduction of the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  Through the medium of that machinery, it has been possible to have joint talks between the official side, on the one hand, and the staff side, on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think these discussions have indicated that both sides have a natural interest in improving the Post Office service and in promoting greater efficiency there.  The development of the Post Office service and the promotion of greater efficiency obviously requires that the staff should be treated fairly.  The conciliation and <Col N="786" /> arbitration machinery has brought about, with the aid of the official representatives and the staff representatives, a new standard in staff relations.  I hope it will be the aim of all concerned to continue the standard of relationship which now exists and improve upon it, if that be possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to post office buildings.  I want to dwell on that topic for a few moments.  If the Minister looks back over the Post Office records he will find that, certainly since the change of Government in 1922, there has been constant agitation in this House and between the Post Office and the Board of Works to have alterations carried out on post office premises, to have many of these premises rebuilt&mdash;some were not originally built as post offices&mdash;and to have others extended to provide for the new types of work which have been put on the Post Office, especially in consequence of the development of social services.  Over the past 35 years there has been a constant battle to get this essential building work attended to.  Down through the years, some improvements have been effected here and there but the improvements have never been sufficient to obviate the very substantial back-log of work which has to be done.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had an opportunity of visiting post offices throughout the country he would find in many of these offices an obvious need for renovation, for extension of accommodation and for improvements generally in order to bring these buildings into conformity with modern requirements.  I have no doubt but that the Minister will experience, as many of his predecessors did, considerable difficulty in getting the Board of Works to do all the work a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will feel it is necessary to do in order to provide proper post office buildings but I urge him to go about the task vigorously.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that, in the Board of Works, it is a case that the crying child gets the most attention.  If he is satisfied to wait for the evolution of a file between the Board of Works and the Post Office in the matter of having buildings reconstructed or extended I <Col N="787" /> am afraid the Minister will find that a pretty frustrating experience.  Now that building work generally has sagged in various parts of the country, I think the lacuna might be filled in by the Post Office undertaking not unnecessary but absolutely vital reconstruction and extension work on many offices throughout the country.  I hope the Minister will give that question a high place on the priority list of things which the Post Office should do.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Minister's introductory statement a reference to the Pearse Street Post Office.  There appears to be more timidity surrounding the question of that office now than I have noticed for many years past.  The history of the place is most illuminating.  The Post Office moved into this old distillery in Pearse Street 35 years ago.  While the map of Europe has been drawn and redrawn, while kings and dictators have fallen all over Europe, the Post Office remains there in all its dismal majesty, the occupier of this old distillery in Pearse Street.  If good intentions could have rebuilt that distillery, it would by now have reached the sky. Every Minister avers his determination during his term of office to rebuild this distillery and to give Dublin a decent sorting and central distributing office. However, whatever qualities the Pearse Street building has, so far, it has resisted every Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from 1922 to 1957 and the building is there as impregnable, apparently, as ever.  It would seem from the Minister's statement on this year's Estimate that there are no brave hearts left to continue the assault on the citadel.  The inference is that a shortage of money would now be a compelling reason for delay.</P>
    <P>If people had gone about rebuilding the Pearse Street Sorting Office in 1924 or 1925 it could then have been built for about 20 per cent. of the cost which would be involved to-day.  We postpone the work every year.  Now, in 1957, we are still not ready to contemplate its rebuilding: I do not say &ldquo;undertake its rebuilding.&rdquo; In view of the apparent faint-heartedness about the intentions towards the building <Col N="788" /> in the Minister's statement this year, it looks to me as if, this time next year, we will probably be in the same position, that is, very much the position in which we were very many years ago.</P>
    <P>I am not making this a point against the present Minister: it could be made&mdash;and properly made&mdash;against every Minister since 1922.  However, when you think of the way in which countries which were devastated in the war have been able to rebuild themselves, countries which were left with no economy at all, countries which were left with a currency whose value was indistinguishable from wallpaper, and compare our position, then it must be admitted that it is strange that, after 35 years of self-government, we have not yet been able to undertake the building of a new central sorting and delivery office in Pearse Street.  Almost everything has changed in Ireland and in Europe in the past 35 years.  Our one link with the past is that delightful old-world building, the former distillery in Pearse Street.</P>
    <P>This Minister would go down in history if he could be the Minister responsible for starting the rebuilding of the Pearse Street premises.  Much as I dislike his politics, I wish the Minister well in going down in history as having done that worthwhile work either in Pearse Street or in Sheriff Street. Something should be done about it.  We are probably the only country in Europe which, for the past 35 years, has been using a virtual slum as a central sorting and delivery office.  I do not know whether or not it is hoped to celebrate a 50 years' occupancy of the building and to issue a stamp to commemorate the fact, but, if that be the intention, I advise that it be abandoned.  It would be very much better to see that building come down and a beginning made on the new buildings which are very necessary from an efficiency point of view and from a staff point of view.  Such a new building would, in the long run, repay the investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that during the year ended 31st March last the number of telegrams handled amounted to approximately 2.1 millions as compared <Col N="789" /> with 2.7 millions in the previous year.  He further indicated that the telegraph traffic has slumped in recent months.  I would ask the Minister to tell us, if the information is available to him, at what point the Post Office believe telegraph traffic will settle down?  Is the decline continuing and what is the percentage of decline in recent months?  Do the Post Office believe they are near rock bottom in telegraph traffic or do they believe they will have, as it were, a continuing decline so far as telegraph traffic is concerned?  Is the decline to continue, or can the Post Office foresee the stage at which they will have got the hard core of telegraph traffic which is likely to remain with them under present day circumstances and at present day charges?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the telegraph reorganisation and other changes in staffing which were rendered necessary as a result of that reorganisation.  I know nothing more irritating to staff than to be faced with a redundancy problem.  It shows itself in a curtailment of outlets, a retarding of promotion and it involves an assignment of staff to duties which are not proper to their grade and which are, in fact, proper to other grades.  That situation is showing itself already in the redundancy which exists in the Post Office.  I should like to ascertain from the Minister what are the Post Office proposals for dealing with this problem, and how long is it likely to take before the problems will be solved?  I gather we have not yet reached the limit of redundancy and that further redundancy may in fact take place in consequence of the curtailment of staff in railway telegraph offices.</P>
    <P>All that is the inevitable outflow of telegraph reorganisation but it would be helpful if the Minister could indicate what are his proposals for dealing with the matter.  If it is just intended to allow the redundancy to be solved by retirement, by emigration, by superannuation and deaths, it will take a fair time to solve, but there are other methods by which a solution could be supplemented.  For instance, the Post Office could secure agreement with the <Col N="790" /> Department of Finance whereby that Department would allow redundant Post Office clerks to be siphoned off the Post Office clerk grade by providing them with entry into general service clerical officer grade.</P>
    <P>Vacancies occur in that grade from year to year and these vacancies are sometimes filled from outside, but if the Post Office has a redundancy of clerks it seems to me, by merest exercise of intelligence, that the redundant clerks in the Post Office should be assigned to general service clerical officer posts instead of recruiting new clerical officers at a time when the Post Office has a surplus of Post Office clerks who could be released from their present duties to undertake clerical work that is available.  At present there are many clerks doing duty as telephonists because there are no Post Office clerical vacancies available.  If the Post Office could manage to have a substantial number of clerks taken out of the Post Office grade and assigned to clerical officer posts it would help to bring about normalcy in a reasonable period of time.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to take a personal interest with his Department in this problem and that both should do their best to bring redundancy to an end because so long as it exists it will prove irritating to the staff and wasteful to the Department.</P>
    <P>I was glad to learn that recently discussions have taken place between the Post Office and staff organisations on the question of providing a weekly half-holiday for Post Office staffs.  As the Minister knows, while we provide legislation to ensure a weekly half-holiday for many other classes of workers, Post Office workers have so far been denied the right to a weekly half-holiday.</P>
    <P>Nobody will attempt to minimise the difficulties in dealing with the problem. These difficulties are there, but are by no means insuperable, and I feel satisfied that given goodwill on the part of the Post Office administration and co-operation by the staff on the other hand, it should be possible to evolve arrangements whereby a weekly half-holiday could be provided for staff <Col N="791" /> whose employment is of a character that requires them to serve the public all round the clock.</P>
    <P>I am sure these discussions will have the goodwill and benediction of the Minister and I hope that the Post Office administration which has shown a new outlook and a new approach to staff problems particularly in recent years, will endeavour to find a solution to this problem because I have no doubt a solution can be found if the matter is tackled earnestly and with a desire to give this long-withheld right to the Post Office staff.</P>
    <P>I think there is nothing further that I desire to raise on this Vote and if any of the matters which I have raised are too technical, or inconvenient for the Minister to reply to at this stage I shall be quite satisfied if he will let me have his views at some later date. I realise that no matter how simple one tries to make these matters they may be too technical.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by saying that I hope the Minister will have a pleasant period in office?  There is no reason why he should not, and nobody would wish him anything other than a period of happiness and peace in his new post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and to wish him well.  As a young man, he will, I have no doubt, bring a fresh mind to bear on the problems in connection with the Department of which he is in charge. I only hope that his youth and enthusiasm will not be blunted by the <Col N="792" /> old-timers who seek to smother youth at all cost on all occasions.</P>
      <P>There is one section of the staff under his control that I should like to mention.  I do not know whether or not other Deputies have referred to them&mdash;I mean the more or less forgotten sub-postmasters and postmistresses throughout the country.  I would have thought that some of the Labour Deputies would have made a case on their behalf.  I suppose many Deputies will say that at the present time things are so serious in the international sphere that it is ridiculous to suggest that any section of the public service should be better remunerated.  I maintain this section, the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, have never received remuneration in accordance with the work they do.  The State gets away from its responsibilities by suggesting that alternative means of livelihood are available, as many of these postmasters have a sideline such as a small business.  I think in many cases, that is a very flimsy excuse.  The hours which these people have to work are very long.  There is no allowance worth talking about for the employment of assistants, and every day that goes by sees new duties imposed upon sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.</P>
      <P>Even within the last few months, a further onerous responsibility was placed on sub-postmasters throughout the country, namely, the duty of collecting money under the Prize Bond scheme.  When banks or any other concern carry out such a duty, they are well remunerated by the State in the way of extra allowances, but no such allowance was made to the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses throughout the country for the extra work involved in that case.  I should like that section of the staff under the Minister's control to receive more sympathetic consideration.</P>
      <P>I should like to know, a Cheann Comhairle, whether it is on this Estimate or on the next Estimate that a Deputy is entitled to refer to television?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to acknowledge with very deep appreciation the kind remarks and good wishes that have been offered to me from the other side of the House and I hope that during my time in the Department, I shall justify in some small measure the things that have been said.</P>
      <P>I shall briefly refer, so far as is possible with my limited knowledge of the Department at the moment, to some of the matters which have been raised in the debate.  Deputy M. J. O'Higgins raised a matter which he raised earlier to-day, the question of telephones and the extension or improvement of the telephone service.  He very rightly indicated that, as the telephone service is one of the branches of the Post Office service that show a profit, it is a very sound argument that it is the one service that should not be limited because of the lack of capital. That is very much my own personal view, but there is this difficulty about it, that the capital must, first of all, be raised before we can seek to reap the benefit that is obviously obtainable. The big problem is where we are to get the capital to start with and that is the problem that I, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, find myself up against at the moment and it is a problem that the Government are up against, not only in regard to this matter, but possibly in regard to many other matters that would, in their own way, contribute to the welfare of the entire community, if there were sufficient money to get them all going immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall try to extend the telephone service because I believe it is very necessary to do so, but I must bow to the general good and to the general demand for whatever capital is available. If I cannot get all the money <Col N="794" /> required to give the service that is being demanded by the public&mdash;and I feel that it is impossible at this stage to do so&mdash;Deputies can take it very definitely that I will have this matter always uppermost in my mind and will try to get that service to the people in the shortest possible space of time.</P>
    <P>There was one other small point that Deputy O'Higgins made which, again, struck a bell, so far as I am concerned, that is, the provision of public telephone kiosks.  I take it that the Deputy meant telephone kiosks for public use, not only in the cities and towns, but possibly in parts of rural Ireland.  It is true that, generally, the need for such kiosks is gauged purely and simply, at the moment, by economics. Judging from replies that I received as a Deputy from former Ministers, it can be taken that economics are the ruling factor in the provision of public telephone kiosks, but I am not without sympathy for those like Deputy O'Higgins who advance the argument that, as the service as a whole is paying its way, each isolated application for a public telephone should not be judged purely on the economics of the individual case, that a wider view should be taken and that regard should be had to the very grave need that sometimes exists for such a service.</P>
    <P>That may not conform to past policy in the Department and at the moment I am not prepared to say that I will depart from that policy, but I can assure the Deputy and the House that the view he has expressed is one with which I have considerable sympathy and that the matter will be examined sympathetically, so far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Deputy's remarks in respect to the improvement shown in the working of the Department in various directions over the year, I would point out to the Deputy that the improvement outlined in the introductory speech, the economies and savings that have been effected as a result of the installation of modern and new equipment of various kinds, did not just start last year; it has been going on, I understand, for a considerable number of years.  The one fly in <Col N="795" /> the ointment that I should indicate at the start of this financial year is that I am afraid we cannot look forward to the same rate of advance in the matter of savings and economies in future as we were fortunate enough to secure last year and the year before, for the very good reason that the cream of the economics has been skimmed off, naturally enough, in the first flush of enthusiasm with which this matter was tackled and, therefore, it is the smaller and less weighty economies that we can look forward to in future.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that it will be impossible in future to show the same substantial decrease in running costs that economies over recent years have made possible.  I only hope that that will not prove to be the case but it is only right to point out here and now that that is likely to happen.  Nevertheless, the economy drive will continue and the policy of modernising our offices and equipment and reorganising the entire service will continue so long as it is felt that any worthwhile saving can be effected or, indeed, any improvement of service can be brought about without increasing the cost to the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised a number of matters.  He described in his usual flowery and descriptive language the building in Pearse Street and elsewhere in the city that house some of the most important branches of the Post Office.  The Deputy can take it from me that, short as my time has been in the General Post Office, I am fully aware of the conditions under which the people he referred to work, not only in Pearse Street, but in a number of other premises.  These are not only unsuited to their particular job and detrimental to the service which the workers may give us but they are inefficient in their operation.  It is the wish of the Department and myself, from what I know of this problem, to try to get something done which will not only give better working conditions but produce greater efficiency in our service; and that includes not only the Pearse Street operations but the various operations in other buildings which are scattered about the city.</P>
    <P>So far as going down in history as <Col N="796" /> having got rid of this is concerned, I will not even attempt to quote what the Deputy said&mdash;it is a little beyond me. It would be a matter of historical importance to get rid of this monument. If it is at all within my power to wipe out the building at Pearse Street, I will do it, whether there is any question of its being recorded in history or not. The Deputy need have no fear what-ever that my Department or myself will attempt to issue any stamp to commemorate the 50 years we have been housed there.</P>

      <P>We do not have to waste any of our good time in that direction.  Again, there is the question of staff relations generally which the Deputy will appreciate is so full of complications and difficulties that to fully understand it is a matter which takes quite a while.  He may be assured that the machinery which has established these good relations with staffs over the years will not be interfered with by me, until a very good case has been shown why it should be changed in any way.  I should like to say that good staff relations are absolutely essential in a service such as that carried out by the Post Office. Its functions are so wide, varied and individualistic that, without good staff relations, our postal service could not give the good service it has rendered down the years.  I will do everything in my power to maintain those relations during my term in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of redundancy, related to reorganisation and modernisation, is something which the Deputy has realised, and has agreed with, must arise.  I can quite appreciate his fears and the statements he made here to-day about the difficulties being created for some of those people who have become redundant as a result of the change-over and the continuing change-over. All I can say is that we do understand the situation as outlined by him here to-day and the departmental and general conciliation councils are fully aware of the whole situation.  The suggestion made by Deputy Norton that these clerks should be absorbed into clerical officer vacancies is, I <Col N="797" /> understand, still under active consideration by these people.  I think it is only fair to add that it does seem a sound argument that if we are to try to place these people, we should not at the same time, if it can be avoided, continue driving people into a grade which might, in fact, be filled by those who are now being made redundant by this reorganisation.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of how long this may go on is concerned, I understand that the expectation is 12 months at the moment and that then we will have the complete problem to grapple with and dispose of finally. Our reorganisation should be complete in about 12 months' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>No; I could not just say quite that.  I feel that redundancy will cease to be created in approximately 12 months' time.  We will see the end of the growth of the problem, but in so far as the actual resolving of the problem is concerned, I cannot say with any certainty that it will be ended in 12 months.  The Deputy can take it that we are doing everything possible to try to keep track of this redundancy and to resolve it with all possible speed.  In regard to another suggestion by the Deputy in connection with the half day and the conditions of service of our people, I can only say that the matter is under consideration by the Departmental Conciliation Council but we cannot say at the moment what may come from these deliberations.</P>

      <P>In regard to one matter raised by Deputy McQuillan about sub-postmasters and their remuneration and conditions of employment, particularly relating to new and added duties piled on to them, this again is a matter which the consultative council is considering. I am not quite clear what the functions of all the various councils are, but one thing about which I am sure is that they all have functions and seem to be carrying them out quite well.  The council will consider any claims made on such matters and will consider the question of the handling of Prize Bonds.  This is a matter on which the sub-postmasters are to be congratulated, from all sides of the House, for the manner in which they have carried out the handling of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £287,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926), including Public Concerts.</P>
      <P>Because of the short time I have been in charge of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I cannot give any account in detail of the working of wireless broadcasting and I must content myself with giving the House the general information I have got about the service with a few brief remarks about matters of policy as I found them in the making.</P>
      <P>I am aware from the debates in the House and from my advisers that a very significant change took place in the general structure of Radio Eireann and in the control exercised over it from 1st January, 1953.  I shall say a few words later about the effect of these changes, but I wish to mention first the financial arrangements fixed in 1953 and how they relate to the Estimate as published for the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> Prior to 1953, all the money that broadcasting got, whether for capital expenditure or for programmes, was provided by the Exchequer without any direct relation to the amount recovered through the Post Office in licence fees.  From January, 1953, however, the arrangements were changed, with Government approval, and the full receipts from licence fees and sponsored programmes fees were placed at the disposal of Radio Eireann for its day to day working. Equipment was provided by subsidy and buildings continued to be reconstructed and erected by the Commissioners of Public Works without cost to broadcasting.  For convenience of reference, the whole financial arrangement was known as the &ldquo;formula&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the years immediately following 1953, the full receipts from fees were not needed for programme expenditure and the balance was surrendered to the Exchequer as had always been the case when the Vote had not been expended in full.  As plans for better programmes costing more money were made and put into execution, the annual expenditure came closer to the receipts.  Although the approved formula was not formally abolished or altered, the amount provided for the year with which we are dealing&mdash; 1957/58&mdash;is about £30,000 less than it would have been if the formula had operated in full, including the grant of a subsidy for all the equipment needed.</P>
    <P>The amount in the Estimate was, however, settled for the coming year under somewhat abnormal circumstances. Last year, the Government approved in principle of a further reorganisation of Radio Eireann which would have put a statutory board in charge and the financial structure was left to be worked out between the two Ministers principally concerned, Finance and Posts and Telegraphs.  No agreement had, however, been reached between these Ministers by the time of the dissolution of the Dáil, so that the Estimate, which had then to be prepared hurriedly, was left at the amount provided last year and this, as I have stated, is considerably less than <Col N="800" /> would have been the case had the formula operated in full.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance, in agreeing to repeat last year's figure, recognised that the reorganisation proposals would probably have to be examined again after the general election and that an opportunity would then be available to make any adjustment that appeared to be called for.  I would like to be able to get back to the formula, as, on a cursory study, I feel that broadcasting is a service which needs to plan well in advance and that its approved financial arrangements should not be disturbed without serious cause.  However, that is a matter I shall have to examine in more detail.</P>
    <P>Before I say anything about the future reorganisation contemplated, may I make a brief reference to the present organisation?  From my observations as a listener.  I am convinced that the standard of the Radio Eireann programmes has improved very considerably since the immediate control was entrusted to a Comhairle with the Director.  Whether that improvement was due to better direction, to the decision of the Minister to keep the station away as far as possible from ministerial and parliamentary intervention in details, or whether it was due to better financial provision, I cannot say.  Probably the improvement was due in part to all the three causes I have mentioned.  I pay tribute to what has been done since 1953, but I do not feel that there is any reason for complacency or for resting on oars. I am sure the service could be improved further in many respects and I am glad to say that the Comhairle and the Director agree with me fully in that.</P>
    <P>With that agreement, however, I have got from them a list of things which Radio Eireann has not got but which it should have, if it is to continue to fulfil its mission of providing programmes of entertainment, education and information of a type and standard which will hold Irish people by their distinctive national flavour and atmosphere and prevent them from being wholly absorbed in the broadcasting output of another country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> Here are some of the deficiencies from which, I am informed, Radio Eireann still suffers.  I am told that no broadcasting organisation in Europe, except Radio Eireann, is dependent for its studios on office rooms, with all their imperfections in acoustics and sound properties.  The single programme which is put out for a restricted number of hours daily cannot be heard effectively by all the people of the country, particularly by those in the outer areas, although they pay the same licence fee as the others.  At this stage in sound broadcasting development, listeners also expect to be able to tune in to a second programme of a different type from the general service. Radio Eireann has not been able to provide such a programme for financial reasons.  I understand, in fact, that Radio Eireann is given only just half the annual sum for its operations that is made available to every small broad-casting organisation on the Continent.</P>
    <P>I am quoting what I have been informed as being responsible for keeping Radio Eireann back from making the further improvements it would like to make.  I am not saying now that I either agree or disagree with the statement of deficiencies because I simply do not know enough about the service to commit myself to a definite opinion on any single issue.  I do know, of course, that a site was purchased for broadcasting headquarters just ten years ago, but the high cost prevented Governments from proceeding with the building.  The present may not be a more favourable time than during the past ten years for very expensive buildings and I do not know if anything could be done by stages.  Those responsible for producing Radio Eireann programmes would certainly like to have some relief from the existing studios, which must be regarded as little better than makeshift.</P>
    <P>Whilst on the subject of accommodation, I may say that the new studios in the Cork Municipal School of Music are now almost completed.  Installation of broadcasting equipment in a new studio centre is always a protracted business but it is expected that the studios will be ready for use within the next few months.  In the mean-time, <Col N="802" /> the members of the new programme staff for Cork are being recruited so that they can be trained and ready to contribute programmes as soon as the studios themselves are ready.  It will then be possible to initiate more programmes and more ambitious types of programme from Cork.  I hope that we shall soon see the results in an increasing element in the Radio Eireann programmes of items which reflect the distinctive character of the City and County of Cork and the Province of Munster generally.  The quality of the programmes should, of course, also show a big improvement because of the better studio facilities that will be available.</P>
    <P>One of the matters referred to in which I feel a particular interest, although I have not, of course, studied the financial implications of improving the position, is the inability of listeners in the outer fringes to receive the existing Radio Eireann programmes effectively.  I understand the remedy for this would likely be brought about by the erection of transmitters using very high frequencies or, in other words very short waves.  Instead of a single transmitter serving the whole country a number of smaller transmitters would have to be provided on high ground throughout the country and I am informed that reception from these transmitters is much clearer than from medium or long wave transmitters.</P>
    <P>The Radio Eireann engineers have been carrying out a study of the most suitable locations for VHF transmitters but the actual erection and operation would be fairly costly.  Even if transmitters could not be provided for a complete second network, I would much like to be able to improve the position for the bad reception districts. The whole matter, including the cost, will, however, have to get very detailed investigation and there are other difficulties, such as the need for listeners to get special receivers for VHF or to provide adapters for their existing sets.</P>
    <P>While the Comhairle Organisation for Radio Eireann brought about great changes for the better in broadcasting standards, particularly in the freedom <Col N="803" /> it gave to broadcasters to express their views, the last Government had, as I stated, decided on a further advance and had approved in principle of the setting up of a board by statute to control the operations of broadcasting. I understand the intention was to establish a public service type of organisation, that is, it would not be a purely private body but, on the other hand, it would be responsible to the Minister only in matters of broad policy.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government had, as I mentioned, set up in 1953 what might be termed the present halfway-house type of organisation and I have not yet had an opportunity of consulting the Government as to whether in the light of the favourable experience of the past four years they would be disposed to establish formally by statute the kind of organisation that has, in practice, been in operation during that period. I shall have to bring the matter before the Government for consideration during the year.  In the meantime, I have asked the members of the Comhairle if they would remain in office for an indefinite period and they have agreed to do so.</P>
    <P>Generally, Ministers in speaking on the Broadcasting Estimate have referred in some detail to the main programme activities during the previous year.  I do not feel it necessary or appropriate to do so for two reasons. First, I have had no official connection with the service during the past year and secondly, broadcasting activities, so far as the programmes are concerned, are as well known to every member of the House as to the Minister. Instead of giving my views on the Radio Eireann programmes.  I will content myself by asking Deputies to give me their own comments.</P>
    <P>It would help me considerably, however, if their remarks were directed to matters of policy or programme trends rather than to individual programmes. I may, however, remind you that the Radio Eireann programmes, in addition to their ordinary output of information and entertainment all the year round, have dealt as usual with the special occasions that arise during the year&mdash;<Col N="804" /> Holy Week, Easter Week, An Tóstal, Christmas Week, and so on, with the addition this year of a General Election.</P>
    <P>In particular Radio Eireann has been able to continue its co-operation in artistic activities outside the studio, not only by the public concerts given by the Radio Eireann Symphony Orchestra both in Dublin and in other cities of Ireland, but by supplying an indispensable element of co-operation in two seasons of opera given by the Dublin Grand Opera Society, and in the season of opera provided by the Wexford Festival.  The station has also taken part in the activities of the European Broadcasting Union and the Italia prize competition and has produced and transmitted special programmes by arrangement with the Council of Europe and United Nations Radio, New York, in addition to providing facilities to many overseas broadcasting organisations gathering programme material in this country.</P>
    <P>Now I want to say a word about television.  More and more television aerials are going up, in Dublin and other parts of the country.  All the people in the houses under those aerials are watching purely British programmes.  It is only natural to say &ldquo;Why cannot we have a television service of our own?&rdquo; I wish we could, and I hope some day we shall.  The difficulties in the way are financial, and I do not yet know how they can be solved.  I am now studying the reports on the possibilities prepared by my Department, as well as the proposals for privately-operated, commercial television which my predecessors and I have received from time to time.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a grave decision to entrust the control of so powerful a medium as television to any private concern, working mainly for profit, and I should much prefer to see television established as a public service of some kind, probably integrated with the present sound broadcasting organisation, since in our small country they would both be fishing in the same pool. I know what a boon an Irish television service would be in the remote countryside.   But it is important not to be <Col N="805" /> misled into starting a scheme that would merely result in giving the Dublin area a poor copy of British programmes, whilst the rest of the country gained no benefit, and might even have to subsidise a service that they could not receive.</P>
    <P>And before I leave the subject I think it desirable to state, for general information, that persons who have television sets only, must possess wireless licences, otherwise they run the risk of prosecution and the confiscation of their sets just as persons in possession of sound radio sets do who fail to take out or renew their licences.  The number of persons who have television sets only is growing and it would be bad for our broadcasting finances generally if the idea gained currency among them that the law did not apply to them.</P>
    <P>I have had as yet only very few contacts with the Comhairle, Director and Broadcasting officials but I have been impressed by the willingness of all to help the Minister to grasp the intricacies of this unusual type of Civil Service Department.  I wish to thank them and the staff generally in Radio Eireann for their work in keeping going a service which has to produce programmes to a strict time schedule for 364 days in the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate, of course, that the Minister is new to the Department, that he is taking up something of which he has had no experience. Accordingly, the purpose of my remarks will be directed towards making a few observations in the nature of constructive criticism to which, I hope, the Minister will address himself.  I hope at a later stage that he will be able to tell us whether or not it will be possible to put these suggestions into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all appreciate that the Radio Eireann organisation is peculiarly situated inasmuch as it cannot please every section of the community all the time; in fact it can please every section of the community only infrequently. I think that in this country we should endeavour to promote the mentality that Radio Eireann should lead the people to taste and culture rather than it should pander to the <Col N="806" /> tastes of imported culture.  I have in mind something which I think is very beneficial to the youth of the country&mdash; the excellent way in which the Radio Eireann light orchestra and symphony orchestra travel to centres throughout the country as well as performing here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>They endeavour to provide for an audience of adults in the evening and next morning put on a special programme of very good music for school children.  It has been my privilege to be present at some of these performances for children and it is a matter of considerable satisfaction to see the effect such broadcasts have on audiences of between 1,000 and 1,500 children.  An explanatory talk by competent people is given to the children in which the different movements are explained in very simple language.  I can say that those children have benefited by these talks when I see the way in which they receive the actual performances afterwards.</P>
    <P>I wonder would it be at all possible for Radio Eireann to extend this instruction service to cover adult audiences, particularly before the orchestra puts on programmes of classical or semi-classical, or what I might call highbrow music.  To some of the school children these programmes are most enjoyable.  The same instruction could be given to parents with very little expense.</P>
    <P>I realise that at times it is difficult to provide live broadcasts.  However, we all appreciate there is an atmosphere about a live broadcast that is nearly always missing from ordinary recordings.  The success which attends the broadcasts of the Dublin Grand Opera Society's performances, the atmosphere created for the listeners in the broadcasts of sporting fixtures is, of course, lost where you have mere recorded programmes.  I think the authorities should do everything possible to make these live broadcasts available as frequently as they can.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the difficulties which listeners encounter in hearing the station in remote areas.  That is true particularly in parts of West Cork. I would draw the Minister's attention <Col N="807" /> to something which, to my mind, is of equal importance.  We are a very small country and materially very poor, but we boast, with some justification, that we have a very scattered empire all over the world and that in many ways it is a very spiritual empire.  It is a great pity that the voice of this country cannot be heard from our own station in many parts of the world.  It would be something worth while, worth achieving and making sacrifices for, if we could procure the necessary finance for such a station.</P>
    <P>Such a radio station would also serve the purpose of propagating our tourist attractions, which is a most important industry nowadays.  Proper programmes over the air could do much to publicise the attractions of our country from the tourist point of view. More particularly, it would focus attention on the main political problem that remains to us.  There are few better ways of creating an informed world opinion than through the medium of the radio.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that this is not a very suitable time to talk of something which may entail the expenditure of a good deal of public money.  At the same time, I merely ask the Minister to give this matter his sympathetic consideration, and even if he has to defer its implementation, that at least it should not be overlooked and forgotten.</P>
    <P>Not merely as a Cork City Deputy do I welcome the new studios in Cork. I think they are a matter of satisfaction for the entire country and more particularly for the province of Munster.  From what we have heard in the Minister's remarks, it seems that the conditions under which broadcasting is carried on, from the studios in the capital here in Dublin, are very primitive and not at all suitable.  Certainly the studios in Cork City are most modern and more suitable and therefore the standard of broadcasting should be much improved.</P>
    <P>There are some people in the country still who, unfortunately, on account of their age and way of life, we cannot expect to have with us for very much <Col N="808" /> longer.  It would be a great service if Radio Eireann would continue and increase their facilities for getting to those individuals and obtaining from them recordings of the knowledge which they have, because if it dies with them, we may never again have knowledge of it.  I have in mind a few people in the southern part of the country who have a store of knowledge and lore and culture in the old tradition, and, if it died with them, it would be really a national loss.  In the recent past especially, Radio Eireann has been very much alive in that sphere and I am hoping that it will continue to improve in this respect, especially now that there are new studios in Cork.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not allow himself to be completely submerged by the Minister for Finance and by financial considerations.  I hope he will realise that at the present time the radio is an essential in the lives of the people.  I wish him well in his term of office and I hope that, as he goes on, he will find his task made easier as his difficulties dissolve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the Minister prefaced his remarks by saying that he was only a short time in charge of the Department.  Consequently, I assume he is not going to accept criticism, at this stage, of his activities.  That is fair enough, but at any rate I hope that the Minister, in going into the Department, had in mind certain lines of approach, certain convictions of his own which he would like, on examination of the situation, to put into effect within the Department at a later stage.  I feel sure that, as a young man, he will brook no interference from the very conservative people he is bound to meet who are already in an established position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greater portion of the Minister's opening remarks dealt with Radio Eireann.  In connection with various programmes we had on Radio Eireann, I would like to say that there are as many opinions about those programmes as there are Deputies in Dáil Éireann. I do not propose to criticise the programmes at all at this stage, because it is a waste of time, but I think many <Col N="809" /> Deputies will support me in this plea to the Minister on the tremendous potential value which the radio can be in the matter of education.  I am referring specifically now to the value it can be to schoolchildren.  I cannot understand how so much time has elapsed without having suitable material prepared and broadcast to our national schools.  The Minister would be doing a good day's work if he would inaugurate a new era in his Department in this connection.  Consultation between himself and the Minister for Education is long overdue. Knowing the Minister as I do, I know he will not delay much longer in this regard.</P>
    <P>The main point I want to speak about here is the possibility of producing as soon as possible a television programme controlled by this State or from within this State.  In his prepared statement, the Minister made a reference to what has now become a hardy annual, the question of a television programme in Ireland.  I believe that any improvements which will take place now in Radio Eireann, namely, any deficiencies which will be made up in regard to studios, buildings and so on, should not be allowed to progress or be implemented, unless, side by side with that, provision is made for television installation and equipment.  It would be ridiculous to go ahead on a so-called advanced programme for Radio Eireann without making full provision for television broadcasts.</P>
    <P>Since I came into this House eight years ago, the question of television has arisen each year.  Each year, the demand has become stronger and more insistent than in the previous year. The argument put forward every time is that this is a poor country and could not afford television, that we must wait until it gets cheaper to operate, until we see what technical improvements take place in other countries and then apply them here. Now, what I have to say I will stand over, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I believe that a suitable television outfit for broadcasting can be brought into this country without any great <Col N="810" /> imposition, as far as the financial end of it is concerned.</P>
    <P>Even apart from that, I would be willing to support in this House legislation which would impose taxation for the purpose of introducing television. I would be willing to go into that division lobby at any time and support the Government on it, because its influence is tremendous at the present time in the world and its influence is going to bear very much on portion of this country at the present time.</P>
    <P>Can we afford television?  That is the question that the Department's advisers are posing every week of the year for themselves and for various Governments in office.  That mentality reminds me of the people who asked years ago could we afford Aer Lingus. If, 20 years ago, we were to wait for jet propulsion before Aer Lingus would be established, we would be a long way off the beam to-day.  We would not have such a highly successful State enterprise as Aer Lingus.  If we waited for the diesel engine to be invented or to be made available before constructing our railways, we would look nice at the present time as far as our transport arrangements are concerned.  If, before generating electricity to utilise our peat resources, we waited for 20 years until the advent of the atomic era, what condition would rural Ireland be in to-day?</P>
    <P>The same argument applies to television. There should be no such thing as waiting until the time comes when things get a bit cheaper and perhaps we will get it for nothing.  We will not get it cheaper in three years' time. The indications are that the burden will be progressively heavier as time goes on.  Tremendous technical advances have been made in other countries and are available to us, but it is not from a technical aspect that I propose television.  I should like to deal with it from the aspect of how we can pay for it and the type of programmes I think we should have.</P>
    <P>Deputies may say to themselves that it is extraordinary to hear Deputy McQuillan advocating expenditure on what they consider a luxury item.  I <Col N="811" /> do not believe it is a luxury.  Television is essential&mdash;perhaps even more essential than wireless.  The question of payment can be met in many ways but the most desirable means of paying for it&mdash;and I have thought this for some considerable time&mdash;is for the Minister for Finance to utilise, to the utmost of his ability, the profits made by foreign film renters and companies in this State.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that the Irish people are the greatest race of cinemagoers in the civilised world.  No other country has a greater proportion of its people attending the films so regularly. If we were serious in establishing television I would suggest that a reasonable reduction from that money would pay for television annually.  I have estimates here, from various returns, which are as accurate as they can possibly be, that in a single year Irish filmgoers spend as much on pictures as would run a first-rate television service for ten years.</P>
    <P>Ninety-nine per cent. of the films shown in all our cinemas come from either America or Britain; the 1 per cent. comes from the Continent.  I do not even include the alleged films that are made in Ireland and showing Irishmen with shamrocks stuffed in their ears.  These films portray an alien way of life.  Nobody denies the tremendous influence that the cinema has on the mind of young and old alike.  Many people suggest that one of the causes of emigration is the dissatisfaction and discontent caused amongst our young people through foreign films.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Foreign film moguls send the greatest trash into this <Col N="812" /> country and they have the controlling interest in the majority of the cinemas here.  They have a free hand.  The Minister has a glorious opportunity of diverting that picture-going public to television.  The longer we postpone television run by Irishmen, the longer the monopoly of the foreign film moguls will last here, and that is something which I think the majority of the Deputies do not wish to see continuing much longer.</P>
      <P>If we do not take the necessary steps ourselves in Dublin and the surrounding areas, our people will get the full blast of influence from British television programmes.  I do not for a moment suggest that television programmes from Britain are bad.  There are excellent programmes being beamed from the British station.  There are also programmes which I regard as undesirable, but I am not acting here in the role of censor.  What I do criticise is the fact that these television programmes beamed from Britain portray solely the British mentality and way of life.  They are not beamed to Ireland for the purpose of showing the Irish way of life, historical events, our customs, pastimes, or anything else. We have nothing in the television line to counteract the influence of British television.  I do not wish to be taken as criticising British television because what is there is highly suitable for the British public.  I am criticising it in so far as it affects Ireland.  The time is ripe for us to compete in our own State with the influence exercised by British television.  I have spoken on this matter very strongly before and I hope I do not have to keep on pressing it year after year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument is put forward that the cost of establishing television would be outrageous.  That is not true. Television could be started here with a maximum capital outlay of £100,000 and could be run on an expenditure of £60,000 to £80,000 per annum.  I do not suggest that the programmes we have here should be the expensive type of show that the Americans and the British go in for.  Some of their programmes cost a small fortune.  There is no necessity for us to try to compete with them in that respect We <Col N="813" /> could not afford to do so, but there is no reason why we could not have very good shows. The approach to television should be similar to that of Radio Eireann.  At least 50 per cent. of the Radio Eireann programmes are recorded programmes.  That is one of the reasons why the cost of running it is so economic.  Surely 50 per cent. of the television programmes could be recorded too.  We could take the cream of the British, French and American shows for reproduction here and we could exclude those programmes which come in <i>ad lib</i> under the British broad-casting and television system.</P>
    <P>We should have no trouble in providing first-class programmes on athletics and news reels of events throughout the country.  Mobile equipment would be very important in this respect.  It could travel all over the country recording events of importance or interest; it could even travel down as far as Cork.  G.A.A. matches&mdash;provided, of course, we had the permission of the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera&mdash; would be of tremendous importance from a television point of view. Athletics generally are of considerable interest to all our people, young and old, and television in relation to such events would be of considerable value. Fees could be charged to the G.A.A., to the rugby people, to the soccer association, boxing associations and so forth.  It has been established that television increases subsequent interest in events thereby ensuring a larger following in subsequent programmes.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that this cost objection should be allowed to overrule the importance and advantage of television itself.  I have spoken purely on the fringe of the more important aspects of it.  I have referred to recorded programmes, news items and sporting events.  Let there be no doubt about it, television is of vital importance from the point of view of education. I hope that the Minister, a young man, will take heed of my words of encouragement.  I had intended to deal in some detail with the question of the film industry, but if you, Sir, suggest that this is not the proper <Col N="814" /> occasion for that, I shall bow to your ruling.</P>

    <P>It was a very wise decision on the part of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;I think it was Deputy Childers at the time&mdash;to hand over Radio Eireann to a Director under a Comhairle.  The standard of the programmes has improved considerably since that decision was taken.  If I have one fault to find with Radio Eireann it is that, when they hit upon a good programme, they keep on producing it until both the producers and the audience are worn out.  Irrespective of whether that programme has a West Cork bias&mdash;as some of them have&mdash;now and again it would be no harm if Radio Eireann retired some of these programmes for resuscitation at a later date.  These programmes provide us with a certain novelty at first in the West of Ireland but, with the passage of time, the novelty wears off and we get rather browned off.</P>
    <P>I commend Radio Eireann for the excellence of their plays, both in Irish and in English.  They are now a feature of Ireland's Sunday night and very much appreciated by the rural community.  I would add my voice to that of Deputy McQuillan with regard to the children's programme.  There is a certain time set aside in the primary schools during which the teacher is free to pick a subject.  It would be a good idea if the radio authorities would select half an hour or an hour during the schoolday in order to beam a special programme to the children. There is, as I have said, a children's programme at the moment.  I wonder how many children listen to it.  It may be an excellent programme and I have heard some people praise it.  There is one thing I do know: the children do not listen to it and, anyone who has had any experience of children, will tell you that their sole interest to-day as far as wireless is concerned is listening in to Radio Luxembourg and to Dan Dare, the Pilot of the Future.</P>
    <P>Some of the sponsored programmes <Col N="816" /> are very good, but I think that most of us resent the stupid pitter-patter that accompanies them.  Oftentimes, when I hear some of this and some of the very amateurish compères on the sponsored programmes, I make a mental vow&mdash;I do not think I keep it&mdash;not to support the products those sponsors advertise or purport to advertise.</P>
    <P>Whether or not we approve of Radio Eireann, we would all like to be able to listen to it.  I come from one of the outer fringes referred to by the Minister in his opening speech.  We can hear Radio Eireann in the West of Ireland, but I think the Minister should address himself to one problem. He should make it obligatory on all manufacturers of electrical appliances to have a suppressor installed on the appliances.  That, I believe, is obligatory in England and other countries on the Continent.  If you were living in a town where there are a large number of domestic appliances, such as refrigerators, washing machines and the rest, in neighbouring houses all about you and you tried to tune in on the day of a big match, whether it be the rugby match referred to by Deputy McQuillan or a big race, it is rather maddening to have to go out the country, if you are able, and ask some rural neighbour who has not benefited from rural electrification to allow you the use of his battery set.  I would strongly advise the Minister, if he has power to do so, to introduce legislation making it obligatory upon all the manufacturers of electrical appliances in this country to make the suppressor a standard part of their manufactured goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the last speaker in relation to what we can call the interference experienced particularly in the southern parts of the country where complaints are numerous in this respect.  Lack of suppressors on industrial equipment is the difficulty.  I know that during the period of office of the Minister's predecessor the matter was attended to and remedied when we reported these matters from the various districts. This problem must be tackled.  It is very annoying and unsatisfactory for people, particularly when they want <Col N="817" /> to hear some programme in which they are interested, to find that it is almost impossible to hear it.  All of these people are shareholders in the radio service because each and every one of them must pay a licence fee before they can avail of the service.  When the Minister has had an opportunity of examining the problem, he should investigate more fully the need for suppressors.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan concentrated upon television.  I am more interested at the present moment in improving the standard of our ordinary radio system than in providing the necessary finances, even at this stage, for the provision of television.  It is most important that we should try to improve the system already in operation. I think it is my duty to pay a special tribute to our announcers who have proved themselves to be excellent from the point of view of publicity.  We hear a lot about the advantages of tourism and the necessity for tourist boards at present, but our announcers in general are not only a credit to themselves but to this country of ours.</P>
      <P>A special tribute must be paid to all in charge of our hospitals programme which is broadcast every week.  The only complaint I have is that we do not hear it often enough.  I believe that arrangements could be made to provide an additional hour during the week for the hospitals programme, because in every part of the country, in hospitals or at home where there may be sick people, the hospitals programme is eagerly looked forward to. That is a tribute to all concerned with this programme.</P>
      <P>With relation to the overall programmes, I am not so sure that I agree with the last speaker about the wonderful improvements since 1951 or 1952.  It is true that there have been improvements.  The Minister has been in charge of the Department for only a short period, but I hope that during the next 12 months, he will be in a position to put into operation some of the improvements we all wish for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the information that I pick up <Col N="818" /> from time to time as a Deputy and as an ordinary citizen, I am afraid that there is a lot of cornering in the radio service.  For instance, at times when a certain programme goes off the air&mdash;it may not be a great success&mdash;we find that within a week or two, there is a new programme with the same persons in it.  I will be very charitable to them. I do not want to pass any remarks but there is a little too much of this.  I am making it clear that there are certain persons appearing from one end of the year to the other in Radio Eireann on any type of programme they wish to be on.</P>
    <P>In the period of office of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1951-1954 and during the period of office of the inter-Party Government in 1954-1957, there were many people clamouring for what I term the independence of Radio Eireann&mdash;the setting up of an organisation like the B.B.C.  Let me say now what I said during the 1951-1954 period to a colleague of mine who was a Minister in an inter-Party Government. I am completely opposed, and will remain completely opposed, to any suggestion of an independent corporation for Radio Eireann.  Let us examine the position as regards some other independent bodies.  I know that I must keep within the ambit of the Estimate, and I will mention the names of only some of these bodies, Bord na Móna or the Land Commission.  We know where the ordinary members of this House are placed when they ask the Minister a question in relation to any of these bodies.  He will be told by the Minister to address his remarks to the chairman or secretary of the bodies concerned, as the Minister has nothing to do with the day to day duties of the bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>Is that state of affairs to continue? Are some members suggesting that we now hand over to Radio Eireann the same power?  I do not claim the Minister said that to-day, but in case this suggestion should again be resurrected, I want to make it clear to the members of this House who speak so loudly about the importance of democracy that the setting up of an independent corporation will automatically <Col N="819" /> mean taking from the representatives of the people the power that should be theirs.  That is one important feature, I consider, in relation to broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Again, let us be very fair.  We realise that Radio Eireann, or an independent corporation, would probably keep on an even keel, as it were, in relation to the overall outlook of the people of this country but who can prove that in the years to come the type of so-called advanced independent thought that can be found now in certain institutions in Dublin may not seep into the policy and the programmes of Radio Eireann? This organisation is the property of the State.  It is administered by people under the responsibility of a Minister of State.  I believe it is vitally essential that under no circumstances should our broadcasting system&mdash; despite its faults or limitations&mdash;be handed over to any independent body.</P>
    <P>The other few points which I wish to make concern the overall policy of broadcasting itself and the types of programmes presented.  A few months ago, there was a programme on Monday nights between 11.15 and 11.30. I am referring now to a time when the present Minister was not in office and, naturally, he cannot be held answerable for this and there is no question of complaint about him for it.  In my opinion, that programme was as good a programme as was ever broadcast from Radio Eireann.  I cannot remember the title of the programme now but it was in relation to old songs, and so forth.  The broadcaster certainly knew his job well.  Why was it that such an important programme was shoved back to a time as late as 11.15 p.m.?  There are many old people in this country who would be delighted to hear a programme such as that, to hear again some of the songs which were popular in the days of their youth and which would remind them of pleasant days gone by.  Why is it that such old people would either be denied the advantage of hearing the programme at all or else of having to wait up until a late hour in order to hear it?  It all goes back to the point I <Col N="820" /> made at the outset, namely, the problem of personnel and the arrangement of some programmes on our broadcasting system.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in having to listen to complaints now when he has not had a full opportunity, probably, of attending to all the various problems which have been put before him in his Department.  The radio programmes, such as they are, are improving: let us give credit where credit is due.  It is essential that they remain under the same control as they are under at present.  We know the difficulties which will face us if there should be a change.  I except that the Minister will examine the question why it is that, even with a change of programme, there is not a change of personnel.  It is more important to concentrate on providing the best programmes possible rather than to embark on something that some people only may wish for.  It is all very fine to wish, for instance, for a television service but the people in rural Ireland would be quite satisfied if the present broadcasting system could not alone be continued in operation but even improved.</P>
    <P>It would be of considerable benefit to the people in the south and south-western areas if the Minister would give his attention to the problem of interference.  These people are share-holders in the broadcasting service because of the money they spend on the wireless licence.  When the Minister returns to this House in 12 months' time we shall be able to give him credit for those matters to which he has attended and for his activities in his Department or we shall be entitled to criticise him for neglecting to take action in matters which, in our view, require his attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us must necessarily be rather diffident in speaking on this vote annually because we are well aware that, no matter what programme is presented on the radio, it will please some and not please others.  Some of us would like more traditional music, others more ragtime and others still would like more highbrow programmes, <Col N="821" /> as one Deputy said.  There may even now be fans for Rock 'n Roll.</P>
      <P>On the whole, I think we can look back on the year as a pretty successful one from a broadcasting point of view and, by and large, they gave everybody something to his taste.  I do not think we are likely to effect much change by advocating any particular type of programme, but I am rather inclined to agree with the last speaker that we sometimes get tired of the same personnel appearing in different programmes time out of number, however good or efficient they may be as broadcasters and no matter how suitable their talents may be for broadcasting.</P>
      <P>Those of us who come from the provinces feel that the rates being paid to artists are not sufficient to warrant more talent from the provinces on our broadcasting programmes.  There have been complaints that if good singers, for instance, travel to Dublin to make a broadcast they find that it takes only a matter of minutes to have the programme recorded in the studio and that the fee received would not compensate them for the cost of travelling to Dublin and hotel and other expenses.  Consequently, we must expect a preponderance of Dublin artists in all the programmes.  Many people who, in the ordinary way, might like to come forward to broadcast and many people who are widely accepted as very fine artists and whom it would be very desirable to have on our radio programmes will not seek either the time or the opportunity to be included. Of course, now that new studios have been opened in Cork, we may expect a Cork bias occasionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>You mean a greater Cork bias.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not permit too much of a Cork bias, however much we may like the Cork accent.  I hope the Minister will examine the possibility of providing, even by means of the mobile recording unit or the tape recording system, suitable opportunities for provincial artists.  I have in mind, in particular, traditional musicians, violinists, vocalists, and others, who would not ordinary have the opportunity of coming <Col N="822" /> to Dublin to broadcast, so that our listening public would have the privilege of hearing them.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Desmond that we should forget about television and proceed, instead, to improve our radio programmes.  Unless we make some provision for a television service, we shall find ourselves high and dry. More and more television aerials are to be seen in this country, which testify to the growing number of people who purchase sets here.  There are very few television programmes with an Irish slant.  Occasionally a piece of news of topical interest is given or there may be a flash of an international match which is of interest.  Otherwise, the programmes presented are entirely foreign.  Our people are going in for them.</P>
      <P>We cannot adopt the attitude that we will ignore the trend towards television and carry on without it.  We shall have to have it at some future date no matter how the funds are to be found.  The Minister said he did not entirely approve of handing over such an important public service to private enterprise.  I would ask him to examine the possibility more carefully of finding some private enterprise which might undertake a television service here.  It would lift a great responsibility from the shoulders of the State if the service were put in the charge of a proper institution which we could be sure would give our people the service they desire with, perhaps, the Minister having the right of veto over the programmes intended to be presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan suggested taking money from the cinemas here.  He did not explain how exactly he would find the money in that direction, whether by taxing that form of entertainment further, or by the exclusion of these films, thus making the money available for T.V.  I did not understand how he proposed to do that, but I do not think the thousands of people, especially middle-class and poorer people, who go to see a good film frequently, particularly in winter-time&mdash;it is the cheapest form of entertainment, offering comfortable seats on a cold night&mdash;would think that a £100 television set would <Col N="823" /> be a proper substitute for these cinema shows.  I do not think that suggestion would win favour generally or meet the wishes of the people, but I think the Minister should examine the possibility of finding private enterprise which will take the necessary interest in sponsoring T.V.  It has to be done somehow; otherwise, we will find ourselves in the position that we will have T.V. viewers rather than Radio Eireann listeners. Then we shall have to be content with allowing the people to see foreign programmes since we have nothing to provide for their tastes at home.</P>
    <P>There is not much more one might say at this stage.  The Minister has paid fitting tribute to the efforts of his predecessor in so far as he said that the past year was one which was generally satisfactory.  Sponsored programmes, however they may be criticised, are creating a great interest among the listening public and are particularly useful for the people who are destined to remain in the house &mdash;housewives and housekeepers&mdash;and those who are confined through ill-health to their homes.  They enjoy sponsored programmes which, during the greater part of the day, are the only programmes they have.  Many people even make an effort to be home at the appropriate time to hear the latest episode in &ldquo;The Kennedys of Castleross&rdquo;.  Others are more interested in the Cork cheese-making programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this a sponsored programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but with one or the other, sponsored programmes are generally satisfactory, and if the tastes of the people are not being catered for in the programmes presented by Radio Eireann, those who are sponsoring these programmes are giving sufficient variety to meet the tastes of everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The request programme is probably taken&mdash;it is in England, anyhow&mdash;as the best means of ascertaining what the public want and I am afraid that if we take the consensus of opinion as shown by the requests sent in from <Col N="824" /> listeners here, we would be driven to only one conclusion.  The number of requests for national or traditional music is very small and would not indicate that there is any general demand for it.  Other people content themselves by saying the requests are sent in by only a certain section of the people and that those with any serious interest in music do not, as a rule, make requests at all.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the true position, but I understand that in England and other countries the request programme is taken as a true indication of what the public want, either as radio listeners or T.V. viewers.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will have a pretty difficult time ahead if he has to make a decision with regard to T.V. It is one of the big problems likely to confront him in his term of office and I have no doubt he will find a way out. I will stress what I said at the beginning; incurring the huge expenditure necessary to finance T.V. here would hardly be a wise undertaking in present circumstances.  I doubt if it would meet the public approval, but I believe that it is possible to have T.V. initiated here by private enterprise, and however inadvisable some people may think it is&mdash;and the Minister voiced his doubts in that respect in his opening speech&mdash;I think it is well worth examining, as it would relieve the taxpayers of the burden which inevitably will have to be borne, as we must have T.V. sooner or later in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have heard so many views expressed here to-day which coincide with my own views in relation to many matters&mdash;some of them of great importance and others not so important.  Generally speaking, I do not take issue very much with any of the things said by the various speakers on either side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Healy, the first speaker, had something to say in regard to the lack of coverage that our present transmitting service occasions throughout the country.  He mentioned West Cork, <Col N="825" /> as a good Corkman should, and there are also Kerry, Wexford and Donegal and parts of other counties, little pockets here and there, where the service is anything but good and, in fact, where sometimes there is no service at all.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a number of matters which I have been considering since I came into office.  It seems to me there are three very important things that have to be done, if possible.  The Irst, I think, is that we must try to improve, as Deputy Desmond said, our present sound broadcasting system for the people at home, as a first step in the right direction.  That will entail considerable cost and the question arises, even if we have the money, as to how we are to improve the coverage, whether by V.H.F. or by increased volume or output from the present station on its existing wavelength. That will again raise some further difficulties which can be dealt with only by our experts and technicians, if and when the time comes when the money is available to enable a decision to be made one way or the other.</P>
    <P>The question of trying to utilise sound broadcasting to get across to our people abroad and indeed to the people of other lands was also mentioned.  Candidly, I have not got as far as thinking along the lines of giving what I think only a short-wave station could give.  That matter was examined already, but it never really went ahead, although much progress was made.  I doubt if, at the moment, there is much we can do to get worldwide coverage, as it were, from an Irish station.</P>
    <P>One thing that should be done, if it is possible&mdash;I do not know what the position really is&mdash;is that, since we have to-day, I would say, more Irish people or people of Irish extraction in Great Britain than we have here at home it is essential that we should &ldquo;get across&rdquo; to those people through our State broadcasting system.  While it is possible to-day to get reception in some parts of Britain from our present transmitter, it is not at all a general happening.  Therefore, I have <Col N="826" /> been thinking in terms of trying to see what can be done to improve our listening service at home; secondly, trying to get our programmes to our Irish people in Great Britain; and thirdly, which will probably be the biggest, most difficult and most costly of all, trying to get around to providing a T.V. service for our own people in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Any one of those things, if it could be accomplished or even started, would be quite a step ahead for Radio Eireann.  Whether or not any one of the three can be undertaken within the next 12 months is a matter that I am not too sure about.  Undoubtedly, the big problem in regard to all three at the moment is the provision of money. I disagree with Deputy McQuillan in the figures he quoted here to-day.  If the Deputy can get me proof that a T.V. service can be provided for a figure of £100,000 and that the station can be serviced for £80,000 annually, and if the Deputy provides full proof of that for the House, not only the Minister but the House will adopt it in double quick time.  Unless that proof is forthcoming, it is wrong to hold out to the people the idea that it is just as easy as all that.  My opinion is that it is much more difficult and much more costly.  The greatest liability will be in the provision of programmes rather than the provision of the transmitting service.  The transmitting service would be an initial cost, which could be got over in due time, but the recurring annual cost of providing the programmes will give us the greatest headache financially.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an idea that commercial interests, possibly, should be given a monopoly in this matter, if we cannot provide a service ourselves. This aspect of the question has engaged the attention of every Minister since T.V. was first mooted in this country.  My predecessors, in all cases, have agreed with the line already adopted, that was, that we could not allow such an important service to be given to a commercial outside interest over which we did not have fairly stiff control.  I can see the weight of that argument and at the moment am inclined to agree with my <Col N="827" /> predecessors that we cannot give to any commercial concern the sole right of a television service over which the Government could not have any control or supervision.  It may well be that there are people who can bring forward arguments to convince myself and others who hold the view that commercial T.V. is not just the answer that such a thing is possible and that the Government need have no fear, but as of the moment I am afraid I cannot visualise that taking place.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the House, in regard to the question of T.V., that the committee set up in 1953 to go into this matter has not been idle. Various suggestions and proposals have been made to them by interested groups and even in the short time since I have gone to the Department, very elaborate proposals have been made by a group which are now being considered by the committee in conjunction with proposals already received. I have recently indicated to the committee that, having the benefit of a number of proposals from various quarters over the past three or four years and knowing the objections that have been found to all of them so far, it might be possible at this stage to draw up the specification under which we would accept a marriage of commercial interests and State interests in the provision of a T.V. service and, having drawn up that specification, we could give it as a hand-out to all outside interested parties who, in their turn, within the framework of that specification, could give us what they had to offer in the terms outlined. That may not give us a result but it is worth trying.  I know that the Television Committee are working along those lines and are as anxious as I am, and perhaps even more so, to find a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>As has been stated here, television is a &ldquo;must&rdquo; for the future in this country.  I, personally, am of that opinion.  We are in the position, particularly in County Donegal and other border counties, that television is becoming an accepted service.  At present all the programmes come from stations outside our control and all those programmes, <Col N="828" /> good though they may be from the point of view of the people sponsoring them, are flavoured in a way that is not good for the culture of the people of this land.  Deputies have indicated that we must have television in the future.  I agree that it seems that it is a &ldquo;must&rdquo;, but we cannot get away from the cost and if a proposal to provide a television service were made in this House and if it would cost the taxpayer a large sum of money, I am afraid neither I nor the Government would get away very lightly and would have few supporters if we were to put another blister on the backs of the taxpayer to provide a television service which, ordinarily, could be regarded as a luxury service.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, this matter is being examined and will be considered very thoroughly in the very near future.  In the meantime, I hope to achieve finality in regard to the other two matters of immediate interest and about which we may be able to do something in the near future, namely, the provision of a better service at home and the possibility of making it possible for our people in Great Britain to receive our programmes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carty suggested that it should be made compulsory on manufacturers to fit suppressors on electrical equipment.  Coming from a county that is rather far from Radio Eireann, I agree with the Deputy that something should be done.  His suggestion is very mild compared with what I should like to suggest at times when I am trying to get a programme in which I am interested and some electrical gadget not far away is started up without a suppressor.  However, that is not just the point.</P>
    <P>The point is, that Radio Eireann, as I understand it, has a staff which travels around the country and which will fit suppressors to these electrical appliances which may be causing trouble.  They will supply them at cost price and charge nothing for the fitting. That is a service given by the Department at the moment and a service which I would commend strongly to everyone in the country in an effort to help listeners to get the service which is now being transmitted by Radio <Col N="829" /> Eireann.  Compulsion is never a pleasant matter and would be rather difficult in this matter.  It might involve us in having to employ a greater number of inspectors and giving them the power to invade private houses in order to make sure that there was a suppressor on any electrical appliance which people might have in their houses.  I do not think that would be a nice thing to do and I think a voluntary effort would be better.  I suggest that any publicity which Deputies can give to this in their own neighbourhood should be given, so that interference can be cut down to a minimum.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I think I should, on behalf of the staff of Radio Eireann, thank Deputies for the nice things they said about them and say on their behalf that these remarks are appreciated very much.  Being in a service that cannot satisfy everybody all the time, I am sure they get many more messages of criticism than of tribute.</P>
    <P>There was also the complaint made about Radio Eireann&mdash;I think by Deputy Desmond, who must be one of those people who like to go to bed early&mdash;that a good programme was relayed after 11 p.m. on Monday nights and that that was much too late for our people.  I think that any decent programme should be kept until after 11 p.m. so that we can listen to it when we get home, if we get home at that time at all.  It is possible that my own views and those of Deputy Desmond's are widely apart, but until I hear others complaining about this, I do not think we should cease to put on a decent programme after 11 p.m.  The aim of Radio Eireann will be to try to give a decent programme at all times and those who can only hear the programmes after 11 p.m. should be entitled to that relaxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Desmond's point was that that programme was more suited for elderly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that should interfere with elderly people <Col N="830" /> either, unless they are bedridden.  In my part of the country, people do not go to bed early.  I will certainly look into the matter.  I may have misunderstood Deputy Desmond, but I do not think so.  Deputy Brennan has spoken about giving provincial artists a chance and said that under the present system of payment a provincial artist who has travelled up to the city and travelled back will not have sufficient to pay for a packet of cigarettes the next day.  I do not know if that is so, but I will have the matter looked into, and if there is anything we can do to bring the provincial artists to Radio Eireann, it will be done, if it is possible from the financial point of view.</P>
      <P>I should also refer to another matter which was mentioned in regard to the question of hearing the same person on several different programmes. When a programme concludes and goes off the air, the next night one hears the person who was on the previous programme on the air again under a new guise.  That is noticeable and it is something which I have noticed myself for some considerable time.  It has been remarked upon to me even in the past few weeks since I became Minister.  There is one argument that officially seems to be very sound, that is, that good artists are not just so plentiful that there are sufficient of them at the disposal of Radio Eireann to go around the various programmes on the different nights at the different seasons of the year.  That may be the real reason for this, but candidly I put a question mark after that explanation myself and it is a matter about which I want to try to get some further information.  If the Deputy who raised the matter wants to know more about it, I am sure he will avail of his privileges to obtain the information.</P>

If they have any suggestions of a nature that would commend them to a common-sense approach to television, V.H.F. or an improvement of our transmission service as we now know it on the medium wave band, I shall be delighted to have them gone into by our experts in the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,114,220 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for the Defence Forces (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Act, 1954 (No. 18 of 1954) and for certain administrative Expenses in connection therewith, for certain Expenses under the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-Raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 (No. 21 of 1939 and No. 28 of 1946); for Expenses in connection with the issue of medals, etc.; for Expenses of the Bureau of Military History; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 32 of 1938).</P>
      <P>The gross Estimate for Defence for 1957/58 is £6,397,416 and after deducting Appropriations-in-Aid the net Estimate is £6,171,220.  A broad analysis of the figures shows that, of the gross Estimate, 60 per cent. is for the pay, allowances and maintenance of the personnel of the Permanent Defence Force; 7 per cent. for the Reserve Defence Force; 16 per cent. for civilian staffs and employees and 17 per cent. for stores, equipment, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substantial reduction of £862,230 on the net Estimate for 1956/57 is the result of a very determined effort to <Col N="832" /> achieve the maximum saving in every service and activity covered by this Estimate.  It is necessary in present circumstances to have the utmost economy compatible with the maintenance of the efficiency of the Defence Forces.  Substantial cuts were made in the Estimate before I came into office as Minister and I have not yet fully assessed the effects of these cuts but it is the intention to work for the year within the framework of the estimates.</P>
    <P>In the main, the reductions affect the sub-heads catering for stores and equipment. There are also appreciable reductions in the provisions for the pay, rations and clothing of the Permanent Defence Force and for the pay of civilians attached to units.  As in previous years, the Estimate in respect of the personnel of the Permanent Defence Force is framed on the basis of the full peace establishment, that is, 1,330 officers and 11,835 other ranks.  Deductions are made in the relevant sub-heads in respect of the numbers by which the actual strength for the year is likely to be below the establishment; the net provisions cater for an average strength of 1,216 officers and 7,250 other ranks.  Provision is made for a total of, approximately, 1,625 civilians including 987 attached to the Corps of Engineers.</P>
    <P>A number of sub-heads show increases, all relatively small except in the case of sub-head Y (2)&mdash;Reserve Defence Force.  The increase of £27,000 here is attributable entirely to the expansion of the F.C.A.  I am sure Deputies will be glad to hear that this fine force is devoting a greater amount of time to training and is showing itself increasingly proficient and self-reliant.  Great credit is due to these young men for devoting their spare time to training and to the Army for the manner in which it has built up and trained the F.C.A. to a point where it is now a significant part of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Although the amount provided under sub-head P (1)&mdash;Civil Defence&mdash;is some £12,600 less than the corresponding provision for 1956/57, there will, as a result of the recruiting campaign for civil defence initiated by my predecessor <Col N="833" /> last February, be much more activity in this phase of our national defence than has hitherto been possible.</P>
    <P>The object of the recruiting campaign is to build up in our cities and towns a body of men and women who are prepared to give voluntary service in local civil defence organisations. This involves the completion of an initial basic course which includes a series of lectures on nuclear weapons and their effects, and later undergoing training appropriate to the particular civil defence functional group in which the individual elects to serve&mdash;for example, in the warden, rescue, welfare or casualty sections.</P>
    <P>The development of local civil defence organisation is, under the Air Raid Precautions Acts, 1939 to 1946, a statutory function of the local authorities.  The preliminary reports about the recruiting campaign received in my Department show that the response has been encouraging, and I take this opportunity of congratulating and thanking the local authorities and their officials including those who, as qualified civil defence instructors, are now imparting to their classes what they themselves have learned at the Civil Defence School. I also thank all who have volunteered for their realisation of the necessity for civil defence in the light of present world conditions and their appreciation of what their efforts may mean to their own cities and towns and to the nation as a whole.  I hope that their public spirit may induce many others to follow their example.</P>
    <P>The amount provided in the sub-head is related to the limited objectives we have set before us for the present financial year.  The item of £23,457 for grants to local authorities includes provision for a contribution in respect of the uniforms which it is proposed to issue to civil defence volunteers when they complete their initial training and have shown that they intend to remain in the organisation.  The item of £20,325 for equipment and stores includes provision for the purchase of radiation instruments and for the construction of rescue training sets.</P>
    <P>The instruments are necessary for <Col N="834" /> training volunteers in the technique of locating and measuring radioactive fall-out&mdash;that new danger that arises so acutely from the use of nuclear weapons.  The rescue training sets are designed to enable volunteers to be trained locally in rescue methods.  The sets consist of simulated damaged buildings and so on, and a number of them are being erected at convenient centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I may mention that 33 specially designed rescue vehicles are being issued to local authorities for training purposes; in fact, a number of them have already been issued.  They are equipped with the tools and appliances necessary for rescue work and are capable of being used, if necessary, for operational purposes, including relief or assistance in the event of such national disasters as storms and floods.</P>
    <P>While, as I say, the civil defence estimate for this year is of limited scope, I wish to assure the House that, in the light of the most up-to-date information available, an extensive study is continuously being made of the problems that could arise for this country in the event of a nuclear war. Developments of the last three years &mdash;particularly the production of the megaton hydrogen bomb with its vastly increased destructive power and its resultant radioactive fall-out capable of affecting areas hundreds of miles from where the bomb falls&mdash;have been so fast that civil defence plans tend to become obsolete before they are fully developed.  Constant revision is, therefore, necessary and such a process is taking place here.</P>
    <P>I am sure we all agree that this country must make every effort within its resources to cope with the effects of war in this nuclear age and to keep itself as well informed as possible of the ever-increasing developments in the weapons of war and the mode of their delivery.  It will take us a long time to reach a stage of preparedness comparable with that which exists in other countries, including small countries such as our own.  Techniques may change, and the work that is now being done in the training of volunteers is only a small instalment of what will ultimately be necessary. <Col N="835" /> Certainly, however, a body of men and women properly trained in the basic techniques will fit into any civil defence plan and will be absolutely essential to the success of any such plan.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt at some length on the subject of civil defence because it is a matter which vitally affects every man, woman and child in the country and because I want to emphasise how necessary it is that the present recruiting campaign should lead to the early establishment of an efficient, well trained organisation.  We all hope and pray that the dread possibilities we are trying to guard against may never happen here or elsewhere, but it would be wrong to ignore the portents.</P>
    <P>As usual, the Estimate provides for the payment of a grant-in-aid of the Irish Red Cross Society.  There is little change in the amount this year notwithstanding the fact that the Society has, since November last, been catering for the Hungarian refugees at Knockalisheen Camp.  That this could be done without calling on public funds is due to the magnificent response of the public to the Society's appeal for subscriptions.  The Society's work on behalf of the refugees and the assistance rendered in that connection by the Army are deserving of the highest praise.</P>
    <P>The provision in sub-head Y(4) for the Bureau of Military History has been made on the basis that the bureau will be wound up on 31st December next.  It has now been operating for over ten years and it is hoped that the important task entrusted to it will have been completed by the end of the year.  I am glad to say that it has met with wonderful co-operation from every quarter and its archives contain a great amount of material which will be invaluable to future historians of the campaign for national independence.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to thank all those who contributed statements or historical documents to the bureau.  At the same time I would appeal most earnestly to those who have not yet fully responded to the bureau's invitations, to do so without <Col N="836" /> delay.  They owe it to the future generations to put on record, in a factual manner, the part they and their comrades played in the struggle for freedom.  It would be regrettable indeed if through any oversight or avoidable omission there were gaps in the record.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that, for the limited opportunities I have had since I took office of making myself acquainted with the Defence Forces, I am impressed by their high standard of discipline and training and by their morale and devotion to duty.</P>
    <P>If Deputies should require any additional information about any aspect of this Estimate, I shall be happy to supply it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on the Minister's speech.  It is practically what I would have said had I been in the Minister's position.  The Estimate is more or less as it was prepared by the Department while I was Minister.</P>
      <P>I am glad to learn that the recruiting for the Civil Defence Force has been successful and that the people of the country have taken to heart the appeal made to them some time ago and now being made by the present Minister. It is important that provision should be made by the people themselves for their protection which might, God forbid, be necessary in case anything happened.  We all hope and pray the necessity will never arise, but it is important that we should be prepared, in so far as our resources permit us.</P>
      <P>I agree with the view expressed by the Minister that every day brings new problems and that plans of yesteryear are to-day obsolete.  I think everybody will agree that I was wise, during my term of office, in not moving too quickly with these plans.  If I had, considerable expense would have been involved for which we would have got no reasonable recompense.  As we are now in a position to assess our requirements more accurately, the best possible value will be forthcoming for any money we expend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister pay tribute to the discipline, morale and good bearing of the Army&mdash;the permanent forces, the reserves and the <Col N="837" /> F.C.A. I am proud of the fact that the F.C.A. have grown to be such an integral part of our Defence Forces.  It is something of which we can all be proud that in this country we have men who are prepared to serve voluntarily in the country's defence.  It is something of which this House can be proud that so many people are prepared to render voluntary service and to give so much of their time in the Defence Forces and in the F.C.A.  We are grateful to them and I want to pay a special tribute to them for their loyalty and devotion to duty during my term of office.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Red Cross.  They, too, deserve a special word of tribute.  They have a difficult job and a difficult role to fulfil.  Some of our people expect a lot from them but are prepared to give very little by way of voluntary help.  There is no doubt that many people subscribe generously to the Red Cross, but what that body requires more than anything else is active members.  I should like to add my voice to that of the Society in asking the community not only to assist the Red Cross financially but also to become active members.</P>
    <P>The Red Cross Society have a very important task to fulfil.  As Deputies will remember, most of the conventions relating to the Red Cross have been ratified by the House.  One or two still remain and I hope the Minister will give his attention to this matter at an early date.  It is important that the Red Cross in his country should be established on a proper basis, that the Society here should have full participation in the International Red Cross, that they should subscribe to all its obligations and benefit by its facilities. There are technical difficulties in the way of ratification of the outstanding conventions, but I hope these will be overcome as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not want to lecture the Minister or the Government, but I must say I am a little perturbed over certain matters that have happened in the Army.  I would point out to the Minister that the seniority list is not a mere plaything; it is something that is of <Col N="838" /> importance and, while I do not intend to make any comment upon recent decisions&mdash;I do not know what the Minister's reasons for them were&mdash;I do want to say that if the Minister is to mainain the morale, discipline and high standing of the Army, the regulations relating to the seniority list should be kept in mind, no matter what his personal views may be, because if he does not keep them in mind he may upset something that is of very great importance.  The Minister knows very well what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>The Army is something of which we can all be proud.  I want to repeat what I have said here many times: it is the Army of the people of Ireland and, for people who want to serve Ireland under arms, it is the only organisation in which they can properly, legitimately and patriotically do so.  I therefore commend the Army to the Irish people and trust that circumstances will arise in the near future through which better conditions may obtain in the Army.  Very substantial reductions have been made on defence since 1954.  I do not take great pride in that.  It is important to remember that the reductions have been very substantial and I want Deputies to realise that instead of further reductions being looked for, in future there is bound to be a trend in the direction of increased expenditure. I want to say to the Minister that I, and the Party for which I speak, will give him every assistance in making the Army more effective, if that is possible. I feel sure that the House will always give the necessary approval for any measure aimed at that end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point in the Estimate with which I should like to deal is that which relates to the naval service.  In this country the taxpayer and the public generally each year pay substantial sums towards the maintenance of an Irish naval service.  The very first day I came into this House I criticised that service, describing it as a toy navy.  In case anybody might think that mine was a voice in the wilderness I want to point out that the late Deputy Dr. O'Higgins reiterated my description of the naval service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> Over the years opinion in this country has come to regard the naval service with tolerant approval.  The people of Ireland are prone to read wild west novels and live in a kind of dreamland in so far as defence forces are concerned.  Naval forces are nowadays a luxury.  I suppose that in these days we are entitled to a little luxury, but when a luxury is utilised for the purposes to which this naval force was recently put, I think the time has come when we should examine whether or not we should dispense with that luxury.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach here in the last few days, in reply to a parliamentary question, pointed out to me that the Constitution of Ireland, which was acclaimed in 1937, repudiated any agreement or confirmation of agreements which took place in this country in 1925.  The reply of the Taoiseach would indicate that, according to the Constitution, the 1925 Boundary Confirmation Agreement has no longer any bearing, has no longer any standing and was completely and utterly repudiated by the terms of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We all know that one of the matters under discussion in 1925 was the question of fisheries under the Treaty of 1921 which was imposed on Irishmen. One of the safeguards for the fishermen of all Ireland lay in that Treaty. The 1925 Boundary Agreement, in so far as the fishing industry is concerned, cut off the fishermen in the Six-County area from this portion of Ireland. When the statement was made by the Taoiseach, or the Parliamentary Secretary on behalf of the Taoiseach that the Constitution which is now in operation here repudiated that agreement of 1925, I felt there was hope that the fishing people in the Six Counties would be looked upon as Irishmen within the meaning of the term &ldquo;Irishman&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the next day, the day after the Parliamentary Secretary pronounced here on the Constitution and how it repudiated the 1925 Boundary Agreement, we find a fisherman from the occupied part of Ireland dragged into an Irish court and fined for fishing within our territorial limits.</P>

I think it ill behoves this House or any Government to talk about ending Partition, to talk about Partition before the United Nations, if we decide here that an Irishman is an alien inside his own territorial waters &mdash;and that in spite of this Constitution of 1937, which is alleged to repudiate any agreement or betrayal of the Irish people in 1925.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to ensure that this is the first and last time such an action will be taken by the Navy we have under his charge.</P>
      <P>In connection with the Estimate as a whole, I have here on the Order Paper a motion in which it is requested that a Committee of this House be set up to go into the entire Defence expenditure. In view of the fact that the Tánaiste has given a promise that Private Members' time will be permitted, if at all possible, before the end of this session, I do not think it would be fair to have a dual discussion on this question.  I hope the Minister will see fit to give sympathetic consideration to this motion when it comes up.</P>
      <P>Perhaps at this stage I might mention a few matters which he could think over in connection with the problem facing us at the present time. We have at the moment in every country an effort being made, a serious effort, to cut to the bone expenditure on conventional defence.  Recently a White Paper was published in Britain on this matter.  I do not know whether our Department of Defence or our Minister for Defence keeps abreast of events in other countries.  The evidence that is available in the Estimates would not incline me to the belief that the Minister and his advisers are doing so, because the Estimate is far too high in present circumstances and in the light of decisions taken by other countries in connection with defence with conventional weapons and conventional armies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every other country&mdash;outside the Iron Curtain, of course; I do not know anything about that&mdash;America, Britain, France, etc., are all endeavouring to reduce the size of their standing armies.  What is the case here?  Anybody <Col N="843" /> reading the Estimate for Defence would be of the opinion, at a first glance, that some effort at a saving was being made with regard to the number of personnel recruited into the Army.  We have, on the face of it, a decrease in the overall Estimate, but this, to my mind, is a subterfuge. There is really no reduction in the regular personnel of the Army and no reduction in the number of civil servants attached to the Army.  There is, I agree, a slight reduction in the number of civilians attached to the Army posts.</P>
    <P>The Minister may suggest to me&mdash; and his predecessor would probably agree with him&mdash;that there is a reduction in clothing and equipment this year.  The Estimate says there is a reduction of £178,000.  It must be borne in mind, however, that this will have to be made up for next year.  It is an attempt to cut down in order to present the smallest possible Estimate to the House.  We are expending the very same amount on a recruiting campaign this year to attract the very same number of men into the Army. No decision has been taken this year to reduce the intake into the Forces. Therefore, on that basis, there is no real reduction so far as clothing and equipment are concerned, and the Estimate will have to go up next year.</P>
    <P>A decision was taken at the end of the emergency by those people making the future defence plans of the State that we would aim at a regular Army of 12,500 men.  Every possible effort was made by various Governments to reach this target, and in spite of energetic recruiting drives the target was never reached.  Now we have around 7,000 to 8,000 soldiers and a full strength complement of officers.  That position has obtained practically every year since the end of the emergency, that we are down the field in privates and at full strength as far as the officer personnel is concerned.</P>
    <P>I need not suggest to Deputies who know Army life how demoralising that situation is upon the officer and N.C.O. elements.  No officer can be really <Col N="844" /> trained and efficient unless he has practical experience of handling and controlling troops, and for our officers to-day and over the last ten years there are not enough troops to go around.  Not alone that, but there are not enough to give officers and N.C.O.s a chance to get used to handling men.  This year, in spite of the fact that we have a limited number of privates, we have decided actually to increase the strength of the officer personnel. That may sound rather contrary to Deputies, but we have now to cater for 57 extra officers on top of the number last year.</P>
    <P>That is not a reasonable way to prune expenses.  There is no necessity at the present time for increasing the strength of the officer personnel.  At the moment the number of officers available is so great that we have a major-general filling a colonel's post. In addition to that, we have 32 captains filling posts normally the preserve of first and second lieutenants. We were not content with that, but we had to create two lieutenant-colonels, eight commandants, 15 captains and 32 lieutenants.  The total cost this year for these 57 individuals is another £30,000 to the State and there are no privates for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement pointed out that 60 per cent. of the Estimate went to pay personnel of the Army and, I think he said, 15 per cent. went to pay the civilians attached to the Army.  I would like to give the House the particulars from another point of view and you will find, on checking up, that they are just as accurate as the Minister's.  The Estimate this year for Defence is £6,171,000 odd.  Before we pay a soldier, before we clothe or train him, we pay out to civil servants and civilians the sum of £939,458; that is to say, almost one-sixth of the total expenditure on Defence goes to civilians and civil servants.  To bring it down to details, there are 1,625 civilians attached to the Army and their pay roll is £650,993; there are 522 civil servants, costing £288,455.</P>
    <P>I want to make certain points here for the Minister's benefit and I come now to a matter which should be of <Col N="845" /> interest to him, namely a comparison of the officer and N.C.O. strength with that of the privates, and the pay attaching in each case.  We have in the Army 1,330 officers; included in that figure are Army officers proper, veterinary, medical, legal and naval officers.  Their total pay is £1,080,000. Between officers and N.C.O.s we have a total of 4,919 individuals.  Their total pay is £1,986,000; we have 8,246 soldiers and sailors.  Their pay is £1,288,000; so that officers and N.C.O.s have between them £698,000 over and above the pay of privates and soldiers. That, to my mind, is an extraordinary situation.</P>
    <P>No matter from what angle one looks at it, it is obvious that the Defence Forces are the preserve of certain elements to-day.  Surely, when the pay of commissioned and non-commissioned ranks exceeds the pay of privates and soldiers by over £690,000, there is something that calls for investigation and for a new approach to this whole matter.  We have the position to-day, between officers and N.C.O.s, of having an officer to every 1.6 men.  Those figures show clearly that there are just not enough privates to go around, not enough even to polish the officers' boots or to take early morning tea and toast up to the married officers.  If this state of affairs is allowed to continue, it will be a serious matter for the officer personnel.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given do not represent the full pay of officer personnel, in case anyone here is naïve enough to think it does.  There is another little item in relation to the pay of officers tucked into another Estimate.  I think it is time we took it out of that other Estimate and put it back where it belongs.  It should certainly be included for discussion here because we are discussing officers' allowances.  We have to cater for a few retired officers.  We have a general, two lieutenant-generals, four major-generals, 17 colonels, 35 lieutenant-colonels, 119 commandants to cater for for pension purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will save me mentioning it on the next Estimate.  I will not deal any further with that aspect of the amount of money we pay in allowances and pensions.  I will go back to some of the so-called reductions and the way in which they are achieved.  Under sub-head A, there is an alleged reduction.  There is a decrease in the pay of officers, cadets, N.C.O.s and privates of £93,000. Where did the reduction take place? Was it in the officer personnel, the cadet personnel or the privates?  I have already pointed out that the number of officers was increased and, as a result of that, the pay of the officer personnel has gone up by £15,322 on last year's Estimate.  There is, I grant you, a reduction in the amount of money paid out to privates, but that reduction is based on the hope that there will be fewer privates coming into the Army in future.  In other words, no provision is being made for privates, if they offer themselves; but, at the same time, a sum of £10,000 will be spent on a recruiting campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-head S, it is proposed to spend £10,000 on advertising.  I hope this advertising campaign will not be for more officers.  I mention these points because they are points to which the Minister should give consideration. The Minister should have the point I mentioned about the reduction in clothing further examined.  If the Minister looks carefully at the Estimate, he will find that there is a substantial increase in the provision for officers' uniforms.  While the amount <Col N="847" /> of money for privates' clothing goes down, the amount provided for officers and cadets goes up.  A reduction should be made all round.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head 11, telephone communications last year cost £36,000. This year, the cost is £41,500, an increase of £5,500.  I wonder whether it is possible to have some saving in this?  Could not the personnel find means of saving even on that?  I cannot understand why that figure should go up.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head O, General Stores, there is a reduction of £134,000 and the reduction has relation to the purchase of aircraft.  There is no purchase this year.  I should like to point out to the Minister that one of the things I want discussed on this motion is the question of expenditure on aeroplanes.  I think that there must be an inquiry into the expenditure of over £1,100,000 on jet planes, on a runway for these jet planes and on spare parts for them.  We must have an investigation of that.  I do not care whose heads will fall, there must be an investigation into it to see how these jet planes were no sooner purchased than they were 50 years behind the times&mdash;completely obsolete.</P>
    <P>We had the shocking position here of an announcement being made that grants for vocational and secondary education had to be reduced in this country at a time shortly after we were able to spend this fabulous sum to keep three of these outmoded planes flying around Baldonnel and over Dublin for the parade on Easter Sunday.  Two of them appeared, I think.  The argument was put forward by the former Minister that this expenditure could be stood over, in view of the fact that they would enable us to train commercial pilots.  If we have to spend that amount of money in order to train commercial pilots, would it not be a far more practical and economic proposition to send these pilots to Amsterdam, France or America and let them be trained there?  Let us cut our cloth according to our measure.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to know that this question of the three jet planes, the <Col N="848" /> expenditure involved on them and the money that had to be spent on making a runway for them will not be allowed to rest.  We will have to find out by some means or another who were the brilliant advisers who were able to persuade any Government that this was a sound investment.  If these brilliant advisers were shown to be so foolish on this item, is it not a fair deduction that they are equally foolish on other recommendations they have made to the Governments in the past ten years in connection with the size of a standing army, the type of army and so forth?  We must have a complete investigation. I will conclude with the hope that the Minister will give serious thought to the type of committee he would like to set up between now and the time this motion comes up for discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start by dealing with defence equipment under sub-head P and to say how entirely I disagree with much of what Deputy McQuillan said on that matter.  I do not agree for a moment that the purchase of these jet aircraft was an extravagant luxury.  The alternative was to leave the Air Corps equipped with machines which, according to his reckoning, are about 250 years out of date.  I do not agree for a moment that these machines are 50 years out of date.  They are not first line fighter planes.  That is frankly admitted, but no equipment which can be purchased in that line at the moment will remain first line for longer than a year or two.</P>
      <P>If we were to accept Deputy McQuillan's suggestion we just would not buy anything.  I have had experience of Army training and I know that one of the things which we lacked most was co-operation with the Air Corps.  The Air Corps was frequently very restricted in its use and all too seldom were the men given experience of even a mock attack or a low level attack by aircraft.  That I certainly regard as an absolutely essential feature of army training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree, too, with the previous Minister that these aircraft have a very high value for training purposes.  I am not in favour of sending our pilots abroad for their training, if we can <Col N="849" /> train them at home.  I should like to say in that connection that the training of the Air Corps pilots and those pilots who have subsequently taken up employment in Aer Lingus is of a very high standard indeed and even with some of the even more antiquated machines with which the Air Corps has been equipped from time to time, the performance of those pilots has been beyond all praise.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of Defence Equipment, I would suggest that the total amount estimated for the current year is on the small side rather than the reverse.  If the Army is to be kept up to date, equipment must be purchased, but I would certainly hope that no economy would be made in the provision for expenditure of live ammunition during training.  In fact, I would suggest to the Minister that the use of live ammunition should be on a much more generous scale than has been the case for very many years.</P>
    <P>It is quite impossible to train troops without live ammunition and&mdash;I give this purely as a personal view&mdash;I feel that the value of using weapons on rifle ranges is very limited.  The only real way in which a man can learn how to use his weapons is to use them under service conditions.  That applies not only to small arms but to artillery as well.  That can only be done if there is a more generous allocation of live ammunition to troops on training.</P>
    <P>I should like to query any expenditure&mdash;I do not know if there is anything&mdash;which there may be on anti-aircraft artillery.  There certainly has been a tremendous change in policy, owing to the fact that aircraft now are practically all of very high speed indeed, so that, even with radar controlled artillery, it is almost impossible, without a stupendous barrage, to have any effect on raiding aircraft. In some armies, they have virtually dropped anti-aircraft artillery altogether. I believe that a certain amount of research into radar control has been carried out by our men and I would hate to think that this would be regarded as waste.  I do not think it is, but I would suggest to the Minister that any further use of anti-aircraft <Col N="850" /> artillery should be very closely looked into before any further action is taken.</P>
    <P>I should not like to be taken as in any way agreeing with Deputy McQuillan in his reference to the Naval Service, but, at the same time, I am a little doubtful in my own mind&mdash;and this as a landsman&mdash;as to whether the present naval vessels, the corvette class, are the most suitable for the work which the Naval Service has to carry out.  I would hope that, in view of the fairly heavy maintenance cost of these vessels, possibly some alternative smaller vessels might be procurable, obviously not during the current year, but if we could look at the matter on a long-term basis, some further proposals might come forward.</P>
    <P>I want to make one last suggestion under this heading.  I suggest that the Minister should look carefully into the question of the provision of helicopters, either for use with the Naval Service or as aircraft with the Army Air Corps.  They have proved themselves tremendously valuable for rescue purposes both at sea, and on the land, as well as for mountain rescue.  They are also extremely valuable from an Army point of view for taking Army personnel into the air and showing them the good and the bad points of camouflage and concealment from the air.  I suggest that that would be a not very costly expenditure which would be very valuable.</P>
    <P>The next point to which I should like to refer concerns sub-head G&mdash; Sanatorium Treatment.  That I regard as most disappointing.  A sum of £1,000 is specified under this heading. It might be wondered how sanatorium treatment could be carried out within that figure.  In case other Deputies are unaware of the fact, I think I should outline the provision for officers, N.C.O.s and men who contract T.B. during their Army service.  If officers contract T.B. at any time after commissioning, they are entitled, on contracting the disease, to a period up to 18 months of sanatorium treatment. That may seem not ungenerous until you realise that the last six months of that 18 months are on half pay.</P>
    <P>The situation for N.C.O.s and men is <Col N="851" /> very different.  An N.C.O. or man who contracts T.B. during the first 12 years of service is not entitled to any sanatorium treatment whatever and, on contracting T.B., he is discharged as medically unfit.  An N.C.O. or man who has served from 12 to 18 years is entitled to 12 months' sanatorium treatment only as compared with 18 months for the officer.  I should like to know&mdash;I am sure that possibly the Minister himself does not know at this stage&mdash;the reason for this rather arbitrary division as regards years of service and I should like some inquiry made into this point.  If the soldier has given over 18 years' service, he is worse off than he was when he started: he gets no sanatorium treatment at all. If a soldier with 29, 30 or 31 years' service, for instance, contracts T.B. at that stage, he is not entitled to any sanatorium treatment and he is discharged as medically unfit.  I can see, under those circumstances, that possibly the sanatorium estimate of £1,000 is sufficient.</P>
    <P>I feel that insufficient publicity has been given to the very niggardly treatment which has been meted out to a number of N.C.O.s and men who have contracted T.B.  In view of the fact that T.B. is now so readily treated and can, in so many cases, be completely cured, I feel the Army should not be treated in this way&mdash;especially as there can be no claim for a disability pension in a case of T.B., except where the officer, N.C.O., or man can prove that he contracted T.B. during the emergency period only.  Apparently it is regarded as illegal to contract T.B. at any other time.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about another matter, too, that is, the proportion of men who serve in the Army only for the minimum engagement.  The proportion appears to be far too high.  There is far too quick a turnover of men. Too many officers are retiring voluntarily before completing their service. This represents, to my mind, a tremendous waste of money on training and equipment and it does very seriously reduce the efficiency of the Army.  In my opinion, it is due very largely to boredom and a lack of <Col N="852" /> opportunity for intensive military training as a fighting force.</P>
    <P>Far too much time is taken up by barrack duties and, to this extent, I certainly agree with Deputy McQuillan that nothing is more demoralising to officers and N.C.O.s than to find themselves unable to exercise the troops which, on paper, are under their command. You may carry out what are known as tactical exercises, but they are no substitute for actual exercises on the field under service conditions.</P>
    <P>I would plead with the Minister to see what can be done to reduce the very high incidence of guard and fatigue duties in barracks.  As far as guard duties are concerned, they might be reduced a little.  I would suggest there might be some arrangement made whereby most of the fatigue in barracks could be carried out by ex-soldiers who have completed their term of service and who could be re-employed for that duty. The amount of fatigues is enormous.  I know to my cost that to most men they appear entirely pointless.  There are turf fatigues, all the orderlies, the billet orderlies, the dining-hall orderlies, runners, barrack police, men stuck into all corners, quite legitimately perhaps, but the net result is that when an officer parades his company, he has 20 men and, as Deputy McQuillan says, three or four officers under him to look after that complement of men.</P>
    <P>That I regard as the worst part of the Army&mdash;the lack of opportunity for training men in the field, the lack of opportunity the men get for re-enlistment for intensive Army training. That, I would say, is the reason why so many men enlist in the first enthusiasm and, as soon as they complete their engagement, retire and try to get a job in civil life.  I would hope we would try to build up a permanent force of long-service men.  They are the men, and the only men, on whom we can rely if we want to build up another emergency Army at a later date.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head Y, Administration, there seems to be something which needs attention in view of the fact that substantial reductions have been made <Col N="853" /> in most of the sub-heads but the total cost of this sub-head, £288,465 shows a reduction of only £400, approximately, on the previous year.  I note in one of the footnotes in the Estimates, that one man, and only one man, appears to be on &ldquo;Organisation and Methods&rdquo; work and I feel that a higher expenditure at this stage on such work in securing business efficiency in the administration would be a very good short-term investment.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote one section in particular, the &ldquo;Soldiers' Pay&rdquo; Section, which has a staff, or provides for a staff, of 105, at a total cost of £57,000 to deal with an Army strength of about 7,000 N.C.O.s and men, much of the accounting and of the actual paying being done by Army personnel. That appears to me to be absurd.  No business could possibly justify expenditure at that level and a civilian employer has to deal with just as many, or very nearly as many, complications, as the Army Pay Section has to deal with.  The civilian employer has the various insurances; he very often has to make tax deductions, deductions in respect of tools and overalls, and adjustments in respect of time and so on, and any normal business concern could manage its payment of staff on a much more economical basis than exists in the Army.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention the Accounts Section and the Stores Audit Section.  Here, again, I feel that a greater concentration on organisation and method would pay handsome dividends, because the whole system of Army accountancy&mdash;unless it has changed radically since my day, and I do not believe it has&mdash;is just laughable.  The military side spend all their time trying to &ldquo;cod&rdquo; the civilian side and everyone knows what is going on; but so long as the tot comes out right in the end nobody can say anything about it. Army accountancy is so complicated that it is almost impossible to detect an error.  It was made complicated in order to make defalcations difficult, but if you really set your mind to it, as any well-behaved officer or N.C.O. would do, you would find it was not necessary to comply strictly with the regulations and yet <Col N="854" /> have all the equipment on charge to you absolutely correct for G.H.Q. inspection.</P>
    <P>I often wonder, when the officers are on G.H.Q. inspection, to what extent do they know they are being fooled.  I think they know it all the time.  I believe this system of Army accountancy, which I think we took over from the British Army, lock, stock and barrel, is now very outdated and that if we could get either our own staff specialising in organisation and method, or else an outside business consultant to advise on this whole system, we could get much greater accuracy at much less cost.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head Y (2), I should like to make some reference to the F.C.A., especially in view of the fact that it is the successor of the Volunteer Force which proved my introduction to Army life.  I agree that it is magnificent to see so many people volunteering for military training, but I am rather disturbed that there is a provision under this heading for an expenditure of £484,000, with a deduction of £124,000 for non-attendance at training.  That surely shows that there is a very large number of men on the strength of the F.C.A. who are not able to attend annual training.  That would seem to show, too, that some of those figures give an erroneous impression of the strength of the F.C.A.  I do not want anything I may say on this heading to be taken as criticism of the officers, N.C.O.s and men of that force who are giving excellent voluntary service &mdash;I cannot speak too highly of them&mdash; but I believe there are a number of men who are in the F.C.A. on paper and who have not been seen for years.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head Z, Appropriations-in-Aid, there is a considerable sum shown in respect of the sale of surplus stores.  I hope the Minister will be able to increase that figure.  I know there is a very human failing which afflicts the Army as it afflicts everyone else, in that they become miserly and slow to scrap equipment, even when it becomes obsolete.  It is just put away, and I strongly suspect much of that equipment is not worth storing any more.</P>
    <P>I remember that some of the <Col N="855" /> weapons with which we were issued especially during the early years of the emergency when the shortage was very acute, were extremely dangerous to the wrong people.  They were dangerous at the wrong end.  I remember firing a Hotchkiss gun and after one burst, the barrel fell off and the whole thing disintegrated in my hands.  I feel there must be a lot of old equipment such as that, and I rather suspect there are men, possibly in Clancy Barracks and other barracks, who are busily engaged in cleaning and oiling it still, while it might much more profitably be sold, so saving the trouble of additional maintenance.</P>
    <P>I am speaking in complete ignorance and just asking a question on this point in regard to the Defence forts. Everyone remembers what a sensation it caused when those forts were cast into our hands again.  Now they are entirely obsolete.  All the equipment that there was in them is now useless. It may all have been withdrawn by now; it may be no longer in existence for all I know but, if it has not been disposed of, I would hope that it would be.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister at some stage&mdash;not to-night very likely&mdash;that he is taking some steps to see how these old coastal forts can be disposed of that are just abandoned there.  Certainly, it would be much better if the forts in Cork harbour, in a beautful situation, were given away as youth hostels or something like that, than allowing them to be maintained at the expense of the Department of Defence or else just allowed to go to rack and ruin.</P>
    <P>The sales of surplus stores should be very ruthless.  As far as the other barracks are concerned, I am a little concerned as to whether the number of barracks which are occupied in Dublin is really necessary.  I am regarding this principally from the infantry angle.  That is the one with which I am most in touch.  It does seem, possibly, rather unnecessary that we should have three barracks in which infantry battalions are quartered and none of them even half full.</P>
    <P>As regards the Curragh, I do not <Col N="856" /> know whether all the barracks there are occupied but possibly there could be some economies in the Curragh as well by closing some one or more of the barracks there if they are not already closed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to all the officers, N.C.O.s, and men of the Defence Forces with whom I have kept fairly closely in touch since I retired.  It is amazing to me to find morale has remained so very high in spite of the very boring conditions under which these men have been serving.  I hope that every effort will be made to brighten these conditions. When I say that I do not mean by throwing parties and so on for the men; I mean by giving them really constructive work which they can understand and appreciate.  Anyone who has served in the Army knows that a unit which is hard worked is happy and a unit which is getting it too easy is thoroughly disgruntled, dissatisfied and undisciplined.  You will get cribbing from soldiers about overwork but that is part of the soldier's vocabulary and cannot be dispensed with but the fact remains, to my mind inescapably, that if Army training were on a more realistic scale, if there were less of fatigues and barrack duties, if as much as possible of those duties were carried out by ex-soldiers who have completed their service and if the fighting men of the Army lived all day and every day as fighting men, the result on morale would be enormous, recruiting would be easier and the men would complete a long-term engagement instead of getting out almost as quickly as they can.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the Minister that in anything I have said I should not like to be regarded as in any way critical of him.  I have tried to be constructive in so far as I was able and I hope that some good may result from some of the points I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Booth has mentioned the problem in relation to sanatorium treatment.  I am very pleased that he mentioned that subject because quite recently it has been brought to my attention, particularly in relation to discrepancy in the treatment being meted out to the private <Col N="857" /> as against the officer.  In view of the fact that Deputy Booth expressed in such a very clear manner the whole problem confronting the Army, there is no need for me to add anything except to say that I certainly agree with his remarks and hope the Minister will have the matter investigated.</P>
      <P>Beyond that point, I am afraid Deputy Booth and I may differ. Deputy Booth's approach has been most interesting and in many ways illuminating but I believe that we will have to approach the problem in a vastly different way, a way in which some of us have tried to approach the matter in the past, irrespective of what Party was in Government.  An Army costs money and the problem that some of us believe must be solved is what amount of money we can make available for the Army.  An Army lives on the country.  What is the position at the present time in regard to production and what proportion of that can be laid aside to provide an Army?</P>
      <P>I believe that the remarks of Deputy McQuillan to-night were in many ways justified, as they have been in the past, on the Estimate for Defence and I believe my own remarks over the last number of years on the same Estimate were justified.  I believe there has been squandering of money, and that there still is, in the Army and in the Department of Defence each year.  Everyone in public life has certain responsibilities and must in every way possible draw the attention of the Minister and the Department to wastages that we consider should be attended to.  We have done it in the past and I am sorry to say that whatever Minister was in charge of Defence seemed to take little or no interest in our complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has always struck me as very noticeable&mdash;perhaps it is a good thing in one way&mdash;that when the Estimate for Defence was introduced in the House annually there was, as it were, a clap on the back for the Minister from the ex-Minister.  I agreed with that in one respect because in most cases the Deputy who held office and the Deputy who had been in office previously were men who had served the country well.  That did not, however, <Col N="858" /> in my opinion, justify the clap on the back.  I am sorry to say that on all those occasions, no matter what complaints were made to these Ministers, they took very little notice of them.  I am afraid that the reason for that was that they did not seem to bother about what was going on.  I do hope that the present Minister will not continue that line of approach because, if he does, Defence during the next 12 months and thereafter will be as great a problem financially as it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>We hear of certain reductions Deputy McQuillan has referred to them.  I believe that the reductions revealed in the Book of Estimates are of little or no importance.  There are ways in which money is still being squandered.  Practically every week of the year on the roads between Dublin and Kildare, and even further afield, one sees fleets of motor cyclists, fleets of Army lorries, all sorts of Army vehicles travelling the public roads.  We were told some months ago that petrol rationing was necessary.  We are told year after year that the financial situation of the country is such that unless production is increased we will go from bad to worse.  In spite of that, there seems to be an increase in the number of tours carried out by the Army.  For what?</P>
    <P>I appreciate the views expressed by Deputy Booth but a great many of the exercises that one sees involve driving on the main roads between Dublin and Kildare and further south.  Indeed, from Cork City they have a happy knack of even sending out lorries with officers of the Army if they miss a bus. We may be told that that represents little in the way of expense but the taxpayers have asked each and every one of us who have raised this matter in the past to continue to draw attention to what is considered wasteful expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is a habit apparently in every country to have huge army parades, whether they are in the squares of Moscow or other cities behind the Iron Curtain, in New York on St. Patrick's Day or in Whitehall in London, and we must have our parades, too.  I may be wrong, but I believe that if there <Col N="859" /> were a little more respect and thought given by way of prayer for the unfortunate men who gave their lives for this country, it would mean a lot more to them and show far more respect to them than all the parades we have in Dublin, Limerick and Cork at a huge cost.  Let us be frank about this and I wish to be frank about it.  What is meant by sending lorries around the country on Saturday night and on Sunday mornings?  Very little&mdash;a day out for some of the boys.  We know that and they know it.  It had nothing to do with whether or not they were successful in their training.</P>
    <P>To whom are we showing our military strength?  Do not forget that in 1939 we had none of these parades and none of this equipment to show our strength to near-by neighbours and some far-away neighbours.  We did have sufficient men and women in the country, both of the younger generation as well as those a little more advanced, who showed by their spirit that their country meant sufficient to them to join the different branches of the Defences Forces in that period.  It was not army equipment that saved us then.</P>
    <P>Some of our military depots have quantities of junk bought for colossal prices and which would not be used in other countries; yet on occasion we say: &ldquo;We will have a parade&rdquo;, and proceed to show the great things we bought.  We are only deceiving ourselves in that respect.  Let us have, as Deputy McQuillan has said and as I have said myself, an Army which is small numerically but which is well contented and well established.  With such an Army, one can build, in time of emergency, the Army which is needed. It happened in 1939 when we had N.C.O.s in the Irish Army who were able to train other young men who joined the Forces in such a splendid manner that they proved a credit to their country.</P>
    <P>In 1948, I told the Minister for Defence, and I still stand by it, that the report of his own officers after the war in relation to recruitment was such that they admitted themselves it was a complete failure.  Yet members <Col N="860" /> of the House were told by the Minister for Defence that everything was grand and that men were rushing to the Colours.  If we examine the figures submitted in this Book of Estimates, we see, as Deputy McQuillan said, that the Army is full of &ldquo;brass hats&rdquo; and officers and a sprinkling of privates. That apparently is to continue.  The reduction in the number of officers after the war was negligible; we know that not alone was the reduction in the number of privates large but it was so because men would not stay in the Army owing to certain conditions prevailing there.  I think it would be far more fitting if the Minister approached the whole question on the lines of having a small, well-paid Army, well-treated and well-housed, rather than showing to us on paper so many thousands of men who are not really there at all.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy Corry will agree with me on the point of having a small well-paid and contented Army.  It has been a heartbreak for Cork County Council&mdash;irrespective of who may be in power&mdash;to provide houses year after year for military personnel.  Would it not be better for the Department of Defence and the Minister to provide money for the building of houses for N.C.O.s in the various centres rather than to be concentrating on jet planes for the training of pilots&mdash;the &ldquo;Dan Dares&rdquo; of the future?</P>
    <P>If we are to have a choice, surely it should be for a group of men not alone well-established and well-paid but well-housed, whether it be around Cork City, Kilworth Camp, the Curragh or anywhere else.  The refusal of the Department of Defence to provide homes for these men is one grievance. It is quite true that they provided a few houses in Cork near Collins Barracks at a cost of about £5,000 a house.  In this Estimate we cannot find money for the provision of homes for N.C.O.s.  I would ask the Minister, as a young man who is completely removed from the line of approach of his predecessors, to have this matter investigated.  If it is handled in the right way we may be successful in obtaining houses for these young men.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to one important matter.  It does not affect the present Minister&mdash;I do not <Col N="861" /> want to accuse him or anybody else&mdash; but the question of promotion in the Army strikes me as being very strange. Promotion has been given to men who were away down the line on the Army list.  I believe a Minister for Defence is responsible for seeing that there is no discontent in the Army.  One way in which discontent can be caused is when capable men see promotion given to those further down the line.  If the handing out of promotions is a right confined to the Army Command and the Minister for Defence, as apparently it is, then let these promotions be given on merit and not for any other reason.  The Minister can look into this matter by examining the Department files.  All I want is to see every man getting fair play, whether in the Army or any other Department.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the Naval Service.  Certain savings have been made in relation to this service, and these savings may be effective.  It was about time they were made.  There is squandermania in the Naval Service. The headquarters are in Dublin.  If the fishermen of West Cork were attacked by a foreign trawler, it would be better to have their headquarters around Deputy Corry's place, Haulbowline, than in Dublin.  Everything seems to be centred in Dublin.  More attention should be given to the Naval Service than has been given in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth mentioned the condition of the Cork harbour forts.  Some of us are aware of the condition of these forts.  We pointed out on many occasions that, if it was intended to keep these forts under the control of the Department, it was vitally essential that sufficient money be made available for their maintenance.  Of course, that could never be found and what was once bad is now becoming derelict.  It is a great pity to see fine buildings going as they are.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth drew attention to the equipment in the forts and wondered what happened to it.  I can say what happened.  When we saw the Tri-colour hoisted over what was then Camden Fort, we knew that excellent equipment was taken over.  All that excellent machinery was brought up to <Col N="862" /> the Curragh and probably&mdash;I do not know&mdash;brought up from there to some second-hand dealer's yard in Dublin. If it had been left in Cork harbour, better use would probably have been made of it.</P>
    <P>In public life, we must be prepared to accept certain responsibilities. When we believe it is our duty to criticise, then I say it is right we should do so.  I take it that, no matter who may be in power, remarks made from one side of the House or the other, are never meant to be destructive. When both Fianna Fáil and inter-Party Ministers were in charge of this Department, I had very good reason for drawing attention to certain squandering of money.  I know what happened.  I am saying here quite clearly that there were very close investigations to find out where a Deputy could have got the information he did get.  I had the information; I got it legally and rightly.  As a representative of the people.  I accepted it as my duty to draw the attention, not only of the Minister, but of the House to these conditions.</P>
    <P>If we were to consider our own person, sometimes it might be better for us to keep our mouths shut; if we were to consider our own personal advancement, it might be safer to say nothing in this House and not fall foul of certain experts.  However, I want to say this to the Minister and I hope to see him about this matter within the next couple of weeks: because my duty compelled me to draw the attention of a Minister for Defence to certain things that should not have happened, for the past 12 months I have been the victim of it.  People in the Department can tell the Minister.  I am not blaming the present Minister.  I can put my finger on some of them.  I will finish by saying that, if some people, no matter who they are, experts of any Department or not, believe that they are autocrats who can silence a public representative for carrying out his duties, then they will have to think a second time, so far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister that these matters are dealt with in a file in his Department.  Please God, within the next couple of weeks, I will discuss <Col N="863" /> them with him.  I will expect from the present Minister the same justice and fair play as I get for the people I represent.</P>

      <P>The first matter I wish to deal with is one that has been under consideration by the Department of Defence for nine or ten years now.  It is the taking in of civilian apprentices at our naval dockyard in Haulbowline. That was a tradition in the British time.  Some of our best men were trained there.  The matter was taken up in the House some years ago by the late Deputy Keane and myself. It has gone on ever since and we are still waiting for the decision of the Navy as to whether the proposal is feasible or not.  The Minister now has it on his hands.  It has taken them nine years to consider whether they will take in half a dozen apprentices at Haulbowline.  If it takes them as long to get ready for war, then God <Col N="864" /> help the country.  I hope the Minister will do better.  Since the matter was raised here, some 50 apprentices could have learned their trade there.  They could have come out fully trained to make their way in the world.  I do not know whether or not laziness on the part of the Department is to blame.</P>
      <P>I had an answer here from Deputy Traynor when he was Minister for Defence.  The matter was to get careful consideration.  Deputy MacEoin, when he was Minister, assured me on at least four occasions that the matter was receiving earnest attention.  But it has not been attended to yet.  Surely the Department of Defence are not in competition with the Land Commission? If they are, the Land Commission will beat them; if you send a request to the Land Commission you can expect to have the matter settled in your grandson's time.  I do not want to come here again to raise this matter.  If I do, I will raise it on the Adjournment and will take further steps that will not be agreeable to anybody.</P>

      <P>The next thing with which I wish to deal is housing for Army personnel.  I invite the Minister to pay a special visit to Spike Island and to look at the housing conditions under which his Army are supposed to live there.  When the housing inspector from the South Cork Board of Health went there, he could not find a habitable house on the island and came back with a bundle of applications to be thrown as a burden on the Urban Council in Youghal or on the Cork County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very same position exists in Haulbowline.  There were decent houses there originally, but they have been allowed to go into disrepair.  I suggest to the Minister that it is his duty and that of the Army to provide houses for Army personnel.  The whole position <Col N="865" /> is a scandal.  It is now four or five years since the barracks in Youghal were closed down and the troops shifted to Cork.  Yet there are still five unfortunate men travelling from Youghal to Cork each morning by train at their own expense to serve in the Army.  Take that out of their week's pay.  They are married men who, through the goodness of Youghal Urban Council, succeeded in getting houses in that town while the barracks were still there.  They have no hope of getting even a dog box to live in in Collins Barracks.  It is costing them something between 25/&ndash; and 30/&ndash; a week of their meagre pay to travel to Cork.</P>
    <P>These are the conditions that are leaving us without recruits.  I have met those unfortunate people, one man with a wife and five children.  His wife, who made the complaint, told me: &ldquo;It is hard enough to rear five children on a private's pay without having to pay for his travelling to Cork each day to serve in the Army.&rdquo; I am asking the Minister now to give consideration to these matters.  It would do the country a lot more good than the jet planes.</P>
    <P>Sub-head T deals with military lands.  A few years ago a Bill was passed through the House to facilitate the handing over of these military lands to the proper people&mdash;the Land Commission.  I have endeavoured on several occasions to draw attention to an area of land lying between Mitchels-town and Fermoy which has been let by the Department of Defence to yearly tenants.  Farms and houses have been occupied on these lands for the past 20 years.  Men with large families live on them as yearly tenants of the Department of Defence.  I can honestly say that there was never a rack-renting landlord in this country who could work out rack-rents in a harder fashion than the Department does in relation to these tenants.</P>
    <P>The land is bad, the tenants are paying more for it than is being paid for the best land in the Golden Vale of Limerick.  Surely there should be some means by which that land would be handed over to the Land Commission and dealt with under the Land Acts <Col N="866" /> so that those people would be charged proper rents instead of the £2 an acre charged by the Department of Defence for some of that land&mdash;a handful of furze.  I would also like to know from the Minister why a similar proposal is not adopted in relation to the large area of land in the Curragh of Kildare.  During the war when farmers were prosecuted if they did not till their land, that land was growing furze.  It still is.  Is there any reason why this State should say to a farmer with 100 or 150 acres: &ldquo;We are taking this off you for the purpose of relieving congestion in County Galway&rdquo;&mdash;and at the same time have these thousands of acres lying there?  What is the reason? If there is a reason for holding them, the people are entitled to know it. There is no justification for holding them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <P>I guarantee to the Minister I would get a crop out of it.  I am sure if we had Deputy MacEoin's brother in arms, he would grow Blue Specials on it.  The land is good.  A man need only look at either side of it &mdash;look at the fields before you come to the Curragh and look at the fields as you leave the Curragh and see what kind of land is there.  Whatever the reason why that land should be held there unploughed and untilled during the emergency and ever since, it is time it was got over now.  I suggest that it be handed over, under the legislation passed in this House for the purpose, to the Land Commission and that they be let deal with it.</P>

I do not want to have the trouble of holding the Minister here from 10.30 to 11 some nights, answering for things he may know very little about, things which are the mistakes of his officials.  Surely in regard to the table which was given to us here, which was read by Deputy Ó Briain, there were enough officials there to do the little job they have to do, unless it is a fact that there are so many of them that, after they start with the first official, by the time the last official gets hold of it there is a new Minister in office.</P>

      <P>Coming from a constituency such as mine, it is only natural that I should hear many grievances of the Army.  Some of these have been mentioned already in the course of this debate.  The main grievances of which I have heard concern promotions and the lack of credit given for service during the emergency. This was mentioned to me in particular in connection with the Corps of Engineers.  I do not know if it refers to all corps in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain officers who joined in the early 1940's and who served as temporary officers with captain's appointment and who after the emergency were not promoted from lieutenant to captain until 1948, would not be eligible for automatic promotion until 1958, which would be ten years from the date of their promotion to the rank of captain.  These officers, who joined the corps of engineers in 1940 or 1941, must wait 17 or 18 years before being entitled to automatic <Col N="868" /> promotion, whereas the officer who joined post-emergency would reach that rank in 15 years.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to bring it to the notice of the Minister that the Defence Forces Regulations should be amended so that those officers who served during the emergency and who have given 15 years' satisfactory service would be promoted automatically to the rank of commandant, as that would leave emergency and post-emergency officers on an equal footing.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention also to the Minister the case of youths who joined the F.C.A.  Many of them are young lads who spend their holiday periods in training camps and, while they do not expect to have hotel conditions in those camps, I am given to understand that at times the conditions are not what they should be for their age.  It is no encouragement to those youngsters to remain on in the F.C.A. and return to the camp each year under those conditions.</P>
    <P>The regular forces and the F.C.A. have for some time been promised a different type of uniform and there is dissatisfaction amongst them that that promise has not been kept up to this. I would ask the Minister to look into that matter also.</P>
    <P>With regard to the housing of the forces, a new scheme of houses is nearing completion on the Curragh. Naturally, the Department is doing something towards giving better housing conditions to the men on the Curragh, but I understand from a reply here recently that the number of new houses built will not satisfy the demand.  If it is not possible for the Minister at this stage to say that more houses can be built, perhaps he could do something about the reconditioning of the houses which will become vacant on the Curragh, so as to give better houses to those who need them.  There are three types of houses&mdash;A, B and C&mdash;with which I am sure the Minister himself is familiar.  One of those types is not fit for any married soldier to live in.  In fact, two of them are very bad for a married soldier.  Perhaps some of the houses vacated when the new houses are occupied could be reconstructed <Col N="869" /> so as to give better living conditions to the soldiers who cannot be accommodated in the new houses.</P>
    <P>Would I be in order in referring to the civilian employees of the Corps of Engineers under this Vote?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is grave disquiet among the civilian employees of the Corps of Engineers.  There have been some dismissals of late and there is fear that there will be further dismissals. I realise that the Minister is working on an Estimate prepared by his predecessor.  That Estimate does not hold out any hope that there will be a lessening of the unemployment that is likely to be caused among the civilian employees.  If the Minister could bring forward works which are already provided for&mdash;there are a couple which come to my mind, the sewage disposal works and the new gymnasium &mdash;it would help to relieve the situation. It would not be a permanent cure, I know, but there is a possibility that, within the next few months, a housing scheme may be sanctioned for Kildare town.  I appeal to the Minister, therefore, to have these works brought forward so that employment will be available for as many men as possible until such time as work on the county council housing scheme is available for them.</P>
      <P>I would join with Deputy Corry in asking the Minister about the lands on the Curragh.  I realise that a certain portion of the lands is necessary for the Department of Defence, but in relation to those portions which are not necessary, would the Minister give consideration to Deputy Corry's proposal, that these lands be taken and divided in order to provide land for those who need it in that area and to secure production from what is absolutely unproductive at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already been investigating a number of matters raised in the debate, but I have not had sufficient time to go into all these matters thoroughly since I took office. I am, of course, operating on the Estimate that was prepared by the previous <Col N="870" /> Government.  That being so, it is rather surprising to me that we should have had so much criticism from the other side of the House.  As I say, I am investigating a number of the matters that were raised, but I shall endeavour to deal with the other points mentioned.</P>
      <P>The question of the ratification of the Red Cross Conventions was raised by Deputy MacEoin.  As far as I am aware, although the Red Cross does come under the control of the Department of Defence, the ratification of these conventions is a matter for the Department of External Affairs and consequently it should be raised on the Estimate for that Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin made only one criticism, to which reference was also made in a different context by Deputy Desmond, that is, the question of seniority.  It is my view that seniority should be adhered to, generally speaking, but if it is obviously in the interests of the service to depart from it on occasion, because of particular merit or other reasons, then that should be done.  I do not think the promotions referred to by Deputy MacEoin had the detrimental effect on the morale of the Army which the Deputy maintained they had.  I would imagine that they had a good effect.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan referred, in the contemptuous terms in which he has referred to it on previous occasions, to our naval service.  It is easy to understand that Deputy McQuillan, coming from an inland constituency, is not concerned with the protection of our fisheries.  Our defensive plan provides also for seaward defence, but at the moment our naval service is not geared for that and is merely fulfilling the function of protecting our fisheries. Deputies who, unlike the Deputy from Roscommon, represent constituencies in which fishing is an industry, will hardly agree with Deputy McQuillan that the naval service is too elaborate, if you like, for this work.  In fact there are complaints to the effect that the naval service is not even sufficient to protect the fisheries.  Certainly there is every justification for a naval service of at least the size that we have at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> The same Deputy drew attention to a motion which has been put down by himself and Deputy Dr. Browne and which appears to me to call upon the Government to abandon its responsibility in regard to defensive policy and to hand it over to a Committee of the House.  The matter of our defensive policy will be decided by the Government and I shall advise the Government, after consultation with the General Staff of the Army.  However, it is possible that in the near future we shall be discussing that on this motion and I will defer going into detail on it until that time.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan also pointed to the reductions that have taken place in the armies of other countries and apparently assumed that we should be able to do something on the same scale.  Our Army has never been organised on the same basis as the armies of the countries he mentioned, and the same scope for reduction does not exist in our case.  We have no troops in Western Germany, for instance, that we can recall; we have not got compulsory national service on which we can slow down and eventually abandon; nor have we battleships and other such equipment which we can decide to do away with. Our Army has been organised on a very modest basis.  The peace time establishment that was provided for is modest and is intended to be only the framework on which an Army could be built if an emergency arose. It is hardly much more than sufficient for the maintenance of internal security if a position should arise in which the Army would have to be used for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The fact that there were so many officers and N.C.O.s as compared with private soldiers was also commented on by Deputy McQuillan.  Of course, that is so because the number of privates provided for in the establishment has never actually been recruited and, therefore, the number of officers and N.C.O.s is somewhat out of proportion. It must be remembered, however, that these officers and N.C.O.s, apart from their duties with the Permanent Defence Forces, are also needed for the training of the First <Col N="872" /> Line Reserve and assisting in the training of the F.C.A.  We need, then, more officers and N.C.O.s than are actually needed for the training of the Permanent Defence Forces.  I am not myself fully satisfied, however, that there is not a possibility of reducing the number of officers.  There may be, or there may not.  It is a question into which I intend to look in the future. I have been considering it.</P>
    <P>I would point out, too, that the Army is the framework on which expansion can take place in the event of an emergency.  If at any time we find it necessary or desirable to expand, we must have both the officers and N.C.O.s so that that expansion can take place.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan complained that junior officers receive a certain amount of automatic promotion.  Apparently Deputy McQuillan thinks that second-lieutenants should not be promoted to full lieutenants and lieutenants should not be promoted to captains until such time as vacancies occur.  I do not know if many others would agree with Deputy McQuillan that junior officers should be left to stagnate as lieutenants until such time as vacancies for captains occur.  It is only to be expected that there should be a certain amount of automatic promotion; surely it is not too high to have this automatic promotion up to the rank of captain?</P>
    <P>He also referred to the provision for a recruiting campaign in this year's Estimate.  Half the money put down for advertising there is for the civil defence recruiting campaign.  I am sure Deputy McQuillan would not like that to be abandoned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost of civil servants in the Department of Defence, that is a problem affecting every Department of State.  In common with a lot of other people, I was convinced before I took office that there were too many civil servants.  I must confess that, up to the present at any rate, I have not discovered how the number in my Department can be reduced.  Civil Service personnel does not have to increase at the same rate when an expansion takes place in the Defence Forces.  At the same time, <Col N="873" /> when the numbers are cut down in the Army, one needs almost as many civil servants to deal with the reduced number.  While there is no doubt that there may be some scope for reduction, I do not think it will be anything like the extent that Deputy McQuillan appears to believe possible.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Deputy was getting at when he spoke about the difference in pay as between officers, N.C.O.s and men.  Surely, it is necessary that there should be a difference in the rates of remuneration of the different ranks?  One cannot have them all paid at the same rate.  There is bound to be a big difference between the pay of senior officers and men.  To-day, when the number of privates is lower than that provided for in the establishment, there is nothing significant in the fact that the amount shown for the pay of officers and N.C.O.s together is actually greater than that provided for privates.  That is due to the fact that the number of privates is well below peace-time establishment.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to expenditure on aircraft.  There is no provision in this year's Estimate for new aircraft.  He said, too, that the jet planes which were purchased are obsolete. That is not true.  They are excellent training craft and quite suitable for that purpose.  They are used as training craft in other countries.  They are certainly providing our pilots with very useful training to enable them to fulfil their function as pilots and also for the purpose of providing pilots for Aer Lingus.  Of course, if these pilots go to Aer Lingus they remain on the reserve of officers here and they are not, therefore, lost to the Defence Forces.  I agree with my predecessor that it is a very good policy that we should train pilots in our own Air Corps instead of having to send them abroad to be trained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth asked that in training activities, manoeuvres and exercises there should be a more generous allocation of live ammunition.  That is something that should be considered. I shall look into the matter and see if something can be done in that direction without unnecessarily depleting <Col N="874" /> our stocks.  Obviously it is something which would make for more realistic training.  I agree it is desirable.</P>
    <P>He also referred to helicopters.  The Army is not losing sight of the utility of helicopters but so far it has been decided not to purchase any.  Possibly we are saving ourselves, in refraining, from being charged by Deputy McQuillan with purchasing something that is obsolete.  The question of helicopters is not however being neglected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth also referred to sanatorium treatment and the difference there is between the treatment in the case of officers and that in the case of men.  The fact is that that situation is due to the difference as between the pay of officers and that of men.  The men are entitled to the benefit of the schemes administered by the State. They are not treated at the expense of the Army unless there is a good prospect that they will recover fully and continue to serve in the Army.  Otherwise, they are let go and then they can avail of the treatment which is provided by the various State schemes. In the case of officers, on the other hand, they are usually not qualified for these schemes because of their incomes.</P>
    <P>The high incidence of guard and fatigue duties was also mentioned.  I am looking into the question of whether it is possible to reduce the fatigue duties.  I do not think it is possible at the moment to do much about the guard duties unless we get more men into the Army or close some of the posts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be very popular.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that any suggestion to close posts would meet with a great deal of local opposition, but that appears to be the only way in which these duties can be reduced.  The same Deputy referred to the fact that the cost of administration is too high. Deputy McQuillan also referred to that.  Deputy Booth referred to the sale of old equipment.  I am doing everything possible to find out where there is equipment which is more or less obsolete and which is not needed in the Army to-day.  I shall try to get rid of that equipment if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> With regard to the coast defence forts that are not occupied at the moment, there is only the bare minimum expenditure required for the maintenance of these forts.  It would obviously be bad economy to let them fall into complete disrepair.  Practically all the perishable equipment stationed in these forts has been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth also referred to the fact that there are three barracks in the City of Dublin given over to infantry.  He does not believe that is necessary.  That is one of the questions I am inquiring into at the moment, but certainly I have been assured that, at the time the third barracks was opened for infantry, it was necessary.  Whether it is necessary at the moment or not is a matter that will have to be gone into.  It is bound up with the other matter I mentioned &mdash;whether it is possible to close other military posts or not.  I know that it would not be popular.  I am not saying that any decision has been come to about that, but perhaps it would make for better morale in the Army if we had less of these guard and fatigue duties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond gave us his ideas about the Army.  He seemed to think that money is being squandered in the Army.  So far I have not discovered that.  Maybe it is, but I certainly do not see any evidence of it.  As to fleets of Army vehicles being on the roads, I think if you inquire at any time about Army vehicles being on the roads, there is always a good reason for it. If you have an Army, it must be trained and if it is to be trained, transport must be provided.  While there may be and probably are occasions on which an Army vehicle is out when it could be done without, I do not think there is an awful lot of that.  If Deputy Desmond can prove to me that Army lorries were used to bring home officers who had missed their buses, I hope he will provide me with that evidence and the matter will be investigated.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dooley and Desmond dealt with the necessity for improved housing accommodation for the Army.  I certainly agree that there is a necessity in <Col N="876" /> a number of places for more housing accommodation for married soldiers. A start has been made in providing houses for soldiers.  As Deputies are probably aware, 88 houses have already been built in Dublin; there are 30 nearing completion in the Curragh; and 20 nearing completion in Athlone. In other places, a start has not yet been made, but I know there are other places in mind in which houses are badly needed.  One of those is Cork. It is hoped to build some houses for soldiers in Cork next year, but it must be remembered that the Department of Defence, in building houses, has to provide them out of revenue.  Local authorities, on the other hand, build houses by way of loans but any increased building activities by the Department of Defence will show up in the Estimates.  In the Estimates this year, money for houses at Cork has not been provided.</P>
    <P>In any case, local authorities have got a duty to provide a fair share of houses for soldiers in common with other citizens.  I certainly do not think it is the duty of the Department of Defence to provide completely for soldiers in that respect.  I assure Deputies I will press as strongly as I can for the continuation and intensification of the provision of housing accommodation for married soldiers. Of course, that will also include, as Deputy Desmond suggested, the reconditioning of the old married quarters which will be vacated by soldiers who are accommodated in the new houses.  Certainly, these old married quarters are largely out of date.  It is proposed to recondition them and improve them in order to bring them up to modern standards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond made some vague charge, which I cannot deal with now, of being victimised in some way by the Department.  I do not know anything about that, and if he can bring any evidence to substantiate the charge, I will have it investigated.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Corry's first point &mdash;the apprenticeship scheme for Haul-bowline&mdash;I am afraid that at this time, at any rate, I have to give the same reply as he stated he got from my numerous predecessors&mdash;that it is still under consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> He also referred to the housing problem, with particular reference to the five men who are still living in Youghal, stationed at Cork, who have to travel every day to Cork to go on duty.  That is something of which I was not aware, but it appears that the best that could be done for these people at the moment would be for the Cork Corporation to provide them with houses.  The Army housing scheme in Cork has not started yet.</P>
    <P>He also referred to land between Mitchelstown and Fermoy.  The position about that land is that the Land Commission have refused to take it over.  There is no provision by which the Department of Defence can distribute it either to relieve local congestion or for any other purpose. The Land Commission, apparently, are not interested in the particular parcel of land to which Deputy Corry referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dooley referred to officers who were temporary officers during the emergency, with particular reference to officers of the Corps of Engineers, and to the fact that they find that, to get their automatic promotion, they have to wait for a longer period than officers who came in, in the first instance, as regular officers.  That is a grievance that does not apply only to the Corps of Engineers.  A number of officers in every corps were kept on after the emergency.  The position at that time was that those who were reverted to a lower rank because the peace-time establishment did not provide for them in the acting rank they held during the emergency found that their service in the emergency was not taken into regard when assessing seniority.  I do not know if anything can be done about that now, but that is what has happened.  I am aware that there are a number of officers in the Army who feel they have been badly treated in that respect.  It was done some number of years ago and I do not know whether anything can be done about that now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dooley referred to another question that has been worrying me a lot since I came into this Department, namely, civilian employees and mainly <Col N="878" /> civilian employees in the Curragh.  I discovered that the Estimates provide for a lesser number of civilian employees during the coming year than was the case last year; in other words, it will not be possible, within the framework of the present Estimates, to keep on as many civilian employees in the Army as last year.  I had nothing to do with the framing of the Estimates.  There is nothing I can do now to initiate new schemes on which tradesmen and building workers generally could be employed in the Army. These schemes must be prepared a considerable time in advance and I am afraid that, for the time being, at any rate, I shall just have to accept the position as I find it.</P>
    <P>The position is that provision has been made for a lesser number of employees this year than last year.  I have already looked into the possibility, as a temporary relief, at any rate, of bringing forward any schemes which have been included in the Estimate.  I find it is not possible to bring any of them forward at a sufficient speed to absorb the people who are at present being dismissed.  The situation is further aggravated by the fact that apparently the previous Government, who were coming near the end of the financial year and who were also coming near a general election, decided to keep on people in employment for whom there was no work available. That will aggravate the position in the future.  I have no alternative but to operate the Estimate as I got it.  I have looked into the possibility of bringing forward other schemes and I have found that it is not possible. Everything I can do to retain these people in employment, I will do, but I am bound by the fact that the money being provided is not sufficient and that schemes on which these people could be employed are not there.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan mentioned the increased estimate for telephone charges.  The wages of telephone operators have been increased, as also have telephone charges, so that it is natural that there should be some increase under that heading.</P>
    <P>The Department of Defence has no responsibility for the policy with <Col N="879" /> regard to fishery protection.  The Naval Service merely provides a fishery protection patrol and the policy is decided by the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Lands. The function of our vessels is merely to arrest trawlers and hand them over to the civil authorities for legal proceedings. The Department of Defence has no other responsibilities in the matter.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into details with regard to the motion put down by Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Dr. Browne as we shall probably have a full debate on that matter later.  If there is any matter which I have not dealt with, I shall supply the information to the Deputy who is interested, if he will put down a parliamentary question.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred in his statement to the possibility of there being too many officers in the Army and the possibility of making a reduction.  I do not expect him to make a statement with regard to his policy, but, in case that reference might be misunderstood, I would ask him to make it clear that what he has in mind, if he comes to any conclusion that reductions are necessary, is that the ordinary wastage will operate and posts not filled rather than anything in the nature of a compulsory reduction or a compulsory retirement.</P>

The present peace-time establishment was worked out some years ago.  I merely intend to have that reviewed.  It may be that there will be no decision at all to reduce these ranks.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,104,730 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937, No. 2 of 1941, No. 14 of 1943, No. 3 of 1946, Nos. 19 and 28 of 1949, No. 23 of 1953, etc.); Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934, No. 33 of 1938, No. 5 of 1944, Nos. 11 and 34 of 1945, Nos. 7 and 29 of 1949 and No. 5 of 1953); Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936, No. 9 of 1948, No. 30 of 1950, No. 27 of 1952, No. 4 of 1953, etc.); Payments in respect of Compensation for Members of Local Defence Force (No. 19 of 1946 and No. 15 of 1949); and for Sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.</P>
      <P>The total sum required for Army pensions for 1957-58 is £1,657,130, which is a decrease of £1,230 on the Estimate for 1956-57.  It will be noted that last year's figure includes a sum of £28,000 transferred from the Vote for Increases in Pensions.  This was to meet increases granted as from 1st August, 1956, in certain Army pensions.  The cost of these increases for the full year will be about £45,000 and provision therefor has been made in this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal provisions of this Estimate are for pensions under the Military Service Pensions Acts; wound and disability pensions, special allowances, dependants' allowances and gratuities under the Army Pensions Acts; and service pensions and gratuities <Col N="881" /> under the Defence Forces (pensions) schemes in respect of service in the permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>The only appreciable increase occurs in sub-head (J)&mdash;Defence Forces (pensions) schemes.  The increase of £20,000 in this sub-head is due mainly to the increasing number of retired and discharged Army and Navy personnel for whom provision has to be made.</P>
    <P>The only reduction, I think, that calls for any comment is that of £14,000 in sub-head O&mdash;Special Allowances.  This is due not to any actual decrease in the cost or number of special allowances on pay but rather to the fact that the expected rate of increase on which last year's Estimate was based proved to be too high.</P>
    <P>I expect that all applications and petitions under the Military Service Pensions Acts will have been disposed of before the end of this financial year. In fact this Estimate provides in sub-head C for the cost of the Referee and Advisory Committee up to the 31st December, 1957, only, and I shall do what I can to have the work concluded by that date.</P>
    <P>I hope that the brief outline I have given will assist Deputies in their examination of the Estimate.  If any further explanations are required I shall endeavour to give them.</P>

      <P>I have very little comment to make on the Minister's statement.  I note that he hopes the Referee and Advisory Committee will finish by the 31st December next and that he intends, as far as possible, that that will happen.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister to state the section under which a member of that board was dismissed recently and why, if the board is to be in existence only for so short a time, it was felt desirable that his services should be dispensed with?  I do not think there was any question of this man's efficiency or impartiality.  I should like to know the section under which the Minister or the Government decided to dispense with his services, because I am not aware that such authority was vested in the Minister or in the Government, this being a statutory body.  However, the Minister may be able to explain that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> The question of special allowances is one to which I think the Minister should have made some reference.  A motion was passed by this House by which certain extensions were to be made in regard to applications for medals.  Legislation was prepared and ready when a certain situation arose, but I think the Minister should have informed the House that it was his intention to carry out that particular amendment in relation to that section even if he was not prepared to carry out the whole intention.  The resolution that was passed by the House should be given effect.</P>
    <P>There is disquiet about the delay in dealing with applications for special allowances.  I know they present a knotty problem and nobody is better aware of that than I am, but the Minister and his advisers should not if there is verification by responsible officers&mdash; unless that verification has been with drawn&mdash;reject the case and declare that the medal was not validly awarded.  It would be better to go on the assumption that every medal was validly awarded unless there was evidence to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I know it is a very difficult matter and one that gave me much worry and many headaches.  I know it will give the present Minister, or any occupant of that office, considerable worry for a considerable time.  Verification is becoming more difficult as the ranks of the people who are in a position to verify are thinning every day.  Therefore, where responsible officers have verified, the Minister might write to them, if they are available, to see if their verification stands, and let that settle the matter instead of waiting to get different people to verify.  That creates delay and imposes hardships on people who are entitled to whatever allowances they should get under the Act.</P>
    <P>The problem of Military Service Pensions will always be a serious one and when the Referee and members of this board finish in December next I feel they will still have left a very unsettled and unsatisfactory state of affairs.  I shall say no more than that at the moment but as I said before, I would prefer to wait until they have <Col N="883" /> concluded and by that time we would get an overall picture as to what the situation was at that stage.</P>

      <P>The former Minister forestalled the point I was going to make.  On 16th November, 1955, a motion in my name regarding the special allowances was accepted by the then Minister, Deputy MacEoin, and passed by the House.  A promise was given on that occasion that legislation would be introduced before Christmas, but, unfortunately, we did not get the Minister to say what Christmas he had in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>Christmas, 1955, went by and Christmas, 1956, went by, and I would now suggest to the present Minister that Christmas, 1957, should not go by without that motion being implemented.  It is a very simple motion.  The Minister will find the report of the proceedings on that occasion at column 856, Volume 153. The purpose of the motion was to ensure that the grant of a medal, irrespective of the date on which it was granted, would entitle recipients to the special allowance.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to hear the Minister say that sub-head O, Special Allowances, shows a decrease.  I do not know whether or not that is due to the number of deaths, but there is extreme dissatisfaction with the way in which the special allowance has been administered for the past 12 months. It has been cut down to practically nothing in many cases.  I am tired telephoning and writing to the Department asking for a reason for the decrease and I have not got any satisfactory answer on any occasion.  I would ask the present Minister to look into these cases now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special allowance was given for services rendered by people who did not qualify for pensions and it is the last Vote that any member of this House would wish to reduce.  On the occasion that my motion was passed, the then Minister, Deputy MacEoin, <Col N="884" /> and his predecessor were unanimous. I would ask the Minister to see to it, unlike his predecessor, that another Christmas will not pass without that motion being implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the appeal made by Deputy Gilbride. Very many who applied originally for service certificates were not awarded the certificates because the Army officers who were best acquainted with their service had been killed in the struggle or had died subsequently. These applicants continued during the years as people to whom the Act did not apply and now, in their declining years, when many of them have become very feeble and their health impaired by the service they rendered to their country, there is so much delay and investigation and difficulties of verification that many of them will pass to their graves without the allowance which would help them in their declining years.  It is very bad recompense for their services to the country.</P>
      <P>There is far too rigid an operation of the Act.  It is known locally by the officers that they were members of the Volunteer forces in those days and that they gave the necessary service to qualify for the special allowance. We are becoming more and more rigid every day.  The Pension Board, after a period of several years, inquires into small details and confuses the applicants for service certificates. How can every little detail of 1919, 1921 and all the rest be remembered now, and why should a little slip as to the date on which one thing occurred or another thing occurred be used to confuse the applicants or their witnesses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are far too rigid in that regard. If a man is not entitled to it, certainly he should not get it, but the local company officers, battalion officers and brigade officers are the best judges and, if they are prepared to testify before the board, that should be sufficient because people who have given such unselfish service to the country will not testify on oath to an untruth.  Very often, as has been said, the officers most intimately acquainted with the cases have long since died.  Other officers <Col N="885" /> are appealed to then who are, perhaps, not used to verifying.  Verification by the officers named in the application forms should be adequate, if they are prepared to certify.</P>
    <P>An applicant may get a form stating that the verification is being re-examined, that some officer or number of officers are being written to about it and that is all he hears about it for months.  These people may be in poor health, thrown on the world in misery, after all their years of service.  I would appeal to the Minister that, as a final gesture, we should be more generous in our treatment of the men who have served their country well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Gilbride and Deputy MacCarthy in making a plea on behalf of the applicants for the special allowance, the veterans of the War of Independence, men and women.  As the House is aware there are generally three conditions governing the awards of this special allowance.  The first is, of course, the medal or the certificate of service; secondly, there is the doctor's certificate; and, thirdly, there is the age of the applicant, if proof of disability is not required.</P>
      <P>In the past few months, I have come across cases of applicants for the special allowance who have been written to by the Department of Defence asking for reverification or stating that it was proposed to apply to the company or battalion officers for verification of the claim or the authenticity of the applicant who held a certificate of service or a medal.  The subjection of veteran Old I.R.A. men and members of Cumann na mBan to the indignity of reverification is something that the Department of Defence should be very much ashamed of.  I have written during the past week to the Minister on that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had high hopes of the former Minister for Defence, Deputy MacEoin, who was deeply interested in that subject, particularly as he assented willingly, years ago, to Deputy Gilbride's motion asking that these people be treated with justice and fair play. They have not got that so far.  I have hopes that the present Minister&mdash;a young man who carries the good <Col N="886" /> wishes of the House&mdash;will do something about it and that it will not be that he will give them too little when it is too late.</P>
    <P>Their ranks are being thinned out daily and I do not think that any member of this House would be happy if he saw one of those Old I.R.A. men spending his last few years in poverty because the Department of Defence would not wake up to its responsibilities and the duty it owes to the men and women of the Defence Forces, of Óglaigh na hÉireann, of Cumann na mBan and the Citizen Army and those who made freedom possible for us.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister in particular to reduce the age limit from 70 to 65 and to provide that any applicant who has a service medal, or a certificate, and who attains the age of 65 should not be required to submit medical evidence or a medical certificate.  If he has the other qualifications, he should automatically qualify for the special allowance.</P>
    <P>One other point to which I wish to refer is the disability allowance paid to the men who serve in our Regular Army.  I had occasion recently while in hospital to meet a man who joined the Army during the emergency and spent five or six years in it.  During that time, he sustained an injury for which he was treated and was discharged from the Army.  His old wound came against him again after ten or 11 years and he went back for treatment to the doctor who had treated him and who was a commandant in the Army Medical Corps at the time.  This ex-Army man mentioned his case to me and I wrote to the Minister for Defence explaining the situation to him.  I submitted a certificate from the doctors who treated this man, explaining the nature of his ailment and how it had cropped up again after so many years.</P>
    <P>I was horrified to learn that because he did not make an appeal within five years after leaving the Army, he was not to get a disability allowance.  That is a grave injustice and if it is necessary that legislation be passed to enable him to get it, I think it should be passed.  If a man receives a disability, he cannot say whether it will <Col N="887" /> recur five, six or seven years later and what the legislators had in mind when they specified the period of five years, I do not know.  If an injustice exists, it is up to our legislators to right it.</P>
    <P>I am sure this injustice has been repeated many times in the case of men who, in 1939 and 1940, answered the call to defend their country and who, at the time, were told that they were the cream of the earth.  Then in after years, when reduced as a result of a disability or incapacity sustained in the course of their Army career, they were told that the law of the land did not allow them to receive justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just renew my plea for a reconsideration of the disability pension for Army personnel of all ranks who contract tuberculosis?  As I said earlier this evening, the present position is that only officers, N.C.O.s and men who can prove that they contracted tuberculosis due to their service during the emergency period from 1939 to 1945 can claim disability pension by reason of tuberculosis.  When a man joins the Army, he surrenders himself absolutely to Army discipline and must live where he is told to live and must lie down in the wet when he is told to do so.  He must submit himself to hardships even during these days which may be just as severe as those experienced during the emergency days. I cannot see how the Army can evade its responsibility for the contracting of tuberculosis by any of its members. At the moment even if a man does contract tuberculosis or did contract tuberculosis during the emergency period, he has to prove to the satisfaction of the board that it was due to Army service.  It is always a mystery to me how anybody can prove that he contracted tuberculosis on a certain day or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the plight of many men who have applied for a service pension and who may have seemed to have had a very poor case on the written application, but who, if called before the board, would have a sounder case than that which appeared on the application form.  Year after year I meet many of these men and each year the numbers are growing less.  I should like the Minister to try to speed up the matter of the special allowances and also, in particular, cases of people who want to prove their cases before the board and who should get another chance.  There have been cases of people who could not get the necessary signature for their forms at the particular time.  Pensions that have been given to members of the Old I.R.A. are few and these men were, in no small way, responsible for enabling us to have our own Parliament to-day.  They contributed the major sacrifice and the fact is that many of them now in their dying years are in places and surroundings which are not suitable for patriots to die in. I hope the Minister will amend the Pensions Act so that these men will fare somewhat better in the future than they have fared in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The speeches made on this Vote mostly seem to deal with the same point and they were mainly about special allowances.  There were some other points made by other Deputies.  Deputy MacEoin asked a question regarding the recent changes of the personnel on the Referee's Advisory Committee under the 1934 Act.  These changes were made under Section 6, sub-section (2) (a) of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934.  I dealt with that matter in a reply to a recent question, but apparently Deputy MacEoin wishes to know under what section that action was carried out and I am now informing him. Under that section, members hold <Col N="889" /> office during the pleasure of the Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin also mentioned the question of the amendment it was proposed to introduce to extend the time for applying for special allowances.  It is hoped to introduce legislation shortly to extend the date for application for medals which would qualify certain people for special allowances. A number of other Deputies, Deputy Gilbride, Deputy MacCarthy and Deputy Carty, also asked that question.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilbride also referred to the reduction which took place in the number of special allowances awarded. Special allowances are reduced for either of two reasons.  The first is because there is a reduction in the appropriate annual sum under the Act.  For example, when the applicant reaches the age of 70 or his children reach the age of 18, the Act provides there shall be a reduction in either of those cases. The second reason for a reduction in the special allowances is if there is some improvement in the applicant's means.  If any Deputy believes that that has been wrongly administered in any particular case, he can always have, if he asks for it, a statement of the means taken into account in arriving at the decision to reduce the special allowance in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delays that take place in giving special allowances were mentioned by a number of Deputies.  Deputy Carty objected to the fact that it should be necessary for people, whom he described as veterans of the War of Independence, to submit to the indignity of having to produce reverification in respect of medals already awarded. This was decided upon because it was in fact discovered&mdash;and I think it was discovered first as a result of representations made by Deputies&mdash;that, in a number of cases, medals have been awarded to people who were not really entitled to them.  Originally the award of a medal did not carry any financial benefit with it and apparently the machinery for awarding them was not foolproof.  The result was that a number of medals were awarded which, it was subsequently found, should not have been awarded.  It was to <Col N="890" /> avoid wrongful expenditure of public moneys it was decided that, on the question of applications for special allowances, it would be necessary to have this reverification.</P>
    <P>I agree with that decision.  I think it is right that the expenditure of public moneys should be carried out only in accordance with the law&mdash;in other words, that public money should not be given to anybody who cannot prove satisfactorily he is entitled to it. I do not think there is any indignity in asking a man to establish the fact he is a person to whom the Act was meant to apply and that he is, in fact, entitled to be granted a special allowance.</P>
    <P>The investigation of claims for special allowances is carried out in three stages.  The first is that the applicant has to establish the fact he is a qualified person.  In order to do that all the officers of his company or battalion are written to for verification. It is in that first stage that the biggest delay occurs.  Unfortunately there is often considerable delay in getting these Old I.R.A. officers to reply to these queries.  Perhaps the reasons are those mentioned by some Deputies to-day, that some of these men are becoming old and dis-interested; that their memories are not as good as they used to be and they find difficulty in remembering details.  I certainly cannot think of any other way in which this verification could be carried out.  I believe it is right that these matters should be thoroughly verified before public money is spent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carty referred to these people as veterans of the War of Independence.  Surely it is only right that we should first of all establish that they are, in fact, veterans of the War of Independence before these special allowances are allotted?  I have every sympathy with people whose claims for allowances are held up in this way and I do everything possible to expedite them.  As I say, the biggest part of the delay is this step of verification.</P>
    <P>The second step is to establish the applicant's means.  This is investigated by means of the local social welfare <Col N="891" /> officer.  It is very rarely any undue delay occurs at this stage.  It is only in very difficult and complicated cases that delay occurs.  I know it happens sometimes but not very often.</P>
    <P>The third step is to establish whether or not the applicant is incapable of self-support by reason of permanent infirmity.  Providing he is under 70 years of age, it has to be established he is incapable of self-support.  That is done by the Army Pensions Board. They do not insist on the applicant travelling to Dublin.  They appoint local medical officers to examine the applicants.  Sometimes there are borderline cases and it is necessary for the board to arrange to have a series of tests carried out before they are finally convinced that the person is, in fact, incapable of supporting himself by reason of permanent infirmity. Surely it is only reasonable, since that is the condition on which these special allowances are granted, that the board should satisfy themselves on this point also?</P>
    <P>Those are the delays.  I do not know of any other delays that have occurred except in the establishing of these three steps.  Each of them is necessary and I do not think any of them are unreasonable.  Any delays that are alleged to be due to the board itself I will have investigated if I am notified of the details.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carty mentioned another point concerning injuries received in the Army which do not recur until after the person concerned has been more than five years out of the Army.  That is something of which I was not aware. I shall look into it and see what is the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth referred to disability pensions for people who contract tuberculosis in the Army.  Soldiers in the Army are insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  They qualify for the same benefits under the Social Welfare Acts as people outside.  With regard to officers, I have to draw Deputy Booth's attention to the fact that neither the Civil Service, nor the Garda have a similar provision to that which he suggests for the Army.  I do <Col N="892" /> not think the risk of contracting tuberculosis is any greater in the Army than in any other occupation.  In fact, it would be my opinion that Army life would make people more resistant to this disease than other occupations. Whether a special case can be made for this provision in regard to the Army as distinct from other occupations is a matter that will have to be gone into. Certainly I do not know that there is any special case to be made in that respect.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other point raised that requires an answer here.  Delays will be eliminated as far as possible, as far as I am concerned. However, any Deputies who have any influence with local Old I.R.A. officers would help considerably if they would impress upon them the necessity of replying, as soon as possible, to the Department's questionnaire in regard to medals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of reverification of the award of the medal, very often the officer who verified it originally and who, consequently, was most closely acquainted with the person, may be dead.  In other cases, there may be a complete change of address&mdash;old officers may have left the district.  If a man is applying for a position he can go to the parish priest and get a certificate of character and enclose that with his application, but a man who is asked for reverification cannot go to his old officers and ask them for a certificate.  That certificate is not accepted.  The Department will say that no officer would refuse such verification if asked for it.  Consequently, the Department may write to the officer and the officer may be missing.  Accordingly, there are delays and disappointments.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,863,700 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, and Miscellaneous Grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum which I have now moved to be granted together with the amount voted on account involves a net expenditure from the Vote for Local Government in the current year of £4,728,700.  The total shows a net decrease of £113,270 on the net amount voted for the year 1956-57, when account is taken of the Supplementary Estimate for that year which was voted last March.  That is the position as revealed by the figures prepared under the previous Administration.  I should, however, inform the House that I have provided for further savings of £500,000 in the Vote as I propose to administer it.  These savings comprise sums of £270,000 from sub-head (I) 2 and £230,000 from sub-head (K).  I shall explain the considerations affecting <Col N="894" /> these items later, but I may say now that the sum of £500,000 is offset by nearly three times that amount which the Government has authorised me to expend from the general capital pool over and above the amount previously estimated to be available for roads, housing and sanitary services.</P>
    <P>It is usual to review periodically the progress made in satisfying the post-war housing needs of the different areas.  The progress made to the 31st March last represented completion by local authorities of 72 per cent. of these needs.  A further 6 per cent. was in progress and 2 per cent. at the stage of entering into contracts.  Thus 80 per cent. of the total needs estimated to be required ten years ago, increased or modified by subsequent experience, have now been met or are in course of being met.  When we subdivide these figures we find that the county councils have in fact completed 96 per cent. of their housing needs; urbans (including Cork, Limerick and Waterford) 75 per cent.; and Dublin City 53 per cent. The number of dwellings in course of erection on the 1st April this year was 4,091 as compared with 6,017 a year before.  It will be of interest to the House if I read out the details of dwellings in progress on the two dates I have mentioned and also on the corresponding date in 1955.</P>

    <P>Deputies will see from the figures which I have given that, as pointed <Col N="895" /> out by my predecessor in introducing his Estimate last year, the position on 1st April, 1956, both as regards dwellings in progress and dwellings in tender was more satisfactory than at the corresponding date in 1955.  The position as at 1st April, 1957, is, however, less satisfactory in both categories than either in 1956 or 1955.  The decline in the volume of housing work being carried out by local authorities is, of course, to a considerable degree related to the fact that in a number of areas the needs on which the post-war housing programme had been based had been satisfied in full.  This is already the case in 23 county health districts and in 21 urban districts.  In 14 other urban districts the post-war housing requirements quoted in 1948 were found to have been inflated and the actual needs of those towns were satisfied by the provision of lesser numbers of houses, or were in course of being met in full at the end of the last financial year.</P>
    <P>There was, however, another factor contributing to the decline in activity as shown in the figures for 1st April last and that was the hold up, for financial reasons, of the commencement of new works between last summer and the spring of this year.  That has had the effect, not so much of considerably reducing the number of dwellings completed in 1956-57, as of diminishing those in progress and those ready to be undertaken now.  This in turn will probably have the effect of reducing the number of dwellings which we may expect to have completed in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>The global amount proposed to be provided for local authority borrowing is being increased to a figure which will be sufficient to initiate at successive stages in the present financial year the whole of the housing and sanitary services schemes which were held up at the end of the last financial year as well as some schemes at present maturing.  It will also enable local authorities to continue operations under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts and to meet commitments already entered into under these Acts and commitments already entered into in respect of Supplementary Grants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> I have also issued a circular letter to local authorities inviting them to submit their proposals in regard to future operations under these Acts within the increased provision which it has been found possible to make for financing such proposals.</P>
    <P>Since assuming office, I have recommended the issue of £1,340,000 to liquidate the obligations of local authorities outside the Cities of Dublin and Cork, to banks, to contractors and to persons awaiting payment of approved grants and advances for private housing.  The position in this regard is that local authorities may now apply in the normal course for instalments of approved loans to meet the firm commitments already entered into by them, according as these commitments become due to be discharged.</P>
    <P>As regards new works, it will be necessary to control the time of their commencement so that approvals to essential proposals now in hands and others accruing in the course of the year can be undertaken in progressive stages.  In furtherance of this arrangement, I have already approved the undertaking of new works to the value of £300,000.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation has built 15,822 dwellings in the last ten years&mdash; 11,816 cottages and 4,006 flats.  There was no practical alternative to the preponderance of houses on the outskirts of the city over the flats provided in the central city areas.  The essential problems confronting the corporation was the clearance of the slums.  Where it has been found possible to rebuild on the sites of slums only a small fraction of the original population could be rehoused there. Slum clearance was also essentially a thinning-out process.  The largest families had to be rehoused first and the others left there for the time being. This involved deferring the final clearance of the slum areas until the small families and single persons residing in them could be rehoused. That position is now being reached in some important sites in central areas. The housing committee of the city council are giving special attention to the problems inherent in the clearance of, and rebuilding on, these obsolescent <Col N="897" /> areas.  The pace of housing in Dublin, according as a higher proportion of the programme is concentrated in the erection of flats, may prove slower than it was when the major portion of the annual output of dwellings was being provided by the erection of cottages.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the sum of £2,000,000 provided in the Book of Estimates for grants under the Housing Acts has been reduced by a sum of £270,000 so that the net amount available for this purpose will be £1,730,000.  This amount is calculated to be sufficient to meet existing commitments in respect of grants already allocated but not yet fully paid and commitments that will arise during the present financial year on foot of new applications.  The total reduction of £440,000 in the provision for these grants as compared with the corresponding amount last year, less the saving in that year, has been found to be possible owing to the sharp decline, particularly in Dublin City, in the applications for new house grants.  In the first six months of the last financial year grants for new houses were allocated in respect of 2,560 houses as compared with 3,089 in the corresponding period of 1955-56.  In the second six months of 1956-57 the figures were 1,691 as compared with 3,006 in 1955-56, giving a total of 4,251 for 1956-57 as against 6,095 in 1955-56.  These figures alone show a manifest reduction in private enterprise housing in the last 12 months which will clearly affect the amount of building of this nature to be undertaken even if the financial and other factors affecting the position were to improve.</P>
    <P>The position as regards grants for reconstruction and repair and improvement is not so unsatisfactory.  The applications for grants of this kind for 1956-57 were in fact higher than for 1955-56.  I look forward to activities under this head improving still further in the present year and I consider it important that this should happen. These grants, the amounts and the scope of which were increased in the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1954, are an effective incentive to property owners to prevent the decay of houses which can be preserved and improved. <Col N="898" /> This is obviously good social policy and it also offers a ready means of activity and employment by builders, builders providers and manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Estimates for the payment of contributions to annual loan charges of housing authorities has reached formidable proportions.  It is placed at £1,835,000 in the current financial year as compared with £704,000 in 1949-50.</P>
    <P>New loans sanctioned for water and sewerage schemes totalled about £2,060,000 in 1956-57 as compared with about £2,095,000 in 1955-56.  Expenditure on these sanitary services schemes had been on a gradually rising scale up to the last financial year during which the commencement of a large number of schemes had to be temporarily deferred for the same reasons as those necessitating the hold-up in housing works.  By arrangement with the Minister for Finance additional capital funds are now being provided to enable these schemes to proceed.</P>
    <P>The loans sanctioned in 1956-57 included projects such as main drainage schemes in North Dublin City, Fox-rock, Killiney, Bishopstown, Lough and Togher, County Cork, and Mitchels-town, County Cork.  Major loans were also sanctioned for a regional water supply for Lough Mourne, County Donegal, and the provision of a reservoir at Ballinclea, Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>Road Fund income from motor taxation, etc., during 1956-57 amounted to £4,767,190 as compared with £5,085,600 for the year ended 31st March, 1956.  The decrease is primarily attributable to the effects of petrol rationing which put a number of cars off the road for a period at the beginning of the present calendar year and also resulted in a switch over to quarterly licences for the first quarter of this year.  The outstanding liabilities of the Road Fund at 31st March, 1957, in respect of road maintenance and improvement grants and other liabilities amounted to £4,212,000. These liabilities were left at this unduly high figure on the date in question owing to the abnormally low proportion of the grants which had been paid in respect of the allocations for the preceding financial years.  The <Col N="899" /> amounts of the payments in these years were low mainly on account of (1) the allocation of a special grant of £500,000 in 1955-56 in lieu of the National Development Fund allocations that had been made to supplement the Road Fund in preceding years; (2) the &ldquo;raid&rdquo; of £500,000 on the Road Fund in aid of the Exchequer in 1956-57.</P>
    <P>Road Fund income for the current financial year is estimated at £5,250,000 but fixed charges on the fund will reduce the estimated amount available for payment of road grants to approximately £4,787,000.  Payments in respect of the existing liabilities of the Road Fund to road authorities will be the first charge on that amount.  These amount to approximately £2,600,000. That leaves available for the payment of new grants a sum of only £2,187,000. Last year the grants allocated amounted to over £5,000,000.  If the same allocation were made this year the amount available out of the net resources of the Road Fund would be quite inadequate to enable a reasonable proportion of the allocations to be made in the financial year.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, as I found it, was that if reasonable interim payments were to be made to local authorities the total of new grants should not exceed £3,000,000&mdash;a reduction of £2,000,000 with a consequent drop in employment of up to 4,000 men. Neither an increase in the overdrafts of local authorities nor a further drop in the amount of employment afforded on road works would be desirable.  In these circumstances and after consultation with the Minister for Finance, the Government has agreed that the funds available for road works in the current year should be supplemented by a sum of approximately £900,000 to be made available from State capital and to be repayable from the Road Fund over a period of years.  This will enable the allocation for the current year to be maintained at the same amount as that allocated last year.</P>
    <P>The most important bridge construction work is the erection of the new bridge over the Slaney at Wexford. The contract was signed a year ago <Col N="900" /> and work on the construction of the new bridge is now in progress.  The estimated cost of the work is now £421,000.</P>
    <P>I have been inquiring about the present position in regard to that much-debated project&mdash;the proposed new bridge at Youghal; and I am informed that my technical advisers have the detailed plans for the structure under examination but that further technical data and detailed contract documents are required before finality is reached in the long history of the preliminaries to undertaking actual work in this case.</P>
    <P>The amount provided in sub-head K for grants towards the cost of schemes undertaken under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, is £400,000&mdash; the same as that provided for the past four years.  In three of those years, the voted provision was supplemented by grants from the National Development Fund amounting to £100,000 in each of the years 1953-54 and 1954-55, and by £250,000 in 1955-56.  The total grants allocated in 1956-57 amounted to £630,000, including a sum of £200,000 by way of supplementary allocation. The voted sum of £400,000 was supplemented by savings from another sub-head of the Department's Vote and by a Supplementary Estimate of £120,000 passed by this House last March.</P>
    <P>The accumulated liabilities to local authorities in respect of the Works Act grants allocated in the past amounted to £220,000 on the 1st April, 1957.  Payments in respect of these liabilities in 1957-58 are estimated at £170,000 which left only £230,000 to meet payments in respect of any new grants allocated.  I decided that, with the restricted capital resources available, I should advise the Government and the Minister for Finance that it was more advantageous to apply this small sum towards the increases in the allocations for housing and sanitary services than to allocate it amongst county councils and some urban district councils for new schemes under the Works Act.</P>
    <P>On this occasion I do not propose to go into any detailed review of the general administration of the Department or of local authorities.  The matters which I have already reviewed <Col N="901" /> constitute the major problems confronting me at the moment.  As every Deputy is aware these problems are in essence financial problems and mainly arise out of restricted capital.  The total net indebtedness of local authorities increased in the last financial year by about £11,000,000 and now stands at about £130,000,000.  As regards revenue, the total annual revenue expenditure of local authorities is now up to £50,000,000 and in the current financial year may increase to about £51.8 millions. This amount is estimated to be met by State grants amounting to £22.4 millions, rate receipts of £20.1 millions and miscellaneous receipts of £9.3 millions.  It is now a regular feature of local authority finance that a higher proportion of the expenditure is met by way of State grants than from rates.</P>
    <P>There was some decrease in the rates struck in several counties for the present financial year, but the average county rate which is calculated to be 36/2 shows a slight increase over last year's figure of 36/&ndash;.  The rate collection continues to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I wish to mention road traffic, not so much to make any statement of policy as to indicate that I am not unmindful of the amount of public attention that is focussed on the hazards of the roads. A new system of traffic signs was prescribed in regulations made by my predecessor on the 24th November last. The responsibility for providing them now rests with the road authorities in consultation with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  A new road safety booklet, entitled <i>Rules of the Road</i>, was also published by my predecessor and is being distributed free of charge to every person who got a driving licence within the past 12 months.  Preparation is also being made for a more comprehensive distribution. The copies to be placed on sale to the general public will be at a nominal price of 2d.  I am satisfied that these measures represent all that can be achieved administratively under existing legislation, so far as my Department is concerned, in the efforts to promote public safety and public convenience in connection with road <Col N="902" /> traffic.  I do not propose to make any comment on what further effective steps can be taken by way of legislation, as I have not yet had a full opportunity, since assuming office, of considering in a detailed manner the heads of legislation on this matter which it had been proposed to sponsor in the last Dáil, but which are not yet drafted in any complete form.  I want to apologise now for our failure to provide copies of this statement.  Our failure arose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The subject of road grants is a matter of considerable interest to me and to my constituents. I was alarmed to hear the Minister say this evening that there was to be a substantial cut in road grants.  I was put at ease when he said they would bring in £900,000 in order to keep the road grants at the same level as last year.  As reported at column 280 of Volume 157 of the Official Report, the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, then Deputy Blaney, asked the Minister of the day for information in respect of the amount allocated in each of the financial years 1953-54 to 1955-56 for (a) road upkeep and improvement <Col N="903" /> work, (b) tourist road grants, (c) special grants for bridge works, (d) grants for schemes, the technical aspects of which are administered through his Department, (e) the scheme for the improvement of roads serving E.S.B. turf-fired generating stations, and (f) the scheme for roads in Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>The answer to that question shows that my constituency fared very badly. In 1953-54 we got £137,000.  There are constituencies here which are not as highly valued as Waterford and which do not pay as much rates, and they got three times that amount.  How that figure was arrived at I should like to know.</P>
      <P>When we come to tourist grants we find that Cavan got £10,000; Clare £35,000; Cork £55,000; Donegal £55,000; Galway £55,000; Kerry £55,000; Leitrim £25,000; Mayo £55,000; Roscommon £25,000; Sligo £25,000; and Waterford got £5,000. We were down in the &ldquo;also rans&rdquo; there.</P>
      <P>When we come to schemes for the improvement of roads in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas we find that Donegal got £14,500; Galway £13,800; Kerry £5,000; Mayo £4,800; and Waterford got nothing.  The former Minister for Local Government told me that we had not got a Gaeltacht in Waterford.  Let me assure the present Minister that we have.  Ring is in Waterford.  Ring and the Helvic area is an Irish-speaking area.</P>
      <P>I come now to 1954-55, tourist road grants.  Cavan got £10,000; Clare £35,000; Cork £55,000; Galway £55,000; Kerry £55,000; Leitrim £25,000; Mayo £55,000; Roscommon £25,000; Waterford £5,000.</P>
      <P>Special grants for employment schemes&mdash;this is another interesting column&mdash;were: Cavan £1,250; Clare £255; Cork £1,500; Donegal £14,500; Galway £8,000; Kerry £6,250; Leitrim £2,500; Longford £1,000; Mayo £12,000; Roscommon £250 and Sligo £2,500.  Waterford gets pennies from heaven&mdash;£250.</P>

      <P>I am quite used to this Fianna Fáil blackguarding.  I am examining here how the road grants increased alphabetically: Cavan went up to £160,000 between the years 1953-56; Clare went up; Cork went up&mdash;but it is a big county; Donegal went up from £290,000 to £301,000.</P>
      <P>Evidently the purpose of this question was to embarrass the Minister of the day.  It was put down by a county man of his who seemingly thought that Donegal was not getting its share.  It looks to me as if the then Minister remembered where he came from, and he gave it the lion's share.  In Waterford we got £137,000 in 1953 and we got £136,000 in 1954; in 1955, we got £132,000.</P>
      <P>Now I should like the Minister to tell the House how these road grants are allotted.  On what basis is the calculation made?  How is it done?  Is it just by rule-of-thumb?  Is it allocated on mileage or, if a county has been good in striking a high rate for roads, is that county mulcted?  Does it not get a fair share of the grants?  Are the counties which have failed to do their duty and strike a high rate looked after in a special way?  If that is so, then it is better that it should be said now and that we should be told that that is definitely the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A rate of 11/&ndash; in the £ for roads was struck in my constituency last year and nearly the same rate was struck this year.  It cannot be said that the ratepayers <Col N="905" /> payers down there are not playing their part.  They have been doing that for years.  Hence I do not see why they should not get recognition from the Road Fund to which they contribute as much as, if not more than, many of the counties which appear to get special preference.  Last year, there was an increase in allocations for employment schemes in Waterford from £250 to £300.  I am sure they must have had a party in the county council when they heard of the extra £50 they were getting.</P>
    <P>With regard to schemes for the improvement of roads in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas, Waterford is time and again excluded.  I hope the Minister will consider this.  I should like to hear how this money is allocated.  Are special schemes to be put up and, if so, will the Minister consider them?</P>
    <P>There is a lot of work that should have been done over the years in Waterford.  One of the jobs that should have been done as far as tourist roads are concerned is to continue the road from the promenade in Tramore to the sandhills.  They are always threatening to do it, but they do not ever seem to get the money for it.  I consider that the Minister should give that matter his sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the traffic code.  Of course, reference was made on the Estimate for the Department of Justice to the enormous number of people killed on the roads.  I put down a question last week asking whether the Minister for Local Government would be prepared to institute legislation and the Minister said he was not quite ready.  I submit that the position is so alarming at the present time in relation to the enormous number of accidents on the roads in which people are killed that a Committee of the House should be got together to draft proposals for legislation in order to give us a safer traffic code.</P>
    <P>The traffic in Dublin seems to be &ldquo;haywire&rdquo; and the only people who appear to take any notice of the rules of the road or the safety of the public are the bus drivers.  The motorists are to blame in many cases, but I would say that on the whole cyclists are the greatest offenders.  The public do not <Col N="906" /> seem to realise that an enormous amount of traffic has come on the roads.  All kinds of transport have increased, motor cars, motor cycles and buses, and the happy-go-lucky way we have on the roads is no longer conducive to safety.  The figures are rather appalling.  The death of a dear one is a terrible blow indeed and the person killed may be the breadwinner, the mother of a family or perhaps a child.  In most of these cases, lives are lost through carelessness.  As far as we can see, our people are not prepared to take care on the road and legislation will have to be introduced quickly.  A code will have to be drawn up and rules brought in.</P>

      <P>Let me now come to the question of housing.  It was stated by a Deputy on the opposite side during Question Time last week that the previous Government were antagonistic towards housing.  If they were, they had a queer way of showing it, having regard to all the houses they built.  I hope the present Government will show the same &ldquo;antagonism&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister feels the same way as his predecessor.  There is no use talking nonsense about antagonism.  A big number of Deputies are members of local authorities and these local authorities, including the county managers, have consistently put up schemes quickly.  A really good job was done by the local authorities in submitting schemes to the Department and even though the Department sometimes held them up and sent back plans and specifications, on the whole the result was fairly good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the present Minister for Local Government meeting us in a very fair way.  He was very co-operative with us.  As a matter of fact, we had him down to open a scheme of <Col N="907" /> houses.  I would not think that is funny, Deputy Corry.</P>

      <P>We did all right with the other Minister, too, but he did not know about the roads at that time. I will not refuse to give credit to anybody in this House for having done some service.  The Minister served us very well when he was in office.  In Waterford, at the moment, we are asked to spread our housing schemes over a period of from three to four years, but the number of houses for the City of Waterford&mdash;170&mdash;that we are asked to spread over that period is very small.  Our plan was to build these in the one building season.  We are in a very good position in that we have a direct labour scheme which has been running successfully there for about six and a half years.  They have built exceptionally good houses considerably cheaper than the contract price.  They are still in action.  I am very happy to say they are about to finish their 500 houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be alarming for us in Waterford to have housing slowed up. I would bear with the Minister because some local authorities would rush into building houses just for the sake of building them although they might not have the demand for the houses.  We have the demand for houses within the City of Waterford. The demand has been consistent.  I have always been surprised, on making inquiries at the City Hall after a housing scheme had been let, to discover that the amount of applicants had not reduced.  As a matter of fact, after we let houses&mdash;up to about 200 houses on one occasion&mdash;the applications increased.  I could give many reasons for that.  One of the reasons is that, even though people complained that the rents were high, <Col N="908" /> or one thing or another, when they saw the houses the local council were building they considered them good value.  Working persons with a family who were living in flats, who were qualified to get houses, immediately put in their applications.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned his intention to find the same amount of money this year for housing reconstruction grants as last year.  That scheme has been very successful in the local authority of which I have the honour of being a member.  From reports I have read, I gather that the scheme has been adopted by people in various parts of the country with great enthusiasm.  I would, however, say to the Minister that people sometimes apply for a grant when they have only just so much money to do the job and they do the job.  Then, when the job has been completed and inspected, they get their grant.  Initially, they might have looked only for what would be two-thirds of the maximum grant. Later on, they might decide that it would have been much better if they had undertaken a bigger job and they might like to get the extra work carried out.  That is frequently the case in some of the old houses where the old roof would not be too good. I feel that where people can show that more work remains to be done and where, in the first instance, a full grant was not given in respect of the first work carried out, an exception should be made by the Department in allowing such people to do the full job and in giving them the balance outstanding in respect of the full grant.</P>
    <P>A complaint I frequently hear about housing reconstruction grants is that sometimes there is great difficulty in getting the money.  I have investigated that point myself.  I must say I received great co-operation from the Department, and, wherever possible, the matter was expedited.  I am convinced that one of the reasons for slowness in the payment of the grants is that there are not enough inspectors on the job to enable the inspections to be expedited.  We have one man who is supposed to do an enormous area.  It is very difficult to get him into the Waterford area sometimes when jobs are finished.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> I would impress upon the Minister that the majority of the people doing this work are not very wealthy.  As often as not, the contractors, too, are not rich men.  They would be small contractors and they would set about doing a small job.  The contractor would have to go to the local builders providers to get materials for the job and the man who is getting the job done might have only £100 which he would pay to the contractor.  The contractor, however, is waiting to get the grant&mdash;both the Local Government grant and the grant from the local authority.  That is where the catch seems to lie.  There seems to be great difficulty with many of these small contractors.  I know that that is not peculiar to my own constituency because other Deputies tell me they have the same trouble.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in order to expedite the payment of housing reconstruction grants and to have the whole matter put on a more business-like footing more reliance should be placed on the report of the local officers&mdash;the county surveyors, the assistant county surveyors or the borough surveyors or their assistants.  Where it is not possible for the Department's inspector to make the inspection within a fixed time, I feel that the report could and should be sent in by the inspectors or the engineers or the local authority. That would help to expedite the matter.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister and the <Col N="910" /> Department should have a check on these things but I think that that check could be covered by a general inspection.  I know that the Department's inspectors go to the various local authorities for a general inspection and I am sure that the houses that have been repaired under the reconstruction grants scheme could then be inspected by the Department's inspectors.  If, in their opinion, the local authority officers were not doing their inspection work properly they could shut down on that local authority and say: &ldquo;You will have to abide by the inspection of the Department's inspectors.  We will not accept your reports in future.&rdquo; That is something that must be dealt with because it is a great hardship on people who are short of money, especially at the present time.  I have two or three cases of people who have about £100 and who are more or less afraid to go on with the work because the contractor they would engage would not be a rich man and would ask them when they would be able to pay him the money.  They come to me and ask me if I can tell him when they will get the money.  That is something which neither I nor any other Deputy can foretell.  It is a six-mark question for us.</P>
