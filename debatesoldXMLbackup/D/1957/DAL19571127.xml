      <P>I would invite the Deputy's attention to my reply to a similar question addressed to me in this House on the 19th June last.</P>

We have, however, recently had a preliminary general discussion on the nature of the problem, and I hope now actively to pursue the matter to some definite conclusion.</P>

According to my information the address of the Irish and British Traffic Conference, to which I take it the Deputy refers, is 16 Westmoreland Street, Dublin.  I have no official information as to the composition of the Traffic Conference, which is a private organisation, but I understand that C.I.E., in common with the other railway companies concerned and with certain shipping companies engaged in cross-Channel services, are members of the conference.  I have received no published reports of the conference.</P>
      <P>Particulars of increases in cross-Channel freight rates are published by the conference in the daily papers as and when they are made.  As I have no statutory function in relation to shipping freight rates, I am not officially advised of alterations in such rates and I am not, therefore, in a position to give any authoritative information on the subject.</P>

Four companies engaged in the regular trade are registered in Ireland; 13 of the 15 vessels owned by these companies and operated on the regular cross-Channel services, are on the Irish register.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Agricultural Production Council which was established last year.  I have in mind to hold meetings of that council as and when the need for such meetings becomes apparent. Since the idea of an Agricultural Production Council was first conceived, however, certain changes have taken place.  In addition to the frequent meetings which are held on a variety of subjects with the various farming organisations, I am about to set up an advisory committee on the marketing of agricultural produce, on which the various organisations concerned will be represented.  In the case of bovine tuberculosis, special representative committees are being set up on a <Col N="1005" /> county basis, and discussions have also taken place with the Special Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Committee appointed by farming and rural organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened attentively and heard that the Minister had appointed a whole series of committees since the new Government took office, a harmless kind of activity, but is that any reason why the production council, representative, so far as I know, of all agricultural organisations in the country, should not be allowed to meet the Minister once a month, or once every two months, so as to hear what he has to say and to submit to him what they have to say about current problems, or does the Minister think that the idea of a production council is unnecessary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  My question is why will he not hold them at the regular intervals originally envisaged in the plan which was, in my time, once a month?  If that should prove too frequent for the present Minister could he not hold them once every two months?  The object was to allow a body representative of all agricultural organisations in the country to meet the Minister at regular intervals when they might put to the Minister what they wanted to put to him and so that <Col N="1006" /> the Minister might have an opportunity of discussing informally with them the topics that he wanted to discuss. My net question is: why has the Minister abolished the element of regularity in the meetings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that increasing numbers of earmarked cattle are being offered for sale in the Dublin market and in fairs and marts throughout the country, and, if so, if he will take action to prevent the reimportation of such cattle in the general interest of the live-stock trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to the Department of Agriculture does not suggest that there has been any significant increase in the numbers of &ldquo;ear-punched&rdquo; cattle imported recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, the export of &ldquo;ear-punched&rdquo; cattle from here to the Continent was prohibited prior to the 1st November, <Col N="1007" /> when the export restriction was removed following consultation with the National Farmers' Association and the National Executive of the Irish Live-stock Trade.  A close watch is being kept on the position, and, as was indicated in the announcement made by the Department of Agriculture at the end of September, it is intended, in any event, to review the whole position in the summer of 1958, in the light of the circumstances then obtaining and experience in the meantime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider sending observers from his Department to marts and fairs throughout the country?  They could then see that there is an increasing number of earmarked cattle being sold, in any case in my area, and from the information I have, in most other areas as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may note from the reply the matter is being kept under constant review.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Has the Minister's attention not been directed to the trade return published by the Central Statistics Office in respect of the first nine months of this year showing that imports of cattle have increased to about £3,000,000 worth?  What cattle does the Minister think these are? They are &ldquo;punched&rdquo; cattle coming in from Northern Ireland.  I think there may be a good deal of force in what the Minister is saying and what he is doing but surely the Minister must know that £3,000,000 worth of cattle have come in this year that never came in before.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will consider amending the Order relating to the movement of pigs so that such movement will be prohibited only within a radius of 40 miles of where an outbreak of swine fever occurs, as the present restrictions are detrimental to pig breeders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 49 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the ban reimposed recently on the movement of pigs other than fat pigs for slaughter and sows for mating is causing hardship in Connacht and elsewhere particularly to persons who have not the feeding or housing resources to keep numbers of pigs on their hands past a certain stage.  However, after a respite of some months swine fever again presents a grave threat to the pig industry. Urgent inquiries are on foot to determine the source of the latest outbreaks and the limits of possible spread of infection.  Until these inquiries are completed and all necessary combative measures taken, it is absolutely essential that pig movements all over the country be kept at a standstill as far as practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true, as Deputy Donnellan states, that no outbreak of swine fever has been confirmed in Connacht.  I should not, however, care to assume, as the Deputy does, that the disease is not likely to occur in that province.  In any event, as previous experience has shown, the confinement of movement restrictions to a particular area would not guarantee the continued freedom of any other part of the country from <Col N="1015" /> infection and dispersal of disease. Indeed, it might have the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputies that the present countrywide standstill will not be maintained any longer than is absolutely necessary.  My Department's efforts to deal with the situation would be greatly assisted and accelerated if everybody in the industry co-operated, first of all by observing the movement controls strictly and, secondly, by reporting any suspicious illness in pigs immediately to the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I think it is unnecessary to assure the Minister of our whole-hearted support for any measures he may take to deal with the situation, I should like to ask this question. Does he think it possible that undue emphasis is being placed on movement as compared with the urgency of the boiling of swill?  Perhaps not sufficient attention is being directed to the fact that this disease may be spread by the distribution of fragments of infected bacon or pork bones which are being introduced into swill buckets and thereafter fed to pigs without prior boiling. If this be the most pregnant source of infection, might it not be possible to lighten in some measure the severe restrictions on movement at present in operation if steps were taken to impose even a penalty on those who brought swine fever on to their premises due to their failure adequately to boil swill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the information I have does not quite bear out the Deputy's point.  Cases of swine fever have occurred where small pigs were removed 300 miles from one end of the country to the other.  The other day we had a very unfortunate outbreak down in West Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>East Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in East Cork.  As the Deputy knows that is very remote from the sources of swill but the Department's veterinary staff are fully engaged all the time on this problem. It is a problem that has occurred in other countries.  On the Continent <Col N="1016" /> they have given up hope of dealing with it by eradication measures as the disease appears.  They have adopted the system as in the case of foot-and-mouth disease of inoculating the animals against infection.  That would be disastrous in this country, if we should ever get to that stage.  I assure the Deputy that, as far as I can know, the movement of infected pigs from one area to another is the predominant source of infection with this disease. It is of the utmost urgency for the good of the pig industry, the bacon industry, that all movement of pigs is stopped by the voluntary effort of the farmers themselves and particularly of the pig dealers.</P>
      <P>The pig dealers have been traced as the greatest source of transport of this disease from one part of the country to the other.  I appeal to them and I ask Deputies to appeal to them and to use their influence with pig dealers and farmers to put up with this very severe restriction for a time until we get rid of the disease in order that we may not have to fall back upon a system of combating it which, in the long run, would be very disadvantageous to the pig industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Minister's reply that he applies the category &ldquo;swill&rdquo; only to such as may be collected from house to house for the purpose of feeding pigs.  Will the Minister not agree with me that &ldquo;swill&rdquo; has a very much wider connotation and involves any food fed to pigs even if it has been taken from the dining-room or the kitchen table of the premises where the pigs are kept?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not further agree that the person who is feeding nothing to his pigs but the swill coming from his own kitchen is under as great an obligation to boil it as the person who is collecting it promiscuously in the town?  The Minister may find that the public are not adverting to that situation and have not come to look upon the swill collected from their own kitchen as being just as dangerous as swill collected from door to door in town or city.</P>

      <P>Any swill, farmers' kitchen swill or any other swill, is a possible source of infection.  Sometimes these infected pigs escape into the bacon factories, despite precautions. Every farmer should be careful not to feed swill unboiled to his animals.  I hope they will co-operate and that the pig dealers will co-operate with the Department for some time until we get this matter under final control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, with a view to putting the pig industry on a more stabilised basis, he will consider the establishment of a semi-State company, on the lines of Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann, to run the industry; and if he will make a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, there are fundamental differences between the sugar beet and pig industries; in particular, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is primarily concerned with the home market, whereas the pig industry is greatly influenced by a highly competitive export market.  The principal factor that tends to cause instability in the pig industry here is the frequent and the sharp fluctuations in the prices obtainable for pigmeat on the export market.  With a view to offsetting the effects of these fluctuations and providing satisfactory prices for good bacon pigs on a long-term basis, an export price guarantee scheme for Grade A bacon has been in operation since May, 1956, and this scheme, under which minimum prices are guaranteed to producers for top-quality pigs, has brought about a very substantial measure of stability in producers' prices despite a disastrous decline in bacon prices on the export <Col N="1018" /> market in recent months.  It is debatable if some other arrangement would have secured better results, but, in any event, the whole question of the organisation of the pigmeat export trade will be examined by the committee which is being established to advise on the marketing of agricultural produce.</P>

      <P>In elaboration of the Minister's very full reply, is it not true that there has been a greater measure of stability in the price of Grade A pigs in this country during the past 18 months than in any other country in the world?  As a result of the stabilisation measures we have taken, is it not a fact that we are still able to pay, with a guarantee that the price will be maintained for six months from to-day, 235/- per cwt. for pigs at the factory when bacon is selling in London at 230/- c.i.f.?</P>

      <P>In view of the higher proportion of Road Fund grants being made available for county roads, re-classification of these roads as main roads would not be likely to achieve an acceleration in their improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment.  I pray the Minister to be as frank and as open as an angel.  Is it not so that a considerable part of the total road grants last year was in fact diverted from main road improvement schemes to county road improvement?  Is it the Minister's intention to maintain in this year the same proportion as was finally determined last year as between county and main roads?</P>

      <P>I have made exactly the same allocation from exactly the same amount of money as was made by my predecessor for 1956.  In 1956, some month or two after the allocation had been made, because of a number of difficulties that arose at the time, there was some effort to divert Road Fund grants to county road improvement but that was really done with the intention of saving somewhere in the neighbourhood of £250,000, which did not in fact result but the intention in doing so was to save money, not by way of indicating a change of policy.</P>

Does the Minister propose to pursue the allocation scheme on that basis of trying to multiply the employment in the rural area on the county roads while at the same time giving the local resident that slight degree of preference over the transient motorist?</P>

There was an allocation of £400,000 for tourist roads, an allocation of £150,000 for bridges and an allocation of £150,000 to county boroughs, making an allocation of £5,000,000.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,800,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for certain Transport Services; for Grants for Harbours; for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1952, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933); for certain Protective Equipment for Ships; for certain payments in respect of Compensation, including the cost of medical treatment (No. 19 of 1946); and for the Coast Life Saving Service.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the main Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce made provision for C.I.E. to the extent of £2,846,300. Of that sum £793,300 was voted to repay to the Central Fund advances made to meet interest on transport stock and £803,000 was voted to repay to the Central Fund advances made last year in discharge of guaranteed bank borrowings.  The amount provided in the Estimate to meet the cash needs of C.I.E. was £1,250,000.</P>
    <P>As I stated during the debate upon the main Estimate, that sum of £1,250,000 was calculated to be sufficient to meet the cash needs of C.I.E. until the autumn of this year.  The Estimate was apparently prepared by the previous Government on the assumption that action on the Report of the Committee on Internal Transport, which had not then been received, could nevertheless be so effectively taken that no more money would be needed by C.I.E. this year. I find it hard to credit that the previous Minister for Finance seriously believed in that possibility.  I know that the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce did not.  The real explanation is that the requirements of C.I.E. were considerably underestimated. Deputies therefore will not be surprised at the appearance of a Supplementary Estimate although they may be surprised and perturbed by the amount of it.</P>
    <P>It is now calculated that the total <Col N="1044" /> additional cash needs, over and above the £1,250,000 already voted to C.I.E. to the end of the year, are £2,376,000. £2,000,000 of that requirement is now being sought in this Supplementary Estimate.  The balance of £376,000 will be met by temporary borrowings and carried over to next year.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. losses are mounting every year.  Their losses, after counting all charges, in 1954-55 amounted to £867,000; for 1955-56 they were £1,625,000; for 1956-57 they were £1,723,000, and it is now estimated that C.I.E. losses this year will be about £2,000,000.  If the operating expenditure of C.I.E. should be further increased&mdash;and we cannot ignore that possibility&mdash;then the losses in this year would be considerably more and next year they would be greater still if nothing is done about it.</P>
    <P>The railway undertaking of C.I.E. continues to lose traffic.  Total receipts from rail freight in the last financial year, 1956-57, declined by £137,000 on the previous year notwithstanding&mdash; and this is the important fact which Deputies must keep in mind&mdash;a 10 per cent. increase in rates brought into operation last year.  Rail passenger receipts increased by £105,000, due to the higher fares applied, but that increase in total receipts conceals a 7 per cent. decline in the number of passengers carried.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the experience of last year and this year that C.I.E.'s railway rates and fares are at saturation point if indeed they are not already beyond it.  Further increases in these fares would not produce any further revenue.  Indeed further increases could well operate to reduce revenue by causing a severe loss of traffic.  If C.I.E. is faced with higher operating costs there would be no way of meeting those higher costs except by cutting down the scale of its operations.</P>
    <P>These facts and figures give the measure of our present transport problem.  From the day it was set up as a public owned undertaking by an Act of the Dáil in 1950 until the end <Col N="1045" /> of this financial year, C.I.E.'s losses will have totalled over £12,500,000 and the rate of loss is increasing.  I stated, when speaking on this topic during the debate upon the main Estimate earlier in the year, that it was obvious important decisions affecting transport policy could no longer be postponed. The heavy and mounting losses from railway operations by C.I.E. were proving that there was a need for a re-examination of policy and for decisions about future policy.</P>
    <P>It is to be recognised that the subsequent developments affecting the G.N.R., the decision of the Belfast authorities to terminate the agreement for the joint operation of the G.N.R., would have forced a re-examination of transport policy in any event.  Deputies are aware, however, that in April of this year there was published the Report of the Committee on Internal Transport&mdash;the Beddy Committee as it is usually called from the name of its chairman.  That report aroused widespread interest.  Comments upon the recommendations contained in it were received from many national organisations which were exceedingly helpful.</P>
    <P>The national bodies who submitted reasoned representations were: The Provisional United Trade Union Organisation, The Save-Our Railways Association of Cork, the Public Transport Development Association, the National Executive of the Irish Live-stock Trade, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the National Fish Industry Development Association, Bord Fáilte Éireann, the Irish Tourist Association and the Licensed Road Transport Association. In addition, a very large number of submissions, 66 in all, were received from local councils, local development committees, private firms and individuals.</P>
    <P>All of these submissions have been very carefully studied.  Most of them, I think all of them, contained protests against any proposals to curtail the railway system or against the closing of a particular section of line or a particular station.  But I regret to say that very few, if any, gave any assurance of local effort to expand railway traffic either generally or on the particular line or through the particular <Col N="1046" /> station to which the representations referred.</P>
    <P>I indicated on the occasion of the introduction of the main Estimate that I would make a statement before the end of the year on the decisions at which the Government had arrived. This Supplementary Estimate has been introduced now to make that statement possible.  In considering what could be done about the situation the Government had, of course, in mind its stated aims in so far as transport policy was concerned.  The Government have declared that its purpose is to maintain the publicly-owned transport undertaking for freight and passengers.  The Government consider that both social and economic considerations require a decision against leaving the general availability of public transport facilities for freight and passengers to a number of private operators.</P>
    <P>It considers also that if one Statewide service is to be accepted as the more efficient method of providing transport facilities, it is impracticable to revert to private ownership even if desirable.  The question which is in the forefront of all examinations of transport policy is, however, the part that railways can play in public transport facilities.  The Government accept &mdash;and I think all Deputies and all local councils and committees who have been making representations must accept&mdash; that a decision to maintain railways requires justification in view of the very heavy losses involved in their maintenance.  I mean by that that those who argue for the retention of the railways must accept the burden of proving that that is the best policy. Furthermore, it must be emphasised that no decision to maintain the railways can be unqualified.  We can deal now only with the circumstances that we see or can reasonably anticipate in the future.  A decision affecting the railways cannot, therefore, be binding in the unknown conditions which may prevail ten or 15 years ahead.  For myself, Deputies will be aware that I have always contended&mdash;and the Government agree&mdash;that the arguments in favour of the retention of the railways are strong if the losses which have been experienced in the operation <Col N="1047" /> of the railways could be minimised or eliminated.</P>
    <P>I believe that but for these losses and the public attention which they obtain, the railways would be recognised as the most efficient and the cheapest method of handling traffic; that it would be accepted that from the point of view of the national economy their retention was desirable. It is, in my view, unfortunate that the advantages of maintaining the railways should be obscured by the deplorable financial results which have attended their operation.  I mean by that, that, in my view, the problem we have to deal with in this connection is financial rather than technical.  The view which is sometimes expressed that railways are obsolete is, so far as I know, not accepted in any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>There is also another aspect of the matter which I think requires to be stressed.  The capital expenditure in which the country would be involved if the railways were scrapped would be very considerable.  The total carrying capacity of C.I.E.'s rolling stock&mdash; its passenger carriages and freight wagons&mdash;is fully utilised at some period every year.  There are occasions, perhaps lasting only for a day, perhaps lasting for longer, when in order to meet the traffic needs of the country all C.I.E.'s passenger carriages are in use.  There are other occasions when all their freight-carrying wagons are in use.  If, therefore, we have in mind scrapping the railways and substituting road services with equivalent carrying capacity, then we have to contemplate a capital outlay on road vehicle equipment amounting to about £12,000,000.</P>
    <P>That is C.I.E.'s estimate.  That estimate has been questioned by the Beddy Committee.  They did not question the accuracy of the calculation but they questioned the need to provide on the roads carrying capacity equivalent to that now available on the railways.  It is that aspect of the matter which must necessarily concern us and indeed the Committee on Internal Transport disclosed in their comments on it that they also entertained <Col N="1048" /> considerable anxieties about it.</P>
    <P>So far as freight is concerned there is a number of views from different commercial interests as to the practicability of maintaining business at its present volume without the convenience of railway transport.  In that connection I should, however, draw particular attention to the representations received from the National Executive of the Irish Live-stock Trade who said that, in their view, the clearance of large fairs even at the present time caused some concern, but C.I.E. was always most careful to overestimate rather than underestimate the number of wagons necessary to clear every fair.  They went on to say that it was difficult to see how the big provincial fairs could be operated by road services only.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, mainly in regard to passenger traffic, however, that the problem of handling peak loads appears to be almost insuperable without the facility of railway operation. The view has been strongly argued that it would be impossible to provide road services capable of meeting the peak requirements of the tourist trade and the occasional peaks of special excursions and pilgrimages.  An Bord Fáilte said in their representations that having regard to the vital importance of tourist earnings in the national economy and the obligations of the board to promote expansion they would be greatly perturbed by any proposal involving abandonment of the railways.  The Irish Tourist Association said that, in their view, visitors would be reluctant to come here for holidays if the country was denuded of its railway services even to the extent suggested by the Transport Committee.  I think we are all aware that any failure to meet peak requirements for passenger traffic even on one single day always provokes large public outcry.</P>
    <P>We must also have regard to the number of people who are employed in railway operation.  On the C.I.E. and G.N.R. services within the area of this State 14,000 workers are employed on the railways.  It has been argued that the substitution of road services for rail services would not mean any reduction <Col N="1049" /> in the total employment.  I do not believe that argument would stand up to critical examination, first, because of the fact that the workers employed in railway operation cannot be regarded as fully occupied; secondly, because the kernel of our problem is the existence here of an excess of transport facilities.  But even if the argument could be shown to be sound&mdash;the contention that the substitution of road services for rail services would mean no reduction in total employment&mdash;nevertheless it is obvious that there would be very considerable dislocation with disturbing social consequences.</P>
    <P>There is another practical business consideration which I want to put before the Dáil.  The operating cost of substituted road services would be higher.  C.I.E., in their submission to the Committee on Internal Transport, estimated that it would cost £11,000,000 per year to operate road services with a carrying capacity equivalent to that of the existing rail services and when we consider that figure of £11,000,000 as the cost of operating the substituted road services we have to take into account that the total cost of operating railway services is £8,000,000.</P>
    <P>For these reasons the Government have reached the decision that we must try to preserve railways as an integral part of the national transport system. The aim of the policy measures upon which we have now decided, or other measures which may be approved in the future, will be to make effective that decision to maintain railways as an integral part of the national transport system by reducing the gap between the revenue and the cost of railway operation and thereby to make the whole of the national transport undertaking capable of paying its way.</P>
    <P>There is a relevant consideration which influenced the Government's decision and which should, I think, influence the decision of the Dáil.  That is that the rolling stock and permanent way of the C.I.E. system are now in very good condition.  The 1953 re-equipment programme is completed or all but completed.  The railway organisation of C.I.E. is well equipped by any standards and should, therefore, <Col N="1050" /> be capable, under suitable conditions, of achieving the economical operation.</P>
    <P>The question, therefore, to which the Government directed its main attention was whether rail losses could be eliminated and that, I suggest to the Dáil, is the key question with which it also must concern itself.  There are important factors which Deputies should keep in mind in that connection. The first is that the railways are finding it impossible to attract new traffic at their present rates of charge. The C.I.E. board say that if they could increase the traffic available to the railways by 30 per cent. the whole financial problem would be ended and the aim of the Government achieved.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that, without some very considerable changes, that aim is unlikely to be realised.  Wages are the predominant factor in operating costs.  Fifty-six per cent. of the total receipts from railway operation is paid out in wages in the case of C.I.E. and in the case of the G.N.R. the percentage is even higher.  The C.I.E. board contended in their submission to the Transport Committee and in their representations to me that the rail services now operated could be maintained without any losses in efficiency with 30 per cent. fewer workers employed on their operation.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed the view that this financial problem of C.I.E. railways, the closing of this gap between their revenue and their operation costs, cannot be solved by any increase in the cost of rail services&mdash; by any further raising of rail rates or charges.  The experience of 1956 shows that these charges are already too high.  The full significance of what happened in 1956 should be realised. These charges followed on the additional cost to C.I.E. of railway operations consequent upon the 1955 round of wage increases.  C.I.E. aimed to offset the higher wage cost by increasing their rates and fares.  Instead of getting more money they got less money.  All the indications are that in the process of offsetting the rising costs by higher charges we have reached the end of the road.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this financial <Col N="1051" /> problem that I should, perhaps, deal with now.  There is, I know, a popular belief that the financial difficulties of C.I.E. are due mainly or entirely to the continued operation of branch lines.  All the information available to me would make it quite clear that the elimination of branch line operations would not make any appreciable difference to C.I.E.'s financial problem.  The C.I.E. board tell me that there are 22 branch, link and secondary lines and that all these branch, link and secondary lines between them lose £100,000 per year. That loss on these lines has to be related to the overall loss of £2,000,000 on the operation of the whole system. Against that loss of £100,000 per year on branch line operation, the board claim that these branch lines contribute traffic to the system worth over £800,000 per year.</P>
    <P>It is true that substituted road services could probably keep that contributory traffic but only at a higher operating cost.  In saying this I do not want to be taken as giving all the branch lines of the C.I.E. system a reprieve.  Some of them, I think, have no economic justification whatever. The C.I.E. board told me that they were proposing this time last year to institute proceedings to close down a number of branch lines but held their hand when the Committee of Inquiry into Internal Transport was set up.</P>
    <P>There are some other considerations bearing upon transport policy to which, I think, I should direct attention before going on to deal with the recommendations in the report of the Beddy Committee and the decisions which the Government have taken on these recommendations.  The first is that this country, in the present state of its economic development, cannot afford to be handicapped by an inefficient or unduly costly transport system.  The consequences of trying to maintain an inefficient or unduly costly system may not be immediately apparent.  We may not be able to pinpoint the advantages we are losing, such as the numerous employment opportunities that would open up for our people if that handicap could be taken away.  To try to preserve <Col N="1052" /> an inefficient and costly transport system for the sake of the employment which it gives would be a very shortsighted policy.  It would operate to deprive far more people of the prospect of employment than the number of jobs it would preserve.</P>
    <P>The House is aware&mdash;this Supplementary Estimate brings it very forcibly to their notice&mdash;that existing losses from the operation of the C.I.E. railways are met from taxation and that taxation imposes burdens upon other economic activities and restricts their growth and employment.  The losses on the C.I.E. railways and the resulting tax burdens are helping to produce amongst important sections of our people what I could describe as an anti-railway mentality&mdash;an outlook which could very easily build up into a demand to end the railways.</P>
    <P>That significant development of recent years is something which all concerned, both management and workers, would be well advised to take heed of.  If we cannot, by our joint efforts&mdash;by making such legislative and administrative changes as appear to be desirable&mdash;bring down the losses on railway operation, then it is certain that the railways cannot be preserved for any length of time.  It was in the light of all these facts and considerations, as well as of the recommendations in the report of the Beddy Committee, that the Government took its decisions.</P>
    <P>I should say a few words about the committee.  It was composed of people who have established reputations for efficiency, competence and sound judgment in the particular spheres in which they occupy themselves.  It is true that none of them had any previous experience in the operation of internal surface transport.  The committee were set up with what I have already described as the impossible assignment of reporting within three months.  They were not able to do so. They reported in eight months and, even then, they indicated in their report that they had not got time to carry out many of the inquiries which they thought to be desirable or to seek information which they thought would be helpful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> I want to pay a tribute to the work done by the members of that committee. They gave their time and their energy to the committee and to the preparation of its report, without stint.  I think it is true to say that, notwithstanding the limited time available to them, they produced a very comprehensive and informative report.  I would describe it as the best of the very many reports upon our transport problem which have appeared in the lifetime of this State.  Nevertheless, I think it is only right to say that the report has been criticised, and severely criticised, by many of the people who commented on it.  It was criticised by the C.I.E. Board both in respect of its recommendations and in respect of its interpretation of the information supplied to it.  It was criticised by the executive of the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation and, indeed, by many of the national and local organisations which sent submissions to me.</P>
    <P>It was alleged in these criticisms that some very important considerations were left out of account by the committee and that, as I said, the wrong interpretation was put upon many of the facts brought to their notice.  Nevertheless, the Government have decided that, in the main, the recommendations in the report are soundly based, and, with some important modifications which I will outline, should be implemented.  I want, straightway, to interpret that decision so as to avoid a misunderstanding of it.  It is not to be taken as implying acceptance of the specific recommendations in the report relating to the reduction of the mileage of line or the number of stations and certainly not as accepting the pattern of the future railway system of C.I.E. which is indicated in the map published on page 186 of the report.  It is that part of the committee's report which was, perhaps, most strongly criticised by the C.I.E. Board as having been based upon insufficient data of operating experience and lack of appreciation of the value of contributory traffic.</P>
    <P>I think the committee's recommendations in that regard have generally been misunderstood.  They had not in <Col N="1054" /> mind making the attempt to specify the sections of line or the stations which should be closed down.  They gave their views in that regard by way of illustration only and would, I think, agree with the view that the actual implementation of any such policy could only be undertaken by those who had day-to-day administrative responsibility and access to all the relevant facts.</P>
    <P>It may be that in the course of time, some picture of the C.I.E. rail system will eventually emerge which will have some resemblance to the map published in the report, but I feel that nobody is at this time equipped to dogmatise on that point.  Experience in the operation of these lines with the new and more economical equipment now available is only now being gained.  Consequently, it is too soon to assume that all the information that should inspire decisions is available.</P>
    <P>The Government's view is that the responsibility for taking decisions on the reduction of railway services, on the closing of particular sections of line or on the shutting-down of stations, must rest upon the board of C.I.E.  It is proposed, however, to give the board a statutory direction in a new Bill which I shall be submitting to the Dáil early next year&mdash;a direction which will be subject to its existing statutory obligation to operate the whole of the undertaking entrusted to it without loss, a direction to keep open railway lines and railway stations and to maintain railway services unless they are satisfied that there is no prospect of economical operation within reasonable time.  Subject to that statutory obligation, the board will be empowered to close down any line or any station or to withdraw any service for which they consider there is no future on their own decision and without having to seek the prior approval of the Transport Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The board, because of the statutory direction which it is proposed to give them, will be predisposed to maintain railways but they will have, nonetheless, this general statutory compulsion to avoid losses.  What, therefore, we are saying in effect to the merchants <Col N="1055" /> and all the towns which may be affected by any decision taken in future by the board and to all the local development committees and local councils which have made representations on this matter is that the lines and the stations in which they are interested will be kept open if there is sufficient business generated at them to justify it or if there is any reasonable prospect that sufficient business will ever be generated to justify their retention.</P>
    <P>In a sense, therefore, it will be a matter for each local community to decide for itself whether it wants to keep in operation the railway line that serves it.  We are aware that many traders in the country want the railway there as a sort of standby service to be used by them if their lorry breaks down or if they have a temporary addition to their business which they cannot handle with their own organisation. Well, we cannot keep a railway going on that basis.  The only prospect of preserving many sections of the line and keeping open many stations is that there should be created in those areas the prospect of sufficient business to justify the C.I.E. Board taking the decision to maintain them.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that the fulfilment of this policy which I am outlining depends almost entirely upon the quality and the character of the C.I.E. Board.  The committee, as Deputies are aware, made recommendations for the reconstitution of the board.  These recommendations are still under consideration and the Government has not yet taken decisions on them.  It is obvious that a strong and competent board is essential.  We recognise that the reconstruction of the board would probably be unavoidable when the G.N.R. terminates and the amalgamation of the section of the G.N.R. in our area with C.I.E. is being effected.  Whatever decision upon the character of the board, having regard to the committee's recommendations, which the Government may take will be expressed in the legislation which I foreshadow.</P>
    <P>So that C.I.E. will have no compulsion <Col N="1056" /> to maintain any line or any station which can never produce enough business to justify it, it is proposed to relieve C.I.E. of the present statutory obligation to provide a substitute road service whenever they close down a line or withdraw a service or close a station.  That decision to relieve C.I.E. of that existing statutory obligation involves, however, the further decision to give licences to private operators or to extend the existing licences held by private operators to provide a service for freight or for passengers wherever C.I.E. decides not to provide one.</P>
    <P>The committee reported that C.I.E. is gravely handicapped in its efforts to expand traffic by the retention of what are called the common carrier obligation and other obligations which are expressed in a number of very old Acts, all of which had their origin in circumstances which no longer exist. It is proposed to relieve C.I.E. of these obligations entirely.  C.I.E. will be put thereby in a position to pursue an aggressive commercial and rates policy. It will have under the new legislation a general obligation to meet public transport needs in a fair and satisfactory manner but no other obligation.</P>
    <P>It may be decided to have a system of appeal&mdash;probably the Transport Tribunal could well be preserved for this purpose&mdash;to decide upon allegations of undue discrimination.  I think, however, that I should make it clear that it is proposed to give C.I.E. the right to discriminate, the right, for example, to quote one merchant a lower rate for the carrying of his goods on the basis of getting the whole of his trade, than they quote another merchant for the carriage of the same goods if that merchant was prepared to give the C.I.E. only the fag ends of his trade.  That commercial adaptability will, it is believed, give C.I.E. the opportunity of winning back some of the traffic which the rigidity of its existing obligations caused it to lose.</P>
    <P>The capital liability of C.I.E. will be reduced by transferring to the Exchequer the interest and repayment obligations in respect of £11.6 million of transport stock and by remitting its <Col N="1057" /> obligation to pay interest on advances made to it to meet transport stock interest up to March, 1958.  I have already mentioned that C.I.E., since its establishment in its present form in 1950, has lost £12,500,000.  What in effect that decision means is that its losses are being wiped out and will no longer be carried as a capital liability on the undertaking.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, emphasise that the position of the stockholders is not affected in any way by that decision. Everybody, I think, realises that their security for the payment of their interest and the ultimate repayment of the capital was the State guarantee attaching to the stock.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, recognised by the Government that, notwithstanding that reduction in capital liability and the other changes that I have mentioned, C.I.E. could not quickly adapt itself to methods of working which would eliminate losses and thereby eliminate the need for subsidy.  The Government have decided, therefore, to provide a subsidy by way of a fixed annual sum given as a grant-in-aid for a period of five years.  C.I.E. will be expected to work within the limits of what it can earn, the limits of its own revenue, plus that subsidy during that period and thereafter to achieve a position which will enable it to carry on without subsidy.</P>
    <P>The amount of subsidy required has not yet been determined.  It is obvious that a very detailed examination of the position of the undertaking and its future financial prospects will be needed and there will necessarily have to be consultation with the board following the announcement of that decision.  That decision does not imply, either, that the Government have any expectation that C.I.E.'s railway losses can be entirely eliminated in a few years.  Indeed, any such conclusion would be entirely unrealistic.  There are very few railway undertakings in the world making profits or even breaking level but the obligation on C.I.E. will be to put the whole undertaking at least on a break-level basis and that must involve a very substantial reduction of losses on railway operations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> The Government gave very full consideration to the alternative proposal put forward by the C.I.E. Board.  C.I.E.'s proposal for solving this problem of railway losses was to impose such restrictions upon private freight road transport as would force back on to the railways the necessary additional volume of traffic.  That proposal was considered by the committee and the observations of the committee on it are contained in their report.  The Government accept the view of the committee regarding these proposals.</P>
    <P>It is our opinion that whatever temporary advantage further and drastic restrictions upon private road freight operations might bring to C.I.E., these restrictions would not provide any permanent solution of C.I.E.'s problem, and we are convinced that such a decision would in time build up pressure of public opinion for the termination of the railways altogether.  Nevertheless, it is essential, and the Government accepts that it is essential, that illegal haulage for hire should be eliminated.  We are all, I think, aware of the extent to which the aims of existing road transport legislation are being defeated by the practice of illegal haulage.  We believe that that can mainly be eliminated by administrative measures which are under consideration.  However, we are accepting the recommendation of the committee for minimum fines and for the non-application of the Probation of Offenders Act in respect of second and subsequent convictions.</P>
    <P>In the event of the agreement relating to the G.N.R. being terminated&mdash;and as the House is aware, we have been told that it is the intention in Belfast to terminate it&mdash;then the parts of the Great Northern system within this State will be amalgamated with C.I.E.  It is not necessary at this stage to elaborate upon that aspect of our problem.  It is obvious that very many problems of detail will arise in bringing about that amalgamation, but there are already joint working parties set up to deal with these details.  They have indeed been working now for some months so that most of the <Col N="1059" /> problems have been isolated and action towards dealing with them is in progress.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with the position of railway workers.  The House is aware that under existing legislation relating to C.I.E. there is a right to compensation given to every worker who loses his employment or whose conditions of employment are worsened by reason of the closing down of railway lines, the withdrawal of services or because of the dieselisation programme. It was never expected that these provisions would be called into play to deal with any general reorganisation of the C.I.E. system.  In the case of the dieselisation programme, the insertion of compensation provisions was largely an assurance to railway workers, because no redundancy was anticipated, and I do not think that in fact any redundancy arose.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that the proposals for legislation which will be produced will provide for compensation based upon these existing statutory scales but subject to abatement where a displaced worker finds full-time employment either with a Government Department, with a local authority or with a State-sponsored body.  It will provide also that the compensation will continue, where it takes the form of a pension, until the worker reaches 65 years and make the necessary arrangements to ensure that a worker receiving a compensation pension will remain in credit under the pension scheme and qualify at 65 to receive the full retirement pension.</P>
    <P>I mentioned here during our discussion last week that the compensation provisions for the G.N.R. workers employed in railway operation are far less generous and far more restrictive in their scope than in the case of C.I.E. The G.N.R.  Act of 1932 was, as the House will remember, an agreed Act. Legislation in identical terms was passed simultaneously here and in Belfast.  Under that Act, only workers who were directly employed on the terminated service have a right to compensation.  Legislation which we will introduce will make provision <Col N="1060" /> applying the C.I.E. compensation provisions to all G.N.R. workers transferred to C.I.E. employment.</P>
    <P>In the event of a general reorganisation it is possible that the cost of these compensation measures will prove very considerable.  The Committee on Internal Transport estimated that the full implementation of their proposals would involve compensation payments amounting in the aggregate to about £8,500,000, starting at around £500,000 per year and continuing on a somewhat diminishing scale thereafter.  The committee recommended that in order to make funds available to pay that compensation, there should be a levy charged upon existing motor vehicle duties.  The arguments which they advanced in support of that proposal for a levy on motor vehicle duties are set out in the report.</P>
    <P>The Government have, however, rejected that proposal.  We consider it to be objectionable on very many grounds, but we recognise that C.I.E. revenues cannot be burdened with the cost of compensation.  They are not capable of supporting it, and to give workers a right to compensation against an employer who has not money to pay it would be an unjustifiable procedure.  We have decided, therefore, that there should be set up a special fund from which compensation will be paid, and which will be financed by annual contributions from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>What is to be the position of workers who lose their employment, not because of any decision to close a line, withdraw a service or because of the dieselisation programme, but merely because the volume of business available to the C.I.E. railway system continues to fall?  The existing legislation provides for compensation for a worker rendered redundant through the withdrawal of a service or because of the deiselisation programme. I have been trying to emphasise that the real problem confronting us, the real kernel of our transport crisis, is the continuing decline in C.I.E. revenue because of the continuing decline in the volume of traffic available to it.  The aim of policy must be to make possible the <Col N="1061" /> recovery of that traffic by the reduction of freight charges.  I have mentioned already that the C.I.E. Board estimate that 30 per cent. of the workers employed on the operation of the railways in its system are surplus to actual requirements.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised my view that part of the problem of railway rehabilitation is how to reduce the present high level of costs.  This is a problem which I should like trade unions catering for railway workers to consider.  It is my view, and I have expressed it before on many occasions, that the whole atmosphere surrounding railway employment would be improved and a feeling of security of livelihood given to railway workers if this problem could be solved.  I therefore believe that it is in the interests of the workers, and particularly those who advise them, such as the trade union leaders, to consider how it can be solved.  I appreciate that the scheme of compensating workers who lose their employment on a scale calculated in relation to the workers' length of service might involve cutting across the last-in first-out rule which is embodied in existing agreements with trade unions.</P>
    <P>The rule to which I have just referred means, in effect, that the workers with the highest compensation entitlement are retained when redundancy arises and that the workers with the lowest compensation entitlement are allowed to go.  I do not know whether consideration of this matter in present circumstances might complicate our examination of the main problem. Within the general scheme of reorganisation covering the existing working rules imposed by the trade unions&mdash;a scheme of reorganisation designed to contribute to the reduction of unnecessary cost&mdash;the Government would consider an extension of the scope of these compensation arrangements or the introduction of alternative compensation provisions in order to facilitate desirable changes.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting is something in the nature of a package deal which would facilitate the improvement of the economics of railway operation and at the same time give security to railway <Col N="1062" /> workers whose employment is obviously threatened by the continuing decline in railway traffic and the eventual threat of the disappearance of the railways altogether.  I invite the unions catering for railway workers to consider that suggestion and discuss it with the C.I.E. Board.  If they have any proposals to make arising out of it I shall, of course, be available at any time to meet them and receive the proposals.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to say anything precise regarding the further capital outlay by C.I.E. upon the improvement of its system, upon the improvement of locomotives, rolling stock and other items.  It is clear that the board's capital programme will require to be reassessed in the light of proposed reorganisation. If the need should arise for C.I.E. to dispose of any surplus rolling stock, regard will be had to the requirements of the G.N.R. system when that is absorbed by C.I.E.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that many of the recommendations of the committee do not fall to be implemented by legislation.  There are recommendations bearing upon the administration of the undertaking which will be brought to the attention of the board who will be requested to address themselves to them and to deal in a similar way with any current problems that may arise.  There was a recommendation in the report in favour of the withdrawal of C.I.E. barges from the Grand Canal.  We are not prepared to accept that recommendation now without further inquiries in view of the observations on the recommendation which we received from the C.I.E. Board.</P>
    <P>We have considered also the views expressed by the committee regarding the operations of licensed hauliers and have considered the recommendations which we have received from the organisation representing these licensed hauliers.  We recognise that, in the event of any curtailment of the C.I.E. railway system, existing licences must be adjusted so as to enable any licensed haulier within a limited area to include the nearest railway station within his area, and we have decided in favour of giving licence facilities for the transport of sea fish when the need for that is established.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> In regard to the recommendation on external motor coach tours, that has already, in part, been implemented. There is a proposal by the committee for the establishment of a consultative council.  I, personally, can see no value in that recommendation which has not been accepted.  I may say that a number of the organisations who made recommendations regarding the report of the committee considered that the establishment of such a council was not important.</P>
    <P>The Government's decisions, therefore, involve a combination of legislative and administrative action to secure the improvement of the railway system by means of concerted efforts to expand traffic and to cut costs.  For the purpose of assisting towards the expansion of traffic and of revenue from traffic, we are giving C.I.E. freedom from the restriction to which they have hitherto been subjected, putting them in a position to secure increased traffic by competitive methods, and we hope to see them in a position eventually to secure additional traffic by reducing their charges.</P>
    <P>The implementation of that policy under the reconstituted board will be achieved over a five-year period.  For the purpose of reducing costs we are giving the board power, in their own discretion, to eliminate lines and stations where they are satisfied that there is no prospect of remunerative business arising.  We are removing a substantial part of their existing capital liability and releasing their revenue, therefore, from the charge in respect of interest on that proportion of its existing transport stock issues. We propose to provide a fixed subsidy by way of grant-in-aid for a period of five years, and the advantage of a fixed subsidy paid in that way is that the board can work towards economies, understanding that any economy they achieve will redound to the advantage of the undertaking and not merely to the advantage of the Exchequer.  They will have clear limits in which to plan the scope of their activities.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, I am suggesting an arrangement involving the payment of compensation out of a fund established <Col N="1064" /> by law and financed by the Exchequer contributions towards reducing, over a period of time, the staffs employed in the operation of the railways to that number which is required for their existing operation.</P>
    <P>Are these measures likely to prove adequate to save the railways?  I do not think anybody can give a confident answer to that question.  For the reasons which I gave at the beginning of my statement, the Government has decided that we must try to save them. We hope to do so with the full cooperation and support of the management of the undertaking, of the workers employed and of their trade union leaders and particularly and essentially with the help and support of all the merchants who carry on business in the areas served by the railway and, I hope, with the backing of these many organisations which in the past few months have been sending protests to me against the proposals for the curtailment of railway operations set out in the committee's report.</P>
    <P>The Government consider, as the Committee on Transport did, that it would be wrong to decide now against the railways.  Whether it will be equally wrong so to decide in ten or 15 years from now will depend on the success of the effort about to be made.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude this statement, I think I should refer to one of the sub-heads in the Supplementary Estimate relating to the Sligo-Leitrim railway line.  Deputies will be aware that following upon the decision of the Belfast authorities to close down the G.N.R. line through Enniskillen, the Sligo-Leitrim line ceased to operate. We have no particular obligation or responsibility in regard to that company. It is a Six-County company with its registered head office in Enniskillen, but we do recognise that many of its employees were persons domiciled within our State.  These employees have no statutory right to compensation.  The company has just gone out of business, and, even if there was a statutory right to compensation, it would not be much use to them because the company has no money, anyway.  It is expected that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the <Col N="1065" /> company will not be sufficient to meet prior claims.  There is no pension scheme.  In these circumstances, we are asking the Dáil to vote money <i>ex gratia</i> to enable payment to be made to employees of that company who are resident within our territory and who have not been taken over and reemployed by C.I.E.</P>
    <P>I understand there are about 95 such persons.  The basis of payment will be one month's pay for each complete year of service with a maximum of 24 months' pay.  It will cost £40,000. There is a saving on other sub-heads of the Estimate of £5,000 so that the amount required for the purpose of putting the Sligo-Leitrim company in funds to make these payments is £35,000.</P>

      <P>No; the Deputy misunderstood me there.  When C.I.E. fails to pay interest on transport stock the Government pays it and then eventually that amount is recovered by Vote of the Dáil, but the amount by which C.I.E. defaulted becomes a liability of C.I.E. and that liability itself carries an interest obligation which has accumulated over the years. It is being released from the obligation to pay interest on that amount in respect of which they are in arrears.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 21 and 22, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(7)  This section shall apply to an individual undertaking the nursing and maintenance of an illegitimate child without reward and to the making of arrangements for such nursing and maintenance as it applies in relation to nursing and maintenance for reward.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which I undertook to Deputy O'Higgins to bring in. I think it meets the objects to which Deputy O'Higgins's amendment was directed.  Under the provisions of Section 2 (4) of the Principal Act, as amended by Section 4 (2) (g) of the Children Act, 1934, a health authority may exempt from being visited, either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as they think fit, any particular premises which appear to them to be so conducted as to make visiting unnecessary.  I might mention, as I said on the Committee Stage, that there are certain circumstances in which it would be undesirable that these homes would be visited by the health authorities.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 2, to delete &ldquo;16&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;18&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision in this amendment extends to the age of 18 the age of 16 which is already provided in Section 3 sub-section (3).  In other words, where a child who was in the custody <Col N="1069" /> of a person who was not a relative of the child and new employment is in a premises other than the premises in which the child has been living, the notification of the employment will have to be given in the case of a child who is a child up to 18 years of age instead of 16.  I think it achieves most of what Deputy O'Higgins desired in his amendment except that in the wording of his amendment the effect would have been to reduce rather than increase the age, because, without specification of the age, the age concerned would be that to which the Health Acts apply and that is 14.  The specific provision of the age of 18 will increase the age from 16 specifically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one thing on that matter and I do not know whether it would appeal to the Minister.  The section, as amended, would read: &ldquo;Where any body or person (not being a relative of the child) having custody of a child under the age of 18...&rdquo;  Would the Minister not consider making that read: &ldquo;custody of a child of the age of 18 or under&rdquo;?  It might arise that employment was arranged after the child reaches the age of 18.  I do not know whether the Minister would consider there is anything in the point.  I should prefer it to read &ldquo;18 or under&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>(3) Féadfaidh an tAire tar éis dul i gcomhairle leis an mBord rialacháin a dhéanamh i dtaobh an mhodha ar a n-úsáidfear an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth urlabhra in aon ghné de ghnó gach tionscail tuaithe agus scéime somhaoiní fostaíochta a sholáthraíonn, a sheolann, a rialaíonn agus a bhainistíonn an Bord sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

Cheap mé gurb é a shíl an tAire go raibh mé ag smaoineamh ar obair taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Ar aon chuma, samhlaíodh dom gur thuig an tAire an gá a bhí le haire a thabhairt do cúrsaí na teanga i mease na n-oibritheoirí agus na stiúrthóirí nuair a bheas an obair ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht.  D'aontaigh mé le cuid den mhéid adúirt an tAire. Do tháinig sé isteach im aigne go bhfuil deacrachtaí ann.  Tá a lán oibre a cuireadh ar siúl chun leasa na Gaeltachta agus tá sé de dhualgas ar na daoine go bhfuil baint acu leis an obair leanúint le labhairt na teangan agus ní cheapaim go bhfuil ag éirí lena lán acu an obair sin a dhéanamh chomh maith agus ba chóir dóibh. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil deacrachtaí ann.  Tá dualgas ar Aire na Gaeltachta féachaint isteach san obair.

Ba mhaith liom a chur ar a shúile don Teachta Ua Maolchatha go mbeidh an Bord seo i riocht eile ar fad i gcomórtas le Bordanna Reachtúla eile maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge.  Beidh ar an mBord a cuirfear ar bun faoin mBille seo dualgais reachtúla speisialta maidir le caomhaint agus úsáid na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra sa Ghaeltacht, agus, mar adúirt mé cheana, beidh sé rí-shoiléir don Bhord go mbeidh síad i riccht speisialta ina thaobh seo.</P>
      <P>Ar an gcúis seo, ní fheicim gur gá ríalacháin speisialta a dhéanamh chun cur síos a dhéanamh ar an gcaoi ina mbeidh ar an mBord a gcuid dualgais reachtúla, atá soiléir cheana, a chomhlíonadh.</P>
      <P>Ar aon chuma, fiú dá mbeadh amhras ar bith ann ina thaobh, tá sa mFille anois, faoi mar a leasaíodh é ar (héim an Choiste, foráil (fo-alt (2) Alt 4) a chuireas ar an mBord dualgas cosúil leis an bhfreagracht atá ar an Roinn cheana i leith cabhrú le caomhain agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáthurlabhra.  Dúirt mé ar chéim an Choiste agus deirim arís anois go ndéanfaidh mé an-tsoiléir é don Bhord céard é an dualgas a bheas orthu i leith na Gaeilge agus go gcaithfidh siad leas na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra a choinneáil chun tosaigh i gcónaí in imeachtaí uilig an Bhoird.  Ní féidir liom a fheiceáil cén mhaitheas a dhéanfadh sé dá mbedh an tAire ag déanamh rialacháin agus á gcur ar aghaidh chuig an mBord.</P>

Sé sin go mbeidh an Ghaeilge ina gnáth-urlabhra ag lucht an Bhoird ó bhun go barr.  Más rud é go dtaispeánfar aon náimhdeas nó patfhuaireacht i leith na Gaeilge ag duine ar bith go bhfuil baint aige leis an mBord a bheag nó a mhór tá iomlán cumhachta ag an Aire é sin d'fhreagairt le gníomh agus a chur ina luí ar chách cad iad na dualgaisí atá orthu le comhlíonadh i leith na Gaeilge.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> (2) Bhéarfaidh an Bord sa tuarascáil bhliantúil sin faisnéis i dtaobh úsáid na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra i ngnó gach lár-ionaid tionscail agus scéime somhaoiní fostaíochta a bheas faoi chumhacht an Bhoird.</P>
    <P>Molaim an leasú seo agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire sásta aontú léi.  Ceapaim gur gá go mbeadh dualgas ar an mBord sa tuarascáil bhliantúil an fhaisnéis sin do thabhairt.  Ar chéim an Choiste, do thairgíos leasú go mbeadh ar an mBord faisnéis do thabhairt sa tuarascáil bhliantúil ar staid na Gaeilge mar gnáth-urlabhra i ngnó gach lár-ionaid, tionscail agus scéime somhaoiní fostaíochta a bheadh féna chúram agus sa gceantar mórthimpeall. Chim gur ar Aireacht na Gaeltachta agus ar a cuid oilfigeach is ceart an dualgas sin a bheith maidir le staid na Gaeilge sa cheantar mórthimpeall. Do cheap mé san am sin go mbeadh sé go maith dá mbeadh ar lucht stiúrtha gach tionscail breathnú do thabhairt ar staid na Gaeilge sna háiteacha leasmuigh chomh maith le sna tionscail féin.  Do cheap mé, freisin, go mba chóir go mbeadh dualgas orthu faisnéis do thabhairt sa tuarascáil bhliantúil mar gheall ar staid na Gaeilge sna ceantair amuigh. Cheap mé go gcoiméadfadh an dualgas sin tábhacht na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra san tionscal ós a gcomhair. Bíodh sin mar atá, b'fhéidir go mbeadh an cúram sin ró-mhór dóibh.</P>
    <P>Do réir ailt 32, caithfidh an Bord gach bliain tuarascáil do thabhairt don Aire ar imeachta an Bhoird i gcaitheamh na bliana roimhe sin agus ós rud é gur chun labhairt na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht a chaomhnadh atáthar ag cur suas tionscal agus scéimeanna oibre, do thuigeas gur cóir go dtabharfadh an Bord sa tuarascáil a chuirfidh siad chuig an Aire tuarascáil i dtaobh na Gaeilge.  Is dóigh liom gurb é an tslí is deimhnithí agus is simplí chun tuarascáil d'fháil air sin ná dualgas do chur ar an mBord tuarascáil d'fháil ó gach tionscal a bhí ar siúl á rá conas a bhí an Ghaeilge ag imeacht in obair an tionscail sin.  Dá bhrí sin, sé an rud ba mhaith liom a fheiscint curtha <Col N="1076" /> isteach ansan, i leathanach 19, tar éis fo-ailt (1), ná:</P>
    <P>Bhéarfaidh an Bord sa tuarascáil bhliantúil sin faisnéis i dtaobh úsáid na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra i ngnó gach lár-ionaid, tionscail agus scéime somhaoiní fostaíochta a bheas faoi chumhacht an Bhoird.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go gcuirfí é sin isteach i dtreo is go mbeadh an tuarascáil iomlán i dtaobh cúrsaí na Gaeilge.</P>

      <P>Ionas go mbeidh caoi fosta ag na Teachtaí breathnú ar conas atá tionscal ar bith ag dul ar aghaidh chomh fada is bhaineas le ceist na teangan féin, ba mhaith an rud é sa tuarascáil a cuirfear isteach gach bliain go mbeadh tuairisc ó gach tionscal conas atá scéal na Gaeilge sna monarchain nó pé áit a bhfuil an tionscal ar siúl, cé mhéid de na hoibritheoirí atá ag labhairt na Gaeilge, cé mhéid den obair a níos an bainisteoir tríd an Ghaeilge, má nítear na litreacha a scríobhadh as Gaeilge, agus mar sin de.  Sé dualgas an Bhoird tionscail agus scéimeanna a chur ar siúl chun cabhrú leis an Ghaeilge agus leis an Ghaeltacht.  Dá bhrí sin, ba cheart go mbeadh eolas againn annseo faoi gach tionscal atá faoi chúram an Bhoird, cé mhéid feabhais atá ag teacht, má tá feabhas ag teacht, ar an scéal maidir leis an Ghaeilge, conas atá ceist na Gaeilge, an bhfuil sí ag dul chun cinn nó ag dul ar gcúl. Má tharlaíonn labhairt na Gaeilge i measc na n-oibritheoirí a bheith ag dul ar gcúl, ba ghá don Aire agus don Bord rud éigin a dhéanamh 'na thaobh.</P>

      <P>Sílim go bhfuil cumhacht go leor agam fén mBille i dtaobh na tuarascála.  Fé alt 33, bhéarfaidh an Bord don Aire pé eolas a iarrfas an tAire ó am go ham maidir le comhlíonadh feidhmeanna an Bhoird, agus, ó tá dualgas ar an mBord an Ghaeilge a leathnú agus a chaomhnú, is féidir liom ceisteanna a chur ar an mBord nua i dtaobh an ruda seo ar am ar bith.  Níor mhaith liom bheith ró-cheangailte agus ar na fáthanna a luaigh me agus an Bille ag dul trí chéim an Choiste, ní féidir liom glacadh leis an leasú seo.  Mar aon leis na <Col N="1077" /> fáthanna sin tig liom a rá go bhfuil na Tionscail Tuaithe mar atáid i láthair na huaire suite i gcúig ionad tríochad ar leith agus is léir go mba riachtanach dá nglactaí leis an leasú seo mion-fhaisnéis i dtaobh staid na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra a shcláthar i leith gach ionaid díobh.

      <P>Is dóigh liom go mbeidh faillí á déanamh sa cheist seo mura gcuirtear dualgas ar an mBord, cur síos, sa tuarascáil reachtúil a bheidh le tabhairt, ar staid na Gaeilge ins gach tionscail.  Tá fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil cuid de na scéimeanna taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ar fad.  Sé rud atá uaim ná go mbeadh deimhin á dhéanamh ag an mBord, ag an Aire agus ag an Teach so, a chuir an cúram sin ar an Aire agus ar an mBord, go bhfuil an obair atá ar siúl fén mBord ag freastal ar an nGaeilge agus dá coimeád buan agus dá leathnú agus dá láidriú.  Mura mbíonn tuarascáil ag cur síos ar staid na Gaeilge ann, ní bheidh againn ach saghas cuntais i dtaobh tionscal&mdash; figiúirí, agus a leithéidí sin.  Is dóigh liom gurb é an tslí is fearr chun a thuiscint conas atá an obair ag dul ar aghaidh ná tuairise bheag do bheith tugtha ar gach scéim.  Tá fhios againn go bhfuil a lán scéimeanna ann agus tá cuid acu ag déanamh díobháil don Ghaeilge.  Tá áiteanna ann go bhfuil ainm buan Gaeilge orthu agus an Ghaeilge lag go leor i measc na n-oibritheoiri i gcuid de na scéimeanna. Is féidir é sin do leigheas ach ní leigheasófar é mura dtuigtear go bhfuil an Teach so ag breathnú go géar ar gach ní atá ar siúl i dtaobh na Gaeilge. Mholfainn go láidir don Aire glacadh leis an leasú sin.</P>

      <P>Tá mé sásta leis an gcumhacht atá agam fén mBille seo.  Tá dualgas orm ceist a chur ar an <Col N="1080" /> mBord i dtaobh aon rud a theastaíonn uaim a fháil amach.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teach as ucht an dóigh inar glacadh leis an mBille seo i gcoitinne.  Is eol dom go bhfuil tuiscint mhaith ag Teachtaí ar chúrsaí na Gaeltachta agus léiríodh sa díospóireacht ar an mBille go dtuigeann na Teachtaí, ó na ceantracha sin ach go háirithe, na fadhbanna agus na deacrachtaí a bhíonn ag cur as do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Ní miste dhom, measaim, cúpla focla a rá arís faoin gcuspóir atá leis an mBille.  Séard tá á dhéanamh agam ann ná eagraíocht a bhunú a bheas i ndon tabhairt faoi gné amháin de chúrsaí na Gaeltachta d'fheabhsú, sé sin, an tionsclaíocht.  Dár ndóigh, san Acht faoinar cuireadh Roinn na Gaeltachta ar bun, tá sé leagtha síos gurb é is feidhm don Roinn ná leas cultúrtha, sóisialach agus geilleagrach na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn, agus cabhrú le caomhaint agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra.  Mar sin, tá réim na Roinne, agus na curamaí atá orm mar Aire na Gaeltachta, níos leithne i bhfad ná na feidhmeanna a bheas le tabhairt don Bhord faoin mBille seo.  Deirim an méid sin, toisc gur cosúil go bhfuil mí-thuiscint faoin scéal ar Theachtaí áirithe adúirt go rabhas ag beartú mo chuid dualgas ar fad mar Aire na Gaeltachta a chaitheamh anonn ar an mBord faoin mBille seo.  Ní mar sin atá an scéal in aon chor.</P>
      <P>Le roinnt míosa anuas, tá staidéar á dhéanamh agam ar na gnéithe eile den obair a cuireadh orm mar Aire na Gaeltachta agus, ar ócáidí eile, tá súil agam go mbeidh mé i ndon a inseacht don Teach céard iad na scéimeanna agus na pleananna atá á mbeartú agam i leith na ngnéithe eile de mo chuid oibre seachas an tionsclaíocht. Níl sa tionsclaíocht ann féin ach gné amháin de leas geilleagrach na Gaeltachta.  Tá súil agam aire faoi leith a thabhairt chomh maith do scéimeanna a rachaidh chun tairbhe na bhfeirmeoirí beaga agus daoine mar iad nach mbeadh mórán baint acu, b'fhéidir, le hobair an Bhoird nua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> Maídir leis an tionsclaíocht, tá sé suimiúil a thabhairt faoi deara go ndearna Gaeltarra Éireann an dul chun cinn is mó sna tionscail a raibh traidisiún ann dóibh sa nGaeltacht, sé sin, tionscal an bhréidín, tionscal na bróidnéireachta agus an tionscal lámh-chniotála.  Bunaíodh na tionscail sin ar an stuaim láimhe is dual do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ba chóir go mbeadh sé mar chúis bróid againn go bhfuil clú agus cáil bainte amach ar fud an domhain, nach mór, ag an mbréidín agus na hearraí eile lámhdhéanta. Beidh mé ag súil leis go dtabharfaidh an Bord nua aire speisialta do na tionscail seo, go ndéanfaidh siad iarrachtaí speisialta chun iad a fhorbairt agus a leathnú amach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> This Bill is intended to implement the agreement signed on 16th March, 1957, between Ireland and the United States of America.  That agreement provided that a sum of £500,000 out of the American Grant Counterpart Fund should be used to promote mutual understanding between the countries by wider exchange of knowledge through educational contacts.  As Deputies are, of course, aware, the American Grant Counterpart Fund amounted in all to about £6,000,000.  It is the sterling equivalent of the £18,000,000 grant which the United States so generously gave to Ireland in 1948.</P>
    <P>Out of the £6,000,000 Grant Counterpart Fund this Bill proposes to use the sum of £500,000 in order to form a Scholarship Exchange Fund.  Apart from such amounts as may be needed for current requirements the £500,000 will be invested in securities approved by the Minister for Finance.  The fund will be administered by a board of seven members of whom four will be citizens of Ireland appointed by the Minister for External Affairs and there citizens of the United States appointed by the head of the United States Diplomatic Mission to Ireland.  An Irish member will be appointed chairman of the board.</P>
    <P>The function of the board will be to promote educational exchanges between Ireland and the United States of America and to finance such exchanges from the fund.  It is intended that, under the scheme, Irish lecturers, university graduates and research workers, will be enabled to lecture at, or work in, American institutions of higher education and other similar institutions.  In the same way, American lecturers, graduates and research workers will be enabled to carry on their work in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to enlarge upon the advantages of such a scheme.  There has, in the past, been a considerable amount of contact and co-operation between us on an academic level, but a proper development of this has been hampered by lack of funds.  The agreement to use part of the Grant Counterpart Fund for the purpose will, I feel sure, be <Col N="1086" /> welcomed by everyone concerned with intellectual and cultural work in this country.  Many of the distinguished Irish scholars who have hitherto been unable, for financial reasons, to accept invitations to lecture to learned bodies in America will, under the scheme, be enabled to visit America and to lecture there on subjects of Irish and of general interest.  In this way Irish scholarship will be better known and appreciated abroad.</P>
    <P>We may confidently expect that a regular exchange of persons of high academic standing will strengthen still further the friendship and understanding which have always existed between Ireland and the United States.  I am sure that the Irish students will benefit greatly by the experience and knowledge they will gain during their stay in the United States, and I fervently hope that in view of their great generosity the people of the United States will reap the maximum possible benefit from this scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My Party naturally welcomes this Bill.  It gives statutory effect to an agreement which was entered into between the predecessors of the present Government and the Government of the United States.  We feel it is an agreement which will bring benefits to both countries, one which we recommend to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill, I think we should pay some tribute to the generosity of the American people who have made these funds available to finance the projects envisaged by the Bill.  I believe there is much in American learning, scholarship and technology from which our people can learn.  I also venture to suggest that there is much in our Irish culture which can be of interest to American scholars and students.  The provisions of this Bill must inevitably bring a greater understanding between our two countries and bring still closer the links which have bound us so closely in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are only two matters which I would like to raise on the Bill itself. The first is a suggestion in regard to the title of the board to be set up under the Bill.  It has been the custom <Col N="1087" /> in our legislation in recent years not to provide an English translation of the names of boards which are set up and give names in the Irish language. It does seem that we should make an exception in this case in view of the fact that three members of the board will be citizens of the United States and that the board will, perhaps, come within the province of United States legislation and certainly of the United States organisation responsible for foreign exchange.  It might be a gracious gesture on our part to give an English translation so that the name of the board in the Irish language can be known by its equivalent in the English language.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate the type of people it is proposed to appoint to the board.  The Minister has wide powers of selection, the only requirements for his four appointees being that they should be Irish citizens.  I should be glad to know if it is proposed that they should be civil servants or persons from the academic world.  Perhaps also the Minister can indicate how long he envisages the board will operate.  Does he think that the amount of money available should be spent over a short period or are the schemes, to be put to the Minister by the board and approved by him, to be of such a nature as to involve the board's operation for a considerable number of years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add one word before the Minister concludes.  I need hardly say that I heartily endorse what Deputy Costello has said especially with reference to the munificence of the American people and the splendid gifts they have given to this nation, this being the second occasion within very recent times that we have had to legislate for the profitable employment of the magnificent endowments that they have provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We frequently hear in public discussions in this country emphasis laid upon the fundamental importance of the agricultural industry to the entire economy.  This Bill is designed to provide scholarships for the higher education of Irish nationals and we <Col N="1088" /> can readily imagine the students of the humanities and sciences availing of the facilities that will be here made available but I should like to suggest to the Minister that the board should be invited, when determining the basis of allocation of these scholarships, to bear in mind the fundamental importance of agriculture to the whole life of this country&mdash;social and economic&mdash; so that we may rest assured that the graduates and students in agricultural science and in veterinary science will be accorded their due share of the opportunities made available by this scheme.</P>
    <P>I think it right to place on record that already, as a result of the munificence of a great American foundation &mdash;the Kellogg Trust&mdash;we are already enabled to send to America a number of veterinary graduates for post-graduate work and, although that scheme has only been in operation for the past two years, it has already made provision for several young veterinary graduates of this country to do post-graduate work in America with a view to bringing that knowledge and skill to the service of the agricultural community of this country.</P>
    <P>I am a little apprehensive that in a scholarship exchange scheme of this kind these aspects of learning may be overshadowed by the claims of medicine, engineering, science and the arts. It is for that reason that on this occasion I invite the co-operation of the Minister for External Affairs in taking such steps as would be appropriate for bringing to the attention of this board the potentialities of scholarship grants in the faculties of veterinary science and agriculture in addition to such opportunities as might more readily occur to a board such as is envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello asked the Minister to indicate what sort of board, in so far as he is responsible for appointing it, he has in mind.  I should be glad if he were in a position to answer that question at this stage and if he would tell us whether it is his intention to secure careful attention to that aspect of the matter to which I have referred by putting on the board somebody who has an approximate or an indirect <Col N="1089" /> knowledge of or interest in agricultural and veterinary science.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the very heartening things in a rather troubled world is the way in which the American people and the American Government are prepared to foster technical knowledge throughout the world.  In years gone by, people who developed technical knowledge were inclined to keep it to themselves but the American Government have gone out with a deliberate policy to ensure that a large number of nations would have available to them as high a technical education as possible and all the technical knowledge available even to the American people themselves.  It is the beginning of something that is very important to the world.</P>
      <P>I was asked a few questions some of which I cannot answer and others which I can.  I do not know what the names of the members of the board will be but I am sure that no board to select people to go to the United States for research work would be complete unless it had upon it people who have had an interest in agriculture as well as people interested in the arts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello asked how long the fund was going to last.  The fund will be a permanent fund and, like everything human, if we are wise we shall have to make provision for its coming to an end.  Provision has been made for winding up the fund under certain conditions under Section 18.  You have, under other sections, provision made that the board may accept contributions of various kinds and if this fund is successful in carrying out the work, which is the hope of the American Government and the Irish Government, it will need what voluntary contributions it can get to the interest that accrues to it each year on the capital fund of £500,000.</P>

They would be three American citizens and they will very quickly get to know the Irish name. It would be a departure from the very good practice that has been established. These boards are known by their Irish name and their Irish name alone and I certainly would not like to depart from that practice in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister for External Affairs might with propriety avail of this occasion to give us some indication of the Government's mind in regard to the financing of the institute.  There is available in this scheme a capital sum which the institute must disperse on capital works. Over and above that, there is an endowment of £1,000,000, the income of which will be available to the institute, year by year.  But is it the intention of the Government to restrict the activities of the institute to what may be financed by the income of that fund?  To put it at its best, the income, even invested in present rates of interest, would produce something in the order of £60,000.  Is it the intention of the Government to supplement that income and, if so, to what extent is the Government prepared to say that, in respect of any work which is of a desirable character, they are prepared to provide the funds?  Or do they wish to say that, subject to a certain annual limit, they will be prepared to find money from the Exchequer to supplement the work of the institute set up under this Bill? Unless some declaration of that kind is made now, I think we are giving the institute rather a poor send-off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I am overstating the case if I say I believe that the American Government holds the view that there was a concomitant understanding, if not a binding undertaking, that the Irish Government would, from the Exchequer, supplement the income which the institute would derive from the endowment.  The Minister for External Affairs would remember that, in the very early stages of the discussion relating to these proposals, the American Government expressed the strongest reservations about any proposal to appropriate any of the available money for the purpose of the endowment. They felt that all the available money should be for the purpose of capital works, leaving the responsibility for endowment squarely on the <Col N="1092" /> shoulders of the Irish Government.  I think that view was associated with the kinds of proposals that were originally incorporated in the White Paper from which this Bill marks a considerable departure.  But the American Government, having discussed the matter further with the Irish Government, expressed their preparedness to meet the Irish Government's view in changing their original position and in consenting to a sum of £800,000 odd being earmarked for capital purposes and a sum of £1,000,000 being reserved as a standing endowment of the institute.</P>
    <P>I think we would be doing less than our part if we did not avail of this stage of our legislation to make a declaration on behalf of our Government that we were prepared to find the finance to meet any additional work which it was requisite and appropriate for the institute to undertake over and above what the income from the endowment fund would finance, subject, of course, to the inescapable limitation that such an undertaking was given within the limit of our available resources.</P>
    <P>I think this institute, if it succeeds, as I hope it will succeed, will in the long term be in a position profitably to use for the benefit of this country an income substantially in excess of £60,000 a year.  I would suggest to the Minister that this is the appropriate time to say that if and when that time arrives neither the Government nor Dáil Éireann will be backward in matching the munificence of the American Government with suitable generosity on the part of the Treasury to the common beneficiary which is the agricultural industry and the national economy of Ireland.</P>

      <P>On the Money Resolution.  In answer to Deputy Dillon, as I see it, in the nature of this Bill, which is merely an enabling Bill, there is a great deal of detail to be filled in and to be worked out.  I fail to see how the Minister can go any <Col N="1093" /> further than the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 of the Bill, which we will debate when we come to them in Committee. In Section 11 there is the provision for endowment and in Section 12 there is the usual provision for annual grants.  I find it very hard to get Deputy Dillon's point as to how we can go specifically any further in the nature of the case here.  The Bill empowers the setting up of this institute. It does no more, as we said on Second Reading, than to give the powers.  The erection of the structure by means of these powers has yet to be done and until the structure is pretty well defined in its details I fail to see how the Government or anybody else can go any further in financial provisions than the enabling provisions in Sections 11 and 12.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could give the assurance that Deputy Dillon asked for in his opening sentence, that we would guarantee that this institute would get all the money it wanted for any work of a desirable character.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That was away down, afterwards.  To take that particular matter first, I must say that I would be glad to be able to give that guarantee and that we would give the institute plenty of work that would cost a lot of money.  This Bill provides, first of all, that the Government may add to these funds available to the institute for research, and so on, and that the funds of the institute which derive from the capital sum will, of course, be in addition to all the sums that are already being spent by various institutions throughout the country.  The sums that are given to University College, Dublin, to many other places, like Johnstown, and all the rest of it, will continue to be spent&mdash;the sums that are ordinarily provided in the Vote. Over and above that, the £50,000 or £60,000, or whatever it is, the interest acruing on this capital sum, will be added and over and above that again there is the provision, as the Deputy is aware&mdash;Deputy Major de Valera alluded to it&mdash;in Section 12:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" />&ldquo;For the purpose of assisting the institute to carry out effectively it functions under this Act, there shal be paid to the institute in every financial year, out of the moneys provided by the Oireachtas, a grant towards the expenses of the institute the amount of which shall be determined by the Minister for Finance in consultation with the Minister and the council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Heretofore, there was a certain sum of money allotted in the Estimates each year for research, which was spent through the existing institutions. Under this Bill and out of the fund there will be an additional £50,000 or £60,000, whichever the interest is and, in addition to that, provision is made to add to the total whatever money the Minister for Agriculture can get out of the Minister for Finance in the light of the necessity for further expenditure and also in the light of the resources of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I am still in some difficulties about the definition of &ldquo;research&rdquo; here:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this Act&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;agriculture&rsquo; includes horticulture, forestry and bee-keeping, and also includes facilities, activities and sciences which relate to or tend to <Col N="1095" /> promote or improve agriculture, and cognate words shall be construed accordingly;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does that mean, if you take it in connection with the word &ldquo;research&rdquo; lower down&mdash;&ldquo;research&rdquo; includes investigation, test, experiment, analysis and study&mdash;that, say, a fundamental research into plant biology <i>per se</i> or plant pathology <i>per se</i> or into a physical problem or into a chemical problem that might be conceivably related to agriculture in that it could be applied in agriculture&mdash;that that definition is wide enough to bring that about?  I do not think that is intended nor do I think it would be wise to envisage such a project.</P>

      <P>All right.  I will take the two of you on.  The point, in all seriousness, is really this: I see a real danger in this Bill of duplication of effort and duplication of work with the other institutions.  It so happens that the other institutions we have are the universities and I am not pleading for the universities specifically as they are but there are other institutions properly doing research, with limited resources, in sciences which are related, within the meaning of this section, to agriculture.  Chemistry, physics, for instance, are two specific ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the dangers in this Bill is the temptation under the structure to erect machinery to have the institute do research that would duplicate research that could be done and might even be being done in other institutions. That would be all very well if the resources of this country were not limited but we are facing a problem on another front in regard to other institutions which are equally necessary to develop the country in its economy and university life where <Col N="1096" /> there are acute shortages of funds and facilities.  A shortage of personnel and anything that would tend to dissipate the forces would be bad.  We should make it clear that the activities of the institute will be firmly and primarily related to agricultural needs and cognate problems will, if possible, be farmed out to other institutions to avoid duplication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely also it is true&mdash; I think it was agreed on all sides when we were discussing the Second Stage&mdash; that there is one body that cannot run the institute and that is Dáil Éireann. The best thing you can do is to get the Government to provide the best council and the best director they can get and give that council and the director the powers requisite to do the job right, and then leave it in their hands to do the job on the assumption that if you have chosen them aright they will not dissipate the resources, duplicate the work that has already been done, or undertake projects that have no relation to their proper function.  If there was no provision in this Bill to enable the institute &ldquo;to review, facilitate, encourage, assist, co-ordinate, promote and undertake&rdquo; then there would be validity in Deputy de Valera's apprehension, but these powers are there under Section 4 (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (2) of that section &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of sub-section (1)&rdquo; there are set out (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k), as 11 specific heads under which the institute can operate to serve the main purpose set out in the definition articles to which Deputy de Valera has referred.  Probably the discussion we are now having would be more relevantly conducted on Section 4 and I think if we did conduct it on Section 4 it would become abundantly clear that the difficulties and dangers Deputy de Valera envisages will not arise, provided we get the right council and the right director.  If we do not <Col N="1097" /> there is nothing we can do about it, because if we do not get the right council and the right director, no matter what precautions we take in the Oireachtas, they will make a hames of it.  On the other hand, if we do get the right council and the right director, provided we give them sufficient scope, they will make a success of it.</P>

      <P>The new council of the institute to be set up under this Bill will, of course, be bound by the terms of the Act and not by anything any of us may say here.  I feel, however, that a council comprising the representatives of these university colleges, five members of the agricultural and rural organisations and certain other members appointed by the board, will keep the director pretty well down to mother earth.  If there is a certain piece of research going on in any of the sciences that will be of use to agriculture, information will reach the director, I am sure, and he will have a knowledge of what is going on in the various universities and research establishments which are already here.</P>
      <P>What is important, rather than spending a lot of time and money on a particular piece of research that might have general application as well as application to agriculture, is that the knowledge that is already assembled or that will be available from time to time should be brought together in the institute in order to serve agriculture or serve horticulture.</P>
      <P>Section 2, as it stands, is wide enough to permit the board to collect all the information that is available and that would be of use to agriculture. It also directs them to pay attention to agriculture as their first interest and not to fundamental inquiries or researches which might have a much greater interest to other branches of science than that of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach would leap into this discussion for a moment.  There is a danger in this proposal of which I seem to hear echoes by the Minister for External Affairs from what Deputy Vivion de Valera has said.  This is an institute of agriculture.  I would like to think of myself as being as pragmatical a person as there is in this house, but I think it would be catastrophic if, at this stage of the institute's history, the threshold of its institution, we were to try and create the impression here that we wished, in so far as it lay within our power, to veto any proposal for fundamental research which the institute might think it expedient from time to time to promote either by way of making grants or providing facilities, etc.  There is nothing more dangerous than an undue&mdash;and I emphasise the word &ldquo;undue&rdquo;&mdash;predilection for applied research.</P>
      <P>I was reading recently what I thought was a very apt article by a man named Schwartz in the <i>Sunday Times.</i>  He was referring to the Labour programme for regulating investment and controlling it.  He said 35 years ago a Japanese national let off a rocket and attached himself to the end of it, and the only apparent result was that he burnt the seat of his pants and cut his knees and countenance by being dragged along by the rocket.  &ldquo;Would that man,&rdquo; said Schwartz, &ldquo;if he had applied for money to develop his idea have got it from a bureaucracy that was controlling the allocation of capital?&rdquo;  Yet it was that man and his crazy rocket who provided the genesis of powers that to-day control the world.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I think that in the field of research any of us can think up a number of problems beyond which specific applied research can be embarked upon to-morrow, but we should be very slow to say that in addition to these obvious avenues of research and progress scientists should not apply themselves at all or that this institute should not facilitate scientists in turning their minds to fundamental issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot emphasise too strongly how profoundly I believe and how urgently I would ask the House to believe that <Col N="1099" /> Dáil Éireann cannot run this institute, that the Department of Agriculture cannot run this institute.  The only people who can run it are the council and its director, and it is because I am so profoundly convinced of that that I would urge most strongly on the Dáil that if you err at all, err on the side of giving this council and its director too wide a scope.  Whatever you do, do not err on the side of hemming them in, because if you do you may get the result of this project being still-born.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the views of some other Deputies on that aspect of the situation.  I think that the Bill, as drafted, does give wide scope, sufficiently wide scope, but I would be solidly against the suggestion that the Minister responsible for drafting the Bill should deprecate the principle of wide freedom for applied or fundamental research.  I do not imagine that he really does, but I apprehend that the trend of the discussion on this section and on Section 2 might create that impression.  It is important at this stage, before such an impression gets abroad, that the situation would be authoritatively clarified.  I regret profoundly that I am not in a position authoritatively to clarify this matter.</P>
    <P>If I were, I would have no hesitation about it.  It is now the responsibility of the Minister for External Affairs and of our new Minister for Agriculture.  I have not much hope in the Minister for External Affairs; I have none in the Minister for Agriculture. By the mercy of Providence he apparently has not taken over yet, or the prospects of an institute would be bleak indeed.  However, I am prepared to settle for the best I can get. All I am asking now is that on behalf of the Government the Minister should reiterate the principle that the widest discretion is vested in this council and in the director within the reading of Sections 2 and 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not very much difference between my point of view and that of Deputy Dillon.  I think he has misunderstood me in this matter.  My main anxiety is not <Col N="1100" /> directed towards narrowly confining oneself to what appear to be practical issues at the moment but towards the economic use of all the research facilities available in the country and towards safeguarding ourselves against the danger of duplication of equipment and effort.</P>
      <P>The grounds for my main fear, as I said on the Second Reading, arise from our experience with another institute. I agree with Deputy Dillon that the fundamental research is often more fruitful than what appears to be the practical approach.  I gave some instances of that the other day.  What is called for here from the institute is a wide discernment of how to place the problem and go about the work of solving it.  My main reason for speaking on this occasion is to voice a warning against the temptation to try and do everything.  Under this section there is provision for making use of external organisations and persons for the purpose of research and even endowment. That is the policy I want to see adopted.  There will be plenty of specific agricultural research for the institute to do directly.  Other problems arise in other institutions and I believe that the institute should be able to use these institutions.  I am using my right to comment on the section to make these remarks because I think it is better to have the matter dealt with than to feel the necessity of criticising the Bill at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon that the widest powers of initiation and that the widest facilities for getting answers to problems should be given to the council and its director.  But it is at that point precisely that again I want to voice a strong word of warning that the policy should be to use all the resources available within the State and indeed outside it.  The Dáil cannot run and should not attempt to run this institute, but if we can give a directing slant to it the slant we should give is that it should use all the resources available and guard against the temptation, where it is not necessary, to set up duplicated systems, duplicated laboratories, duplicated technicians.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Something more definite is called for in this matter right from the start.  The council is appointed to carry out the general government of the institute and the administration of its affairs, but later on the Bill says there is a director who is subject to the general direction of the council.  The question immediately arises under this section as to who is going to direct the technical activities of the institute.  Will it be the council or the director?  Is the director in every sense to be subject to the council or will he be an autonomous person having independence and autonomy in the matter of getting the research work done?  This is an aspect of the matter which has been brought to light in a previous experiment.  It would therefore be highly desirable at this stage to have that pointed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be very little trouble in interpreting this Section 5.  The council is there to carry out the general governing of the institute and the administration of its affairs and one of its functions will be to hear reports from time to time from the director.  He has the job of putting up a scheme of work to the council and he has the duty under Section 7 to control and direct the activities of the staff of the institute, that is, to see that the staff do their work on the activities they are directed to carry out by the council, as conveyed to them through the director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be the function of the council to specify and decide what research activities will be undertaken and the priority for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That, I think, is one of the functions.  The director may make proposals to the council under Section 7 on any matter relating to the activities of the institute.  As he will be the man who will receive suggestions from day to day and, perhaps, many suggestions a day, from various people interested in agriculture, he will have available to him material <Col N="1102" /> from which he can draw up a programme, suggest it to the institute and let it be passed.  When the general programme of work has been agreed by the council it will be his duty to see that the staff carries it out efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Vivion de Valera indicates the desirability of clarification.  As I see it, the director will direct the actual work on the basis of a programme approved by the council annually.  At Rothampstead which has a research station and has a council, so far as I know, the council meets relatively infrequently.  It consists of very distinguished scientists and administrators drawn from all sorts of sources and the director is a man of the first eminence.  In consultation with the divisional heads of his departments, I think he proposes a programme of work for the year which the council approves and possibly extends in consultation with the director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can see in this institute, that will be the procedure approximately. In practice, the council would meet in 1958, the director would propose a programme of research and indicate the procedure that he proposed to employ in order to implement that programme.  The council would either approve or amend, or&mdash;and I believe this is unthinkable&mdash;reject it <i>in toto.</i>  It would then be for the council to meet as frequently as they, in their discretion, thought wise, requiring the director to report on the progress made, leaving it to the director to administer the affairs of the institute between one meeting of the council and the other.  That is probably as clear as it can advantageously be made by sub-section (2) of Section 7, but if there is anybody with better experience of drafting who will propose a better form of words I have no doubt the Minister would be very pleased to accept it.  But can we get our minds clear?  Are we all agreed on what we want to do?  Is the outline I have now given substantially the Minister's purpose?  If it is, I think this form of words gives effect to it and if I am <Col N="1103" /> wrong in my belief as to the true meaning of sub-section (2) I would be grateful if the Minister would correct me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Deputy Dillon is concerned there is this to be said: under Section 8 there is provision for the appointment of committees and commissions and it is apparently envisaged that the council will take a much more active directing interest in this institute than merely meeting once in a while.  They are to run the institute and it is highly important at the start that any possibility of conflict should be eliminated.  As I read this, the director is an officer, and when it comes to sub-section (2) of Section 7 I shall suggest the deletion of the word &ldquo;general&rdquo;&mdash;that is what this is all leading up to&mdash;in &ldquo;general direction of the council&rdquo;.  In such a case there is a lot to be said for an autonomous director but if it is to be that, let him be put in straight and right at the top. If he is to be autonomous in some ways and not in other ways the seeds of conflict might be sown.</P>
      <P>For instance, special committees will be set up, and it will be necessary to have special committees because no one person can possibly be qualified to deal with all aspects of all the problems that will arise, and, when you have advice of that nature provided, one has to be very careful to ensure that the seeds of conflict will not be sown because one could very well find a technical commission of that sort in conflict with the individual views any particular director may hold on a particular problem whether in regard to the actual doing of it, or in regard to the interpretation of priorities. That is a nice kettle of fish to come to the people at the top, especially if they are in any doubt as to their power.  It is for that reason I raised this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is going to be the ultimate control?  If the council is to be the control, take out the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; in sub-section (2) of Section 7.  If, on the other hand, it is intended, as has been tried elsewhere, to set up a committee and leave the director autonomous <Col N="1104" /> in technical matters, leave him autonomous in technical matters but then let us face it in the Dáil that your committee at the top is going to be so much window dressing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be some head with whom the last word is to lie. It is clear that in this Bill the ultimate authority lies with the council.  It seems to me there is no doubt about that.  The words &ldquo;general direction&rdquo; do indicate the duties of another officer who is subordinate to the council.  If his activities are such as not to please the council, they will have to get rid of him.  There must be somebody in charge and in my opinion anyhow the Bill makes it quite clear that it is the council who have the general control. They have to have a technical officer to do certain work and he is the director.  A wise council who have confidence in their director will allow him to give them advice to carry through the work and, if he is a good executive, will interfere as little as possible.  I think it is quite clear in the Bill.  I do not think we will improve on it if you are going to have a council at all.  You cannot do anything with the Bill except leave it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to score any point on Deputy de Valera but I would respectfully draw his attention to the fact that this is the one section of the Bill which his Government have inserted and I, therefore, propose to withdraw from this argument and leave it to the three of them to settle the matter between themselves because I was afflicted by this conflict of the Austinian theory of authority and where it was going to lie.  I sought to resolve it by simply having a chairman who would be a director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on the Second Stage it was not a matter of principle.  I thought there was a powerful argument for your proposal in Section 7 and certainly I would not argue against it. I think the Taoiseach has fairly stated the position.  There must be some ultimate authority.  That is in the council. Nobody can close his eyes to the fact that the Government appoints the first director.  Sub-section (3) of Section 7 provides that the first director shall be <Col N="1105" /> appointed by the Government as soon as may be after the commencement of the Act and shall hold office for such term and on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Government.</P>
    <P>That gives rise to the possibility of a conflict between the council and the first director.  Let us face that.  The first director will not be the appointee of the council but the appointee of the Government and it is possible that there will be a conflict there.  I think that is a risk we will have to take but, if the council is well chosen and the director is wisely chosen, there will not be a conflict.  I prefer to run the risk of such conflict arising than take the risk of having a dud appointed as first director.</P>
    <P>As I have repeatedly said before, we cannot run the institute from Oireachtas Éireann.  We have got to take certain risks and our case should be to minimise these risks in so far as we can.  There is a possibility in respect of the first director.  Thereafter, the ultimate responsibility will be with the council and, in the event of a conflict, they will have to get rid of the director and find one who has their confidence and whose discretion they are prepared generally to trust, always subject to the overriding consideration which, I think, is inescapable that if the council go berserk there is nothing we can do about it.  I do not believe it will.  If it is properly chosen it certainly should not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My point there would be completely met by the deletion of the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; in sub-section (2).  I am not altogether satisfied with the argument that a director can be got rid of.  In theory, that is a perfect answer but when it comes to practice there are all sorts of human and other factors.  When it comes to the practical application of that remedy it is never really satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> It is much better to define spheres of action straight away.  The word &ldquo;general&rdquo; in sub-section (2) should be omitted, when it would read &ldquo;subject to the direction of the council&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would strongly advise against the removal of the word &ldquo;general&rdquo;.  I think the words &ldquo;general direction&rdquo; ought to be left in.  I do not agree with Deputy de Valera.  I think that in the relationship between council and director the only suitable ultimate sanction is the sanction of parting company if they have lost confidence in one another.  I do not believe an institute of this kind can be run by a director who has lost the confidence of the council.  It would be much better for the council to say to the director: We cannot work together any longer.  We have no confidence in one another.  We had better part.  I would even go to the point of saying that if the director was not prepared to go they would have to take steps to remove him.  I do not believe it is a good thing to try to plaster up cracks in a confidential relationship such as should exist between a director and the council which is the ultimate authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one.  This Bill provides that the director will have immediate control of staff.  If the council of the institute are going to have day-to-day direction, they will be attempting to control the staff instead of the man whose job it is to do it.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out and as the Taoiseach pointed out before, when we were debating the last section, the council have the power to dismiss the second director&mdash;not the first.  The Government retain the power, under sub-section (9), to dismiss the first director but, like Deputy Dillon, I feel that the whole future of the institute depends upon the director and the institute working together, with the director bringing the council along with him by being left by the council to direct the daily work of the staff. Once a programme of research is decided upon, the director will carry it out, and see that it is carried out by <Col N="1107" /> the staff under his immediate control. If the council want to appoint a committee there is power to have the committee.  This section deals with the director.  Clearly, he has control of the staff, with the council giving the general directions.  I think that to go any further than that might be to create trouble instead of allaying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of staff that is involved here.  It is a question of the actual programme of work.  That is my concern in this matter.  If that work is construed as leaving a wide selection of programme of work to a director, I feel you will have conflict.  If you have a strong council, it will come to a head with the director and he will lose or the council will lose and leave the whole thing to the director.  I think you do not take on direct responsibility to the council; you do not make the council turn out and hire lab boys, or something like that, just because you give them the power to do it.  I strongly urge that there should be no equivocation about the subordinacy of the director to the council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any real doubt about it?  It seems to me that if the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; has any meaning&mdash;you can use it in a restrictive as well as in a broader sense&mdash;if it has any meaning it is that the council is in control, that if work is not being done the council thinks ought to be done in a proper way, they have a remedy.  As regards the first director, can you imagine that any Government would not listen to the council of the institute if it put up a case against the director, if the director was neglecting his duty, if he suddenly ran off the rails and was doing all sorts of wrong things which it was necessary for the council to complain against and really wanted to stop?  If he was not a fit and proper person, if such a mistake was made in the first appointment, then the council has a way out.  Surely the Minister for Agriculture or the Government would not be deaf to representations made in such instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you are trying to co-ordinate two things like this, all you can do is give a general indication and in the <Col N="1108" /> Bill it is that the council is there to draft programmes, to hear what the director has to say&mdash;he may have difficulties of various kinds which he may wish to refer to the council.  But the day-to-day running, looking after staff, supervising, in so far as he is able or wishes to do it, the researches taking place, that will ordinarily be a matter for the director.</P>
    <P>I come now to the subject of the part-time chairman.  I have in the back of my mind the possibility that the chairman would be a sort of substitute for a standing committee, that, from time to time the director might have to come to him as representing the council, to confer with him, to ask him about certain things.  As part of his work, I imagine, as a part-time appointee, he would be there for immediate consultation by the director if there is to be proper co-ordination at all.  But, in any legal document, I do not think you can go further than lay down the relationship that should exist between the council and the director that is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am very much against any attempt to try and make it more rigid.  I know that the argument is not entirely one way.  I know that the argument is to get rid of the word &ldquo;general.&rdquo;  But there is a difficulty in that.  On the one hand, the director may be self-opinionated and may not do things the council would wish to see done. Another difficulty, which is worse, is that you have the council meddling in things which ought not to be meddled with, and interfering constantly.  The director might therefore say: &ldquo;What is the use of my doing anything? These people fundamentally do not know what is involved.  They will not listen to me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You have two dangers.  First, you have the danger that if you do it one way you have the undue interference of the council.  Secondly, there is the danger of the director taking to himself powers beyond those which it would be right and proper for him to take.  I do not think you should define these powers more closely.  You have to depend on human relations in the long run.</P>

      <P>I think the Taoiseach is <Col N="1109" /> misled here and misunderstands the section.  He envisages that, in the event of a conflict between the council and the first director, the council would go to the Minister for Agriculture and explain the nature of the conflict and move the Minister for Agriculture to ask the Government to remove the director as an unsatisfactory collaborator. But the Government cannot do that in accordance with the terms of this Bill.  The Government can remove only the first director.</P>

      <P>They can remove only the first director for misconduct or incapacity. Suppose the council comes along and says: &ldquo;This is a very brilliant character.  He is as honest as the day is long.  The trouble is that to live with the saints in heaven is glory but on earth it is quite another story and we cannot get on with him.&rdquo;  If the Government tries to remove him, it is earthbound since he may <i>a fortiori</i> say: &ldquo;You have no power.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to do is to clarify the matter.  Let me recall again, this is not my section.  It is possibly because I had canvassed all these great difficulties that I finally came down on the side of having one authority who was both chairman of the council and director.  I assure the House the decision was arrived at only after long consideration of the kind of problem which Deputy Major de Valera has raised&mdash;the difficulty of resolving this conflict of authority between a director and a council, with a chairman.  However, I will revert to what I have already said.  No matter what you do, you run risks.  The best you can do is to minimise the risks as far as you can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> I think the Taoiseach is probably right when he says that the Bill as drafted goes as near to reducing the risk to vanishing point as possible but, again, I think the Taoiseach misdirects himself when he refers to the adjective &ldquo;general&rdquo; in sub-section (2). I think the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; in that context is restrictive.  I do not think that means that, in every respect and detail, the director is subject to direction by the council.  I think that if it was our purpose to effect that end then Deputy Major de Valera's proposal to delete the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; would achieve it.  If our purpose is to say: &ldquo;The council will lay down broad lines of policy and, if it considers any subject to be a matter of sufficient gravity to declare policy upon it, the director shall be subject to their control in that respect but, in the matter of day-to-day administration or detail or staff, the adjective &lsquo;general&rsquo; will be interpreted to mean that the director is independent of the council,&rdquo; I think that is a good arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose you eliminate it, have not you the other difficulty, the difficulty of undue interference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it seems to me that the whole idea is that this body of men will meet from time to time; they will not be there every day; their representative, the chairman, will have a sort of general overlooking, in their interest, generally keeping in touch, as chairman, to know what is happening.  If you give the council directly more detailed powers, there is the danger that they will be interfering with details that they ought not immediately to interfere with.  Again, I do not think you can do very much better than what you have here.  In every case where there are authorities and you give them any kind of freedom at all, you run up against certain difficulties. You have it in the managerial system and a number of other examples of that type.  As far as I am concerned, I would be willing to leave it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is that difficulty in the managerial system and, if <Col N="1111" /> one is to go by Deputies in the Dáil in the past on that, it would nearly be a word of warning.  I should like to point out that I have not suggested, when on Section 5, taking the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; out of sub-section (1) of Section 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be a council, to be known as the Council of An Foras Talúntais, to carry out the general government of the institute and the administration of its affairs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;general&rdquo; there is perfectly apt and perfectly proper but the trouble is this that here you have a statutory director.  If the first thing were visualised, that you would simply have the council running everything, then there would be absolutely no need to appoint the director in this Bill at all.  By virtue of the powers given in this Bill to the institute and to its governing council, it could very properly in law and otherwise be left to the council to appoint its own director, as it would probably do in any event in the nature of the thing.  Therefore, that being so, one has to ask what is the purpose of a statutory filling of that particular post, which could be very well, naturally, filled within the framework of the Bill without going into that detail here.  The only answer can be that this director is visualised as a statutory person.  He is given statutory identity and given, therefore, an importance which, <i>per se</i>, carries the implication of autonomy.  Now, if you leave the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; in there, I am convinced that there is the seed of conflict there and that the danger of a conflict there, from the point of view of getting effect for the purposes of this Bill, is greater than the danger of interference by the council and I am also influenced by this consideration: if you have two people there and their rights are defined and one person has rights over the other and they are defined, they can be perfectly friendly. For instance, if two people have a farm and there is a fence and it is clearly defined that the fence belongs to A and not to B, they live in perfect harmony as neighbours.</P>

I will guarantee not to take violent sides with either section of this monolithic Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Taoiseach to another aspect of this problem which it may be advantageous to consider at the same <Col N="1113" /> time.  I think he envisaged a situation in which the director might from time to time take counsel with the chairman as a kind of standing committee of the council.  If that is intended, it might be well to look again at the section which erects the council and consider investing the chairman with that authority to act in a consultative capacity to the director on behalf of the council between meetings of the council.  I do not urge that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not urge it but if the Taoiseach has that idea in mind that the chairman should so function, it might be well to indicate somewhere in the Bill that that had been thought of.  Otherwise, you might have a director in his own defence giving the chairman a pretty short answer or you might have the council, on the other hand, querying the discretion of the chairman of the council to have discussed the institute's affairs with the director divorced from the council over which it is his duty to preside.  I do not press the matter but, in examining this question of the relationship of the director to the council, I think it would be no harm to consider whether any more specific provision should be made for any interim relationship between the chairman of the council and the director.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 11, I have a certain difficulty.  This relates to the endowment fund.  I think, in fact, there is no difference between myself and the Minister for External Affairs, but I am bound to place this on record: In the discussion that I had, preparatory to the drafting of this Bill, with the American Ambassador I sought authority from the Minister for Finance, now Deputy Sweetman, and said to the American Ambassador on behalf of and with the full authority of the Government to which I belonged that if any additional funds were necessary faithfully and effectively to carry out the work of this institute, over and above what the income of the endowment would yield, the Government of which I was a member would certainly recommend the appropriation of such funds to Dáil Éireann within the limit of the resources of the Exchequer in accordance with the informed view of the Minister for Finance.  I believe that is the intention of the present Government but I would be grateful if the Minister for External Affairs could definitely reiterate that undertaking now or it may be that perhaps he would prefer to look at it and consider the terms in which a statement of that kind could be made on the next stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am bound to make that statement here and now, and had I been responsible for the introduction of that Bill it would have been my duty, as part of the case on which I recommended the Bill to this House, to state that it was an honourable commitment on the part of the Government of which I was a member and that it constituted a significant part of the discussions on foot of which the American Government agreed to allow £1,000,000 of the <Col N="1115" /> total gift to be earmarked as an endowment as distinct from their original proposal that the entire £1,800,000 odd should be appropriated to capital purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11, regarding the endowment, does not stand alone. The next section, Section 12, provides that where the council think their funds are short of their requirements and they have propositions for the expenditure of more funds than the endowment will yield, they have the right to approach the Minister and the Minister has the right to approach the Minister for Finance.  The matter will then be determined by the council, the Minister and the Minister for Finance, after consultation between each other. Certainly that section, Section 12, providing for giving right to the Dáil to pass by a Vote further funds, would not be put in if it had not been envisaged that the Dáil would be asked for an appropriate sum when the time arrived when it was required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only trying to help in clarifying the position.  I imagine that this is a residue over from the situation which envisaged the chairman of the council being the chief executive officer of the institute.  Then I suppose it appeared clear and logical that the council should appoint the staff even though the staff was to be controlled by the executive officer who would have been, in my version of the Bill, the chairman of the council.  But there is now a new element here introduced that the staff is appointed by the council but is subject to the director who is in a state of quasi-independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1956 Bill there is this provision: &ldquo;the members of the staff of the institute shall be subject to the general control and direction of the chairman.&rdquo;  Now the director has part of the chairman's functions.  Section 17 (2) provides: &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of the next following sub-section the members of the staff of the institute shall be appointed and removed by the council.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The next sub-section provides for the setting up of a board, but there is no provision that the director will appoint the stai.  It is the council that will select the staff and, if they are wise, if there is a big number of applications a board of selection will be set up by the council or by whoever is the appointing authority in order to examine in detail the qualifications of the applicants.  Of course, if a very highly qualified person was available they might know that and would not go through that procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to think this over.  It must be clear to him that the 1956 draft envisaged the director and the chairman being the one person.  Therefore the appointment of the staff by a council over which the director presides as chairman is quite a different proposition from the appointment of staff by a council of an institute whose day-to-day <Col N="1117" /> affairs, and especially staff matters, are controlled by a director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I only read out the 1956 Bill for the Deputy's information.  I think this is a good provision on its own without any reference to the old Bill or to anything outside the section itself.  It is right, I believe, that the council should appoint and remove the staff of the institute.  It is a protection for the director.  If people are badgering him about getting a position in the institute he should have somebody to consult in the matter.  When he has not the full power himself he can simply say he will put the matter before the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if the word &ldquo;staff&rdquo; is taken to include porters, charwomen, messengers and minor staff of that character, it is not suggested that their appointment should be reserved to the council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless common sense prevails I do not know of anything we could do here to settle it.  The council may be advised by the director upon whose recommendations they may not, however, be bound.  If they refuse to act on the recommendations of their director they will know what the natural consequences in many cases might be.  They will have particular cases in front of them upon which they may judge.  If the suggestion now advanced is adopted there would only be one way in which an appointment could be made and that would be through the nomination of some person by the director.  When a post falls vacant there may be certain applications and the board would have before it the director's report.  Then, perhaps a few members of the board will be technically qualified to examine the qualifications of the applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for that reason that this fits in with the framework of the Bill providing you have a controlling director such as any big company would have.  The director's position would be equivalent to that of the general manager of a large concern.  In a large concern the board would not be concerned with the employment of a charwoman.  That, however, <Col N="1118" /> does not mean the board would lack authority to appoint or remove that charwoman.  If this word &ldquo;general&rdquo; were removed, the position would be changed.  The whole position is bedevilled by the words &ldquo;subject to the general direction of the council&rdquo; in Section 7.  If the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; were omitted, everything would be all right.</P>

Any of us who has had experience of government knows that from time to time in the ordinary course of the discharge of normal duties some cross-grained person queries our jurisdiction.  When you consult with your advisers you find that you are exercising some power that was conferred on you in 1861 and that you have a clear statutory power for doing what you did in order to maintain order in the Department of which you were in charge.  We had such a cross-grained person in our employment for many years.  He was an old gentleman whom we sacked regularly and just as regularly he came back every Monday morning and resumed the even tenor of his way.  Of course, we had the Common Law right to discharge him in perpetuity.  I also <Col N="1119" /> remember the man who, when told he was to be discharged, said he would go on a hunger strike and he had his family dispatched to the country in order better to conduct his hunger strike.

      <P>I would not like to accept the Minister's suggestion at all. If, as I said earlier, we remove the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; from Section 7 (2) we will be making the director the general officer.  I think that would be fairly sound.  In other words, we would be making it clear that the director is the manager, the chief officer of the board.</P>

      <P>There is a problem in this context which has been experienced in the case of a number of other institutions.  It provides that the accounts shall be submitted annually by the council to the Comptroller and Auditor-General for audit.  That carries with it some sort of implication that the Public Accounts Committee of this House has some responsibility for certifying those accounts.  Then you are led into the complicated situation in which it is alleged against the Public Accounts Committee that, if they do their duty, they are trespassing on the rights of these institutions.  Take the case of the National Gallery, which enjoys a constitution not entirely dissimilar from what is envisaged for this institute.  It has its council, its director and its income.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General audits its accounts.  The accounts are brought to the Committee of Public Accounts, but supposing the Committee is not satisfied <Col N="1120" /> that the accounts are adequately and properly kept, what is the Committee to do?</P>

      <P>Might I interrupt the Deputy?  While I cannot detail them here, a number of boards, State companies and organisations of that kind, have their accounts examined and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General but they are not subject to review by the Public Accounts Committee.  When the accounts are audited, the Comptroller and Auditor-General certifies them and they are presented to whatever authority that board or State organisation is supposed to present them to.</P>

I think he is selected as the auditor by the organisation concerned as a result of administrative practice in the Department of Finance.  When the Comptroller and Auditor-General is specifically named in the statute I think the situation is different and the Public Accounts Committee comes into it.</P>

In the case of State accounts, accounts of Government Departments which are subject to the audit of the Auditor-General, when he makes his audit he also gives a report and sends the lot to the Committee on Public Accounts.  That is direct, but in this case the C.A.G. having audited the accounts of this institute presents them to the Minister, not to the Public Accounts Committee, to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  I think there is no doubt about it, but if there is I shall have the matter looked into.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 2 of the Schedule gives rise to a matter which I think I ought to mention.  The view was strongly pressed by the American Government that the members retiring <Col N="1122" /> at the end of a three year term should not be eligible for immediate reappointment. They had some idea that provided a desirable introduction of new blood into the governing body without disrupting the continuity of control.  I pressed the opposite view and in no matter did the Government of the United States unduly press their view upon us.  With great generosity they made available to us their best advice but with the equal generosity and decency that one would expect from them, they in no way tried to coerce our judgment in the matter when in respect of paragraph 2, I dissented from the advice that was very strongly tendered to us, and I expressed the view that a person who had served effectively should not be automatically disqualified from reappointment.  I would like the attention of the House to be directed to that, so that if there was a general review this opportunity should be taken to consider an appropriate amendment of the Schedule should the other view prevail.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1957&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for further issues from the Local Loans Fund in respect of local loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> The existing statutory limit on aggregate issues as fixed by the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1956, is £110,000,000.  The Bill raises this limit to £135,000,000.</P>
    <P>The fund was originally established on the 1st May, 1935, and issues from that date up to the 30th September, 1957, amounted to just over £93,500,000. Of this total approximately £75,500,000 related to loans for housing, some £50,000,000 being for the purpose of local authority housing and £20,000,000 for the purpose of advances under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. Over £14,000,000 related to sanitary and public health services and £3,750,000 to the provision of vocational schools and various other services.</P>
    <P>The commitments of the fund in the period from its establishment to the 30th September last aggregated almost £106,000,000, the excess over the figure for issues being accounted for by the fact that most loans are issued in instalments according as the particular works progress.  A sum estimated at £1,000,000 may, however, be deducted in respect of loans and balances of loans not now required because some works have either been abandoned or completed at a lower cost than first estimated.  This leaves the net total of commitments at the end of last September at some £105,000,000, or within about £5,000,000 of the existing statutory limit of £110,000,000 which, it is expected, will be reached in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, therefore, to raise the limit for issues from the fund and the new limit proposed is £135,000,000 which should cover commitments for a period of two to three years ahead.</P>
    <P>As is clear from the figures I have given, it is housing which has constituted by far the greatest demand on the Local Loans Fund and that demand has been of very considerable magnitude.  Major public housing programmes have now been completed or are nearing completion in many areas and, generally, requirements under this head may be expected to decline in the coming years.  It has, however, <Col N="1124" /> been necessary to continue assistance to Dublin and Cork Corporations which formerly raised the capital they required by independent borrowing. These corporations are placing a substantial additional burden on the fund from which they are at present drawing almost their entire requirements. Were it not for them, it would not be necessary to seek authority to extend the limit for issues so soon after the passage of the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1956, which, less than a year and a half ago, raised the limit from £90,000,000 to £110,000,000. I hope, however, that, in the not too distant future, some relief will be forthcoming here also through the resumption of independent borrowing and the completion of building schemes.</P>
    <P>Every reasonable relief must, indeed, be looked for so as to release capital for investment in productive enterprises contributing to a genuine expension in the economy and providing more and continuing employment for our people.  It follows, therefore, that all requests for loans from the Local Loans Fund must be examined very critically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the Bill was introduced in 1956 and enacted by the Oireachtas.  It was expected to carry sufficient sanction for a period of approximately three years.  Subsequent to the enactment of that 1956 measure, for the first time I think since the inception of the State&mdash;certainly for the first time for many years&mdash;I had to come to the assistance of Dublin Corporation and allow Dublin Corporation to draw on the Local Loans Fund.  I had to take similar action in relation to Cork Corporation because neither Cork nor Dublin would have been in the position of being able otherwise to finance their own housing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That departure from the previous pattern which I introduced soon after the passage of the 1956 measure has had the effect, as the Minister stated, of meaning that it was necessary for him to come to the House for a further sanction to increase the limit. I should like the Minister to give us so that it could be on the records of <Col N="1125" /> the House, some information about certain aspects of the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister will forgive me if I say that it was a little bit hard to follow the figures he gave when he mentioned them at the speed at which he did but we will have another opportunity on the Committee Stage, when I will have read those figures more carefully.  As far as I could understand him to say, about £50,000,000 of the issues already made of £93,500,000 had gone to local authority housing and about £20,000,000 had gone to private grant housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>£20,000,000 to small dwellings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Minister's pardon&mdash;small dwellings.  I am not quite clear whether the Minister in his figure of £93,500,000 and the subsequent figure of £75,500,000 for housing was speaking about allocations or about actual issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister, therefore, tell me whether I am correct in saying that allocations made to date were the total of £105,000,000 which he mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The £12,000,000 are in the machine, so to speak?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a greater sum than is normal in the machine.  I appreciate, of course, at once that the amount that there is normally of allocation, apart from expenditure, must vary.  Allocations, commitments, call them what you like, sanctions are needed and the local authorities concerned, naturally, do not draw the moneys they require until it is really necessary.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether or not there is anything unusual in that amount.  I should also like the Minister to give us, for the benefit of having it on the record of the House, the various periods of repayment for Local Loans Fund advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> There used to be an arrangement by virtue of which in respect of housing loans for working classes and labourers Acts, that is to say, housing directly by the local authorities, the period of repayment would be 50 years and in respect of the Small Dwelling (Acquisition) Acts the period would be 35 years, but in relation to that 35-year period for loans in connection with the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, I have a recollection that certain local authorities did not conform to that standard period.  I should like to know, therefore, whether the situation is that the 35 years for small dwellings is a fixed period or a maximum period.  The normal position in respect of public health, water and sewerage schemes used to vary somewhere between 25 and 30 years, and I think that for vocational schools the same periods operated.  The periods in respect of hospitals and dispensaries were, I think, normally 35 years.</P>
    <P>I was never quite satisfied myself as to why these various periods were fixed on such an entirely different basis.  It seems to me particularly hard to understand why the periods for direct housing differed so much from the periods fixed for small dwellings repayment loans.  I should have thought that the length of life of a house was going to be just the same whether it was a local authority applicant or a person with assistance from that local authority who was erecting the house. In fact, I think it would be fair to say that the person erecting his own house and caring for his own house is more likely to protract the life of the house than a person merely living in a rented house.</P>
    <P>We have had over the years two substantial variations from time to time in the interest rates payable in respect of issues made from the Local Loans Fund.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to give us the rates of interest which are payable for issues from the fund for, shall we say, the last two or three years, whatever period in that respect he has convenient to his hand.  Particularly I should like to know whether there is at present any variation in the interest rate charged to a local authority for its <Col N="1127" /> own direct housing as apart from its small dwellings requirements.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that amounts in Dublin and Cork had almost entirely to be provided from the Local Loans Fund.  I assume in that respect that he was referring to the existence of certain moneys arranged last year from the Irish Assurance Company, amongst other bodies, for the provision of £500,000 to Dublin Corporation.  Have any similar arrangements been made for Dublin or Cork which would ease the draw that there would be on the Local Loans Fund in respect of the current financial year or for the future?</P>
    <P>I think I am correct in saying that, in the year 1955-56, the last year for which I have the exact figures, the issue from the loans fund, excluding, of course, Dublin and Cork, for housing purposes was £6,570,000; sanitary and public health services, £1,830,000; vocational education, £90,000, and some £70,000 for miscellaneous purposes, making a total gross issue for that year of £8.56 million.  I should be glad if the Minister has available the amount that was so issued in 1956-57 and if he would give it to the House.  I should also be glad if he would give to the House the similar anticipated requirements for the current year.</P>
    <P>I think that the amount for 1956-57 and the current year 1957-58 would require to be adjusted by some £2,500,000 in respect of Dublin Corporation and some £750,000 in respect of Cork Corporation so as to provide a proper comparison with the earlier years.  However, it would be desirable to have that information and if the Minister has not got the information readily to his hand now I should be quite happy to have it on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Might I inquire from the Minister whether the figures he gave for issues &mdash;£93,500,000, £75,500,000, and so on&mdash; were in respect of the present time or up to the 31st March last?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>30th September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the local authority housing, there were also, previously, grants for housing <Col N="1128" /> under the Gaeltacht Acts.  I presume that those continue also.  Up to the 31st March last, I think the amounts so issued were £118,000.  I wonder what has been the issue since that time.  Up to the 31st March, 1956, the issues for local authority housing had been more or less equal as between urban and rural housing.  I think that up to that time, the amount expended on urban housing had been some £20,000,000 and on rural housing some £25,000,000.  It would be interesting to see how the trend of the proportions between those two had since varied and whether it appears in the future that the trend will be more or less of the same proportions.</P>
      <P>It is clear to us on all sides of the House that it is necessary to have an extension of the amount provided to date in the Local Loans Fund sanctioned.  I thought I might have heard from the Minister some indication of how he expected expenditure in general to run from this fund.  The Minister did give an indication that he was hoping there would be some relief for the fund by means of direct borrowing from Dublin and Cork.  One of the relevant factors, perhaps, there, is the new Trustee Savings Bank Bill which has been on the stocks now for some time.  However, apart from that, I think it would be desirable that the Minister should give us some indication, when he is giving the figures up to the 31st March last for that year, of how he considers draws from the fund will run this year compared to the original estimate, what he sees in the future and particularly what he sees in the future in relation to the trend of interest rates on the amounts that may be allocated from the fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the advance in the figures brought forward in the Local Loans Fund I should like to say that the housing programme in Cork is still far from being completed.  It will take a few years before it can be tapered off and, due to the non-availability of sufficient funds, about 40 operatives had to be dismissed recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last two local issues cost £8,150 and, in order to meet this, we shall have to raise a short-term loan or put <Col N="1129" /> 7d. in the £ on the rates.  Furthermore, the issues which were made at 97 now stand at 84, which is not an encouragement for local issues again for housing or other such purposes.  I think we shall have to depend largely on the Local Loans Fund.  There is also a difficulty in relation to the 35 years' term, to which Deputy Sweetman has referred, in regard to house purchase schemes for tenants.  If you want to avoid the impact of too heavy a weekly charge on the tenants and want to extend the period to a 40-year period, there is a difficulty about the availability of finance for houses for which grants are being made, and other things of that kind.  I should like the Minister to consider those two points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know whether it is the intention now to cater wholly for applications for housing and the other services mentioned from local authorities out of the Local Loans Fund.  There was, in 1956, a decision to tell local authorities to get moneys elsewhere, from the banks and from the insurance companies. I should like to hear from the Minister what were the results of that fairly new departure from the position which had obtained.  Does the Minister intend or visualise that in future all, or nearly all, of the money to be borrowed by local authorities will be provided out of the Local Loans Fund? If that is his view, can we take it that the other idea of having local authorities borrow from banks and insurance companies has been a failure?  What was the result of that policy while it was in operation?  How much money was provided to local authorities outside the Local Loans Fund by the bodies I have mentioned?  I would be interested to hear about that particular matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  The periods of repayment vary very much.  In fact, Deputy Sweetman gave them all and gave them correctly.  The period of repayment in local authority housing&mdash; these are all maxima&mdash;is 50 years; Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, 35 years; sanitary services, usually 25 years&mdash;25 years for small loans and 35 years for loans over £10,000; vocational schools, 25 to 30 years, also according to the amount; hospitals, 35 and dispensaries 35.  The only reason I can give for the difference is that the borrower, the local authority, is perpetual and the individual is not.  That is the reason why a longer term is given to the local authority than to the individual.</P>
      <P>In regard to the rates of interest, I could go back a few years.  I have figures going back to 6th October, 1952. At that time it was raised to 5¼ per cent. but local authority housing was not put up for some time afterwards &mdash;it was 3¼ per cent. but on 1st May, 1953, it was made 5¼ per cent.; on 1st January, 1954, 4¾ per cent.; on 1st December, 1954, 4½ per cent.; on 10th March, 1956, 5¼ per cent.; on 14th November, 1956, 5¾ per cent. and then, on 28th October last, it was raised from 5¾ per cent. to 6¼ per cent., except for Small Dwellings Acts and Gaeltacht Housing Loans, which were left as they had been at 5¾ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the end of this financial year.  That is as far as we are committed at the moment.  The total issues for 1955-56 from this Local Loans Fund were correctly stated by Deputy Sweetman at £8.56 million and for the financial year 1956-57, £11 million and the amount provided in this financial year was £13.98 million. I am sorry that I have not got a revised estimate of what may be issued actually for that year.  We should be able to get that in the very near future and, if possible, I will have some estimate of that next week.</P>

    <P>Deputy Sweetman is also right that these figures should be adjusted because <Col N="1131" /> last year and this year Cork and Dublin to a great extent have been looked after from the fund, with the exception, as the Deputy pointed out, of £500,000 secured by the Dublin Corporation from the Irish Insurance Company and £160,000 secured by the Cork Corporation by way of additional overdraft from the bank.  Apart from that, these authorities were looked after and the adjustment should be, in 1956-57 at any rate, £3.34 million for Dublin and £67 million for Cork.  Of course, if we take that from the amount issued and the amount allocated this year, it leaves a fairly level pattern also in the last four or five years.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that I have not got a very exact allocation of the expenditure between urban and rural housing by local authorities.  In 1955-56 it was, for urban, £1.33 million and, for rural, £1.89 million and in 1956-57, £3.60 million for urban and £1.93 million for rural.  I cannot give figures for this year.</P>
    <P>The only other question raised was one by Deputy Cunningham with regard to whether we are continuing the practice of getting local authorities to raise their own money as far as possible. All I can say is that, if any local authority can raise capital on favourable terms, it would be very welcome but I do not think they will get very much that way.  We are taking a realistic view of the matter and we are assuming that they will not get anything substantial in that way and, for that reason, are providing what we think is the total amount required. I think that is all I have to say on this stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion <Col N="1132" /> that Seanad Éireann as it is at present constituted should be abolished. (Deputies Dr. Browne and McQuillan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>During the discussion on the last occasion, in referring to a number of propositions for a scheme of election of a Seanad, I mentioned a number of possible ways in which a desirable and effective Seanad could be elected.  I mentioned one after the other, largely in order to dismiss them as impracticable.  During the course of the enumeration, I mentioned the suggestion that the Seanad could be picked by lot.  That, as I said at the time, struck me as being one of the best suggestions that had been put forward.  I also felt that it was a very poor and a very undesirable suggestion if it had been made seriously, and going back through the debates it is clear that the proposition was made seriously. I was unable to give the reference at that time to the Taoiseach and I would like to remedy that defect now.</P>
      <P>This question arose, as I say, out of the proposition that a Seanad should be elected by lot, a Seanad which would be composed of distinguished persons, artists, writers, poets and politicians who would finish their active life in politics, persons who had grown old in the service of the State in one way or another.  I attributed this proposition to the Taoiseach and the reference, I would like to tell him, is column 1852, Volume 52, of the Official Debates of the 25th May, 1934.  The Taoiseach, then the President of the Executive Council, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think Deputy MacDermot on a former occasion suggested that we should get it by lot.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is, a Seanad of distinguished persons and old persons.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not think that people are satisfied to get things in that way, but I do believe with Deputy MacDermot that a system of lot is much more likely to secure the type of Seanad we have in mind when we are thinking of this ideal Seanad, than any of the ordinary systems of election or selection.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> Then at column 1855 of the same Volume he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The system of lot then comes along.  I have given, perhaps, as much thought to this matter as any member of the House.  Thinking over all the various alternatives I have seen put up, or that would suggest themselves to me, I honestly believe that if you did want a Second House, the system of lot would be the best you could get.  If you could, for instance, have some sort of modern equivalent of the ancient censor where you would have certain people who had achieved certain offices, certain positions, entered on a panel and agreement as to the type of office that would qualify for admission to the panel, and if periodically you put the names on the panel into a hat, and picked them out, you would probably get a better Seanad than you would get by any system of nomination.  If we do believe that a Second Chamber is necessary, or that it is advisable to have these wise people to apply a check when a democracy is running riot, some such system as that would be more likely to achieve the results we have in mind.  But, again, is it worth all the fuss?...  Do you think that these people are going to be less affected by political prejudice than the ordinary person who is elected?...</P>
    <P>Then you come to the question: is it wise to have this sort of power or control resting altogether in the hands of people who are spent?  They are spent people, people whose energies are gone.  We ought to ask ourselves this question: what is the best type of Legislature?  What is the best type of Government?  Is it government by spent powers or is it government by active minds and active people who want to achieve something, who want to make this world somewhat better....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He concluded:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a world of conflicts.  So it seems to me, at any rate....  I doubt very much whether, if government is in such hands, in the stress of modern times our country would be likely to fare as well as when we have government by people who are <Col N="1134" /> active, and when the controlling forces are in the hands other than those of the old.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to dismiss as a serious proposition the idea that you could choose or should choose a Seanad by lot.  It seems to me, therefore, after all the examination, that one is left with no reasonable or satisfactory alternative but to come to the conclusion that the Seanad is a body which should be abolished.  All of us who have respect for the whole democratic ideal are, I am sure, very loath to touch on or in any way reduce the machinery of democratic government.  Consequently, we are possibly slow to interfere with what we have come to accept over the years as a satisfactory system of bicameral government.  I believe that it has been proved in the event that we have no need for this system of bicameral government and that in suggesting that it should be abolished we are moving along the path towards democracy, true democracy, that is, government through the expressed will of the people in its elected representatives.</P>
    <P>We have in our own time seen the last vestiges of privileged rule of this kind being changed in the last 30 years, the removal of the anomaly of university franchise, the extension of adult franchise, woman suffrage.  All these small gains, real and definite gains towards the establishment of true democracy, have been made without any noticeable weakness or vitiation in any way of the whole democratic process. These are a direct sequel, in my view, to the taking away of the hereditary rights of government, stemming right back to the old discredited idea of the divine right of kings.  I would urge therefore that we have no alternative to accepting a unicameral system of Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to support that point of view with a quotation from Deputy Lemass as reported in Volume 51 of the Official Report.  He was speaking on a proposal for the removal of the Seanad.  I agree completely with what he said.  He said:: &ldquo;We are going to make democracy triumphant.&rdquo;  It had been suggested there might be a dictatorship as a result of the removal of <Col N="1135" /> the Seanad.  To this Deputy Lemass said: &ldquo;If there is going to be a dictatorship it will be by a majority of the Irish people.  It is about time that the Irish people become masters in their own country.&rdquo;  Supporters applauded that and he concluded: &ldquo;This is a Bill that makes them masters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on, at column 1874 of the same volume: : &ldquo;The pretence that is a wall or bulwark for democratic institutions is puerile.&rdquo;  That was in 1934.  It is as true to-day as it was then.  Many contributions were made by speakers on both sides of the House at that time.  The curious thing to-day is the near-unanimity with which speakers on both sides of the House forecast the problem that we are dealing with to-day.  Very definitely the Opposition Speakers&mdash;Deputies Costello, McGilligan and various others &mdash;said in 1937 that we could not provide for a satisfactory Seanad, that any Seanad elected under the Constitution and according to the rules drawn up would be a political Seanad &mdash;a political mirror image of this House.</P>
    <P>I do not think any objective examination of the operation of the Seanad to-day could leave us in doubt that it has confirmed all their worst fears.  It is an over-elaborate, complicated, useless, futile and pretentious body.  I do not think it makes any real pretentions to be a non-political body.  As a result of the action of the electoral system the vocational bodies have been practically completely driven out of representation by the activities of the various political Parties.  All political Parties are to blame in this respect. The Seanad is there and the leaders of the Parties manipulate the Seanad to suit their own ends.  It is in the interests of the whole idea of democracy and of democratic Government that the pernicious, corroded, devitalising influence of the Seanad, and in particular of the Seanad election process, should be removed from the arena of public life in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any doubt in most people's minds that it has brought democracy into disrepute in the eyes <Col N="1136" /> of the public and even in the eyes of our own people here.  I am not to be taken as saying that there are not some fine Senators.  Personally I have no objection to any of them at all.  There are some men who would grace and add lustre to any deliberative Assembly. However, they are the exceptions.  We know that the general run is that the Party leaders decide, following the general elections, who shall be the Senators.  In many cases persons who have been before the public, who have put their viewpoint to the public, who have offered themselves to the public for election to this House and have been rejected by the public are the persons who are then put in by the back door to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>In that way it seems flying in the face of the expressed public will and wish in regard to these particular people.  It seems to me that the machine is now being operated largely by the Party bosses for their own special ends.  The last Seanad cost £161,000.  We can fairly say that over such a period that sum, or a fairly considerable portion of it, is divided nearly evenly between the Party leaders to be handed out in one form or another to the different helpers, henchmen, hangers-on and political rejects of one kind or another whom they decide to reward for their services at election time.  That £161,000 is taxpayers' money and I think it is a gross misuse of that money to spend it in that way.</P>
    <P>In particular, it seems clear that to give to a Taoiseach, any Taoiseach, the right of electing or nominating 11 Senators is a very dangerous power to put into the hands of any one man. I know the reason why it is done.  It is in order to give him a majority in a House that could delay his legislation. I disagree completely with the powers of the Seanad to delay legislation even for 24 hours.  I think it is a repudiation of the rights of this House.  I think it tends to vitiate the whole democratic idea in public life because of the power that right to nominate Senators confers on an individual.  I believe it is one of the factors that tends to weaken democracy if all of us in public life become beholden too much to any <Col N="1137" /> one individual.  That individual, if we accept that domination, holds too much power over us and many may find it necessary to maintain silence in controversies, discussions and debates whether in Party, in public life or elsewhere, in order to merit approval and win reward or preferment of one kind or another.  I think that is one of the important factors which corrupts, not only the individuals subject to that benevolence, but also the person who is in a position to hold out rewards for conformity, for silence.</P>
    <P>Because of my dedicated belief in and adhesion to the whole idea of democracy I think that anything censoring discussion, debate or fair criticism in any way weakens, undermines, and finally must destroy the true fabric of democratic government in any society.  The whole form of Seanad election has made too big a contribution to that enervation and disinterest in public life, to the seeming political amorality of many persons in public life, to be allowed to carry on.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear somebody, ex-Ministers or Ministers, trying to make the case that they have any respect for the Seanad.  One of the most notorious facts is the difficulty Senators find in getting a Minister to go in and listen to them on motions that have been put down for discussion and debates on legislation.  Their difficulty is to get a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary to bother his head to go into the Seanad.  On one occassion recently a Minister interrupted a Senator in the middle of his speech in order to make his own speech.  I suspect that particular incident showed a disrespect for the individual Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We may not discuss the proceedings of the Seanad even on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concluding on that point but I think the main thing the incident showed was the contempt which the Minister had for the Seanad as a deliberative body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Seanad is not indispensable.&rdquo; For that statement, for its certainty and correctness, I am indebted to the present Taoiseach.  As far as I am <Col N="1138" /> aware during the time when the Seanad was abolished, some of the best legislation that has ever gone through this House was promoted and passed without any advice or delay, or any revision or contribution whatsoever from the Seanad.  In deciding to abolish the Seanad we are not deciding to do something drastic and, even if we were, I think I should still advocate it. But we already know we can get along well without a Seanad and that there is no necessity to have one.  I believe we cannot afford the luxury of a Seanad.  It is an expensive pet to maintain.  It can be dispensed with without harm to the whole democratic idea and nothing but good could come from its abolition.  Because of the increased responsibility, the increased confidence which the people would place in it and the benefit which members would themselves derive, I think the stature of this House would be increased and that the whole community would benefit.</P>
    <P>Like many others, I have given much thought to the idea of an alternative body to the Seanad, but I do not believe there is any necessity for a second deliberative public Assembly, and there is no reason why anybody should waste time trying to devise such an alternative.  The only possible advantage I can see, the only thing that could add to our deliberations is to have whatever advice one can get from the vocational councils or the committees which have been nominated or elected from time to time.  I have personal knowledge of the value of the National Health Council, of which I was a member for a time and in which very many interests were concerned.  The trade unions were represented, the medical profession, the politicians, the nursing profession, persons interested in insurance questions, and public health officers of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>We had many meetings which I personally found very stimulating and particularly interesting.  We argued many points on controversial issues and, as a result of our discussions, considerations were forwarded to the Minister.  Sometimes he accepted them and sometimes he did not.  That is his right, but I felt it was a useful set up as long as it maintained that <Col N="1139" /> simple and straightforward function of considering and discussing without any powers at all, beyond the powers to recommend.  Let me be quite clear on that.  It should have no executive functions at all or any vocational groups.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it must be possible to establish committees such as a national health council for the Department of Health.  These advisory committees for the different Government Departments would have the right to see legislation on its introduction to the House, make recommendations in regard to it and also see the same legislation after the Second Stage or the Committee Stage and make further recommendations.</P>
    <P>I think there is no doubt at all that the vocational groups and the different vested interests have as much access as they need.  Professions, trades or trade unions of one kind or another who because of their knowledge might have a special interest in legislation coming to the House, have a right to put their point of view before Government Departments.  There is no curb on that right to advise or to recommend changes of one kind or another.  I do not think it is at all necessary to maintain the expensive incubus of a Seanad in order to get that advice, either by memorandum submitted by the different bodies or through the advisory committees which I believe could do a useful job.</P>
    <P>Certainly, that seems to me to get over the big disadvantage of the alleged value the Seanad can give in its advisory functions.  At least, a council like the National Health Council has all the different persons directly associated with the problem of health at its disposal and, consequently, the advice is something worth listening to. As I said before, the advice of a Senator-engineer on a health problem is about as useless as the advice of a Senator-doctor on an engineering point.  Consequently, it seems to me that the best value could be obtained for this House, in helping us to legislate as intelligently and as fairly as possible, by having elected committees <Col N="1140" /> of persons who would have a special interest in any legislation that might derive from a particular department.</P>
    <P>I believe that any fair-minded Minister would be glad to have the advice of persons who might be prepared to act in an advisory capacity.  I think that legislation might derive certain value from such advice.  However, I do not think that we should have any inferiority complex about getting rid of the Seanad.  It seems to me to be the last vestiges of the old idea of a hereditary Second House, a House of Lords.  If we take proper precautions to establish pre-conditions to a democracy in our society we can well legislate here for the benefit, and in the best interests, of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>I must draw again upon the Taoiseach's statements in the past because, of course, the fate of our motion is largely dependent upon the attitude of the Taoiseach to that motion.  Consequently, I feel that his point of view must be made quite clear so that if he has altered that point of view, which he has a perfect right to do if he wants to, we shall get the value of the opinions that he has and any new opinions he holds on the matter of a Seanad.  But there is no doubt at all that in past years he had no hope that we would ever be able to create a Seanad, a Second House, which would give a body of any real value to us, no matter how hard he tried.  That, of course, creates a very complicated problem but possibly he might not think so.</P>
    <P>As far back as I can go, I find that in relation to any remarks made by him in regard to Senates he has been opposed to them.  He has been very clearcut and strangely unequivocal in his condemnation of Senates right from 1928, as I quoted before, to 1934, when he abolished the Seanad.  In Volume 51 column 1461 of the official Dáil Debates he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... I had hoped it might be possible to arrive at some form of Second House which would have distinctive characteristics of its own...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> I feel that action has got to be taken.  I, for one, have not been able to devise a solution, nor has any solution been offered, for the problem of a distinctive Second Chamber so constituted that one could depend upon an independent judgment on public affairs, on any public matters that would be submitted to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 1828 he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There seems to us to be no valid reason why a considerable sum of money should be spent annually on a Second Chamber.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 1816 of the Dáil Debates of 24th May, 1934, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Therefore let us get rid of this farce, that there is any check like that.  Let us forget about it and let the people forget that it is a check and let the people and us here concentrate on making the direct representative Assembly the type of Assembly it should be.  Let us get the best we can and let us not be fooling ourselves with the idea that, if we have a Second Chamber, we are going to be better off.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was right on every occasion.  On 7th October, 1937, as reported at column 353 of the Official Report, the present Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think on one occasion I said it was beyond the wit of man to construct a Seanad that would be really satisfactory.  I did not even say an ideal Seanad, but a really satisfactory Seanad...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another very important statement, which I should like to develop later on, is to be found in Volume 52 of the Official Report.  The present Taoiseach said it seemed to him that there is only one way of avoiding the dangers which the advocates of a Second House have in mind, and that is to educate our people politically and make them understand the consequences of their acts at election time.  It is the obvious remark, with which I am in complete agreement.  He said that he had spent a considerable time in considering the matter and asking himself how a Second Chamber could be constituted which would be really effective.  He <Col N="1142" /> said he had examined any suggestions he came across in his work on the matter or from those whom he asked to consider it.  He said he had seen no suggestion that, in his opinion, would warrant the expenditure of public moneys in putting it into execution.</P>
    <P>At column 1814 of Volume 52 of the Official Report, he is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Seanad we conjure up as an ideal is impossible of attainment or even approximate attainment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have not read out these quotations in order in any way to irritate the Taoiseach.  I have read them out because I agree with practically every word he said on that occasion.  He may still hold those views as firmly to-day as he did then.  I only hope so because I think the logical act arising from that would be to do what he did in 1934, that is, abolish the Seanad.  All those statements which I quoted were made in 1934.</P>
    <P>Then again, in 1937, as reported in Volume 69, column 289 of the Official Report, when he was reconstituting the Seanad, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the arguments that I put forward here on previous occasions with regard to the Seanad still have their full weight.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again he reiterated his views of 1934, as reported in the same column:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the Constitution was before the Dáil I made it quite clear that we were not the Party who believed that an ideal Seanad could be got.  We believed that any Seanad that could be got was going to be very far indeed from the ideal, and we were far from favouring a Seanad which was going to be a reproduction of the primary House.  To our mind a Seanad was going to be of very little use if we were going to have in the second branch of the Legislature exactly the same political controversies or antagonisms and the same political Party manæuvring as in the first House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, he was quite right.  That is what has transpired.  There is no substantial difference at all in the political make-up of the Dáil and the Seanad.  So far as having any controversy <Col N="1143" /> at all in the Seanad is concerned, and it seems to me to be precious little, it comes along practically identical lines to those we find here.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the Taoiseach will approach this motion in an objective way, I think he is faced with a curious dilemma.  That is how it seems to me.  I can go only on what I have read. He may be able to correct me if I have been wrong in any case.  However, it seems to me he is faced with the odd dilemma of having been right in his statements over the years, in his fears over the years, in his analysis of the futility of the Seanad, in his analysis of the impossibility of getting an ideal Seanad, in his fears even to attempt an ideal or near-ideal Seanad.  On the one hand, he has been shown to be right in all his forecasts and in all his prophecies&mdash;correct in so far as it has not been found possible to get even a near-ideal Seanad.  As a result of all our best efforts, genuine and sincere efforts, no doubt, to get an ideal Seanad, it has been found to be impossible. That is the position on one side.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been right the whole way through.  The only inexplicable thing is why, in the face of all that overwhelming evidence to the contrary, he still has continued to retain this futile incubus of a Second House which is nothing but a considerable expense on the country.  I think it is fair to say that it is the Taoiseach's own creature.  It seems to me from reading the debates that he gave a tremendous amount of attention, care and thought to the body which is now the Seanad, the electoral system whereby the present Seanad is constituted.  Therefore, naturally, pride of parenthood may make it very difficult for him to be as objective about it as I should like him to be.  However, it is possible that he will rise above whatever prejudices he may have in favour of the Seanad, in view of the fact that he went to so much trouble to try to create it or to create an ideal Seanad.</P>
    <P>I think that if there were no other reasons&mdash;and there are even more compelling reasons&mdash;the financial or <Col N="1144" /> economic one seems to be a compelling reason for the abolition of the Seanad in these times when we are asking the people to economise, when the price of bread and the essentials of life has been increased, when we are curtailing our health services because of expense. It seems wrong that we should do so and still continue to pay out a considerable sum of money each year for the maintenance of this futile body.  I have no illusions about the difficulties of creating the ideal unicameral system of Government, but I think it is possible to do so.  It has been fairly shown by many speakers other than I, over the years, that the Second House is quite unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach, the President of the Executive at the time, was right when he said that, in an attempt to get the democratic unicameral type of Government, it seemed to him that there was only one way of avoiding the dangers which advocates of the Second House had in mind and that was to educate our people politically and to make them understand the consequences of their acts at election time. Of course, that is the essence, it seems to me, of our problem.  Assuming that the Taoiseach believed that, and I am sure he did believe that to be true, that education was so terribly important to the evolution of an intelligent democracy or to an effective democratic system of government&mdash; that is as true to-day as it was when it was said in 1934&mdash;from it arises the question why he took no steps to try to ensure that we did create in the Republic what would be a literate or properly educated democracy.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest dangers to our whole system of democratic government, of course, is the fact that such a high percentage of our people, because of no fault of their own, find it very difficult indeed to judge the merits of the different political questions which come up for consideration from time to time, simply because of the fact that over 90 per cent. of them get little or no education whatsoever after the age of 14 years.</P>
    <P>To me the whole story of the Seanad's life history since 1922, and particularly the Taoiseach's part in <Col N="1145" /> relation to it, is a most puzzling enigma.  I have been unable to reconcile the extraordinarily clear-cut, unequivocal statements condemning this Second House with the curious action in retaining it over the years.</P>
    <P>All political figures of any stature, no doubt, are considered in different ways by society.  Many historians, in trying to consider this problem, will wonder at the curious attitude, the curiously capricious actions of the Taoiseach over the years.  Perhaps, to help us to decide whether he really believes in the whole democratic system or idea of government, he could explain to those of us who know these things merely from reading why he did find it impossible at one time to accept the decision of the elected representatives of the Dáil in 1922, an attitude which led to the disastrous civil war, and then the curious decision to accept the democratic idea of coming into the Dáil and deliberating, discussing and debating, as he did&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point is on the question of the Seanad itself. Could he tell us why it was he found it possible, in 1934, to abolish the Seanad and to give first-class reasons as to why he abolished it&mdash;and I agree with every one of them; I would have voted, if I were there at the time, with him for its abolition&mdash; but then again, curiously repeating his earlier <i>volte-face</i> in these very important matters, and deciding three or four years later, to accept the idea of the Seanad and its utility and, having regard to all the jeers and the ridicule that he poured on the people who believed in a Seanad&mdash;I do not&mdash;and all the arguments, reasonable arguments, some of them slightly unreasonable, how he came again completely to reverse his whole approach to the very important fundamental problem of the democratic idea of government?  I must say I would be very glad if he could give us any explanation for what seemed to me at any rate to be a rather incomprehensible inconsistency <Col N="1146" /> with very complicated and damaging consequences in at least one instance.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to make it clear that the Labour Party supported the abolition of the Seanad.  Deputy Norton at that time pointed out that it was the policy of the Labour Party as far back as 1922 and that they had made it clear that they were opposed to a Seanad.  I would be interested to know whether that opinion still holds.  Deputy Norton repeated his stand against the Seanad in 1937, when he told the President&mdash;column 312, Volume 69, Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I should personally prefer the President to have stood where he did some time ago when he abolished the Second House.  No case whatever has been made in the meantime for the continuance of the Second House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He pointed out that none of the disasters which were prophesied as inevitable when the Seanad was abolished had materialised.  There seemed to be almost complete unanimity in the House not to establish a Second Chamber, or at least not to establish a particular type of Second Chamber, but the Bill went through all its stages and a Second Chamber was established. That is another curious enigma beyond my comprehension.  Presumably the Opposition had no choice but, at the same time, the matter does need some explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Taoiseach accepts this motion he will have the full support of the people.  In the eyes of the people the Seanad is a completely discredited body.  It is an unnecessary expense on the taxpayer and the people would be delighted if the Taoiseach were to repeat his action in 1934, when he looked into his own heart and found out what the people were thinking; they told him they did not want a Seanad then.  I believe that if he were to repeat that action to-day he would get exactly the same answer.  I do not know what he did in 1937 in order to find out whether or not the people wanted a Seanad.  The Constitution was ratified and it included provision for a Seanad, but I do not think the people accepted the Constitution because <Col N="1147" /> there was provision for a Seanad in it.  I think they accepted the Constitution in spite of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I believe there is no reason in the world why the Seanad should be retained. I believe the people would be completely behind the Government if it were decided to abolish the Seanad. I made it clear in my opening remarks that we were not anything like as radical as the Taoiseach in his youthful exuberance when he abolished the Seanad, and I should like to reassure him that, if he has any idea we would not support him in its abolition now, he would be entirely wrong in that belief.  I said we wanted the Seanad abolished as at present constituted. That, as it happens, is the same wording which the Taoiseach used prior to his abolishing the Seanad, and it is, therefore, quite possible for him to abolish the Seanad under this motion. There is nothing one could do to the Seanad as at present constituted which would render its maintenance worthwhile in our present state of democratic development.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; and substitute: &ldquo;that the existing method of selecting the members of Seanad Éireann should be amended.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have listened for two hours to Deputy Dr. Browne giving his reasons why the Seanad should be abolished, and he concluded by saying that, were the Taoiseach to accept the motion and abolish the Seanad, he and the seconder of the motion would support him.  Neither the Taoiseach nor this House can abolish the Seanad.  Let us be clear about that.  To abolish the Seanad we would have to have a referendum and amend the Constitution. That is the legal position, and Deputy Dr. Browne's two-hour speech on the abolition of the Seanad is, in my opinion, in no way appropriate to the  motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy quoted at considerable length from past pronouncements of the Taoiseach as to the reason we should not have a Second House.  He referred to the <i>volte face</i> on the part of the <Col N="1148" /> Taoiseach in 1937.  Now, we in Fine Gael have been consistent in this matter. All down the years we have believed in a Second House, but we do not think that the present method of electing or selecting the Seanad is a good one.  We think it could be improved and that is the reason I have put down this amendment.</P>
    <P>If there was a debate on the merits or demerits of a referendum, then we could go into the merits and demerits of a Second House but, as that is not the purpose of the motion, I do not think we should go into this matter at this stage.  All I want to say is that we, in Fine Gael, believe in a Second House and the Taoiseach, after mature consideration, agrees with Fine Gael in that.  This is one time in which the Taoiseach admits he was wrong, and we welcome that admission from him. It is not often we get such an admission from the Taoiseach and we welcome it therefore on the rare occasion on which we do get it.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Local Government in the Cabinet of which I had the privilege of being a member, I had taken certain steps in relation to the Seanad. The Government considered the matter and certain steps to improve the method of election or selection were put forward.  In theory, the method of selecting as adumbrated in the Constitution was a good one but, unfortunately, we have departed very much from the original idea and from the theory which the Dáil and the people approved.  I shall give a recent example of what I mean.</P>
    <P>No less than ten days ago there was a motion before Seanad Éireann:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann is of opinion that the Solicitors' Remuneration General Order, 1957, should be disallowed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That motion came before the Seanad. It was moved by the Leader of the House and spoken to by the Minister for Justice.  His speech occupies exactly two columns of the Official Report.  Other speakers spoke against the motion and their speeches occupy over 100 columns.  Apart from the Minister, not another speaker in the Seanad spoke in favour of the motion. Nevertheless, that motion was steam-rolled <Col N="1149" /> through the Seanad.  Obviously there is something wrong in Senators becoming &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; men. On the opposition put forward there were good reasons why the Order should not be accepted but, with only one spokesman in favour, whose utterances occupied less than a page of the Official Report, these &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; men rolled into the Lobby in opposition.</P>
    <P>If we could get back to a proper vocational method of election or selection to the Seanad, it would be a good thing.  Deputy Dr. Browne gave a good example of his experience through the National Health Insurance Council.  If organisations like that selected or elected members, we would be getting somewhere.  We have non-political organisations which could elect representatives and which have sent to the Seanad Senators who contribute very usefully to the debates in that Assembly. But the present method of electing Senators needs drastic overhaul in my opinion and, as I have said, I, as Minister, took certain steps to advise my colleagues in the Government of methods whereby mush-needed improvements could be made.  I note that the present Minister relinquishes the portfolio which he holds, but I hope his successor will consider and submit proposals to his colleagues for the amendment of the method of election.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House further on this matter.  Deputy Browne spoke for two hours, but his entire speech was on the abolition of the Seanad. To abolish the Seanad, we must amend the Constitution by referendum and any contribution which I could make to a debate on whether we should have a referendum or otherwise is not appropriate to the present motion.  I recommend to the House the acceptance of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. First of all, I desire to point out that the motion put down, and spoken to for so long and in such an immature way, would require amendment of the Constitution.  I understand that amendment of the Constitution would cost about £250,000.  I suggest there is a much less expensive way of rectifying whatever is found wrong with the Seanad than by the expenditure of such a sum for such a futile purpose.</P>
      <P>Article 19 of the Constitution allows to be made effective the amendment which Deputy O'Donnell has mentioned, that there should be another method of electing the Seanad.  Before I go on to talk about methods proposed before which might be considered again, I should like to point out there is a considerable amount of public mystification with regard to the waste alleged in connection with the Seanad.  I heard the figure of £151,000 quoted.  I understand the Seanad costs from about £30,000 to £38,000.  I understand that if one-quarter of the administrative expenses which are down in the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas are attributable to the Seanad, the cost of the Seanad might rise to £50,000.  That is the full amount that might be saved if the Seanad were abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some years, there has been disquiet regarding the Seanad.  In 1934, it was abolished.  In 1936, a commission was set up to inquire into a scheme for a Second House.  In 1937, about this month 20 years ago, a parliamentary committee was set up to deal with this report.  About ten years afterwards, another commission was <Col N="1151" /> established to consider the working of the Second House and to consider amendments, either in its election or system of work, which might be desirable.</P>
    <P>Again, it is proper to get into the framework of this discussion the exact powers which the Seanad has.  There has been a certain amount of hysteria with regard to the undemocratic character of the Second House.  I prefer to take my stand with political philosophers right down the ages to the present day and also the practice of modern States.  From the great Aristotle down to Edmund Burke and Esmien, a very celebrated French jurist, there has been a unanimity of opinion with regard to the necessity for a Second House.  I take that view in comparison to what has been described as a place for political rejects who have been cast out from any Parties.</P>
    <P>I take experience.  When this was last discussed, I think the calculation was that there were about five States in Europe that had not a Second Chamber.  Three of these were Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the three Baltic States which were swallowed up by Russia.  The fourth was Bulgaria, which also disappeared behind the Curtain.  The only other one was Spain.  I do not know whether Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Spain will be regarded in this House as the models we should found ourselves on rather than the rest of Europe.  In America, the situation shows greater unanimity than in the situation years ago in Europe.</P>
    <P>What is undemocratic about a Second House?  What are the powers the present Seanad has?  They have certain delaying powers with regard to legislation.  They can delay a Money Bill for three weeks and they can delay a Bill that is not a Money Bill for three months.  That is the beginning and end of their power with regard to legislation.  They may initiate Bills other than Money Bills and other than Bills to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>They have two or three other small powers, some of which may become of <Col N="1152" /> importance but only on critical occasions, which are not likely to arise very often.  They play a part in the impeachment of the President, if that should ever come to happen.  When war and invasion happen they have, with this House, the right of passing a resolution which brings about a national emergency.  Under conditions established in the Constitution that right may be claimed.  They exercised that right when the last Great War broke out, and such conditions can be brought to a finish only by a resolution saying the emergency is over.  In that the Seanad must play a part.</P>
    <P>Those are powers which are very rarely exercised&mdash;the impeachment of the President, of which we have no example, and the declaration of a national emergency, of which we have one example.  Outside of that, the Seanad have a useful power given to them as a way of saying that a minority could assert within a certain reserved limit a particular right with regard to legislation.  An Article of the Constitution empowers a majority of the Seanad and one-third of the members of this House to request that legislation should be sent by the President to the people for a referendum, on the ground that the legislation is of such national importance that the will of the people should be taken into account on it.</P>
    <P>Those are pretty nearly all the powers the Seanad have.  They also have a power&mdash;perhaps I should have mentioned it earlier&mdash;in relation to the removal from office of a judge.  If a judge is to be removed from office on grounds of stated misbehaviour or incapacity, he can be removed only upon resolutions passed by both Houses, calling for his removal.  The resolutions must be established to the satisfaction of both this House and the Seanad.  The same thing applies when the Comptroller and Auditor-General has to be removed.  He goes out also, on a vote declaring him to be guilty either of stated misbehaviour or incapacity. That vote has to be passed by both this House and the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Having enumerated those points&mdash; and those are all the points that could <Col N="1153" /> be said with regard to the Seanad&mdash; I want to ask what is undemocratic in allowing a body, if it were appropriately constituted, to take part on these rare occasions in the exceptional matters I have mentioned, and to have the power to delay Money Bills for three weeks and ordinary legislation for three months.</P>
    <P>I consider there should be a Seanad. I have always maintained that attitude with the members of the Party to which I belong.  We have exercised ourselves from time to time in trying to secure that there would be something in the nature of vocational representation in respect of the Seanad, and the Constitution contemplated that there could be a change over from the ordinary system of election to the system of vocational representation.</P>
    <P>Article 19 of the Constitution allows &mdash;in respect of those who come from the panels in the ordinary method of election&mdash;43 in number&mdash;a substitution to be made of those who might be elected by direct election by vocational or functional groups, associations or councils.  That is provided for in the Constitution and it is along those lines that we previously had tried to move to get an amendment of the situation in regard to the Seanad and that is what is on foot in respect of this amendment, which Deputy O'Donnell has moved.</P>
    <P>There have been many efforts.  The panel system was achieved by the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1937.  There have been attempts often to get a change in the position. The attempts go along four lines. There is the situation in which at the present moment people are elected on this system of panels&mdash;five panels representing different interests.  There has been introduced into that the other complication of the two sub-panels&mdash;the panel which is nominated by the nominating bodies and the panel set up by members of the Oireachtas.  There have been efforts made to establish in respect of these sub-panels two things.  One is that there should be either a minimum number of people chosen from each set <Col N="1154" /> of sub-panels or else there should be a fixed number to be taken from each of the sub-panels.  There has also been the suggestion, and I think the better one, that the nominating bodies alone should nominate for their own particular panel.  The fourth and best of all these suggestions is that the nominating bodies should elect those who are nominated on the sub-panel where they are allowed to make the nominations.  Any of these suggestions can be adopted, still keeping inside the Constitution and quite in accordance with Article 19 of that document.</P>
    <P>In 1937 a committee was set up to consider this matter.  I was asked by my own people to put forward suggestions. I put forward suggestions for having the panels replaced by vocational councils.  Some of those panel groups were not easy of replacement by a functional council, but an effort was made.  It is not necessary to have an ideal scheme of functional councils in order to have a correct replacement made from the present system of election. We succeeded to some extent, but where the scheme broke down was that in those days the agriculturists of the country were not organised and the best that could be suggested at the time, in 1937, was that there should be a new register made of all landholders, whoever was registered proprietor of any farm lands, that those people should be entered on a special register and they should elect the 11 people to come from the Agricultural Panel.  The farming community is better organised now.  There are many organised bodies of farmers, and these people could be regarded as the organised agricultural body and they could represent the functional council and could give us the full representation by substituting for those who would come from the Agricultural Panel.</P>
    <P>It was easy enough to deal with Labour in those days&mdash;except that it was said that not merely organised Labour but unorganised Labour should be represented.  There was a scheme for that.  There was a scheme for the Cultural and Educational Panel.  It was quite easy to get bodies of that type to function.</P>
    <P>With regard to Industry, and those <Col N="1155" /> groups allied with industry in the Constitutional panel system, it was easy enough again to get a group who could be regarded as those who would not merely nominate but would elect to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The one which caused a considerable amount of difficulty was the last of these panels, that which deals with Administration and certain social matters. Even there, although no one could say it was an ideal scheme, it was found possible to get groups which, after a bit, would have grown and multiplied and made additions to themselves; and one could have got a very good functional representation even through that rather vague group mentioned as No. 5 in the panel system.</P>
    <P>In 1937 that scheme was proposed and in the committee of 15 a particular resolution, that I myself backed, secured a majority.  We carried it by eight to seven.  An attempt was made by the then Government supporters to have that reversed, but whatever was then proposed was beaten by the same majority; it got only seven votes to eight cast against it.  At that point, we were in this difficulty, that the end of the Session was coming near.  The committee met for one of its final sessions, I think, about the 4th November, 1937.  It had been agreed by all Parties that the legislation with regard to the Seanad had to be got through before the Christmas Recess of that year.  In this situation, there was such divergence of opinion that it was agreed that nothing could come from the committee.  Therefore, the committee reported back that it had come to a standstill.  But if it had come to a standstill, the last vote taken was one in favour of the proposal which the Party that I belonged to had put up. Our own views with regard to how a permanent Seanad should be constituted were left over for later consideration.</P>
    <P>The present Tánaiste, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, said he would take on himself the responsibility of putting up proposals for a different type of Seanad from that which we had proposed.  But in the rush of the times, he simply wrote a <Col N="1156" /> letter to the chairman of the committee to say that he no longer desired to carry on this task he had taken on himself, that he did not propose to put in any scheme for a new type of Seanad; and he added that he did not think that, then or at any other time, would it be possible to have people so grouped along functional or vocational lines as to form a proper background for a new type of Seanad.  On that note&mdash;and it was only on that note&mdash; there was reluctant acceptance of the proposals which eventually emerged and which are the legal background to the Constitutional provisions of Article 18.  I say it was with great reluctance these matters were accepted.</P>
    <P>I heard the Labour Party mentioned here to-night.  Deputy Norton, as far as I remember, had something like 30 or 40 amendments to the scheme proposed, which is now the panel electoral system.  However, time was pressing &mdash;it was agreed the legislation had to be through before the year 1937 came to an end&mdash;and with a considerable amount of hesitation, and with no one really liking it, the particular scheme which still stands now, was evolved.</P>
    <P>I want to say that it was accepted because of the rush of the time and it was accepted because in those days it could not be said that it was possible to get all the panels filled by direct vote of various functional groups. Some of them could have been so filled and some of them were quite ideally situated to act as proper nominating bodies and electoral colleges; but there were certain groups about which that claim could not be made.  Deputy Lemass, the Tánaiste, took the attitude that it was not possible then, and he did not think it would be possible for many years, to have this country developed along functional lines, so that a Seanad could be voted for in this way.</P>
    <P>I believe that the situation has changed very considerably.  The group which causes most trouble, when trying to get a scheme of functional representation, is the farmers' group. They are organised in different sections, but certainly they are so well organised that one possibly can get four or five groups who could, by an <Col N="1157" /> amalgamation, give us, either by separate schemes or as one group, the 11 people who nowadays are elected to the Seanad from the panels representing agriculture.</P>
    <P>I say we are now surely at the time when it is possible at least to make some change in the Seanad.  It might be wrong to depart from a purely elected Seanad as far as the 43 members are concerned and go off to a functionally representative group; but it is possible, as they are already divided along the two sub-panels, to have an approach made to get some sort of vocational or functional Seanad.  The nominating bodies sub-panel, say, could be elected.  Let there be some minimum or maximum associated with the members who are elected in the panel system and let those on the nominating bodies sub-panel, nominated by certain nominating bodies, be elected by the nominating bodies or elected by some group of a functional type equivalent to the nominating body we now have.</P>
    <P>I think the time has come for some change in the Seanad, thought up in haste&mdash;the whole scheme was very confused and not properly understood&mdash; and only accepted on account of the emergency which had arisen towards the end of the year 1937.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, and in accordance with the notice I gave this afternoon, I am now raising the subject matter of Questions Nos. 18 and 19 on the Order Paper for the 21st November, 1957.  These questions and the answers to them are to be found in Volume 164, No. 6, in columns 950 and 951.  The first question was to ask the Minister for the Gaeltacht:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If he will state whether he has made any Order or Orders or given any direction or directions that firms, shops, business houses or private persons be not supplied with goods, for cash or otherwise, by the Gaeltarra Éireann section of his Department while there is any amount <Col N="1158" /> whatsoever due and owing by the said firms, shops, business houses or private persons on foot of goods already supplied under the circumstances heretofore obtaining.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied to that question in Irish, saying, &ldquo;Ní dhearna mé&rdquo;, which, as I translate it, and I am sure the Minister, the House and the country will accept, is &ldquo;I did not give any such direction, I did not make any such Order or Orders&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>By way of supplementary question, I asked the Minister if he was aware:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that there is a practice obtaining whereby people who owe sums, however small, are not being supplied with Gaeltarra Éireann goods!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister again replied in Irish saying, &ldquo;Níl an t-eolas sin agam&rdquo;, meaning, &ldquo;I have no such information&rdquo;. I replied, &ldquo;That information should be got by the Minister forthwith&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister in the meantime has requested the officers of his Department to furnish him with that information.  If the Minister did not make any such Order or give any such direction, and if he has not that information, he should know by now that practice is obtaining in Gaeltarra Éireann.  At least one firm has been refused Gaeltarra Éireann goods on the basis, the simple basis, that the firm owes Gaeltarra Éireann money.  That would seem to me to be a departure from the ordinary rule and practice of business.  If people desire to sell their goods they must give them to a willing purchaser.</P>
    <P>There may be a reason from time to time why a purchaser, however willing, might not be supplied by reason of the fact that he would not have cash to pay for goods, but, in the case I am referring to, this firm owes Gaeltarra Éireann this year something over £800.  As a token of its good will, having been hit by the recession of late 1956, which is continuing to some extent to the present time, that firm did its utmost by way of good will to pay sums to Gaeltarra Éireann on foot of the account which was due. Those sums ranged from three payments of £100 to one of £50 and they <Col N="1159" /> requested Gaeltarra Éireann to supply the firm with goods for cash.  The reply given to this firm was, &ldquo;We will not supply you with goods for cash because you owe us money.&rdquo;  What better way could be had by Gaeltarra Éireann to get their money back than to furnish goods for cash that might be sold at profit, so that out of that profit this particular firm would be able to pay its debt to them?  The Minister, I am sure, will be able to explain why, on the 21st November last week, he did not know this practice was obtaining, and will be able to explain whether he approves of it as a business proposition.</P>
    <P>In Question No. 19, I asked the Minister for the Gaeltacht:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;if he will state the amount due and owing to the Gaeltarra Éireann section of his Department by a firm (name supplied) on each accounting date in the months of June, July, August, September and October, 1957, and, further, if he will state whether goods are still being delivered to the said firm, and, if so, whether on a cash or credit basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied again in Irish saying: &ldquo;As the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, I, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, propose to circulate it with the Official Report.&rdquo;  It was duly circulated&mdash;a small statement covering five items for the months of June, July, August, September and October.  That could not be given to me by way of oral answer in the House.  It had to be put in the form of a tabular statement in Irish for two specific purposes.  I submit it was in Irish so that the general interest would not be sustained, and it was put in the form of a tabular statement so that I would be debarred from raising a supplementary, on an answer for which I would have to wait until the Official Report was circulated.</P>
    <P>For the month of June the figure given was £591 6s. 9d. as due and owing.  Deputies will be aware that for some time past I have been concentrating in this House on asking a series of questions on the management <Col N="1160" /> and conduct of affairs in Gaeltarra Éireann, generally and particularly. I have asked those questions in English to gain for the whole subject matter the publicity which I think it deserves in the public interest.  I have been answered in Irish to prevent that publicity being obtained, and to shield the particular type of conduct and management which I wish, in the public interest, to have fully and frankly exposed.  I put this question down deliberately in the form in which I did, using the phrase &ldquo;due and owing&rdquo; which is a legal phrase, to see exactly how far the Minister was prepared to go in his reply to keep the point of the matter from the public. I regret to state the Minister forgot he was making a legal reply to another legal person, when he should in fact have been directing his attention in a like manner to giving that information, not to me alone, but to the House and the whole country.  He said the amount owing for June was £591 6s. 9d.</P>
    <P>Everybody will realise there is a practice in business whereby accounts are not collected until a certain time elapses, but if within that time the purchaser pays, he can avail of certain discounts offered by a particular firm or business such as Gaeltarra Éireann.  Of course, the Minister has seized on the opportunity to say that until that time elapses with regard to certain sums that were owing they would not be put down as due and owing in the legal sense.</P>

      <P>The answer was given to me deliberately to mislead the House and I am sure in an effort to mislead me, but the Minister forgot what his predecessor, the Acting Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Lynch, said in reply to the debate on the Estimate for the Gaeltacht, on 25th June last.  He was being pressed with regard to this same company which is owned&mdash;except for the technical business of one share&mdash;by the agent whom I, as a result of a departmental inquiry, dismissed for his conduct from Gaeltarra Éireann, and who was reinstated, <Col N="1161" /> by quibbling, by the Minister's predecessor and over which the present Minister proposes to stand.  The Acting Minister spoke in respect of the same company about which I asked the question last week and then the Minister's answer was £591 6s. 9d.  Now, of course, it will be interesting to note whether that was paid between 25th June and the accounting date, or what the accounting date is.</P>
      <P>In any event, here is the reply given by the Acting-Minister when closing the debate on the Estimate for the Gaeltacht.  At column 1207, Volume 162, No. 9, Official Report, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The current amount due by that company to Gaeltarra Éireann is, I understand, £9,370.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a long shout from £591 6s. 9d. I have no way of finding out, except by parliamentary question, which I did not ask, what the accounting date is each month.  I have no way of finding out whether that portion that makes the difference between £9,370 and £591 6s. 9d. was paid in the last days of June this year.  What it is sought to hide in this case is that the amount concerned was only the mere figure of £591 in June so that the public will not know that the credit given to that company is as it was on June 25th, according to the Minister's predecessor, up to the amount of £9,370 &mdash;£370 over and above the capital issue of this company, even if, indeed, it is subscribed, and without any knowledge of what other commitments that company has, and so as to keep from public knowledge the fact that the people of this country, through the Parliament and the Department for the Gaeltacht, are financing a company and paying the interest on that money which should be paid by the company itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the object of my question and the Minister fell into the trap of &ldquo;due and owing&rdquo; which I freely confess I set for him in this question to see how far he was prepared to go in using the legal terms in order to keep from the House and the public the exact position.  Here are the remaining figures for the months of July, August, September and October: <Col N="1162" /> £1,790 18s. 6d.; £346 11s. 6d; £1,504 17s. 6d.; £1,500 12s. 5d.; and it ends: &ldquo;Tá earraí á sholáthar don gcomhlucht ar chairde go fóill &ldquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are goods being supplied on credit to the company still.&rdquo;  But the man who owed the mere £800, of which £350 has been paid since last March, will not get credit and his case is placed in the hands of the Chief State Solicitor in order to collect the debt.</P>
    <P>The Minister knew a thing or two about that when he answered the question last Wednesday.  He did not know this type of business practice obtained in his Department.  What does he think of it now&mdash;refusing credit to the small man and giving this unlimited credit, to the tune of £10,000, to the company that is owned by an agent of Gaeltarra Éireann and to which reference has already been made in this House, a company that is financed, in effect, by a Government Department? The goods are stored for this agent in Westland Row whence he does not have to remove them until he gets customers.  Would we all not love to be directors of a company so easily financed, the backing for which is easily got in a Government Department?  If that £10,000 were used in the Gaeltacht areas, it could put 60 more workers into employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister had better give us the full figures for those months.  The amount due was £9,370.  Will the Minister say that that figure was wrong in June or will he say it was correct?  If it was correct in June, will he give us the appropriate figures until October in each month?  That is the situation I have found it necessary to bring to the notice of this House.  It is a situation arising from the deliberate attempt to mislead the House, first of all, by the use of Irish, which I regret to say does not get the publicity it should, and then by the use of a tabular statement which was circulated so that I was denied the opportunity of raising the matter there and then, and indeed in the hope that it might not be raised any other time.</P>

      <P>It seems extraordinary to me that when Deputy Lindsay puts a question framed by himself, as he <Col N="1163" /> has been proud to inform us, in a legal, way when he gets the answer he asks for, he wants to hold up the House on the Adjournment.  He told us he deliberately framed this question in the terms in which they are here, as to what was &ldquo;due and owing&rdquo; on the accounting periods in different months.  The Deputy knows quite well, and knew quite well when he put down that question, that there is a difference in the figure which may be &ldquo;due&rdquo; and may be &ldquo;owing&rdquo;.  There may be a debt owing, but it would not be due until the payment date came along, if for instance, the custom of merchants in that business were to give a month's credit or two months or five weeks' credit.  The Deputy asked for information as to what sums were due and owing on these accounting dates and, having got that information, comes in and tries to convince the House that there is something extraordinary missing when he gets the correct answer to the question he asked.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy is suffering from some kind of persecution mania in this matter if he thinks that I am trying to keep any information from him. I shall answer any question that the Deputy puts to me on this subject.  I have answered truthfully the question I was asked here in the form in which the Deputy put it to me.  Now he tells us that it is different information he wants to get.  If he wants different information, let him put down a question and not waste time here to-night in pursuance of his long assaults on Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy was rather misleading in his supplementary question.  He asked me: &ldquo;Is the Minister aware that there is a practice obtaining whereby people who owe sums, however small, are not being supplied with Gaeltarra Éireann goods?&rdquo;  He has quoted an instance and I know the particular individual to whom he refers but, in his own words, in the area from which he comes from and I come, £800 is not regarded as a very small debt.  If a man in Mayo is &ldquo;in the red&rdquo; to the extent of £800 with his shopkeeper, I do not think the shopkeeper would <Col N="1164" /> regard it as a very small debt.</P>
    <P>What are the facts in connection with the one instance which he gives? The facts are these: the total debt due and owing in February, 1957, by the party to whom the Deputy refers was £878 11s. 11d.  There was no payment received, even on account, from this much maligned man from the previous September in 1956 and, in fact, part of this sum of £878 11s. 11d. was outstanding since January, 1956.  Gaeltarra Éireann started to bring pressure on this valuable customer in February of this year.  Every effort, including threats of legal proceedings, to make this man pay up what was lawfully due, was made without very much success.  Ultimately a number of promises were made by this gentleman that he would pay this long outstanding and overdue bill, but like many promises made by people who are &ldquo;in the red&rdquo;, they were broken.</P>
    <P>This gentleman still owes Gaeltarra Éireann £542 14s. 3d., and the matter had to be referred to the solicitors of Gaeltarra Éireann to endeavour to collect this debt.  This is the case that Deputy Lindsay says is a most appalling one, that this individual whose debt goes way back to the beginning of 1956&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the specific instance given by the Deputy on which he bases his allegations. This very valuable customer, whose debt runs back to 1956 and out of whom the officers of Gaeltarra Éireann have been trying to screw the money for nearly two years, comes back&mdash; and I give this gentleman full credit; he should be sitting on the benches opposite&mdash;and notwithstanding that story, demands goods for cash.  &ldquo;Forget about the old dog,&rdquo; he says.  &ldquo;Leave it there.  I want goods for the cash I am going to pay to you over the counter, and completely ignore my indebtedness to you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Any business man who would carry on in that way would not be very long in business.  As I told the Deputy in reply to his question, there is no rule or direction given generally in Gaeltarra Éireann to refuse to supply goods for cash.  No firm in the world would do that.  The only two instances that I could find in the whole history of the commercial transactions of Gaeltarra Éireann of refusing people goods for cash was one of a bankrupt who &ldquo;codded&rdquo; them out of £600 and had the neck to come back afterwards and demand to be supplied with goods for cash; the other is this gentleman about whom Deputy Lindsay is so concerned but in respect of whom the officers of Gaeltarra Éireann have been trying to collect their money over the last two years&mdash;</P>

Would the Deputy go out to his friend that he mentioned here and ask him would he please, even now, after all this time, in the interest of the tax-payers pay up this £542?  I assure the Deputy, if he succeeds, I shall insist on the officers of Gaeltarra Éireann sending him a Christmas card when the time comes.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the number and net tonnage of tankers, including their repeated voyages, that entered and cleared from ports in the State from and to Great Britain during the years 1954 to 1956, inclusive, distinguishing between ships with cargoes and in ballast, and the number and net tonnage of such vessels classified by nationality.</P>

      <P>The particulars sought by the Deputy are not readily available since the customs documents from which the shipping statistics are compiled do not show explicitly whether or not each vessel returned is a tanker.  In the circumstances, perhaps the Deputy would be good enough to repeat the question in a month's time.  In the meantime the Central Statistics Office will see how far the information required can be extracted from the data available.</P>

      <P>The following table shows the particulars required in respect of 1956.  As the shipping statistics are not normally compiled in this detail the preparation of similar statements for 1954 and 1955 will take some time, and arrangements have been made for them to be sent direct to the Deputy by the Central Statistics Office as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the number and net tonnage of vessels, including their repeated voyages, that arrived at and departed from the port of Dublin from and to Great Britain during the years 1954 to 1956, inclusive, distinguishing between ships with cargoes and in ballast, and the number and net tonnage of such vessels classified by nationality.</P>

      <P>The following table shows the particulars required in respect of 1956.  As the shipping statistics are not normally compiled in this detail the preparation of similar statements for 1954 and 1955 will take some time and arrangements have been made for them to be sent direct to the Deputy by the Central Statistics Office as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of the years 1954 to 1956, inclusive, (a) the c.i.f. value of imports consigned from Britain, (b) the f.o.b. value of exports consigned to Britain, (c) the estimated freight content of (a), and (d) the estimated amount of freight paid on (b).</P>

      <P>The trade statistics for 1954-56 were not compiled by reference to country of consignment and it is not therefore possible to state the exact particulars required in parts (a) and (b) of the question.  The trade statistics show imports by country of origin and exports by country of final destination and the following table, showing trade with Britain in 1954-56, is compiled from this source:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Owing to the absence of data, no reliable estimates can be made for parts (c) and (d) of the question.  Since in the Trade Statistics imports are valued on a c.i.f. basis and exports on an f.o.b. basis it is not necessary for Balance of Payments purposes to obtain explicitly figures for freight (except for the net freight earnings of Irish shipping companies), and particulars of the freight charges in respect of traffic with Britain are not therefore available.</P>
