      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 45) (Amendment) Order, 1957.</P>
      <P>The House is aware that Orders made by the Government under the Control of Imports Acts require confirmation within a period of six months.  This Order will expire during the Recess if the motion to confirm it is not passed now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the Order is to bring within the scope of the Control of Imports Order men's and boys' pyjama cloths which have more than 90 threads to the inch in the warp.  When the quota Order was being prepared it was decided to exclude from its scope certain finely woven materials which were not manufactured in the Irish mills and to confine the Order to the heavier cloths, striped flannelettes, produced by the Irish mills.  There has, however, been a substantial importation of these flannelette cloths which were brought outside the scope of the Order because they contained more than 90 ends per inch in the warp and it is considered desirable, after consultation with all the interests concerned, to bring these cloths subject to control. <Col N="1485" /> The extent of the quota will be, as usual, determined in consultation with the interests concerned, but it is considered necessary for the protection of the employment given in the Irish mills to extend the scope of the Quota Order to cover this type of cloth.</P>

There is no such cloth made as pyjama cloth.  How can you identify it and say that it is pyjama cloth which is used only in the manufacture of pyjamas?  How do you describe it as pyjama cloth?</P>

      <P>For the purposes of the Order, it is defined as cloth with a certain woven texture.  The definition in the Order is quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it is not just pyjama cloth.  It is a cloth and how do men's and boys' pyjamas come into the Minister's brief?  The cloth is not pyjama cloth; it is cloth of a certain texture.  Can this cloth be used for anything else if the person declared that he intended using it for men's and boys' pyjamas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to control the quantity of the cloth and not the quality.  The control will be exercised by giving licence under the quota Order to manufacturers and it is intended that the quantity they import will have a stated relationship with the quantity of similar cloth produced by Irish mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>How will the Minister use the Order?  The question of men's and boys' pyjamas have nothing to do with the Order at all.  It seems to me that no matter what the cloth is to be used for, it will still be subject to control and whether it is for men's and boys' pyjamas or not has nothing to do with the Order.  I want to make sure that this Order will not be used in such a way that somebody can import the cloth by declaring that it is not intended for use in the manufacture of men's and boys' pyjamas and then use it for that purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that this is a flannelette cloth of a character which is ordinarily used in the manufacture of nightwear.  Is it intended now that nobody will be allowed to make these <Col N="1487" /> garments on the domestic sewing machine?  I should imagine that in this country at the moment half the nightwear is manufactured in the home. People do not buy the made-up garments which are relatively expensive. If imports of this flannelette are to be confined to the manufacturers, does the House seriously suggest that no countrywoman in Ireland with a family of children can buy flannelette for the purpose of making pyjamas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>She can, of course. There is quite a considerable production of this cloth within the country and the amount produced last year came up to 200,000 square yards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister feel that the domestic production will be adequate to provide material for the domestic manufacture of these garments? I imagine that what the Minister has in mind as pyjama cloth is the cloth with the broad stripes alternative in colour and white, but I know that a very large quantity of plain coloured cloth is used in the home manufacture of these garments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These quota Orders were defined to bring within their scope only the types of cloth manufactured here and to leave outside their scope the kind of cloth which it was necessary to import.  They are being altered as the manufacture of cloth here has increased.  That situation has now arisen in regard to these pyjama cloths and the possibility of increased production of such cloths here has arisen.  If it is found necessary to import such cloths to meet home requirements, quota licences will be issued for the importation, but, as the production of the Irish cloth increases, the importation of the outside product will be reduced.</P>

      <P>Not in the law as it has operated since the war, but, as I explained on the Second Reading, before the war, there were a number of companies which had special Acts relating the charges to the dividends they paid on their shares.  A long time ago, the charges ran out through the top of these arrangements.  They would be completely impracticable to-day, but nevertheless they would automatically come back into operation if we did not enact this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will be administered by An Bord Fáilte.  I think the Minister made a grave mistake in the changes he made in the personnel of An Bord Fáilte in taking off that body the present President of the Irish Tourist Association.  It is an undoubted fact that tourism, tourist resorts and the name Killarney have the widest possible connotation abroad. It was very regrettable indeed that the President of the Irish Tourist Association, who is the charman of the urban council in Killarney and represented the interests of tourism around there, should have been taken off the board <Col N="1490" /> by the Minister.  It was an unwise step and it was particularly bad when it was done for the purpose of putting on the board a Dublin hotelier.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister's answer to the question I asked yesterday was honest.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the person he substituted is a member of the National Executive of Fianna Fáil.  I do not think anything the worse of him for that because I do not believe in the view some people hold that it is a good thing not to be in politics.  I think it is a good thing to be in politics, but the Minister would have served his purpose far better if he met the question honourably yesterday.  It was a very bad thing indeed that the Minister should have made this substitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to second what Deputy Sweetman has said.  It was a great pity the Minister decided to terminate the appointment of the chairman and the other members. These members did their jobs as well as they could.  I agree with Deputy Sweetman that it would be quite a mistaken view to suggest that, because a man participates in the public life of this country, he should therefore be avoided as a pariah.  I agree with Deputy Sweetman that the fact that one of the men appointed is prominent in the Fianna Fáil Party is in itself no block to his appointment to a position of responsibility; on the contrary, it may well commend him to the public as somebody prepared to pull his weight in public life.  However, I regret very much that the impression should be created that when persons come forward to undertake for very restricted remuneration responsible public work and do their job honestly, conscientiously and well, with every change of Government, their appointments are immediately terminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may be a reason why you will not get people who are eligible for appointments of this kind to accept them at all.  You cannot anticipate that people will accept them for ridiculously inadequate remuneration, if they are to be exposed to this kind of affront.  I think it is true to say that the chairman of this board functioned for about one-eighth of the <Col N="1491" /> remuneration paid to the executive director.  He made no bones about that because he thought he was contributing to the public good.  When a man has done that, it is not becoming that his services should be arbitrarily rejected in the way which was followed in this case.  I think Deputy Sweetman is right to avail of this occasion to refer to this aspect of the situation and I trust that this kind of procedure will not be persisted in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first point raised by Deputy Sweetman, I want to put him right as regards the facts.  When the present Bord Fáilte organisation was set up in 1952, I made an arrangement with the I.T.A. under which I undertook to appoint as a member of An Bord Fáilte one person nominated by them from a panel of three persons to be submitted by them.  That practice has persisted ever since.  Mr. Downing, whom the Deputy has in mind, was a member of An Bord Fáilte by virtue of the fact that, having been nominated by the I.T.A., he was appointed by my predecessor. On this occasion, the I.T.A. did not nominate Mr. Downing and under that arrangement I was confined to making a selection from one of the other three names put forward by them.  The person so chosen was not a Dublin hotelier.</P>
      <P>When we reconstituted the board on the expiration of their term of office, there was no question of removing any member. The board's term of office had expired and I had the responsibility of renominating the members or making changes.  One person I put on the board is a Dublin hotelier to whom Deputy Sweetman referred.  He was a previous President of the Irish Tourist Association and had been a member of the board from its inception but had been removed from membership by the previous Government. I thought they had made a mistake in removing him.  I cannot assess what their motives were.  The person in question is outstandingly competent in this particular field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the chairman, I do <Col N="1492" /> not think it is desirable that I should attempt now to justify the change I made in that regard.  It would involve something more, perhaps, than extolling the merits of the present chairman. While I felt that a change in the chairmanship was desirable, I did not feel it was a suitable arrangement to have renominated the outgoing chairman as an ordinary member, nor do I think it was desired by himself. I feel certain that, knowing the individual concerned, nobody would think that the nomination of the present chairman was made with any idea but to get the best qualified person in the country for the position.</P>

      <Col N="1493" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,800,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for certain Transport Services; for Grants for Harbours; for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1952, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933)); for certain Protective Equipment for Ships; for certain payments in respect of Compensation, including the cost of medical treatment (No. 19 of 1946); and for the Coast Life Saving Service.&mdash;(Minister for Industry and Commerce.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this Supplementary Estimate was adjourned last night, I was referring to some aspects of the unfair competition which C.I.E. has to meet in the operation of its road freight services &mdash;this unfair competition which has bedevilled the success of C.I.E. in that sphere of its operations down through the years.  I was referring in particular to the fact that, in the main, the people against whom the C.I.E. road freight department have to compete are people whose vehicles are manned by crews who are paid very low rates of wages; are compelled to work extra hours on duty without any overtime pay and whose conditions of employment generally are not at all comparable with those payable by C.I.E. to the people manning their lorries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One way of giving C.I.E. a fair crack of the whip to enable them to compete on equal terms with their competitors would be for the Minister to establish a joint labour committee for road freight transport under the Industrial Relations Act.  The establishment of such a committee would result in the <Col N="1494" /> prescribing of set rates of wages, conditions of service and all people, whether C.I.E. or other concerns, would then have to compete for the available traffic on the road on equal terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the illegal haulage which, of course, is one of the chief difficulties confronting C.I.E. There is no need for me to outline at any great length the extent to which illegal haulage is being operated in every county and town in Ireland. Every Deputy with an eye in his head must be well aware of it.  The Minister knows the extent of it and I know it. He indicated that he hoped, by administrative action, to combat the illegal haulage activities of the people who are engaged in it at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that, in the very first instance, he will have to allocate to that duty a greater number of Gardaí.  The detection of illegal haulage is a very difficult job for the ordinary Garda stationed in our country towns.  The law itself is very complicated and the Gardaí are reluctant to bring people into court. Several devices are used to get away with illegal haulage.  My information is&mdash;and I am open to correction&mdash;that in the whole Republic the number of Gardaí specially allocated to this duty is only two.  Only two members of the Garda are allocated specifically to the detection of illegal haulage.  That appears to me to be a preposterous situation.  It is better to have none at all than expect such a small number of men to make any impact on this illegal practice.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister, when he comes to make a decision in regard to the administrative measures he hopes to employ, to make quite sure it will be easier for the ordinary Garda in the country to detect illegal haulage.  I suggest that all commercial goods carrying vehicles should be issued with trade plates by the carriage department and that each vehicle should have prominently displayed on it the name, the address and the business.  In that way, you would get away from these nondescript lorries one sees at every fair and market in our Irish towns which are obviously operating illegally. <Col N="1495" /> These are some of the administrative measures that I feel might be helpful in combating what the Minister obviously regards as the very widespread practice of illegal haulage.</P>
    <P>Turning to the road passenger side of the C.I.E. undertaking, I must join issue with the Minister.  He stated&mdash; and quite rightly&mdash;that the kernel of the problem is the existence here of an excess of transport facilities.  I agree with him, but I cannot then sort out in my own mind, if the Minister holds that view, why he made arrangements whereby foreign coaches can operate extended tours in Ireland during the tourist season.  The position up to now appears to me to be that C.I.E. were handling that branch of our tourist industry in a very efficient way.  In comments by people who have come here on holidays, I have heard nothing but praise for the C.I.E. tours.</P>
    <P>These tours were operated with specially-designed coaches built at Inchicore.  They provided extra employment in their building and in their operation.  I felt that that was a field of our transport endeavour and of our tourist traffic endeavour that was wide open to expansion.  C.I.E. appeared to be making quite a good thing of it.  The revenue accruing to C.I.E. from that type of traffic was not inconsiderable. I cannot see why the Minister should then change his horses, so to speak, and allow foreign coaches to come in here, manned by foreign crews, to take over this part of our transport industry. I do not know what good will accrue to our transport industry or what good will accrue to our tourist industry by having foreign buses, manned by foreign crews, coming here and foreign couriers with, perhaps, Cockney accents describing the beauties of our countryside and its historical connections to the tourists. There must be some reason which influenced the Minister on that matter. He should make that reason known to this House and perhaps reconsider his decision in the light of further representations.</P>
    <P>So far, I have pointed out what this House might do and what the Minister might do to help C.I.E.  We all <Col N="1496" /> realise that there are many things which C.I.E. themselves can do, many things which they have neglected to do and many things which it behoves them to get &ldquo;cracking on&rdquo; as quickly as possible.  In one part of their report, the Committee on Internal Transport said there was a regrettable absence of friendly co-operation between the management and the trade unions.  It is obvious from that that the committee realised the importance of good relations between the employees and the management of our transport undertaking.  It is obvious that the committee realised the value of having co-operation at all levels in the carrying-out of our transport industry.</P>
    <P>The position taken up by the board of C.I.E. in that connection appears to be that they said that, in their experience, the unions are not interested in such co-operation.  The board claims that the unions are interested only in rates of pay and conditions of service and that they rarely, if ever, go out of their way to take further part in co-operation with the management in running the industry.  In a communication sent to the Minister by the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation, after the publication of the Transport Committee's Report, the union deals with the situation there.  I think that what they conveyed to the Minister in that communication should be placed on the records of this House so that, once and for all, there will be no ambiguity as to the trade union's approach to co-operation in the transport industry.</P>
    <P>They pointed out as follows to the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the 22nd August, 1956, the secretary of the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation wrote to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce drawing his attention to the series of complaints and grievances which had been brought to its attention and which militated seriously against achieving improved efficiency in C.I.E. and harmonious relations between the board and its employees.  At a meeting convened by the Minister and presided over by the Secretary of the Department of <Col N="1497" /> Industry and Commerce, held on the 2nd October, both sides agreed to accept &lsquo;the principle of joint consultation between C.I.E. and the staff through the provision of regular means of consultation between the management and the staff and affording opportunities for co-operation and discussion on matters of mutual interest including efficiency in the working of the undertaking and the development of their business and the best use of manpower.&rsquo;  The official statement issued after the meeting stated that the management would take all possible steps to implement this principle of joint consultation and that both sides undertook to approach the concept of consultation in a spirit of harmony and co-operation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was not until the 24th November that the chairman of C.I.E. requested the Provisional United Trade Union Organisation to appoint representatives to discuss with the board the way in which the question of joint consultation should be approached.  A meeting for this purpose was held on the 11th December at which the chairman of C.I.E. outlined the board's view as to how joint consultation should operate and the machinery necessary to this end.  On the 12th February, 1957, the Provisional United Organisation wrote to the chairman of C.I.E. requesting that discussions with the unions concerned with the setting-up of joint consultation machinery for rail operative and rail shop grades should commence as soon as possible, but it was not until the 10th April that a meeting for this purpose was convened by C.I.E.  At the meeting the trade union representatives set out at some length the unions' proposals on joint consultation and a document incorporating these proposals was submitted to the chairman at that meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nothing has happened since.</P>
    <P>Sixteen months ago, the trade unions catering for members in C.I.E. asked the board to take some steps to set up joint consultation.  The board, as is obvious from the communication I have <Col N="1498" /> just read out, have fiddled with that matter ever since.  They have accepted the principle, but it is obvious from the procrastination, the delay and the obstructive tactics which they have employed that they are not interested in joint consultation.  In that respect, I may say they differ from similar transport boards in practically every country in Europe, to a large extent, and to the greatest extent in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The British Transport Commission have joint consultation machinery. There are regular meetings between the management and the staff not alone at top level but right down to the local stations.  The employees can discuss their grievances.  The management can discuss the mutual problems of themselves and their staff in a friendly and agreeable atmosphere.  Ready solutions can be found to most problems and petty grievances such as very often arise in C.I.E. and fester into major disputes can very often be hammered out at local level.  I hope the Minister will convey to the board of C.I.E. his desire&mdash;I feel it must be his desire&mdash; to have joint consultation between management and staff.</P>
    <P>I feel that C.I.E. have fallen down in regard to public relations.  We are all aware of the unfriendly and critical attitude of the Press towards C.I.E. That is unfair, I think, but the C.I.E. Board, themselves, appear to have done little or nothing about it.  Any organisation which is unfairly attacked or unfairly criticised should have an up-to-date public relations department to let the people know exactly what is happening and what the difficulties of our transport undertaking are.  The public would then be in a position to judge for themselves and much of the unfair criticism against C.I.E. would thus be nipped in the bud.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, C.I.E. have not been as active as they might be in getting out after the traffic.  Too often, they just sit back and hope the traffic will come to them.  Too often, even when they know that illegal haulage is being carried on, they will not get involved. They will not go to the fairs and markets and compete for traffic.  They are being given a wonderful opportunity <Col N="1499" /> now, as announced by the Minister, in having discretion in quoting freight rates.  Amongst their own staff at the moment, there are people who have given many years' service in the transport industry and who would make excellent canvassers.  I do hope that, if C.I.E. embark on a campaign of open competition and canvassing all types of traffic, they will not get the idea that some Deputies appear to have of employing experts in that field.  The best people that can be employed on that type of work are the people who have served on the railways, who know the railway job, who have been engaged in transport all their lives and who know what the customer is looking for.</P>
    <P>I do hope that an active and vigorous campaign will be undertaken by C.I.E. to win back the traffic that has been lost and to gain new traffic. I hope that they will get it out of their heads, once and for all, that the whole concern and every aspect of its activities must be managed from Kingsbridge, Broadstone or Inchicore.  I hope they have learned their lesson in that regard and that there will be no small degree of decentralisation of the activities of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>There are district superintendents and station masters in large depots who are little more than rubber stamps, as far as the business of the railways is concerned.  They have certain minor powers, but, if anything arises outside them, they must get on the telephone to Kingsbridge, or wire or write Kingsbridge, and by the time that is done, the traffic is lost or, if it is a matter of some labour dispute, the dispute has got worse.  I repeat what I said before, that I hope the Minister will urge the new board at least to tackle this problem and to decentralise control in these matters.</P>
    <P>There is wide scope in the C.I.E. organisation for the introduction of up-to date business methods.  From my experience of the clerical side, the system of bookkeeping and correspondence employed by C.I.E. is antediluvian. I hope somebody will be brought along to the C.I.E. organisation who will study that aspect of the <Col N="1500" /> matter and, to the benefit of the board, of the staff and of the people of the country generally, modernise the methods employed by C.I.E. in its offices, goods stores and depots.</P>
    <P>Before going from C.I.E. to the anticipated merger with G.N.R., of which I will have something to say, there are just two more points.  I hope the present transitional difficulties of C.I.E. will not be used as an excuse by the board for rejecting the wage claims that will shortly be before it from the supervisory and wages grades staffs of the company.  It could well be that this would be used as an excuse.  As we are all aware, the trade union organisations, with the help of the Minister, made a very wise agreement with the employers' organisations to secure increased remuneration to meet the increased cost of living.  I think the trade union movement acted in a most responsible manner and I think the Minister appreciates the efforts that the trade union movement made to avoid any kind of friction and major disputes.  The railway trade union were not unconnected with that effort and I do hope that the already low living standards of railways workers will not be further depressed by the use of the current difficulties as an excuse to deprive them of the increases that every other worker in the country is getting at the moment.</P>
    <P>Lastly on C.I.E., I hope that the old board, before it goes out, will dispose of the moral obligation it has in relation to its older pensioners.  In reply to a question in the House yesterday, the Minister informed me that there are over 1,000 ex-C.I.E. men drawing pensions of 6/- per week and there are another 1,000 drawing pensions of between 6/- and £1.  I know, they know, and we all know that they have no legal entitlement to an increase in their pensions, that there is no legal obligation on the board of C.I.E. to increase them, but I am suggesting, and it cannot be contradicted, that there is a grave moral obligation on the board of C.I.E. to do justice to these old people who worked in the railways at a time when wages were particularly depressed, who gave 40 to 50 years' honourable <Col N="1501" /> service and who are now thrown on the scrap heap on pensions as low as 6/- per week.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points that I should like to make regarding the pending amalgamation of that portion of the G.N.R. which is in our territory with C.I.E.  These amalgamated lines in future, under the new legislation, will be under a new board charged with operating a new policy.  Part of that policy was indicated by the Minister when he stated that they would be charged with keeping open railway lines, except under certain conditions.  I want to draw to the Minister's attention developments that are taking place and that have taken place quite recently on sections of the G.N.R. which he might re-examine and he might direct them to stay their hand until they come under the new board which will be operating a new policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that passenger services were withdrawn from the Dundalk-Clones branch as recently as October.  That appears to me to be a branch that might profitably be operated by diesel car and it is a branch that quite possibly, in the ordinary course, would be kept open to passenger traffic by the new board operating a new policy.  Then there is the case of the Oldcastle branch.  There is an application before the Transport Tribunal to withdraw passenger services from this branch.  Again, the same argument applies, that that should not be allowed until the new board takes over and investigates the position.</P>
    <P>It appears that the G.N.R. have utilised diesel railway cars which were released through the closure of secondary lines in the North of Ireland.  They have been used and concentrated solely on the Belfast-Derry route.  I do not know why that should be so.  They could be used on the lines I have referred to.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is anything in the suggestion that, on the abandonment of the existing agreement, there is some question of the division of the assets of the G.N.R.  I find it hard to believe that the agreement is so loose <Col N="1502" /> that assets such as diesel rail cars will be distributed between the U.T.A. and C.I.E. purely on the basis of their location at that time.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is the Government's policy in relation to the County Donegal Railways.  As we know, the Donegal Railways Joint Committee is jointly owned by British Railways and the G.N.R., which, of course, is jointly owned by the State, jointly under the control of our Minister here.  What brought it to my notice was that there was in yesterday's Press an announcement of the intention of the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee to close and abandon the Donegal-Ballyshannon line.  The Minister in his statement did not refer at all to the County Donegal Railways and I should like to know from him if it is intended to amalgamate these lines as well as those in the G.N.R. with C.I.E. and, if that is so, again I say the County Donegal Railways should be encouraged to desist from the procedure they are now taking to close and abandon that line, until they come under the new board operating a new policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the compensation to be paid to redundant employees of the G.N.R. after the merger of the two systems.  I know the difficulties that the Minister is facing in this matter and I would advise him to give the option to G.N.R. employees either to come over to C.I.E. or to accept compensation.  That would, to some measure at least, meet the problem of redundancy that undoubtedly is going to crop up.  I have a feeling that there are many employees in the G.N.R., men approaching the 60 mark, who would readily agree, for several reasons&mdash;because of home conditions they may not be able to face transfer &mdash;to retire on adequate compensation rather than transfer to C.I.E.  That would ease the problem of pushing out the fellow at the bottom and still be meeting, and justly meeting, the wishes of the man around the 60 age mark.  I am not too sure that it might not be possible to extend to the C.I.E. staffs around that age the option of retiring on compensation at that particular age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> One other small group that may not have come to the Minister's notice is the staff of the Irish Railway Clearing House.  It appears obvious, with the merging of the G.N.R. with C.I.E., that the work in the Irish Railway Clearing House will be considerably reduced and that there will be redundancy. To add to that I am informed that at the moment British Railways are contemplating a new approach to its clearing house system and that we may see in a very short time the position where British Railways will make bulk settlements with other railways as far as their clearing house arrangements are concerned.  If that is so you will have large scale redundancy in the Irish Railway Clearing House and I would like to ask the Minister if he has given this matter thought and what he thinks regarding compensation provisions. Up to this the clearing house has been mentioned only once in this House and that was in the 1924 Act when you had a previous amalgamation between the Irish railways.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I should like to say that, all in all, I think the policy outlined by the Minister has much to commend it.  But I am very doubtful however if the changes envisaged in his statement are radical enough to meet the problem or radical enough to enable C.I.E. to provide an unsubsidised system of public transport for passenger and freight on rail, road and water, on the basis of satisfying the public and giving a fair crack of the whip to the people engaged in the transport business and their dependents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if there is anything which belies the old saying that it is easy to be wise after the event it is probably the question of transport.  We are discussing C.I.E. losses and the general question of transport nearly 14 years after the introduction of the Act of 1944 which, I think I am correct in saying, foreshadowed at the time cheap and efficient transport.  I think this question of transport has dashed the hopes of more than one Minister for Industry and Commerce and I do not propose to indulge in any taunting of the <Col N="1504" /> present occupant of that position because his hopes in the days of 1943 and 1944 have been dashed also.</P>
      <P>Everyone seems to be agreed on the fact&mdash;and I do not think there is any gainsaying it&mdash;that the problem with regard to transport is that we have got too much transport, that the transport resources in the country are in excess, and fairly considerably in excess, of our requirements and that involves with it the question of C.I.E.'s financial losses on the railways and to a lesser extent, on the canals.  When we consider the question of too much transport, and the losses entailed by operating too much transport, we are straight away up against the question of the social consequences of that, rather than the social problems involved in trying to remedy it, the big problem of the unemployment which would be created.</P>
      <P>I think it is true, although not particularly helpful, to remark that, if there was any reality in the Fianna Fáil plan for full employment, that particular aspect of the problem is one which need not worry us.  But I am talking on the assumption that the £100,000,000 plan for full employment need not be taken into account when we are discussing the transport problem and that if the question of an excess in transport is to be tackled and be remedied, we must face the logical conclusion that that is going to result in unemployment and the displacement of some of those at present employed in the transport undertaking.  Some of these could presumably be adequately compensated. Others, I presume, would be absorbed into other forms of employment but there must be a residue, if the problem is to be tackled in that manner, of unemployment which to my mind would be fairly substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister when making his statement on this Estimate gave a figure of about 14,000 persons employed on the railway undertakings in this part of the country, that is, on C.I.E.'s railway operations and that portion of the G.N.R. railways operating in this part of the country.  Coupled with that, the <Col N="1505" /> Minister mentioned the C.I.E. estimate of 30 per cent. redundancy in railway employment.  It seems to me, consequently, that the figure for over-employment in the railway undertaking at the moment must be in the region of 3,000 or 4,000 persons.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that the estimate for changing over to road services, of an equal carrying capacity, would involve a capital outlay of about £12,000,000; I think that was his figure. I do not think that in itself is particularly terrifying when weighed against the C.I.E. losses which, again I think I am correct in quoting the Minister as saying, since 1950 to the end of the present financial year, come to something like £12,500,000.  On those figures, any capital outlay of the sort involved, if offset against losses running at that rate, would not take too long to be recouped. I think the Minister argued, and argued quite soundly, that quite apart from this question of any capital outlay involved at present the railways, their rolling stock and permanent ways are, for the most part, in very good condition.  There does not seem to be any point in unnecessarily anticipating a decision to jettison those and to dispose of them probably at a very great loss.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, the Minister pointed out that the C.I.E. estimate of the running cost of operating road services of equal carrying capacity to the railways would be £11,000.000 as against £8,000,000 on the railways.  That is an addition of £3,000,000 a year if there is to be a change-over.  Fourteen years after the 1944 Transport Act, the Minister comes to the House and is honest enough to say that notwithstanding the proposals he is making to the Dáil, and notwithstanding the recommendations of the Committee on Internal Transport neither he nor anyone else can say that certain proposals he has outlined will be sufficient to save the railways in this country.</P>
    <P>If I followed the Minister correctly, a number of decisions have been taken by the Government in this matter.  It is difficult to discuss these in a concrete manner at the moment, until the legislation he has foreshadowed has <Col N="1506" /> been introduced.  However, a number of decisions have been taken, the key one being that we must try to preserve the railways as an integral part of the national transport system.  That decision, in turn, involves a number of other decisions.  The committee which examined on this problem also made a number of recommendations.  The Minister has accepted some of those recommendations, has rejected others of them and is silent with regard to a number of others.  I do not know whether the Minister's blanket endorsement of the general soundness of the views of the committee is to be taken as indicating that the particular issues on which he is silent are likely to be accepted by the Government or not.</P>
    <P>There is, for instance, the recommendation permitting farmers to carry goods for neighbours within a radius of two miles.  That was one of the recommendations of the committee and it is a matter to which the Minister did not refer.  There were other recommendations of one sort or another to which the Minister, in his statement, did not advert, and I should like to know from him whether these matters are still under consideration in his Department or whether he has decided, as a matter of general policy, to adopt the various recommendations, other than those which he specifically stated are being rejected.</P>
    <P>One of the principal decisions the Government have taken is in connection with the alteration in the approach to the closing down of branch lines.  The system heretofore has been that if it was proposed to close a branch line, the approval of the Transport Tribunal had to be obtained. That involved an elaborate inquiry into the proposals.  The Minister has indicated that the Government's view is that the C.I.E. Board should be empowered to close down any line or station, or to withdraw any service for which they see no future, and should be permitted to do that on their own decision, without having to seek the approval of the Transport Tribunal.</P>
    <P>It does not end there.  The Minister has indicated also that an alteration <Col N="1507" /> will be made so as to remove from C.I.E. the obligation to provide an alternative service in cases where they decide to discontinue a railway service and to close down a branch line.  He has indicated that, in cases where C.I.E. do not provide an alternative road service for a discontinued railway service, that must be coupled with the giving of licences to private transport undertakings to deal with the situation.  I certainly feel that there should be a very cautious approach to this question of enabling C.I.E. on their own decision and on their own initiative to close down branch lines.</P>
    <P>Remember that while the Committee on Internal Transport did indicate their view that the mileage of lines could be considerably reduced, they did that, having recommended, and strongly recommended in their report, that a transport advisory council should be established.  That was one of the recommendations which the Minister has specifically rejected, so that the position arising out of the proposals the Minister is taking is that, without a transport tribunal, without a transport advisory council, C.I.E. are to be empowered, on their own initiative and on their own decision, to close down branch lines and not to provide any alternative transport where they have closed down such lines.  This is a matter which should be considered with a certain amount of caution.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that as far as the information he had was concerned, it was not going to make any great difference to the financial problems of C.I.E. whether branch lines were closed down or continued. I assume that, in talking in that way, the Minister was referring to the losses incurred on these branch lines rather than the total savings which C.I.E. might effect by closing them.  In 1949, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke on this matter in the Dáil during an adjournment debate on the question of Dublin bus fares.  As reported at column 1601 of the Official Report for March 23rd, 1949, the then Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" />&ldquo;The first proposal which was put to me was that all fares should be increased&mdash;more or less the same proposals as it is now proposed to bring into operation now.  But they said then that that alone would not meet the situation.  I was asked to close down branch railway lines to an extent that would enable them to dismiss 1,000 men; to cut back on general maintenance to a point that would enable them to dismiss a further 2,500 men; and further, that we should also agree to restrict private transport.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far back as 1949, the idea of C.I.E. was that they should eliminate branch lines to an extent which would enable them to dismiss 1,000 men, and it seems to me that C.I.E., without any control by the Transport Tribunal, the Minister or anyone else, will now be allowed to make their own decisions in this matter. Unless the position has altered substantially between 1949 and the present time&mdash;perhaps it has, for all I know&mdash; C.I.E. would have in their mind something along those lines that would enable them to reduce their staff by about 1,000 people.  Unemployment of 1,000 people would probably affect about three or four times that number when one has regard to the wives and families of the workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also decided to accept the recommendation of the committee with regard to the freeing of C.I.E. from the common carrier obligations. Briefly, the common carrier obligations could be defined as an obligation to accept any traffic that is offered to the board and accept it at rates not exceeding their published rates for that particular business, and also the obligation not to accept in a manner which would prejudice a particular person or group of persons on the one hand, or which would favour them on the other. They also have an obligation to charge all persons equally in respect of the carriage over equal distances of goods of a similar description.  My definition may not be legally perfect, but I think, generally speaking, that would sum up the common carrier obligations.</P>
    <P>When we consider the transport undertaking as a national undertaking, <Col N="1509" /> a national service provided by a concern in public ownership, it seems necessary that something in the nature of, or very closely allied to, common carrier obligations should be in existence. The Minister's proposal, as I understand it, is to free C.I.E. entirely from their common carrier obligations and to put them in a position where they can quote different rates to different people with a view to attracting business.  I concede straight away that, from the point of view of business efficiency and looking at it purely from the point of view of a commercial venture, the Minister is quite right.  Probably C.I.E. will be put in a position, when these obligations are removed, of entering into keener competition with other commercial firms, particularly in withstanding road competition which they have to meet at the moment, but I feel that we are rather letting the people down when we consider the question of national transport as a service which has to be provided for the people.</P>
    <P>I want to call attention to the fact that in their report the committee, when they made their recommendation regarding the freeing of C.I.E. from common carrier obligations, specifically tied that up with having in existence a transport council which would guard the public interest and see that there was some adequate machinery there to prevent anything in the nature of discrimination in changing their rates and so on.  The Minister has rejected the idea of a transport council, but has accepted the idea of freeing C.I.E. from common carrier obligations. In fairness to the Minister, let me say that when he was introducing the Estimate, he did not overlook the point because he mentioned the possibility of keeping the Transport Tribunal in existence to deal with any problem of discrimination.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand the Minister's attitude in connection with canals.  The committee, in its report, indicated that if C.I.E. were allowed to withdraw their barges from the canals, they would effect a saving of, I think, £108,000 a year, and I assumed &mdash;perhaps wrongly&mdash;from the manner <Col N="1510" /> in which the recommendation was worded in the committee's report, that the suggestion that they should be allowed to make that saving came in the C.I.E. submission to the committee. I may be wrong in that because the Minister stated that he did not propose to accept that recommendation without further consideration in view of the C.I.E. observations.  I should like to know what were the C.I.E. observations.  I should like to know if it was part of their submission to the committee that they should be allowed to withdraw their barges, and what observations they had to make on the point subsequently.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see, having regard to the limited user of canals, it appears to be an eminently reasonable suggestion that if £108,000 per annum can be saved by allowing C.I.E. to withdraw their barges, that should be done.  I would go further, and I would relieve C.I.E. from any obligation to maintain the canals.  I do not think it would be too great a burden on the appropriate local authorities if that obligation were to be borne by them, so far as the stretches of canals in their counties are concerned.  I am not suggesting that they should maintain them as canals, but that they should keep them clean and so on.</P>
    <P>I also completely fail to understand either the recommendation of the committee or the Minister's decision with regard to the motor coach tours. In their report, the committee adverted to the fact that they had considered these tours from the point of view of the very considerable income which C.I.E. derived from extended coach tours.  They also referred to the fact that the coaches gave employment and that they were built here from dutiable components and, nevertheless, the committee, it seemed to me, rather from the tourist point of view than the transport point of view, recommended that foreign coach tours should be allowed.  In the course of his statement, the Minister mentioned that that was being implemented, I thought the position being that he had already come to a decision prior to the committee's recommendation.  I do not <Col N="1511" /> know whether I am correct in that or not.</P>
    <P>In either event, when it is stated by the committee, it is stated by the Minister and it is conceded by everyone who has examined the problem, that the problem is one of too much transport, I cannot understand why the Minister should admit more transport now into the country.  When everyone is concerned about C.I.E. losses and when C.I.E. are able to derive a considerable income, in the words of the committee, from dealing with these coach tours, I cannot understand why the Minister should take a decision which may prejudice the income which C.I.E. derives from handling these coach tours.  I certainly do not understand that and it seems to me to be quite inconsistent.  I do not know quite how the matter is being dealt with by the Minister.  The committee suggested that duty-free facilities should be afforded to such coach tours. They based it on their view that it would attract tourist business which C.I.E. probably would not get anyhow. I disagree with that view and I think that if coach tours are being admitted, it certainly should not be on a duty-free basis.</P>
    <P>I want to make some suggestions.  I want to make this suggestion, Sir, which may not be strictly in order at the moment; but I want to make it very briefly, for the purpose of emphasising a further suggestion which I want to make immediately afterwards. Having regard to the vital part played by transport in the economic life of the country and its impact on industry, commerce, agriculture, communications and everything else, and considering that so much of the taxpayer's money has already been spent on public transport, and when we have the Minister's proposal that for the next five years at least there will be an annual payment made by the taxpayer in respect of transport, it seems to me that we should not shirk from taking a decision to make this question of transport the special care and consideration of a Minister.  The Department over which the present Minister presides is probably <Col N="1512" /> too large already and I think it would be a matter of relief to him and to his Department if this question of transport could be taken out completely from the Department of Industry and Commerce and dealt with separately.</P>

      <P>As I said, I intend to be very brief on it and I am mentioning it only because I want to make another suggestion, which I think is relevant but which might not stand up without this suggestion first.</P>
      <P>I want to pass from that point by saying I think that could be done without the creation of a new Ministry. There is a very close and natural affinity between the questions of transport and communications and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and that Department is one which is not generally regarded as being overworked. I think we should create a new Department of Transport and Communications to deal with both this question of transport and posts and telegraphs.</P>
      <P>The reason I want to mention that is that we should explore the possibility of having separate rail and road boards.  That could not be done unless the question of transport were under the special care of a Department of State.  It must be remembered that the Oireachtas will be voting money&mdash;I do not know the amount, but it will proably be considerable&mdash;for at least the next five years to the public transport undertaking.  I think it is necessary that there should be a Minister directly responsible to the House and who can be questioned in the House regarding the expenditure of that money.  It should be within the bailiwick of the Committee of Public Accounts or some such committee to go into the question of that expenditure. It seems to me, while I might be wrong in my approach to it, that it might be worth while considering the separation of the rail and road ends of C.I.E. under separate boards.  As I say, I do not think that can be done unless a new department is set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> As a minimum, the Minister should reconsider his decision to reject the idea of a transport council.  There should be a transport advisory council and the committee gave their arguments in support of that.  I do not want to prolong what I have to say by going into that.  Their recommendations are in the report and they certainly had reasons for advancing that recommendation.  Also, as I have indicated, the Minister should reconsider his attitude to the canals.  He should reconsider his attitude to freeing C.I.E. completely from the common carrier obligations.  He should reconsider his attitude with regard to allowing C.I.E. and nobody else the right to decide about the closing of branch lines.  I know that it is a difficult problem and I know the Minister and the Dáil will proably be discussing it many years from now.  At least, we are to get an opportunity annually, I take it&mdash;if there is to be a sum included in the Estimate for C.I.E.&mdash;of reviewing it.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments which the committee put forward in favour of a transport advisory council was that there should be some body in permanent session to review these matters.  I hope the Dáil will get an opportunity annually to do so.  None of us would be doing a service by minimising the problem.  It is a big problem.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is likely to be unemployment.  I do not want to go into the question of compensation, other than to say in a very general way that, if persons who have had employment in a public undertaking of this sort are put out of employment, by reason of any reorganisation or any cutting back that may take place, I do not think anyone can grudge seeing that those people are properly compensated. There must be adequate compensation for any worker who is put out of employment or whose position is disimproved.  There are compensation provisions in the Acts there already.  The Minister seemed to indicate that there would be doubt with regard to the position of people who became unemployed, purely and simply because C.I.E. could not get the work. <Col N="1514" /> I believe that if by Government policy or through the adoption of C.I.E. policy, these people find themselves unemployed because of reorganisation, the Minister and the Dáil must face up to the question of adequate compensation.</P>

      <P>When the Dáil rose last July, I, like every other Deputy, returned to my constituency, and one of the things I brought back with me was the Report on Transport.  From the exhortations the Minister had given to the electorate and from the propaganda of Fianna Fáil as to the wonderful activity they would show if they were returned to office, I was full sure when we came back to this House that we would not have a proposition, just the mixture as before, asking us to vote another £1,800,000, but that we would have concrete proposals prepared by the Minister.  It might be said there was no time.  That report was produced in May of this year.  We had June, July, August, September, October and November, and nothing happened.  I am afraid the activity that has been shown by the Minister and by his colleagues has been reflected in the activity of the rest of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to the business of this House since we came back here a few weeks ago.  I was very disappointed that the Government Party composed of 77 members could produce only one back bencher to comment on the Agricultural Institute Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it looks as if they intend to follow suit in this regard. The Minister said in his statement that the railway undertaking of C.I.E. continues to lose traffic.  They have been doing that since the 1944 Traffic Act.  One of the principal reasons why the railway undertaking is losing traffic is that road transport went into competition, and into unfair competition, with them.  When that business got cracking in 1944, they sent 30 wagons to a 200-wagon fair and filled the place with matadors.  They did that until they had most of the live-stock traffic on the roads and they continued <Col N="1515" /> sending the wagons to the fairs.  Now we must ask ourselves the question: have C.I.E. priced themselves out of the traffic?</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal of criticism of C.I.E., and much of it is aimed at the top.  We might as well be realists and aim whatever criticism we have at the top and bring it down to whatever level the criticism can be aimed at.  One great change has taken place in C.I.E. since 1944 and has done great damage.  When the railways had the monopoly of transport, there was an <i>esprit de corps</i> in all railway staffs from the lowest-graded porter up to the highest-graded official.  It was the passenger who counted; it was the traffic and the goods that were the important things.  That has all gone by the board. I have seen extraordinary things done. I have seen thousands of people transported from my constituency up to see the All-Ireland final, which we did not win, and they had to gallop from Croke Park to Kingsbridge to get home.</P>
      <P>That kind of thing has injured C.I.E. and driven people on to the roads.  Passengers are not being considered.  It is the staffs that matter.  Many people would prefer to pander to the railway staffs and not say a word about that, but I think it is only right to draw attention to it.  At a time when the railways had a strict regulation that goods should be loaded, say, at 6 o'clock, for a goods train leaving at 6.45, if you got there at 6.15, they would load the goods.  As I say, there was this <i>esprit de corps</i> and whether it was the station-master with the gold braid on his hat or the lowest porter or shunter, they would get down on the line and make sure those goods got away.  The sooner they get back to the idea that the customer and the traffic must be catered for the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will say this much in favour of the staffs.  The centralisation of authority in the railway is definitely cramping the style of the officials down the country who might try to show initiative. There should be relaxations and a delegation of power to what I will call the superintendents of areas.  They should be able to stand on their own feet in their own areas and direct <Col N="1516" /> traffic with which they are more competent than anybody else to deal. When I speak of road transport, I mean not only the monsters that C.I.E. have on the road but the monsters other people have on the roads. I saw the coming of the one-ton truck, the three-ton, ten-ton and 15-ton lorry.  Now they are 20, 25 and 40 tons.  Where is it going to stop?  I think there should be a restriction on the carrying capacity, or on the size, of many of the vehicles that have appeared on the roads.  I know it would be a great hardship to put them off the roads right away but there should be only so many years allowed for them to run themselves out.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Minister should see to it that C.I.E. do not have themselves priced out of the market; they should encourage heavy traffic back to the railway.  We see monsters bringing petrol from Dublin to depots in Cork, Waterford and elsewhere, and they go around the small villages parcelling it out.  Other Deputies know, as well as I do, that there are oil depots belonging to these companies situated alongside railway lines at various stations.  All that traffic should be diverted to the railways.  It would not create unemployment among people engaged on the lorries; in fact it would create employment by putting back the small tanker which would do the local deliveries.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said by what is called an Irish merchant, a member of a chamber of commerce, an industrialist, or director of a company, that C.I.E. should be done away with just like that.  That is all nonsense and the Minister knows it is.  A very important thing to consider, is this: If somebody came to this House from America, Czechoslovakia or anywhere else, and said he could establish an industry in this country that could employ 14,000 men, and the operating losses were £400,000 a year, I do not think the House would have to take very long to make up its mind about what it was going to do.  That is the way we must look into it.  If all this slicing away of branch lines, if all this actual paying-off of men and the creation of unemployment really takes <Col N="1517" /> place, will that be worth the money to this country?  The Minister should consider that, that we are losing £400,000 in operating costs on the railways but we are keeping 14,000 men employed.</P>
    <P>We now come to a matter about recent railway policy that I and a great many people do not like, with the figure of unemployment right in front of us.  I am referring to the ruthless and brutal letter of Mr. Reynolds to the Dundalk Urban Council.  I have some experience of ruthless and brutal things done by this House.  There is nothing to smile about, nothing to laugh about, in this.  People's lives, hopes, futures, livelihoods, and homes are all thrown into the balance.  Legislation was brought in here which resulted in people's livelihoods being taken away in my constituency without any compensation.  That legislation was welcomed here.  As long as I am here I shall always hold it against the Government Party.  They are going to do the same in Dundalk and the comparison is nearly the same.</P>
    <P>Most of the people working in the railway yards at Dundalk have been there for generations.  They are a fine people and a hatchet man was sent up to prepare the ground to destroy their livelihood.  By contrast we can see how this was dealt with when another Minister of State met a deputation of the workers in Dundalk.  He proved himself to be a better diplomat there than he did in U.N.O.  He had the best swerve, and sold the finest dummy ever sold in this country, in the statement made to the deputation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has selected my constituency several times because we are evidently a simple people.  He came to Waterford when he said it was whispered that Fianna Fáil would reduce railway employment and that there was no truth in it.  He said if he were Minister, and they were at the wheel, they would not reduce railway employment.  They were simple people. The majority of the railway men voted for the Minister's candidates.  It is a frightful state of affairs to see that people can laugh in this House at a thing like that.  When the Party I support, and the inter-Party Government, <Col N="1518" /> were in power we were sneered at.  Everything we did was jeered at and sneered at by the people who are conspicuously absent during these debates now.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that he should approach this matter in Dundalk as bravely as his predecessor did.  When it looked likely as if the G.N.R. were going to produce the axe, the strong action taken by his predecessor promptly had it put away.  Fourteen thousand people are getting their livelihood on the railway.  The operational losses are £400,000 per year.  Before any hatchet man is let loose on the people of Dundalk, Waterford or Cork let the Minister come bravely to this House with proposals.  Let him get his Vote here to-day but let him come into the House with his proposals early next year, and keep the promise he made on thousands of posters: &ldquo;Let us get cracking.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give credit to the Minister for introducing the proposals.  They are not by any means perfect but I think all sides of the House will agree that the national transport system in this country has been a headache for many years past. There is no doubt that a small country with a population of less than 3,000,000 cannot carry the present load of public and private transport.  The most we can hope to do is to provide the country with the most efficient and economical transport system we can, namely, a combination of both State and private enterprise.  Economically, the national transport system will never pay its way and I do not think it would be fair to expect it to do so. The taxpayers, therefore, will have to face up to the unpleasant necessity of maintaining a national transport system out of the public purse.  As a <i>quid pro quo</i>, however, the public are entitled to as efficient and economic a public transport system as can be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the House accepts that we must have at least the nucleus of a national transport system.  The reasons for it are as obvious as the House's acceptance of the principle. First of all, it is desirable that we <Col N="1519" /> should have such a system, in case we find ourselves in times of war or emergency, with the obligation placed upon it to carry both passengers and goods.  Secondly, it is desirable from the point of view of employment content. As several speakers have pointed out, C.I.E. is a very big employer of labour.</P>
    <P>Rather too much emphasis has been placed on C.I.E. losses.  C.I.E. is in the unfortunate position of having its losses easily assessed and its cost to the public, particularly the taxpayer, easily assessable.  We all know that we have a big number of industries&mdash; giving good employment, I grant you &mdash;which have what might be described as hidden subsidies through tariff or other protection.  The public is prepared to bear these imposts because these industries give employment, and they are thereby afforded the opportunity of continuing and prospering. But if an assessment were made of the cost to the public in terms of pounds, shillings and pence the public might suffer quite a shock.  It is not fair, therefore, to blame C.I.E. entirely for incurring very heavy losses.</P>
    <P>The Minister has approached the problem in the right way when he asks that C.I.E. be put in a position to compete on fair terms with other forms of transport.  Certainly it establishes some means by which one may arrive at the most economical and efficient method of transport ultimately.</P>
    <P>The problem of transport is sufficiently serious, I think, to warrant the appointment of a Minister for Transport. I hesitate to suggest yet another Minister in addition to those we already have, but a Minister for Transport would be as important as a Minister in some other Departments and activities of State at the moment. A Minister for Transport should be appointed and, instead of the Minister for Industry and Commerce getting up here and stating that he has no responsibility or that he cannot interfere with certain actions and decisions taken by C.I.E., we would then have someone directly responsible to this <Col N="1520" /> House for the running of public transport.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy T. Lynch with regard to decentralisation of control.  I think every Deputy has had experience of how difficult it is to get even a minor decision at local level and, if the Minister's idea of C.I.E., competing at local level is to come to fruition, it is essential that the local district superintendents should have much more authority and much more liberty to take decisions than they have at the moment.  It is farcical to come up against the minor matters which cannot be dealt with at local level.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the position of Limerick. I heard several references to Dundalk. Limerick cannot, of course, compare with Dundalk in the size of its engineering works, but it is the most important engineering and machine shop in the south-west and it is the logical centre for wagon building or repair work on behalf of a reorganised C.I.E.  I hope when the Minister's proposals are being put into concrete form Limerick's position will be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>There is another point in favour of holding on to our national transport system.  That is the tremendous amount of capital which has been invested in it over a long number of years.  If all the capital equipment in the nature of wagons, rails, stations, etc., were to be replaced to-day there is no doubt the cost would be ten times the figure that appears in the C.I.E. balance sheet.  There is, too, the question of the employment content.  The Minister has faced up to that problem.  It is only fair that, should redundancy occur in any scheme of reorganisation, the men who lose their employment should be treated justly and generously by this House and by the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the principle of the maintenance of a national transport system being accepted and the burden on the taxpayer of maintaining such a system being made as light as possible.  Over and above that, the merchant lorry owner and the private <Col N="1521" /> haulier should have an opportunity of competing on level terms.  I am opposed to any restrictions on the merchant trader.  He serves a very useful purpose and is a very useful unit in any transport system.  His position is recognised in most countries where modern transport methods obtain.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to answer one question when he comes to reply. I did not follow his statement last week that he proposes to wipe out C.I.E.'s accumulated losses of £12,000,000 by accepting liability for £11.6 millions of interest on C.I.E. stock.  Perhaps he would elucidate that.  Candidly, I did not follow it.</P>
    <P>If the country, for its part, and particularly the taxpayer, is prepared to accept the principle of the necessity of maintaining a national transport system then C.I.E., for its part, has the task of ensuring that such a system will be both efficiently and economically operated and constitute as light a burden as possible on the taxpayer. This will not be the last we shall hear of C.I.E. for many years to come, but the action of the Minister now represents a step in the right direction. When the Minister comes to the actual reorganisation of the system I hope he will put on the board the best men, irrespective of who they are or what associations they may have.  Equally, I trust that the new board will do its job irrespective of public criticism.  I think that the present condition of C.I.E. calls for courage and consideration and if the Minister approaches the problem in that way the House will give him every support.  This thing has dragged on for far too long and the time has come when the problems of C.I.E. have got to be faced up to in a realistic manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>As the debate has dragged on longer than was expected and as most of the points have already been dealt with I shall not delay the House too long.  I would scarcely have risen at all but for the fact that in the Minister's opening statement on the Estimate there was the implication that, in the new legislation, the board to be set up would have complete authority to decide on their own <Col N="1522" /> whether or not branch lines should be closed.  I have a particular interest in this and so has my colleague on the Fianna Fáil side of the House, Deputy Mrs. Crowley.  In that particular connection we have two branch lines in Kerry, one in the Iveragh peninsula and the other in the Beara peninsula.</P>
      <P>I would suggest therefore, not only because of my own personal views but because of the views of the people in those areas, that this board should not have complete power to close branch lines and that the Minister should reserve to himself the authority to make the final decision.  If there is any attempt made to close either or both of these branch lines he will have the opposition of the two Deputies for South Kerry who attend this House and also the opposition of the Sinn Féin Deputy who will, perhaps, deal with the matter in his own way.</P>
      <P>If a clause had been inserted in the legislation of 1944 whereby the purchase of new lorries by a different set of people from those who had carriers' licences was prohibited I think that there might not now be any question of losses on C.I.E.  Since that legislation was passed, and since the end of the war, something like 25,000 new lorries have been imported into this country either in their entirety or in their component parts at a cost of something like £40,000,000.  If it were provided in legislation that only replacements for the lorries of those who had carriers' licences would be allowed in, we would to-day not have the trouble with the balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may not have been possible at the time to foresee that so many people would purchase lorries.  C.I.E. itself may be responsible for part of that because they did not make proper provision for the conveyance of live stock. At various fairs throughout the country sufficient cattle trucks were not made available and the cattle had to be sent by road to their various destinations. If C.I.E. had supplied sufficient cattle trucks the people who bought the cattle would not have set out to purchase lorries for the transport of their own live stock.  It was in that way that this kind of competition arose between private enterprise <Col N="1523" /> and the railway system.  There are bound to be losses because of the method of transport where you have competition between railways, buses and C.I.E. lorries.  I think that if the C.I.E. lorries were used only to feed the railways and the buses, we would not have that type of competition and the type of overlapping that we have.</P>
    <P>Another reason why the people discontinued using the railways both for passenger and goods traffic was because of the high fares.  The increasing of the fares brought in no extra revenue to C.I.E.  In fact, losses were incurred.  The fares are far too high.  C.I.E. is now in charge of railways, buses, lorries, canals, hotels and restaurants.  I wonder could the Minister tell us where the losses are occurring.  Are they under all these heads or are they under one particular section?  I think the major loss would be on the running of the railways.</P>
    <P>For some years past improvements have been made in the railway system. The passenger carriages and the restaurants were improved and the railways themselves were repaired.  All that cost a lot of money but travelling by rail is now very comfortable.  C.I.E. have also improved their hotels and brought them up-to-date and, while the tariffs are too high, the accommodation and food are perfect.  The staffs of C.I.E., from the lowest to the highest, are courteous and capable of carrying out their work.</P>
    <P>There is one other important question, the matter of redundancy.  That problem could best be solved by ensuring that employees who have long service and are nearing the retirement age would get some special inducement so that they would wish to retire now. Perhaps they could get some extra pension or gratuity.  The important thing is that some arrangement will be made to ensure that there will be no dismissals from the service.</P>
    <P>I would say in conclusion that, notwithstanding all the criticism that has been levelled at C.I.E., members of the Oireachtas and the people in the country generally were pleased to learn that the Minister did not accept the findings of the Transport Commission <Col N="1524" /> to close down railways with the exception of the two main lines, one running south and one running west.  We require branch railway lines to serve the main lines.  Railways have always been regarded as the one means of transport for passengers and goods, by the ordinary people.  They never trouble those who have motor cars, lorries and various means of transport. I hope whatever Government is in power will ensure the continuance of our railway system.  We cannot look too far into the future.  We have already improved our railways by dieselisation.  It is quite possible that in years to come&mdash;and perhaps not too far distant&mdash;we shall have some system of transport by atomisation.</P>

      <P>One of the advantages of an advance statement of the form which the Government's legislative proposals may take is that by provoking thought and discussion among all those who are interested in public transport, as well as by securing a more widespread realisation of the magnitude of the problems we are up against, a number of useful ideas may emerge which will help the Government to complete its proposals and to produce a practical plan of action to deal with the problem.  That applies not merely to Deputies&mdash;although Deputies have a primary responsibility in the matter&mdash;but also to the trade unions who cater for railway and transport workers and, of course, to merchants, manufacturers and organisations who have the allocation of substantial transport business.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I think I should make it quite clear that I am not claiming, either on my own behalf or on behalf of the Government, that I know the answers to all the problems.  It is rather a large responsibility to have to carry to produce proposals which will be regarded as workable, which will be accepted by those who have to work them and which will achieve the purpose, which Deputy Norton referred to, of keeping <Col N="1525" /> the issue of transport policy outside the area of Party controversy.</P>
      <P>I will arrange to produce proposals based upon the Government decisions which I have announced but I certainly hope that in the perfection of their detail I will have full co-operation from all the interests concerned.  May I say that this debate was an encouraging start to that process?  We have had a number of very sensible and constructive speeches.  Perhaps it was unfortunate that Deputy McGilligan started off, because he followed his usual destructive line; but I am quite certain he was not speaking the mind of the Fine Gael Party.  I believe the Fine Gael Party do not often see him at their councils&mdash;any more often than we see him in the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to that again in one respect where I think his intervention may be harmful.  It has already been made clear that, from the reception it received outside the Dáil, in some respects the statement I made here last week was misinterpreted and requires clarification or amplification.  I am naturally desirous of ensuring that the viewpoint of the Government will be well understood and that the process of consideration and discussion which I desire to see started should not be impeded by any misunderstanding of what we have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made here to-day to this question of redundancy among C.I.E. railway staffs.  In that connection I may say that I was wrong in my statement that C.I.E.'s submissions to the Committee of Inquiry into Internal Transport contained a reference to a 30 per cent. redundancy.  C.I.E. pointed out that that statement was not contained in their submissions to this committee.  That arose in another connection.  In any event, I am somewhat perturbed by the significance attached to that figure.  I did not desire that any such significance should be given to it.  There is a suggestion that the problem has been measured. That is not correct.  I will refer further <Col N="1526" /> to what the committee said in that connection.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. also suggested that the manner in which I made that statement in the Dáil implied that there was some reflection upon their management. I did not intend to do that although I noted the comments of the committee in paragraph 339, which I will quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is little evidence of a searching examination, either by railway managements or by labour interests, as to the real causes of the deficits and insufficient attention has been given to factors which clearly indicate that railway expenditure is at an unjustifiably high level.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I did not intend to convey that any redundancy that exists amongst the railway staff is due to managerial incompetence. What I had in mind was the existence of traditional methods of working, trade union agreements and rules, which minimise the scope available for economies to be achieved by methods of management.  Perhaps I would have been wiser to have confined myself to what the committee did in fact say in that connection&mdash;in paragraph 421:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Redundancy exists, however, in that undertaking (C.I.E.) when compared with railways in other European countries irrespective of our recommendations, and employment of railway staffs has been maintained by artificial aids.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on, in the same paragraph they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No staff could reasonably expect such conditions to continue.  The knowledge that for 11 years the Department in which they are employed cannot of itself meet operating expenses and is so great a drain on the rest of the undertaking that the survival of C.I.E. as a whole is threatened, cannot be conducive to staff morale.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having commented on the fact that the railway structure had not been adjusted to suit altered circumstances, they went on to say in paragraph 422:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While the extent of the present <Col N="1527" /> staff redundancy in the railway undertaking of C.I.E. might be judged to some extent by comparison with railway employment in other countries as related to mileage, volume and density of traffic and similar factors, the only accurate basis of determination is by reference to the employment provided under the conditions indicated in our recommendations.  This, however, cannot be estimated at present, particularly as the volume of employment will be influenced greatly by the degree of success in obtaining additional traffic under new conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason I referred to this matter in my opening remarks was that I think it comes very close to the heart of the whole problem.  It is a matter for the trade unions catering for railway workers in the first instance.  The interest of these unions, as I see it, is twofold.  First, they have the desire to make employment of their members engaged in railway operations more secure, to give them the certainty of continuity and therby to enhance their status and their morale.  Secondly, they have the desire, which we all share, of keeping the maximum number of workers in employment.</P>
    <P>In a sense, it will be appreciated that these two aims are in conflict, if the views of the Committee of Inquiry are sound that there are redundant staff employed which tend to bring up the total level of operating costs and that one of the necessary measures to save the railways is to bring down these operation costs.  Can these two aims be reconciled?  I think they can to some extent.  It was in that connection I made my reference to the possibility of extending the compensation arrangements under existing Acts.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that there are provisions for the payment of compensation to workers who lose their employment when a railway line is closed down or a railway service is withdrawn but that it is not the problem we are facing here.  What I had in mind was that the trade unions and the <Col N="1528" /> management might get together for the purpose of working out what the minimum staff needs of an efficient railway organisation are and to consider what alterations in rules might be made or what measures might be adopted to bring the staffs down to the minimum number required for efficient operation and thus make more secure the employment of those who will continue to be engaged in railway work.</P>
    <P>If that proved to be practicable I indicated I was prepared to consider what I call a package deal under which, in consideration of the prospect of improving the costs of rail operation and in order to facilitate the implementation of any agreement that might be made, the extension of the existing compensation arrangements or the institution of a new compensation arrangement which would ensure that the reduction of the number employed in railway work would not cause hardship, would be facilitated on the lines which were indeed suggested in the Milne Report of 1949, where the possibility of inducing workers to surrender their employment in consideration of such compensation payments was referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now accepting the view of the committee which I quoted that it cannot be estimated, particularly as the volume of employment would be influenced greatly by the degree of success in obtaining additional traffic in the new conditions. There is no figure of redundancy. As I said, I did not intend the figure I mentioned to get the significance that has been given to it. There has been no precise estimation or calculation but the existence of the <Col N="1529" /> problem was undoubtedly adverted to by the committee as one of the main factors to be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in saying that nobody at present knows what is the extent of the redundancy, if any?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I say. It has not been measured and it would not be practicable to measure it now in view of the prospect that through the other changes I have indicated some increase in traffic may be accomplished.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I should refer to Deputy Casey's remarks regarding the wage demands which are at present with the C.I.E. Board.  I think Deputy Casey may have misunderstood to some extent the provisions of the national wage agreement which he quoted.  That agreement, as I understand it, was not intended to provide for the granting automatically of any specific increase to workers generally.  The real important part of it was the recommendation that at the present time the preservation of employment and the prevention of price increases were considerations of outstanding importance and there was, therefore, by both sides, acceptance of the idea that in relation to any particular occupation there should be an investigation of the extent to which it was possible to concede wage increases and particularly of the methods that might be applied in order to offset the effect of wage increases upon prices or employment.</P>
      <P>I am not going to attempt to prejudice any negotiations that may take place in that regard but it is, I think, unrealistic to think of C.I.E. as an organisation in a position to grant automatically wage increases without giving a great deal of thought to how the effect of these on higher costs can be offset.  I have stated already that if there is any further increase in the costs of railway operation the only conclusion to be arrived at is that some curtailment of the scope of the railway operations may be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some uncertainty was also created, I gather, by my reference to the existing &ldquo;last in, first out&rdquo; rule in determining the order in which workers are released from employment <Col N="1530" /> when redundancy occurs.  Deputy Faulkner of Louth had some discussions with the workers employed on railway work in his area and found that uncertainty as to what I meant. Others have also commented upon it. At paragraph 424 of their report the committee says this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We consider that, while the final decision as to the particular workers to be released would be a matter for C.I.E. after consultation with the trade unions concerned, a suitable balance should be preserved between younger and older men in determining the staff necessary for the efficient operation of the undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the management of C.I.E., in endeavouring to establish a suitable balance between younger and older men, would find themselves up against that particular rule and, indeed, I think that, in the context of a reorganisation scheme, the trade unions might wish themselves to modify the application of that rule. The purpose of my remarks was merely to make it clear that, even though it would involve a higher bill for compensation, the Government would not object if the rule were modified in order to facilitate the whole operation and bring about what the committee regard to be desirable, namely, a suitable balance between younger and older men within the company's organisation.</P>
    <P>The third matter concerning which Deputies know some misunderstanding has arisen relates to the problems that will result from the amalgamation of the G.N.R. undertaking within the Twenty-Six Counties with C.I.E.  First of all, I want to say definitely that the circumstances which are forcing a change in regard to the G.N.R. did not arise by our decision.  It is not by our wish that the agreement which was negotiated in 1935 for the setting-up of a joint board to operate that undertaking is coming to an end.  We have not yet received formal notification, under the agreement, for its termination but we have been informed that it is the intention of the Minister of Commerce in Belfast to give that <Col N="1531" /> notification.  I sincerely hope he will change his mind.</P>
    <P>Apart from any other reasons which we may have, most of us would regard it as undesirable that the G.N.R. undertaking should cease to exist. Indeed, we would hold that view even if the Belfast authorities confirm their decision to go ahead with the programme of closing-down a number of the lines within the Six-County area. The position regarding the line from Portadown to Derry is uncertain.  A statement issued in the last few days indicated that the result of efforts to attract traffic to that line and to reduce the costs of operating it will determine the decision.  I would say, however, that even if the outcome of all these changes in the Six-County area were to reduce the G.N.R. system to a single line from Belfast to Dublin it would still be preferable to keep that joint board in existence for its operation.  That is what we desire but it is not what we desire that will determine the course of events.</P>
    <P>Taking facts as they appear likely to develop, we must recognise that the agreement for the joint operation of the G.N.R. undertaking may come to an end in October of next year and, if that happens, it will obviously be common sense to amalgamate what is left of the undertaking in the Twenty-Six Counties with the existing C.I.E. undertaking.  That decision brought into a very prominent position the question of the future of the Dundalk Works.  These works are not our property. They are in an entirely different position from any other part of the G.N.R. undertaking.  They are the property of the G.N.R. Board which, as I have said, is a joint board.  We could have left that position to develop when notice to terminate the agreement was received and tried then to consider what part the G.N.R. works, when taken over from the G.N.R. undertaking, could play in the transport organisation of the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>It was obvious that the acquisition of the G.N.R. works by C.I.E. would <Col N="1532" /> give C.I.E. a surplus of railway engineering shop capacity and that, in any event, the future course of transport development here was such that in these circumstances a substantial diminution in the work available for the Dundalk shops was very likely. They were built up to service the whole of the G.N.R. system, a large part of which has already been dismantled. We decided, in the interest of maintaining employment at Dundalk, not to wait until the problem was upon us but to try to take time by the forelock and plan now for the development at Dundalk of new activities which would supplement the railway work it will lose if the agreement is terminated.  That involved, as I explained to the Dáil, the negotiation of an arrangement with the governmental and transport authorities in the Six Counties for handing over these works to a new company. These negotiations were rather difficult. A number of legal points arose but, ultimately, an agreement was made for the leasing of the Dundalk Railway Works to a new company.</P>
    <P>The reason we pressed to get that done now was because we recognised that time would be needed if commercial engineering activities were to be organised for Dundalk.  Nobody, I am sure, believes that an undertaking of that kind can be accomplished in a very short time.  I said, indeed, when introducing this Estimate that the time available was already, in my view, very limited and that I had hoped that the actual transfer of the works would be completed before this.  I do not think that has really impeded the progress of investigating or planning for new activities at Dundalk.  That company has tendered for certain contracts which are available around the world. I cannot say whether or not they will get the contracts.  We hope they will. Discussions have been going on with a number of firms engaged in the production of commodities for which the equipment at Dundalk Works would be suitable and a very large number of contacts have been made, all designed to open up the possibility of attracting to Dundalk work of an engineering kind which will maintain the volume of employment there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> I can understand the anxiety of workers in Dundalk to have some guarantee that these efforts will succeed.  They cannot be given such a guarantee.  They can be assured that people are working vigorously and continuously in order to bring about success.  We can hope they will succeed but no guarantee can be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The only guarantee they want is that the railway work will be left in Dundalk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan made a speech which, I think, was intended to be mischievous.  Obviously, the success of this effort will depend on the existence of complete co-operation and harmony between those who are trying to organise the extension of activities at Dundalk and the workers in the shops.  I think Deputy McGilligan was trying to build up a barrier of suspicion and hostility between them.  Deputy T. Lynch, who spoke this morning, followed Deputy McGilligan on that line.  I do not think he is likely to receive much attention in Dundalk whereas Deputy McGilligan may.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to a letter sent by Mr. Reynolds, chairman of the company, to the Clerk of the Dundalk Urban Council.  Mr. Reynolds explained to me that he received a letter from the Clerk of the Dundalk Urban Council which did not, on its face, suggest it was written by him in his own official capacity as clerk.  It was a letter conveying a number of suggestions as to possibilities that might be investigated in connection with the extension of activities in Dundalk and later it appeared that these suggestions were submitted on behalf of the Dundalk Chamber of Commerce and the Dundalk Branch, Congress of Irish Unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Reynolds replied to the letter on a personal basis and expressed a personal view on the possibilities, without consulting his board, without consulting me.  The purport of his letter was, first of all, to make it clear that the volume of railway work available for Dundalk was going to be reduced anyhow; that it was obvious <Col N="1534" /> that, when this agreement terminates, when the G.N.R. is cut at the Border, all the work they normally got from across the Border will be done in the U.T.A. works in Belfast and he thought it likely that C.I.E. would be able to do the balance of the work in their own workshops.  He went on to say that it was obvious, also, if they were going to develop these new activities which they were trying to develop or which the letter suggested, they would have to buy new equipment which would take some time to deliver and install.  In the meantime, he pointed out, a contract was being made with the G.N.R. Board to get the Dundalk Engineering Works to do all the work of the G.N.R. Board so long as that board remained in existence.</P>
    <P>In connection with the doubt as to what the attitude of C.I.E. might be, as he has no connection with the management of C.I.E., it should have been clear that he was expressing only a personal view.</P>
    <P>I was very much perturbed at some of the statements made in Dundalk which purported to be made on behalf of the trade unions representing the workers. I met the representatives of all the unions concerned and, when I say that, I do not want the House to think of three or four people sitting around a table.  There were 25 representatives present at the meeting I held.  It is quite clear that if meetings of that kind are to be repeated&mdash;and I think they can be exceedingly useful&mdash;there must be some assurance that statements made at them will be accurately reported outside.  I do not want to suggest that any of those who attended that conference have in any way misrepresented what I said or failed to report accurately everything that occurred there, but it is clear that, at second- or third-hand from them, some very garbled and inaccurate accounts reached the workers of Dundalk.</P>
    <P>One of the questions raised at this conference was the danger, as the workers saw it, of work now being done, particularly in connection with the road services operated by the G.N.R. at Dundalk, being transferred to the C.I.E. workshops in Dublin.  So <Col N="1535" /> far as railway work is concerned, it is reasonable to anticipate that there is going to be, if anything, a surplus of railway equipment for a time, so that, apart from normal running repairs, no new work is likely to be necessary.</P>
    <P>I have here a typescript of a report of the discussion I had with these 25 trade union representatives on the 5th November last.  It was the report that was made at the time and, in the paragraph dealing with this question of the relationship between the Dundalk Engineering Works and C.I.E., this is what I am reported to have said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He (that is, the Minister) had not yet discussed with C.I.E. the question of continuing the building of road passenger and road freight vehicles at the Dundalk Works.  He would have no objection to C.I.E. having such work done at Dundalk on a contract basis.  He expected that the position would be clarified in about six months.  He would be prepared to meet the unions again after the position was clarified.  In broad principle it would be contrary to Government policy to transfer to Dublin work which could be done at Dundalk.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of that, the suggestion which appears to have been made to the workers employed at Dundalk that a decision had already been taken to transfer to Dublin work which could de done at Dundalk was without any foundation.  Indeed, I tried to indicate here in the Dáil, when the motion for the £500,000 guarantee was under discussion, that it was not merely in my own case but in the case of everybody concerned that it was reasonable to expect that there would be goodwill and co-operation in bringing the Dundalk Engineering Company over what was likely to be a rather difficult transitional period during the next year or so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn, who spoke on this matter with far more knowledge of what is involved than Deputy McGilligan, referred to what I had said regarding my desire to effect these changes with the minimum of hardship and queried in that connection our intentions regarding the transfer of <Col N="1536" /> G.N.R. staffs to C.I.E. I do not anticipate any insuperable difficulty in that regard.  There is a multitude of details which I do not even pretend to have fully considered or even to comprehend at the moment and for which joint working parties have been set up, the reports of which will, no doubt, be available in good time.  I think, however, I can say in a broad general way that the transfer of G.N.R. workers to C.I.E. employment, when the amalgamation takes place, will not in any way worsen their position&mdash;in some way it must, clearly, improve their position&mdash; but there is no real solution for the problem of the Dundalk workshops on that basis.  The problem in Dundalk is to maintain employment and the whole purpose of the decision we have taken, the whole aim of all that is being done by the managing board of this company is to build up activities at Dundalk that will keep the workers there in employment.</P>

What I tried to do was to get the two processes to overlap, to get the new company working now examining the possibility of developing these new activities during a period when there is certain to be railway work available for Dundalk under their contract with the G.N.R.</P>

We can quote you this price for it&rdquo; and, on that basis, get a contract from C.I.E. to do this work, a contract which will be similar in character to the contract they have now made with the G.N.R. to do all their work during the period that the G.N.R. are in existence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coburn referred again to this question of compensation and I think there must be some misunderstanding in this regard.  I said that the G.N.R. workers are not entitled under any statute to compensation when disemployed through redundancy.  How anybody could give what purports to be legal advice to the contrary, I cannot understand.  The terms of the Act are clear and beyond all possibility of misunderstanding; therefore it is my view that nobody purporting to be a lawyer could have given advice of that sort.  I can only conclude we are <Col N="1538" /> talking about different things altogether. The position so far as C.I.E. workshops is concerned is that up to 1953 they had no entitlement to compensation and indeed it was not an unusual experience in railway workshops for the volume of employment to fluctuate from time to time.  In 1953 C.I.E. workshop employees got a right to compensation only when they were permanently deprived of their employment by reason of the dieselisation programme.  When I say that I feel there must be some misunderstanding, that arises from the knowledge that there is in existence a pension fund to which these workshop employees have contributed.  That fund is in substantial deficit but the payment of the pensions in guaranteed by the G.N.R.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme a worker leaving the G.N.R. employment would be entitled to a refund of his contributions, so, theoretically, when he goes from the G.N.R. to the Dundalk workshops there would be that entitlement to a refund of contributions but also a wiping out of the pension right.  I have indicated that my idea is to deal with that by legislation, transferring with the worker the pension right that he has, so that there will be no interruption in that regard.  I told the trade union delegation that in substitution for the guarantee that the G.N.R. Board have given, notwithstanding the deficit, pension payments will be backed by some other guarantor at least equally solvent.</P>

      <P>The Act which we passed setting up the G.N.R. Board is an Act which was negotiated with the Minister in Belfast.  It was an agreed measure, enacted simultaneously in both Dublin and Belfast in corresponding terms.  Indeed, if my recollection is not wrong, I pointed out to the Dáil, when introducing that Act here, that there were these differences between the provision in the C.I.E. Act and <Col N="1539" /> that Act and urged the Dáil not to seek to amend it as it was an agreed measure which had to be enacted without alteration.</P>

Within the past month or so there was an announcement of the intention to provide for some compensation although, from what I saw of the announcement, it would seem that their compensation payments will be on a much more restrictive basis than ours.</P>

      <P>About 20 minutes, I am nearly finished.  There are a few matters to which I want to refer to clarify what I said already.  Deputy Norton dealt in a general way with the main questions of policy that arise in this connection and I think he approached them in a fair and reasonable manner.  He told us what his views were on the aspects of the question on which he has reached conclusions and indicated the additional information he would require on some other matters before making up his mind.  He expressed doubts as to the possibility of attracting business back to the railway. I have these doubts also but I do not think they are quite so pronounced as are those of Deputy Norton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to statements I was supposed to have made when introducing the 1944 Transport Act and Deputy McGilligan referred to a statement made in 1951. I do not want to go over the past at all and would not ordinarily do so except where it has a bearing on the problems of the present.  When I introduced the 1944 Act, the war was on and it is quite preposterous to say <Col N="1540" /> that I was holding out the hope of an immediate improvement in the efficiency and cost of the transport services. What we did was set up the organisation which would be able to improve the public transport services as opportunity presented itself after the war.  We contemplated then a situation gradually developing when the war was over in which it was important that the public transport organisations should be ahead of private enterprise in the efficiency of their operations, in their ability to procure new equipment and in their ability to extend the scale of their services.</P>
    <P>We contemplated that in so far as we would continue to control the supply of materials and particularly of petrol we would deliberately use that control so as to facilitate the growth and extension of the public transport services after the war rather than the growth of private transport operations, believing that it was justifiable as a long term policy and indeed as a short term measure also in so far as all the public could get the benefit rather than the owners of private transport alone.</P>
    <P>By 1947 that possibility of improving the equipment in use in the railways, getting rid of some of the decrepit rolling stock used through the war years, and extending the scale of other operations, presented itself.  As some Deputies know, by 1947 orders were placed for the diesel locomotives which were to provide faster, cheaper and more efficient services, but in 1948 there was a change of Government.  A new Minister came in who felt that he could not take a decision without an investigation and there was a direction given to C.I.E., inspired, I think, by Deputy McGilligan, to stop all capital development on the improvement of the railway services and even to cancel the order for diesel locomotives.</P>
    <P>As mentioned here to-day by Deputy O'Higgins a further order went out not to increase fares or reduce costs but to stand still in every respect until a commission of inquiry was set up. The Milne Commission was set up and their report was issued about one year later.  It was not until 1950 that legislation arising out of that report was <Col N="1541" /> submitted to the Dáil.  The legislation did not, in fact, mean the adoption of any of the recommendations of the Milne Commission but it indicated the end of that standstill period and the beginning of a new period when C.I.E. were directed to go ahead and try to improve their services again.</P>
    <P>During the whole period contemplated when the 1944 Act was being framed as the time when the transport services would develop their efficiency and improve their business enterprise, they were doing nothing, while private transport was rushing ahead.  Lorries were being purchased by the thousand and the general impression was being created that the enterprising businessman went in for private transport and that only the stick-in-the-muds kept to the public transport services.  That process was further accentuated by what was in my view the most colossal mistake ever made by a trade union. There was a strike.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the trade unions concerned for having a strike; there will always be strikes, I suppose, and the workers are perfectly entitled to have them.  But during the strike the trade unions concerned decided to black list the goods of the firms that normally used the railways while they placed no impediment on the movement of the goods of firms who had not, up to then, been using the railways. That penalised the firms that were sticking to the railways and emphasised the supposed disadvantages of adhering to the public transport system.  Every firm in the country that was affected by that decision, that found itself unable to send its goods from one place to another by the public transport system and was denied the opportunity of sending them by an alternative method, immediately took a decision not to be caught that way again but to buy lorries and to establish their own private means of transport.</P>
    <P>These events created an attitude of mind among business people which was prejudicial to the railways.  They have, however, changed since then and it is my belief that if the management of the railways pursue an aggressive sales <Col N="1542" /> policy they can get back trade from some of the business people again.  One Deputy said that the trader who owns his own lorry appreciates the advantages of that lorry to such an extent that he will never be persuaded to abandon it and go back to the public transport system.  I think a very great number of them have never tried properly to assess the advantages and disadvantages of acquiring and possessing their own transport, and if the railways can offer an equivalent service at reasonable rates I firmly believe they will be able to show a number of these traders that it would pay them to go back to the public transport services rather than to retain their own form of private transport.</P>
    <P>I hope that belief will prove to be correct.  It will, of course, depend entirely upon the vigour with which the C.I.E. management try to avail of the new situation which will arise following the legislation I have foreshadowed and upon the outcome of the efforts made to increase the efficiency of the undertaking, to reduce its cost and to put it into a position to quote competitive charges.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters to which I think I should refer before I conclude because I think all Deputies should be clear in their ideas about them before they come to the House again in connection with the draft legislation.  Some Deputies approved and others disapproved of the intention to release C.I.E. from common carrier obligations arising from old enactments. This is a matter to which I have given considerable thought.  I suggested the possibility that with the withdrawal of these statutory obligations there might be instead some form of an appeal tribunal set up to which citizens alleging undue discrimination could take their complaints.</P>
    <P>The management of C.I.E. and other people have said that is not logical, that if you strip C.I.E. of these obligations there is no sense in putting on other obligations which might prove even more onerous to them.  There is a great deal to be said for the argument that this is not the same situation that existed 50 or 75 years ago, that now there is a public transport <Col N="1543" /> concern which is State property and in which there is no element of private interest, no question of profits arising from its operations, that we appoint a board to run it in the public interest and that that board does not need watch-dogs in the form of a tribunal to see that it does not act unfairly towards individual citizens.</P>
    <P>I have considerable sympathy with that point of view and I think that, relying on it, we could also deal with the point to which Deputy M.J. O'Higgins referred regarding the closing down of branch railway lines.  Any tribunal we will set up will consist of people of the same kind as those we have chosen to run the undertaking anyway.  Their decisions are not any more likely to be wiser than those taken by the people who are directing the day-to-day operations of the concern. There is, as I said, no comparison between the situation that exists now and that which obtained when these obligations were first put on the public transport undertaking.</P>
    <P>Then the undertaking had a complete monopoly.  In fact nobody could move freight over any distance except on the railways privately owned and working for profit and there was need for the Legislature to impose obligations on these undertakings to check and control their operations.  It did it to prevent damage to the public interest and to prevent the exercise of undue discrimination.  In the new situation we can, without fear, strip C.I.E. of these obligations and direct them merely to run their undertaking fairly and in the general interest.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is saying that nobody else can run a railway?  If anybody else wants to run a railway service we have several railways to give <Col N="1544" /> them, and we could easily be talked into parting with some of them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton referred to the removal of part of C.I.E.'s capital liability as a tidying-up operation.  I should like to emphasise that it is more than that.  My objective is to give to the C.I.E. management a realisable target to aim at.  So long as there was this burden of capital liability the tendency was to give up the idea of ever trying to make their accounts balance, but by taking away these capital liability burdens and by giving them a fixed subsidy by way of Grant-in-aid for a period of years, we give them for the first time in recent years the possibility of achieving that balance by their own efforts.</P>
      <P>I think it is a tremendous advantage to the morale of the organisation to be able to achieve the position where they can justify their operations by achieving results which the public will appreciate, particularly when they now understand that any economy they may introduce by the overhauling of their accountancy system, such as Deputy Casey suggested, or in any other way will redound to the benefit of the undertaking and not merely mean that the amount they have to ask from the Minister for Finance will be reduced correspondingly.  So long as there was no benefit to the undertaking by the introduction of economies the urge to find economies was reduced, but in the new circumstances I think a different atmosphere should prevail.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the need for employment of expert consultants to overhaul the accountancy section and other parts of the C.I.E. organisation.  That was dealt with in the committee's report, and it is undoubtedly something which is very desirable, but it is clearly a job of management.  It is not a question of legislating for it.  I think we can be certain to find a board that will be anxious to avail of all these techniques to improve their efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Casey asked me to give him some indication of the size of the Grant-in-Aid which is in contemplation. I could not do that at this stage. A number of factors have to be taken into account and I think it would be <Col N="1545" /> wrong for me to reach a decision without giving the C.I.E. Board a full opportunity of expressing their views in that regard.  With regard to external coaching tours I am in complete agreement with the views of the committee that it is desirable that these tours should be allowed in here. I am very conscious of the fact that C.I.E. tours are excellent and indeed the evidence which we have had from a multitude of sources of the quality, standard and efficiency of C.I.E. tours is unquestionable.  They are first-class tours.  I think Deputy Casey may have misunderstood this.  C.I.E. for their own purposes have decided to limit their operations to what are known as first-class tours, visiting first-class hotels, the expensive type of tour. There is a whole volume of business they do not touch because they do not want it, tours organised by workers' organisations, trade unions, and by various committees of one kind or another in other countries.  The C.I.E. tour is too expensive for such people but they can be accommodated in this country to our advantage on tours of a different kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>There were several things that C.I.E. did not want to do but which they should be made do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>From their point of view there were substantial objections to carrying on both types of operations and consequently there was this decision to allow these tours to be organised outside C.I.E., but in order to ensure that there would be no disadvantage to C.I.E. and no prejudicial results for our tourist trade, the arrangement is that licences to operate these tours are given only after the application has been considered by a committee which includes representatives of Bord Fáilte and C.I.E.  Each of them will check the application from their own points of view, C.I.E. to make sure it is not cutting across their <Col N="1546" /> line of operations and Bord Fáilte to ensure that it is in any event the type of operation likely to expand and protect the future of the tourist business.</P>
      <P>I think, in time, when the operation of these tours has demonstrated the advantage they can be to the country we can still further modify the restrictions regarding them.</P>
      <P>I do not think I have to deal with the Donegal position at present.  That is no doubt a complicated position but I think it would be inappropriate to attempt to deal with it until we have the G.N.R. position clarified.  As we know, part of the Donegal system is operated by G.N.R., part by the County Donegal Joint Committee of which the G.N.R. is half owner and part by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Company.  The whole future of railway operation in Donegal must obviously rest to a very considerable degree on the retention of the G.N.R. line to Derry from Portadown.  If that line should cease to operate there will, of course, be a completely different situation there.  But I must confess I do not feel there exists in Donegal at the moment a transport situation which requires such urgent action that we cannot afford to leave it stand over until this more general situation has been clarified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  Of course under existing legislation the tribunal procedure operates.  Indeed, there has been for some time past a desire on the part of the joint committee to close a number of sections of lines and some have been closed.  I think people who are interested in transport should take note of the operation of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Company which has completely got rid of its railways and is providing a very efficient and, as far as I know, adequate transport service. At the same time it is paying a dividend of 5 or 6 per cent. upon its capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins asked me if all the other matters mentioned in the <Col N="1547" /> committee's report, to which I have not referred, are still under consideration. That is so.  He must not take it, because I did not refer to it, I am accepting a committee recommendation. Some require examination and some, such as the recommendation regarding farmers carrying goods by tractors, have no direct bearing on transport policy at all but in any event these are matters which will be considered and we may have proposals to make in the legislation.  The fact that I did not refer to them is not to be taken to mean that they have been either accepted or rejected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain observations which I think fall to be made on this motion.  Last March is now well nigh nine months gone by, and in that month there was a general election, in very special circumstances. The inter-Party Government were then in the process of completing, and had virtually completed, the steps necessary to restore the balance of payments situation.  It is important to recall with very special clarity the reasons why, in the judgment of the inter-Party Government, it was a matter of vital interest to this country that the balance of payments situation should be brought into a proper condition. The alternative to taking the measures requisite to restore the balance of payments position was the prospect of mass unemployment, in circumstances when the Government would not have at its disposal the resources necessary to protect the bulk of the employed people from the consequences of such unemployment.</P>
      <P>It was with the primary purpose in mind of protecting the employment of the working people, that we made up our minds that, whatever the cost, we must create a favourable balance of payments, and to that end take such measures as might be necessary to restrict the inflow of imports while the flow of exports was expanding.  We would thus provide the foreign exchange which we require to purchase the essentials without which we could not do, if the standard of living of the people is to be maintained, and purchase the raw materials essential to the maintenance of employment for our industrial workers.</P>
      <P>I believe that the facts demonstrate that, by the time March last came, the necessary things had been done&mdash;exports were expanding and imports were contracting to such good effect that, in the first nine months of this year, for the first time since 1946, we had produced a favourable balance of payments in the trade of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that election period last March, Fianna Fáil gave sweeping undertakings all through the country, of <Col N="1551" /> what they proposed to do to put an end to unemployment and emigration. I remember two placards.  One was: &ldquo;Let's Get Cracking; Vote Fianna Fáil&rdquo;; and the other, I think a very indecent placard: &ldquo;Housewives, Vote Fianna Fáil and Get Jobs for your Husbands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Opposition has leant backwards to excess in its restraint during the last nine months, in not pressing the Government to say what they had in mind when they put up those posters.  But now I think we would be lacking in our duty, on the eve of the Christmas adjournment, if we did not ask the Government to tell us what they intend to do.  I am obliged to say that the impression I have got during the last nine months is that the Government has gone to sleep.  Is there any precedent in the recollection of any Deputy in this House, for a new Government to be in office for nine months and have presented to the Dáil nothing but Bills which were left in print by their predecessors? The public may not be aware of that fact, and the public may be surprised that debate in the Dáil has not been more active and vigorous during the last nine months, but the reason is simply that all the legislation which has been presented to this House in the last nine months was prepared by the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>The last matters with which we have been dealing were the Agricultural Institute Bill, which is identical with that presented by me to this House in December, 1956, and the Transport Report which, as Deputies know, was prepared by a commission set up by the previous Government and every other Bill has the same provenance. Am I not entitled to ask the Government what they have done or what they propose to do to realise the undertakings given by them?  We told the people what we intended to do and, let it be perfectly clear, the people rejected us in favour of what Fianna Fáil proposed.  It is relevant to recall that since that, general elections have been held in Holland, Canada, Finland, New Zealand and France, and in every one of them the Government that held office was put out.  There <Col N="1552" /> was a change of Government.  None of us are in a position to prophesy, but it would be a brave man who would lay much money on the existing Governments in certain other countries, both to the right and to the left of us, if they were called to face the electorate at the present time.</P>
    <P>It is so easy for an Opposition, when a Government is taking steps to restore equilibrium in the economy, to enter the arena and promise to reverse the necessary measures that are being taken and to perform miracles overnight. But the day of reckoning comes and the day of reckoning has come here when I am entitled to ask what has become of the Fianna Fáil plan that was to prevent the rise in the unemployment figures which has been going on for the last four or five weeks. What are the Fianna Fáil plans to prevent emigration which has been going on on a scale as great or greater than it has ever gone on before?  Our plans were clear and defined and I propose to refer to some of them here to-day and to invite Fianna Fáil to set against them what their programme is because, for good or ill, they are the Government until such time as the electorate in by-elections reject them. So long as they retain a majority in this House and choose to use it they remain the legitimate Government of this country, but Parliament has the right to hear from the Executive what the Executive proposes to do.</P>
    <P>Part of the Fianna Fáil positive declarations since they have taken office has been represented by the contributions of the Minister for Lands, and is revolting propaganda, that the capital expenditure in this community over the last ten years has been a waste of national resources.  I want to describe that campaign of the Minister for Lands as revolting irresponsibility. Some of us here remember the conditions in which this country was when we took it over in 1922.  I want to recall the offensive patronage with which certain people used to refer to dear, dirty Dublin.  And it was true of Dublin as I remember it as a child. The very part of it in which I lived, North Great George's Street, was a part to which you were ashamed to <Col N="1553" /> bring a stranger because you had to lead him through such slums as were hard to reproduce in any other city in Europe.  Those slums are gone.  I think of Hardwicke Street when I was a child.  Go up and look at it now.  Substituted for the festering slums in that street are now some of the most modern flat buildings in the world.  I think of Temple Street, of Lower Gardiner Street, of Gloucester Street, of all the areas in Dublin where there were people living two and three families to a room.  Those buildings are all gone and their place is taken by housing on which we spent, even in the last ten years, £100,000,000.</P>
    <P>I think not only of Gardiner Street, Dominick Street, and those other areas but of the country towns of Ireland.  I think of the town where I live where, when I was a child, half the houses were thatched houses and many of them houses consisting of one or two apartments.  They are all gone and in their place are houses where any man could rear a decent family with reasonable amenities for decent people. Quite apart from what was laid out in the early years of the State, in the last ten years £100,000,000 has gone into changing the housing conditions of our people.  Can that expenditure be legitimately described by the Minister for Lands or anybody else as slush? Do we regret that expenditure?  Are we to hang our heads for shame on account of it?  Are we to proclaim before the world that that outlay of our money in taking our people out of the slums was slush?  I do not think it was and I want to say with the fullest sense of responsibility and with the full authority of the Party to which I belong that if we had to do it again we would spend every penny of it.</P>

That is what Dáil Éireann is for.  We spent £9,000,000 on the farm building scheme since 1949. Now the Taoiseach says that is their scheme.  All the better.  Let him tell the Minister for Lands not to go down to Kilkenny and describe it as slush. We spent, in the last seven years, £6,000,000 on the ground limestone scheme.</P>

      <P>There is a limit to his audacity.  We spent the money necessary to plant 90,000 acres of forest since 1948.  Was that slush?  It was a very large capital investment which provided employment for our people and which will provide revenue when the forests reach maturity.</P>
      <P>We spent £12,000,000 since 1948 on the extension of the telephone service to the remotest parts of the country. I can see somebody here, with some shadow of justification, saying: &ldquo;You could have got on without the telephone.&rdquo; I do not think anybody living in rural Ireland will share that view.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to recall the fact that we built the sanatoria that were not there, and we built them to the point at which we have more accommodation now than we require for the patients. When we embarked upon that scheme we deliberately set out upon a programme to build more sanatoria than we would require, in the conviction that there was no other way to bring the plague of T.B. in this country under control.  Our aim was to put standing derelict sanatoria all over Ireland, which would no longer be required when we had our job completed. <Col N="1557" /> We have equalled the record of the State of New York in which at the present time 50 per cent. of the sanatoria there are idle for the want of patients to go into them.  I want to know does the Minister for Lands consider that slush?  If he does, I want to know what value does he set in cash on the lives of the children that did not die because we provided the sanatoria to secure that they would not die, because we provided the hospitals without which they would have died.</P>
    <P>I notice with interest that, when this matter is raised in a concrete form in Dáil Éireann, Fianna Fáil are ablaze to repudiate the Minister for Lands, but the fact remains, while the Taoiseach repudiates him in Dáil Éireann, he is sent around the country to repeat that falsehood and utter that slander at dinners, luncheons, banquets and wherever he can get a dog fight assembled to listen to him. I have been raising these categorical matters here and have challenged the Party of which he is a member, and the Government to which he belongs, to the point of repudiating him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be glad to hear from the Fianna Fáil Party, or any member of the Government, what was wasted?  What part of that outlay do <Col N="1558" /> you agree with the Minister for Lands was improvident dissipation of the resources of this country?  I think it was all well spent and I think I shall be able to demonstrate it was well spent because part of that expenditure, to which I have not yet referred, was involved under the land project on foot of which we have added 1,000,000 statute acres to the arable land of this country.  Is that slush? It was slush before we started on it. Most of it was marsh and bogland but it is growing good crops and carrying stock to-day to the great advantage of the country in many forms.  If it were not doing that, our economy would be very different to what in fact it is.</P>
      <P>I hear no words from Fianna Fáil as to what their policy is for increasing production.  I did hear 18 months ago from Fianna Fáil what their policy for increased production was.  Do any members of the Fianna Fáil Party remember the dinner in Clery's Restaurant where Deputy Lemass, the present Tánaiste, turned up and outlined a scheme involving the borrowing of £100,000,000 which was to be spent on increasing production in Ireland? What has become of that scheme? Why do we never hear anything about it now?  He is Tánaiste in this Government.  Has he dropped it and, if he has, what is the alternative proposal of the Government of which he is a member?  Deputy Lemass is Tánaiste, Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Head of the Government.  I notice he comes home from his discussions in Paris on the Free Trade Area and the Common Market and I am quite at a loss to follow what Deputy Lemass, the Tánaiste, is saying.  On his return from Paris, he announced quite casually that agriculture was to be included in the Free Trade Area. On the following morning, the Prime Minister of England, Mr. Macmillan, appeared to use language, as reported in yesterday's <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, indicating that Great Britain had no intention of including agriculture in the Free Trade Area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the time is overdue when the public of this country should be taken into the Government's confidence and <Col N="1559" /> let know what is the position in regard to Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Free Trade Area.  Without the information, I am not in a position to offer any opinion, but I think it right to remind the Government again of what I tried to remind them on an earlier occasion: the keystone of Irish diplomacy is the vital interest of Ireland.  I should like to know what this Government considers to be the vital interest of Ireland.  I would ask them to bear in mind that under the 1948 Trade Agreement Ireland at present enjoys a link in price between cattle in Great Britain and store cattle here which could make a difference at certain times of the year of up to £20 a head in cattle; Ireland enjoys under the 1948 Trade Agreement a preference at present in respect of butter worth approximately 30/- per cwt.; and in respect of bacon, a preference worth anything from 25/- to 30/- per cwt.  I would urge the Government very strongly that these very special considerations be borne in mind and that these very desirable assets, which we at present enjoy, will not be lightly relinquished, unless a very substantial <i>quid pro quo</i> is available.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not think it would serve any useful purpose to challenge the Government in being as to what its programme is, if we, on this side of the House, were not prepared to give some indication of what our policy is for increased production in this country, and I want to reaffirm on this occasion that we have a policy for increased production and that we believe it is a good policy.  We believe it has been tested and can be checked on its results.  We want to put it on the table now and invite Fianna Fáil to say what its alternative is, or in what respect it proposes to depart from the policy as laid down by us.</P>
    <P>Our policy for increased production in agriculture is substantially based on nine propositions: (1) the land project, in order to restore fertility to that part of the land of Ireland which has become infertile, through neglect, and the reclamation of which is beyond the capacity of those in whose ownership it is, without State assistance; <Col N="1560" /> (2) the lime scheme, under which 1,000,000 tons of lime are being annually applied to the land of Ireland &mdash;an application which could, with great advantage, be doubled if we could persuade the farmers to do so; (3) the removal of the Fianna Fáil tax of 20 per cent. which they put on superphosphate and which we removed in order to expand the use of phosphates on the land of Ireland.  The Taoiseach appears to dissent from that proposition.</P>

At least he will agree that is the true version; they put the tax on &ldquo;super&rdquo; and we took it off.

      <P>Yes.  Let us tell that tale again, because I want to tell the House that it would not be fair for Fianna Fáil to say that there were no soil-testing facilities when they left office in 1948.  There were, and they were located in Ballyhaise.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will hear it again.  They were located in Ballyhaise. There was a laboratory in Ballyhaise, a dreary kind of a room, but it was a room, and it had a roof on it, and in that room there was one man and one boy, and in their persons were concentrated the entire soil-testing resources of the Irish nation.  Their equipment was of an arresting character.  It consisted of a disused medicine bottle, tied to a discarded bicycle wheel, revolving on a fourpenny nail, and the little boy's job was to spin the wheel with his finger.  Those were the entire soil-testing resources of this country in February, 1948.  We have to-day in Johnstown, in the new soil-testing laboratory which has been completed there, the most up-to-date soil testing service in the world, and it is dealing with 100,000 samples per annum for the farmers of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the seventh point of the programme on which our policy for expansion is based, that is, the 1948 Trade Agreement.  The eighth point is the parish plan.  There is a history to the parish plan and to me it is quite a fascinating history.  When the Taoiseach speaks in public, he is all for the parish plan.  He thinks it is a splendid plan economically, socially and in every other way, but when Deputy Moher goes to the Cork County Committee of Agriculture, he <Col N="1562" /> is quite determined that the parish plan will not work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not putting Deputy Moher in the same category as Deputy Corry or his leader, the Minister for Health.  Their function is to throw the dirt; Deputy Moher's function is to throw the spanner into the works.  It is always a clean and shining spanner and it is always most politely thrown but it is thrown for the same purpose of gumming up the works.  It achieves its purpose.  I issued a challenge before and I do so now again in respect of the parish plan.  I invite any honest Deputy, and there are some honest Deputies, to judge the parish plan, not by the best group of three parishes, but by any group of parishes. Take the worst group of all and I say it demonstrates the benefit to the people it is to have an agricultural adviser for every group of three parishes covering approximately 1,000 farms.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that any rational Government will come to the conclusion that, given a fair chance, it would be money well spent to intensify that service and provide one parish agent for every rural parish in Ireland.  I suggest that in all the schemes I am outlining as being an effective programme for increasing agricultural production no element is more important than the parish plan and the provision of an adequate advisory service for those who have to make their living on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We provided, for the first time in the history of this country, a guaranteed minimum price for pigs and for feeding barley.  I think it is right that the Government and the country should know the result of that.  Two years ago, we prescribed a minimum price for pigs.  We did that by making a levy per pig on every pig that went into the curer's factory and by giving a guaranteed price to every curer who exported bacon from this country.  As a result of that policy, it has been possible for us to maintain for our farmers a stable minimum price for Grade A pigs over the past two years; and for the past three, four or five months, we <Col N="1563" /> have been able to maintain a price of 235/- for Grade A pigs although during some of that period, bacon has been selling in London at 230/- and farmers in Denmark have been accepting 150/- for their pigs.  To that stabilisation scheme, the Exchequer is committed to a contribution of £150,000 per annum.  It is a scheme under which the guaranteed minimum price for Grade A pigs cannot be changed without six months' notice to the producer. The existence of that scheme has made it possible to provide a guaranteed minimum price for feeding barley, with the result that in this year it is estimated that there were 400,000 tons of barley produced in this country.</P>
    <P>Our ninth plank is the scheme introduced by us in 1954 for the eradication of T.B. in cattle.  I hope that scheme is being pressed forward as I think it ought to be.  I do not want to underestimate the difficulties of any Minister for Agriculture in dealing with this matter, but I like to recall that when I brought in the scheme in Dáil Éireann, although it was not opposed, some Deputies from Sligo expressed concern that their county and County Clare were to be the first two counties which were to have intensive attention under the scheme.  I said on that occasion that the people of Sligo would live to bless this plan because, when they became an attested area, people would come to buy their cattle from every part of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This much is certain now that, whether we like it or not, the tuberculosis eradication scheme must be pressed forward.  Our aim ought to be to get the country cleared in 1960.  I doubt if any Minister could achieve that aim, and I will not deride any Minister <Col N="1564" /> for Agriculture who fails to achieve that aim.  However, that ought to be the aim before him, and the nearer we can get to that date, the better it will be for our economy as a whole.  If we have an abrogation of the 1948 Trade Agreement without an adequate <i>quid pro quo</i>, or the loss of the British market through failure to eradicate tuberculosis in our live stock, there is not a living person in the Republic whose standard of living will not be very substantially and immediately reduced.</P>
      <P>In evaluating any policy, we must ask ourselves what are the results of that policy.  It is by that test that I would like to challenge Fianna Fáil.  I am able to apply the test of results only to Fianna Fáil policy in agriculture in the past, as I am able to apply that test only to our policy in the past. You cannot judge progeny in an animal by its appearance.  Even when Deputy Moher calls out from the platform and says: &ldquo;Let us get cracking&rdquo; and on the other hand, says to his neighbours: &ldquo;Wives, vote for me so that your husbands may get employment&rdquo; they will be well&mdash;advised to apply the same criterion to Deputy Moher as they would to a quadruped and say: &ldquo;We shall judge you by results.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What are the results of the policy for which Deputy Moher's Party has been responsible?  I can speak only of what I have personal knowledge.  After 16 years of Fianna Fáil policy, in 1948 there were fewer cattle on the land of Ireland than at any time in our recorded history, fewer sheep, fewer pigs, and the land of Ireland was in a state of dereliction unprecedented in our history. It was in that situation that we took over to apply our policy, starting from a point where we had less live stock than we ever had before and more devastated land than this country had ever seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What were the results?  I asked the Taoiseach some questions the week before last and I asked the Minister for Agriculture some questions last week, designed to elicit from them what the output of the agricultural industry had been last year, which was the harvest of our last sowing.  Let us judge the policy for which we were responsible <Col N="1565" /> by the answers the Fianna Fáil Ministers gave to these questions. Up to the 16th November, the mills had received 3,066,000 barrels of wheat, the greatest crop of wheat ever gathered in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>So it can be grown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Our exports of bacon had increased to £2,059,000 in the first nine months of this year as compared with something like £80,000 in the first nine months of last year.  The quantity of creamery butter produced in this country up to the 31st October, 1957, was 897,000 cwts., the greatest quantity of butter ever produced in the creameries of Ireland.  The quantity of milk received in the creameries was 260,994,000 gallons, the greatest quantity ever delivered to the creameries of Ireland in the history of Ireland. The estimated output of the 1957 barely harvest was 400,000 tons, the largest barley harvest ever gathered in the history of Ireland.  The export of live cattle from Ireland in the first nine months of 1957 was 697,321, a greater number than had ever been exported in the history of this country.  Our total output of cattle for the year 1956, which is the last year for which figures are available, amounted to 994,000 cattle.  That is our exports, our dead&mdash;meat exports and domestic consumption.  That is the highest figure ever recorded, with the exception of 1954 and 1938-39.</P>
      <P>There are some cheerful Christians who are inclined to qualify their rejoicing at those figures by saying: &ldquo;Ah, but the cattle population is going down.&rdquo;  Fortunately, the facts do not sustain that, because in the last enumeration of our cattle, in June, 1957, we have an increase of 42,000 in the number of our milch cows and an increase of 8,900 in our heifers and calves.  There has been a substantial reduction in the number of our cattle two years old and under three and in the number of our cattle over three years old, which is a thoroughly desirable development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people here have completely come to overlook the value of sheep to our economy, but I direct the attention of the House to the fact that, in <Col N="1566" /> the last ten years, the sheep population of this country has increased from approximately 2,000,000 to 3,707,000 in June, 1957.  I believe that this year we will reach the happy position of having put more pigs into the bacon factories of Ireland.  Although that is by no means the end of all of our objectives, I believe these tendencies make it perfectly clear that the policies which we have advocated have had results.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word in respect of the pig situation.  There are two factors at present causing considerable anxiety to the pig producers of this country.  One is that they are not satisfied that the existing grading system in the factories is doing full justice to the producers.  The other is that they feel the present general standstill Order throughout the country is in excess of the essential requirements that a prudent Minister for Agriculture would operate for the eradication of swine fever.</P>
    <P>I have said, and I want to reiterate, I am prepared, and the Party of which I am a member is prepared, to sustain the Minister for Agriculture in any necessary measures which he must take to eradicate swine fever.  But at the same time due regard should be had to the very severe hardships in which a protracted general standstill Order involves a great many of our people.  I know it is very hard for a Minister for Agriculture to query or reject the technical advice of his veterinary advisers. But I also know, and anyone with experience knows, that a veterinary adviser is obliged by the nature of his calling to recommend to his Minister what in his judgment, from the veterinary point of view, is the optimum course.</P>
    <P>It is the function of a responsible Minister for Agriculture to listen and give due weight to the veterinary advice he receives, but it is also his function to listen and give due weight to the advice received from his livestock technical officers and others qualified to advise him and then give a judgment, not only in the light of the technical veterinary aspects but in regard to all the aspects of the question which legitimately engage the concern of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I have already replied to a number of Dáil questions on the subject of unemployment since last March.

      <P>There is in progress in the House today a debate on the economic position, in the course of which the subject of unemployment will no doubt be dealt with from various points of view. The Government's position in the matter will be dealt with in speeches by Ministers, and I myself hope to speak this afternoon.  I think that this is the best way of bringing to light the complexity of the problem and any proposals or suggestions for dealing with it&mdash;far better than the method of putting down questions at short intervals, in disregard of the long&mdash;term nature of the problem and of the fact that, as experience under successive administrations has fully shown, it does not lend itself to solution by ready&mdash;made short&mdash;term devices.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider having a survey made of the upper reaches of the River Fergus, County Clare, so as to get an estimate of the cost of dredging and deepening it in order to ease the annual flooding of the lands adjoining the river, which causes serious losses to the farmers concerned.</P>

      <P>The river Fergus catchment area has been listed for treatment under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, and for that purpose an engineering survey will be carried out in due course.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant provision of the law in relation to the procedure of the censorship board, which is contained in Section 11 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, lays it down that four members shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the board and that a prohibition Order shall not be made unless at such meeting three at least of the members vote in favour <Col N="1580" /> of the making of the Order and not more than one member votes against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in reply to a supplementary question earlier, said he was satisfied that the board was operating as efficiently as ever.  In view of the last figure he quoted as representing the number of books condemned, is he satisfied that it is a fair rate of work?  Secondly, is he aware that the number of books of an unsavoury character is increasing daily upon the streets of the City of Dublin and elsewhere, and is he satisfied the board can deal with this problem adequately under the present set up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied the Deputy has as much and more responsibility for the situation which he has described as I have by reason of the fact that for six months when he was Minister he, in conjunction with his colleagues, failed to fill two vacancies on the board which were there at the <Col N="1581" /> time.  For six months, by reason of the fact that there was no quorum the board were unable to meet.  It is quite possible that during that time quite large numbers of the type of book to which the Deputy refers may have been circulated.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, for a further six months the chairman of the board was in disagreement with two other members of the board and he refused to call a meeting of the board unless I was prepared to remove these two members.  That is something I could not have done in the circumstances because of the terms of the Act.  That is the situation which the new chairman is trying to overcome and I think we ought at least give the board an opportunity of dealing with the situation to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw that phrase, but I shall use these words: is the Minister casting responsibility from his own shoulders and trying to <Col N="1582" /> put it on the shoulders of his predecessor by saying that his predecessor's failure to appoint two members for six months led to this situation?  Is the Minister satisfied that is a positive fact, that it has led to, or assisted in, bringing about this situation? Secondly, is the Minister satisfied that the grounds of the dispute to which he has referred in his reply between the chairman and two members of the board were well established?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot go into the dispute now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister has said this was one of the reasons, it arises out of his reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied on the representations made to him by the chairman that a case was not made, that a case was not substantially established by the chairman?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that uncertainty as to the Government's intentions regarding the majority recommendation of the Liquor Commission concerning bona fide trading, which, if implemented, would cause much unemployment in Tramore and other areas, has had the effect of depreciating seriously the value of licensed premises in these areas, and is holding up traders who intended to improve their premises; and if he will now make a statement on the Government's proposals in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the commission is still under consideration and I am not yet in a position to say what <Col N="1583" /> action may be taken on its recommendations nor do I expect to be able to do so for some considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that it is of the utmost importance that an early decision should be made and announced on this matter, and would the Minister endeavour to see in the interests of all concerned that that will be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy does not realise the difficulties involved in a question of this kind.  First of all, this is a pretty voluminous report as the Deputy no doubt knows.  It has to be examined departmentally.  It is now in at least five or six different Departments undergoing examination. When it comes back it will then have to be examined in my own Department, by myself, and submitted to the Government.  When the Government has dealt with it eventually it must be submitted to the draftsman, and with all that type of administrative delay I could not promise any specified date on which I would be likely to introduce the Bill dealing with this situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to alter the existing arrangement under <Col N="1585" /> which the export trade in seed potatoes is handled by the Irish Potato Marketing Company, as I am satisfied that, in present conditions on the export markets, a central selling organisation can secure the most remunerative returns in the interests of growers generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Northern Ireland which has six counties, is exporting approximately four times the quantity of seed potatoes we are exporting although they are free of control?  There is a real market for seed potatoes and does the Minister not consider that the Potato Marketing Board has failed to fulfil its function and that it would be advantageous to allow farmers to make direct arrangements to export potatoes instead of being frustrated by the Potato Marketing Board who seem to have inhibitions about exporting any potatoes other than table potatoes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not be induced to believe these operations could not be carried out effectively by some such organisation as is mentioned here.  Surely all the arguments point the other way&mdash;that advantages must accrue to us in a general sense through employing the machinery we have for the disposal of both seed and ware potatoes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>If other countries can export four or five times as much seed potatoes as we are exporting, without control, why cannot we be free also? Why must we be restricted in everything we do in this country by bureaucracy? The figures are there and I can give them to the Minister tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that other countries may be able to achieve the end which the Deputy has mentioned does not prove that an organisation of this kind is not vital in our circumstances. To me that is no argument against this central organisation.  I am not satisfied and I am sure the same would apply to my predecessor&mdash;that what the Deputy claims is true and would prove to be true, because after all we have evidence, I suppose from the time <Col N="1586" /> of the setting up of this organisation, that private enterprise, which might be able to handle the cream of the market available, cannot reach the distances we expect in the case of our seed and in some instances of our ware potatoes.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that, and I have not been asked that until the Deputy put it in the form of a supplementary. I have been asked what, in my opinion, is the general purpose of the Central Marketing Body as against leaving the market free and reverting to the position where the individual grower marketed his crop in whatever fashion he liked.  I have given my answer, and it is one, the truth of which, the accuracy of which and the wisdom of which I am fairly solidly convinced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if any steps are being taken with a view to increasing the export of dressed beef from this country to Italy, and if he will make a general statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The export of carcase beef to Italy has in fact been increased substantially in 1957.  For the first nine months of that year exports amounted to over 29,400 cwt., as compared with 2,950 cwt. in the whole of 1956 and nil in 1955 and 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The import of carcase beef into Italy is not subject to quota control and the development of our export to that market therefore depends mainly on the trend of prices there.  Our meat exporters, who have acquired considerable experience of continental markets <Col N="1588" /> in recent years, keep in close touch with market developments and avail of every opportunity to increase their sales.  Every possible assistance is given by my Department which maintains close contact with exporters, and by the Legation in Rome.</P>
    <P>I understand that refrigerated shipping to continental ports is now more readily available than in previous years and this has also facilitated the expansion of the trade.</P>

For the whole of last year, however, so far as information as to artiste's occupation is known, the total number <Col N="1599" /> of State employees engaged was 54 and the payments of fees amounted to £3,182 19s. 9d.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations currently in force regarding appointments as auxiliary postmen require that, ordinarily, candidates, who should be nominated by the employment exchange and reside within a three miles <Col N="1600" /> radius of the office where the vacancy exists, should be within the age limits 18 to 50 years.  They also require that candidates should be free from physical defects which would interfere with the work, conform to a minimum height standard, possess a good character and a reasonable standard of education. Where the employment is in a Gaeltacht district a good knowledge of Irish is required.</P>
      <P>Preference is accorded to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Candidates who have been granted an active or general service medal for service during the period of 1916-23.</P>
      <P>2.  Ex-members of the permanent Defence Forces who have had not less than five years' satisfactory service; such preferential treatment is restricted to a period of two years following discharge from military service.</P>
      <P>The age limits (18 to 50 years) do not apply to candidates entitled to preference on grounds of national service. Service with An Fórsa Cosanta Aitiúil does not entitle a candidate to preference.</P>
      <P>Possession of an active or general service medal in respect of service during the period 1916-23 is regarded as verification of service in that period and service with the permanent Defence Forces is verified by inspection of the certificate of service or of discharge.</P>

      <P>I shall not deal further with the specific matters in relation to the pig industry to which I was referring save to say that the Minister would be well advised to review this <Col N="1603" /> matter at an early stage.  We want to help in the eradication of the present outbreak of swine fever but it is our duty to say that the burden is becoming extremely heavy on small farmers with large numbers of young pigs who are unable to move them.  It should be legitimate now to consider whether limited movement in respect of certain categories of pigs might not be allowed in restricted areas.  The Minister is bound to bear in mind the value of the pig industry as a whole and the danger there is of driving people out of that industry if they find that the burden is becoming unbearable.</P>
      <P>I am in the difficulty that I cannot praise or indict the Fianna Fáil policy for increased production because I do not know what it is.  Anything that I have read so far in publications of consequence I have been constrained to comment upon adversely to-day with special reference to the observations of the Minister for Lands.  I do observe that, despite the Taoiseach's reply to-day to questions put to him, unemployment has jumped in the last three or four weeks.  It is common knowledge amongst us that emigration is proceeding at a rampant rate.  I am entitled to ask Fianna Fáil what has become of their general election poster campaign, what are they doing about it or was it all fraud?</P>
      <P>The only categorical statement of policy put out by Fianna Fáil was that of the Tánaiste when he spoke of the £100,000,000 Fianna Fáil plan.  It was published in the Fianna Fáil Party <i>Pravda.</i>  Do you remember that?</P>

I return now to the fact that the £100,000,000 proposal was published as a supplement in the Fianna Fáil <i>Pravda.</i>  I am entitled to ask, two years after, for the delectation of the Irish people, what has become of it. <Col N="1605" /> I am told by Deputy Haughey that it has been put in cold storage not because there is an adverse balance of payments but because the external assets are less now than then.

      <P>We are all agreed that the cost of living is going up.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has agreed to a formula whereunder industrial workers are to get increased wages to compensate, within a limit of 10/- per week.  What proposals does this House make to assist the 500,000 farmers of this country, the great majority of whom are living on holdings of 20 acres or below 30 acres of land and whose average weekly income is substantially less than that of any industrial worker?  What proposal is there to help him to meet that cost of living increase?  Or are we drifting back into the happy state&mdash; and I speak ironically&mdash;that this country was in prior to 1948, when the small farmers were cast for the role of hewers of wood and drawers of water, when they were the despised element in our community and when they were <Col N="1609" /> the element to whom the Minister for Agriculture could say in Dáil Éireann, as reported in Volume 106, column 2239:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would have had inspectors tucked after them, and I would have tucked them out into fresh land, and I would compel them to break fresh land, and if they did not do it, I would tuck in the tractors through the ditches and through the gates and tuck out the land for them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    <P>I do not blame Deputy Moher for leaving the House particularly when he hears Deputy Loughman beside him interpose &ldquo;and quite right too&rdquo;. Are we on the road back to that?  Deputy Loughman like myself is primarily a business man.  He is not a farmer.  I see that the Deputy has now left.  That is another one gone.  The truth is hard to bear.  Could there be any more eloquent peroration than the two vacant seats and the two receding backs that we have just seen?  If their colleagues can contradict a word I have said they can disregard it all. There were two of them there who sought to challenge it and now as I sit down their seats are empty but let them read it in the report.  If as Deputy Loughman thinks, they can revive <Col N="1610" /> in this country the dispensations we broke down in 1947 they have another think coming.</P>

      <P>It was not a white elephant.  If the Opposition have come in here to interrupt and make a jeer of the plight of the people, because that is what they are doing, let me remind them that the rural electrification scheme was initiated by a Fianna <Col N="1611" /> Fáil Government.  It was started by a Fianna Fáil Government which had decided that the benefits of electricity should be brought, so far as possible, down to every farm house in the country.  It found the money to do that, it found half the cost to do that out of the public Exchequer.  It was necessary that the scheme should be subsidised in order that electricity might be made available to the farmers of Ireland at rates which they could pay.</P>
      <P>We took upon ourselves the responsibility of raising the money and of course imposing the necessary taxation to defray the charges which would undoubtedly arise in consequence.  This scheme went ahead on that basis until the second Coalition Government came in and what did Deputy Dillon and his colleagues do then?  Not merely did they discontinue the subsidy, and thereby increased the direct cost of electricity to every user in the country. They also by their action tended to slow down the rate at which the rural inhabitants would have the benefits of electricity.  Not merely did they do all this.  They dishonoured the bond which the Fianna Fáil Government had entered into with the E.S.B., an obligation which had been accepted by the first Coalition and which had not been disturbed by the Fianna Fáil Government from 1951 to 1954.</P>
      <P>As I say they were guilty of a breach of public faith with this statutory body because not only did they discontinue the subsidy, but they imposed retrospectively on the E.S.B. the obligation of repaying so much of the subsidy as had already been paid out to it.  Yet Deputy Dillon has the hardihood now to come in here and say it was the Coalition Government which was responsible not merely for initiating the hospitalisation programme, not merely for erecting the sanatoria, but also for initiating and carrying through the rural electrification scheme.</P>

    <P>Yesterday I was looking at a cartoon in a newspaper.

      <P>But this speech of Deputy Dillon had a purpose.  I understood that this debate was to concern itself with the present problems of the people, the economic conditions prevailing in the country.  The speech which Deputy Dillon made did not relate to those conditions at all, not from beginning to end.  They were not aimless remarks.  I am sure they were well directed to their purpose and the purpose of them was to divert the minds of the people from the seriousness of the situation&mdash;the seriousness of the situation which the second Coalition Government left behind it.</P>
      <P>The problems with which the country is confronted to-day are not of recent creation.  They are the product of the policy initiated by the Coalition Government in 1949; the policy which, as Deputy Dillon has told us, made the millions fly; the policy under which they borrowed £40,000,000 from the American Government and could find no better way of spending than by flinging out $6,000,000 in one afternoon to buy cereals which we could have produced in this country; the policy which has left every successive Government from now until 35 years have elapsed with the burden of extracting out of industry in this country, of taking out of the pockets of the citizens, an increasing amount of money every year until that American debt is repaid.  The £40,000,000 which Deputy Dillon borrowed has been spent as he boasted they would spend them and the burden is now falling on the people of repaying that money.  It will be repaid out of the toil and sweat of the Irish people and for that Deputy Dillon and his colleagues are responsible. It was not necessary to borrow that money.  It was borrowed with the deliberate purpose of creating an inflationary situation here.</P>

Out of the £40,000,000 I do not think that £6,000,000 was spent on what might be described as capital goods, as productive equipment.

      <P>Deputy Dillon has referred to the balance of payments both in the course of his speech and by way of interruption.  Apparently he attaches a great deal of importance to it.  So do we all.  For any year it might be described as the final accounting.  It gives us the figures which indicate the final out-turn of our operations as a trading community from year to year.</P>
      <P>Let us see what the position was in the past in regard to it.  In 1947, which was the year before the Coalition Government came in for the first time, there was a deficit of £29.8 million.  It was large by comparison with anything we had hitherto experienced.  In fact we had not experienced any substantial deficit in any previous year, even in 1939 and even during the economic war about which Deputy Dillon so frequently twits us so often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1947 there arose the first deficit of any substantial amount.  It was a relatively small deficit having regard <Col N="1615" /> to our resources at the time and to the conditions from which we were emerging. Over the period from 1940 to 1946 it was impossible to import many things which were necessary for the expansion of our industries and for the maintenance of our economic activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Deputy did not say &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; in 1945 and 1946 when he was going out bellowing to the people about the hardships they were undergoing then. He knows as well as I do that those hardships were not of our making, but that they were imposed by world circumstances at the time.  However, conditions began to improve when materials became available, when it was possible for us to resume the industrial development interrupted by the war in 1939.  It was, of course, imperative for us to import new plant and to build up our stocks of raw materials and in many ways to make good the deficiencies which were a consequence of the war.  Therefore, in 1947, we had a deficit of £29.8 million in our balance of payments. It was a relatively small deficit in relation to the resources which were at our disposal.  But it was sufficiently large to compel the then Taoiseach, now Deputy Costello, to speak in August of 1948&mdash;I think&mdash;and refer in rather startling terms to this deficit which had emerged as a result of our external transactions during the year 1947.  In consequence of that, there was imposed by the then Government a certain slackening in activity: things were slowed down and the old hidebound, conservative Fine Gael mentality was beginning to prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not one of those who think we can cure all the nation's ills by spending money we do not have, or are not prepared to save, or which we must borrow and ultimately repay, but there is, I believe, a happy mean between extravagance and demoralising lack of enterprise.  However, it was the un-enterprising element that shaped the policy of the Government in 1948 <Col N="1616" /> and continued to shape it during 1949, because the deficit in the balance of payments fell from £29.8 million to £19.7 in 1948 and to £9.7 million pounds in 1949.  And then there came the change to which I have referred.  Then Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, was&mdash;as Deputy Dillon said in reference to another matter&mdash;put into cold storage at the behest of the then Minister for External Affairs.</P>

      <P>Consequences which were reflected in the serious balance of payments deficit which began to emerge in 1950, when it jumped from £9.7 million to £30.2 million in that year, to be succeeded in the year 1951 by a deficit amounting to no less than £61.6 million.</P>
      <P>It has been said that history does not repeat itself.  Perhaps it does not repeat itself in detail but it may often do so in a general way and indeed in relation to our economic situation it has repeated itself in a general way. It did so from 1954 over the period of the second Coalition Government, because what I am about to establish is the striking similarity between the conditions which obtained when we took office in June, 1951, and the conditions as they existed when we took office in March of this year.</P>
      <P>Let us deal with the balance of payments to which I have referred.  In 1950 it was £30.2 million; in 1951 it was £61.6 million; in 1955 it was £35.5 million, and in 1956 it was £14.4 million. What was the interim trend of the balance of payments over the period from 1951 until we were leaving office and the Coalition Government took office in 1954?</P>

The old MacBride policy was restored and the balance of payments deficit jumped to £35,500,000. That was in the year 1955.  In that year, a motion was brought into Dáil Éireann, a motion of no confidence in the Government, and in the course of that debate Fianna Fáil Deputies warned the Government as to what the consequences of their policy would be. They were jeered at, and sneered at, and told that everything was for the best in the best of all possible worlds here in Ireland, because we had a Coalition Government in office.  Within less than six months the Minister for Finance in the second Coalition Government came in here on the Vote on Account and described the economic peril which the country was facing.  He begged and implored us to allow him to take measures to deal with it.  That was in March, 1956.  I have referred to the position which existed in 1951 when we took over&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I referred to the position when we took over in June, 1951.  I had only been four or five weeks in office as Minister for Finance when I came here and did something quite unusual.  As a rule the Vote for the Department for Finance goes through the House without discussion and without any form of statement by the Minister.  But the situation which I found confronting me in the Department of Finance when I took over from my predecessor, was so serious that I thought it advisable to let the country know immediately what that situation was.  I said that four features of it called for immediate and careful consideration.</P>
      <P>The first of these was the character and adequacy of the Budget introduced by my predecessor, Deputy McGilligan.  That Budget was never discussed in the House.  It was introduced on the 4th May and before the House met again the Dáil was dissolved and we were plunged into a general election.  I then referred to the problem of unwieldy capital expenditure. I spoke about our trading situation with the rest of the world as reflected in the balance of payments and I spoke about the rapid dissipation of our external assets.  These were all serious matters reflecting the serious position in which the country then was.  Instead of being received as my successor&mdash; now Deputy Sweetman&mdash;was received when he came to the House in March, 1956, this considered statement of mine, which was subsequently substantiated up to the hilt by the actual facts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But the situation was very similar then to what it is to-day.  I predicted as early as two months after Deputy McGilligan had introduced his Budget proposals to <Col N="1619" /> this House&mdash;I informed the Dáil that many important matters had not been covered&mdash;that, so far as I could see, the out-turn of the Budget for the year would be a deficit of about £5,000,000. Talking from recollection, it was I think, in fact, an actual deficit of £6.7 million.  Again, in October, 1956, the Minister for Finance being still alarmed about the existing situation brought in further proposals to impose special levies.  Now, I do not want to be unduly censorious or unfair to the inter-Party Minister for Finance.  As I said, when these proposals were before the House, they were the best that he could think of and, as the situation was in our view extremely grave, we did not intend to oppose them though we did think that the effect of some of them would be very grave indeed so far as many industries were concerned.  But we received them and we dealt with them rationally.  We did not get up and make the sort of speech to which Deputy Dillon treated the House to-day.  We dealt with them as responsible men, concerned with the problems of the country and the effect upon the lives of our people of the conditions to which the public economy had been reduced.  As I said, we were serious.  There was no factious opposition.  Indeed, to the extent of possibly imperilling our own reputation with our own people, we supported the measures which Deputy Sweetman proposed.</P>
      <P>Let me see what the result of those measures was.  We warned Deputy Sweetman that we thought this whole idea of the blanket levy undesirable, but we had in mind also the fact that the balance of payments position was extremely grave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been £35.5 million in 1955, the balance of payments deficit was in 1956 running at a rate which we thought was exceedingly undesirable and, therefore, we were prepared to concede him the powers which he was asking.  What was one of the results of the measures which he adopted?  The Deputy has referred to the unemployment position.</P>

I am talking now about persons having unemployment benefit claims current; these are the persons who would normally be in employment.  The unemployment assistance figure is, as everybody knows, distorted by the fact that at this time of the year the Employment Order ceases and a very large number of people come on the register, people who are not in the strict sense of the word &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo;, many of whom are in general self-employed having small holdings not considered adequate to enable them to sustain themselves and their families in decency during the winter and early spring.</P>

      <P>On the 23rd November, 1955, there were 22,537 persons drawing unemployment benefit.  On <Col N="1621" /> the corresponding date in 1956 that figure had jumped from 22,000 to 32,000, an increase of 45 per cent.  That was the result of the sort of policy that the Coalition Government had been pursuing. This year, while it has not yet reverted to the 1955 level, the figure does show a considerable improvement and a very satisfactory trend in contrast to the figure for the year 1956; on the 23rd November, 1957, the figure was 27,307 as against 32,664.</P>

      <P>In the year 1955, for the week ending 16th November, there were 22,000 persons claiming unemployment benefit.  In the following year, 1956, that number had jumped to <Col N="1622" /> 31,832.  This year it is down to 26,001. I am not quoting these figures in any spirit of complacency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What do you think happened then?  On the 9th November, 1955, there were 21,000 claiming unemployment benefit.  It had jumped to 22,000 on 16th November, 1955, and it went up further to 22,500 on the 23rd November.  Does not everybody know that at this period of the year, due to slackening in building activities and slackening in outdoor work of all sorts and a sort of general malaise which seems to take place just immediately before Christmas, there is more unemployment? This is the slack period in virtually every industry and consequently people who have been employed for the greater part of the preceding 12 months occasionally have to go to the unemployment exchange at this period of the year.  Are we to be blamed because in this year, 1957, the general trend of every other year is being followed?</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has again been talking about the balance of payments, and he has been claiming some credit for the fact that this year it is down to what I think is a very precarious balance.  He seems to think that in some way this is due to something which was done last year or the year before by the Coalition Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will look at the figures for the months of January and September in the years 1956 and 1957 he will find that our imports have fallen by £3,011,000 and our exports have increased by £21,820,000. The net result is that the balance of payments is about balanced.  What <Col N="1623" /> miracle, under Heaven, can the Coalition claim for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Cattle to some extent.  Cattle were responsible for the major portion of it but will some person tell me if we could have a livestock industry without a dairying industry? Was it not Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, who was trying to get the farmers out of milk production? If the farmers had got out of milk production would someone tell me by what sort of miracle we could hope to increase the livestock population?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the advice to keep seven cows instead of five, 14 instead of ten and 20 instead of 17?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are the cattle to-day.  How is it they were not forthcoming in 1956?  We were not exporting butter in 1956; it is a substantial item in our exports to-day.  People will tell us that we are exporting the butter at a lower price than we are paying the farmers to produce it but where there are cows there is milk and other by-products.  We cannot have a healthy livestock industry unless we dispose of its by-products.  These by-products are helping to the extent to which we get anything for them.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Dillon wants to mime, as he is doing, there is an opening for him in the Olympia Theatre.  I think there is a harlequin or a clown there and that he would fill the part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only paying due attention to what the Minister is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>However we may have to dispose of these by-products, to the extent that we can sell them abroad for as much as we can get for them, it helps to secure a balance of payments.  If Deputy Dillon's policy, when he tried to drive the farmers away from the cows over the period, 1948 to 1951 and again over the period 1954 until he was kicked out this year, had succeeded how could we have a surplus of butter or of anything else <Col N="1624" /> to export?  Deputy Dillon wanted to drive the farmers out of butter and milk production and into beef.  If he had done that he would have been as successful in relation to the dairying industry and the livestock industry as he was in relation to the egg and poultry industry which he encouraged the farmers to get into on the basis that he proposed to drown the British in eggs.</P>
      <P>The only thing he succeeded in doing then was in bankrupting many of the unfortunate farmers who took his advice.  That slogan of drowning the British in eggs was a political slogan and if Deputy Dillon had had any foresight whatever and knew what was happening in Britain he would have known that the day would come when, not merely would the British be self-sufficient in egg production, but they would be exporting eggs to the continent to the detriment of all who believed there was a secure market for their eggs in Britain.</P>
      <P>I got up to show that the speech, the irrational speech, which we listened to from Deputy Dillon had one purpose in mind and that was to divert the attention of the people from the seriousness of the situation and to induce them to forget that it is a situation which is the direct offspring and traceable directly to the policies which were initiated in this country by the first Coalition and reverted to by the second.  They succeeded, in their two periods of office, in sinking this country into an economic morass.</P>
      <P>It is easy to get the country into a mess but it is very difficult to get it out of it.  It is easy to bring the country to the verge of bankruptcy and difficult to restore its economy.  It is easy to waste the resources of the country and difficult to build them up again.  They can only be built up by a policy of self-denial and a farsighted policy of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not been able, in the few months we have been in office, to undo or remedy the ills of the Coalition Government but we are making progress and the figures I have quoted show that we are making progress.  The fact that we are now on the knife edge in regard to the balance of payments <Col N="1625" /> instead of in deficit, shows that we are making progress.  It is indicated by the fact that the people have more faith in this Government than in its predecessors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just issued a loan.  It is the substantial, thrifty people in a country who sustain a Government.  You may have fluctuations in different places for personal reasons, such as were active in a recent by-election, but the indication of the people's support is that they are prepared to invest their savings with us. Contrast the result of the recent loan with that floated by Dr. Ryan's predecessor. The difference in interest was infinitesimal.  It worked out at about 2/- per cent. but one loan was oversubscribed and the other one was very definitely under-subscribed because the people had no confidence in the policy of the Coalition.</P>
      <P>It is easy to get a country into difficulties. It is very hard to extricate it from them.  That is proved by what happened over the period 1951 to 1954. We had a tough job then but we were bringing the country back.  Then it was plunged back again by the retrograde policies of the second Coalition. We have taken over in exactly the same circumstances as we took over in 1951.  Already, within six months, the benefit of the change is being manifested in every sphere of industrial and productive activity and in the new hope which is arising in the breasts of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with patience for the last half hour to the Minister for Health on this very important question.  I was disappointed that we had no statement from the Government regarding their policy to implement some of the things they promised the people.  The Minister made the excuse that because some of the farmers over £30 valuation had come on the unemployment register, that accounted for the larger number of unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to remind the two other <Col N="1626" /> Deputies in my constituency of the speeches they made when they were elected, in which they said that one of their first tasks would be to help the Taoiseach to cure the unemployment problem, provide more houses for the people and bring back to live in comfort on their own land some of the men who had been forced to emigrate. What are the facts?  In one of the large industrial towns in the county two large factories are being closed up and in one of the principal factories 100 men less are employed to-day. Twenty or 30 families have emigrated. In the rural area a flour-mill, which gave employment to 40 or 50, has closed down.  In one area in Bray a factory is on short time.</P>
    <P>There is a problem facing the Government in the rural areas which we have never experienced before.  Several farmers of 1,200 or 1,300 acres have set their land to large farmers on the 11-months' system and have dismissed their employees, with the exception of one man and a dog to act as caretakers. These farmers received £22 per acre.  There should be some arrangement whereby these men who received £2,000 or £3,000 for the setting of their land should have to contribute to the State for dispossessing men of employment.  Some of these landowners are not solely dependent on agriculture and have other business sidelines.  They are receiving large sums for the setting of their land but they do not pay one penny income-tax on it.  If a tradesman gets £400 or £500, he has to pay income-tax.</P>
    <P>The industrial worker is protected by the trade unions.  He is getting 10/- as compensation for the removal of the food subsidies.  But the worker in the rural areas, the forestry worker and the county council worker, has had no increase in his wages and he still has to pay a higher price for food.  The men in the rural areas and the old age pensioners have to pay 4/4 per lb. for butter, while we are giving the British and other foreign people £1,250,000 to eat our butter at 3/4 per lb.  I am surprised that we have had no statement of policy from the Government.  Will we have increased grants to provide work in the rural areas and will the <Col N="1627" /> Local Authorities (Works) Act be put into operation to give employment there?</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the question of housing.  Dublin Deputies were very vocal last year leading deputations and protesting about tradesmen having to emigrate to England to find work. They are very silent a present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>You had your members proposing resolutions of condemnation because you were not getting all the money you wanted for houses you were not in a position to erect.  Now you have ceased building in Dublin and building has also ceased in my own area except for a few houses to be erected in Avoca.  There is no work there except for a few repairs.  Deputy Briscoe's colleagues can verify that. It is not a situation you can take pride or delight from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health spoke for half an hour about what happened from 1948 onwards but he expressed no hope about our prospects in 1958.  As Deputy Briscoe well knows, we will be faced with a problem in January and February.  How will we meet that problem?  When a public body makes representation to a Department, the Department will not say they have not <Col N="1628" /> the money but they will either delay through some excuse or other or they will refuse the grant.  If Deputy Briscoe can assure me that he is in a position to provide the tradesmen and building labourers in Dublin with employment in the erection of houses, we will all be delighted.</P>
    <P>In my constituency factories have been closed, others are on short time and one principal factory, as I said, has 100 men less&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>That happened notwithstanding the promises made that you were going to provide employment for all our people.  They were told by Ministers to work harder.  In my constituency the men are prepared to work but the trouble is there is no work for them.  In certain areas there is wholesale emigration.  Sporting organisations find they are losing some of their principal men each week.  It is not because they have a wanderlust but simply because there is no work in the constituency.</P>
      <P>You may have other positions in the city to meet such a situation but in a rural area where you have land set on an 11 months' system and where the men working machines will not take on a single extra man, it is a problem.  It is a problem which, whatever Government is in power will have to face.  We do not hear now the speeches or the great statements that were made some months ago during the election.  One of my colleagues said then that the immediate problem was unemployment, housing and giving the people a proper place to live in.  We warned them about the Budget and that by the removal of the food subsidies that this would take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance argued with me because I warned him that the duty of trade unions would be to protect their own members.  I was also worried about the middle-classes who have no organisations to protect them.  The men in the rural areas, the forestry workers for example, have not received one penny increase to meet the situation.  In the cities and <Col N="1629" /> in the industrial areas, workers can meet the situation but in the rural areas they are faced with the problem of having no organisation and these men have not got an increase.  I say that the Government has not given any hope to the people and the position, as I pointed out, is that probably by January or February the problem of unemployment will be worse.  The Government is not making any provision at this period to meet that situation. The White Paper that the Tánaiste issued was only for discussion, to deceive the people like all the other posters which were put out during the election.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Vote for Fianna Fáil and provide employment for the people,&rdquo; they were told.  They voted for them and we already have more unemployment. We have not had as much unemployment in County Wicklow for a long time.  The Deputies are probably doing their best but they are members of the Party who made promises to the people.  The promises were like many promises made&mdash;never meant to be fulfilled.</P>

      <P>I shall not delay the House too long but I think on this annual review of the political events in the country one should avail oneself of the opportunity to say sincerely and candidly what one thinks the position is.  In reviewing the past political year, on which the curtain is now descending, we would of necessity cover the activities of two Governments.  The present Government is in power only for some eight months and I do not now, nor did I at any time, believe that any Government could work miracles in that short period.  I am concerned, and will be concerned, with trends in political events and indications as to how our economy is moving in a particular direction.  I am prepared to be satisfied or otherwise by those indications.  We spoke on the debate here last year.  No member of the House can deny that the outlook then was anything but good.  The people never faced a Christmas with such a serious and gloomy outlook as on that occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if anybody was prepared to point to any signs on the economic horizon to give them hope it would have been like a shot in the arm to the economy of that time. But such hope was completely lacking. Fianna Fáil took over the reins of Government in March and they faced three immediate problems, in addition to some of the long-standing problems which we are still facing.  They faced a budget deficit for which money had to be found and some unpleasant things had to be done in the process of finding it.  They faced a serious deficit and in the balance of payments, an adverse balance, and worse than that, and possibly arising from these two problems they faced a pall of gloom which had descended on the entire country and on the outlook of the people.</P>
      <P>Those were the three immediate problems which the new Government had to face when they resumed office in March, just about eight months ago. I am prepared to judge their record by how they tackled those problems since. As I said money had to be found to make up the deficit in the Budget.  It was found in probably the only reasonable and practical way in which it could be found if we were not to go to people already harassed and who had lost their confidence in giving money to the Government.  The balance of payments problem was tackled and brought to the stage where we now can no longer regard it as being a problem. As the Minister for Health pointed out, the position may still be regarded as precarious but certainly as satisfactory. From the manner in which these two problems were dealt with, the third immediate problem, that of the gloom and despair which had descended on our people, was automatically lifted. I would say it was lifted from the day the people first discovered that they had returned to power a strong Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition may talk about promises made, posters displayed and so forth, but if the people had voted for one thing more than another in the last election, they voted for a strong Government with an over-all majority, that would not be trimming its sails every day to meet political expediency <Col N="1631" /> and that would not be in a position to put through any stern policy or programme that would ultimately result in the uplifting of the economy of the country.  Those people did not expect that they were returning a Government with a Pandora's box or an Aladdin's lamp.  They knew they had appointed a Government that had to find money and when you have to find money you do not create it out of nothing.  The people are well aware of that.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government has restored confidence in this country augurs well for the future.  It was the first essential towards progress in any direction and nobody can gainsay the fact that the people in every walk of life, particularly business people, have come to realise that the future of this country is in capable and better hands. The component parts of the previous Government may have been well intentioned separately and they may have meant well, but when they got working and when each section tried to appease the other it was like the splitting of the atom.  The fall-out of radio activity had a serious effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to look at the things which really matter in this country.  Agriculture is our No. 1 industry.  That is undisputed. We must do everything possible to ensure that those engaged in agriculture get a proper chance to produce more with greater efficiency so that the extra production will be marketed profitably and under the best conditions.  We are taking all possible steps to improve the technical knowledge of those engaged in that industry. We are placing at the disposal of our farmers every possible assistance and encouragement to enable them to expand the economy of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But remember those who say we should concentrate on agriculture alone are not conscious of what the position actually is.  We must look to other industries as well even though they <Col N="1632" /> may take only second, third or fourth place to agriculture.  Every Deputy is aware of the figures over the past number of years showing a continuous downward trend in the number of people employed in agriculture.  That is due to two things&mdash;increased mechanisation on farms and the social problem which is facing the people.  In those days people living in congested areas are not satisfied to live in the circumstances in which their forefathers lived and raised families.</P>
    <P>This social problem is responsible for a considerable decline in the numbers engaged in agriculture.  We must face that fact.  We have given rural communities the best possible facilities and amenities such as grants for better houses, more money to lay down and maintain better roads into the townlands in which they live, better water and sewerage facilities, rural electrification schemes and so on.  All these have tended towards raising the standard of living of those people.  Still many of them are not prepared to remain at home on uneconomic holdings. There are many other things which could be done for those people, such as the provision of specialised branches of agriculture on uneconomic holdings like pig raising.</P>
    <P>While agriculture should get the best possible attention, and should get more attention as time goes on, we must not forget our subsidiary industries. After agriculture we have tourism. Tourism is getting every possible encouragement that we can give it.  I am satisfied that our future in this matter is very bright indeed.  In that respect we have many things for which no Government is responsible.  Providence has been good to us in this regard. However, there are many things yet to be done to attract an increasing flow of tourists.  I think this Government has proved itself to be wide awake in this matter.  After tourism we have afforestation which is being pressed forward with all possible speed.  We have bog development in which Fianna Fáil have proved their interest.</P>

      <P>We have the development of our fisheries.  I do not usually indulge in interrupting speakers, but I was compelled to interrupt Deputy Dillon this evening when he devoted some of his speech to the passing of rather unworthy remarks on our Minister for Lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased and satisfied that the fishing industry in this country has embarked on a new era.  Foresight and impetus have been put into it now which were never before devoted to it by any previous Government.  I believe that in this respect a great deal of hope for the future of the western seaboard is based.  We can look forward now to continuous expansion in that industry, but we have still much ground to make up.  After all, the aim and outlook of every Deputy, particularly of every member of the Government, must be to give a better standard of living to an increasing population.  If I were Taoiseach in the morning I could concentrate on agriculture alone and solve all our difficulties by giving a lovely standard of living to a very small population.  However, we must not only try to cater for our present declining population but we must also endeavour to arrest this decline so that future Governments will be catering for an increasing population.</P>
      <P>We must concentrate on the other branches of industry besides agriculture&mdash;afforestation, bog development, fisheries and the manufacturing industries. Deputy Everett spoke about industry in Wicklow.  Wicklow is not so much the concern of Donegal, but I would advise Deputy Everett to read the statement of the Chairman of the Arklow Potteries Board of Directors a few days ago.  I should think the chairman of that board would know more about industry in the town than the Deputy.  I feel equally sure that he was not trying to give any uplift to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must try to encourage our subsidiary industries, particularly those allied to agriculture, so as to take care of any surplus population on the land. As I said earlier, employment on the land over a number of years shows a <Col N="1634" /> continuous decline.  In 1944, there were 526,147 people, male employees, on the land, all over 14 years of age.  In 1955 that figure had dropped to 418,000 showing a continuous downward trend each year except for the year 1953-54 which showed a slight increase, according to the Abstract of Statistics.</P>
    <P>What was the position in industry in those years?  An extra 98,000 people found employment in industry since 1932.  Is it not worth concentrating on? Yet, I remember Deputy Dillon accusing Fianna Fáil of concentrating too much on the manufacturing arm in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>How many extra since 1948?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;when he pointed out, trying to be as cynical as possible, that Fianna Fáil would create a factory for putting Aspros on a string. I do not care what the factory is doing so long as it gives employment to some people who would otherwise have to go abroad.</P>
      <P>I believe the outlook for the establishment of industries here is good.  We might be unduly optimistic if we were to consider the possible outcome of the European Free Trade Movement.  Our position could be very good.  I believe it will help us, and I think the manufacturers who are already in production are now sufficiently efficient to withstand any test.  I believe we can have various other commodities produced here in addition to those at present manufactured with the possible expansion of our export market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe Deputy Dillon's speech should really worry anyone on this side of the House.  He did not really point out that the trends for the future were not good.  Most of his speech was in castigation of the Minister for Lands because of something he is supposed to have said about capital development.  I think that was a pretence, and the Deputy then proceeded to take credit for all the capital development that has taken place in the country since 1932 when, in my opinion, progress really began.  Those are very recent events and nobody will be deceived about them.  If any Government did any useful work let us say here: &ldquo;Good luck to them; more <Col N="1635" /> power to them&rdquo;.  Let us continue in that direction and let us not give the people the impression that we are here for the express purpose of contradicting each other, depending on which side of the House we sit.</P>
    <P>I think anyone who succeeds in getting into this House has something to recommend him because it is not too easy and we should use that &ldquo;something&rdquo; to best advantage.  I do not believe anybody here, can with reason represent to the public now that in the eight months during which we have been in power we should have completely transformed the situation which we found in existence.  I do not think the members on the other side of the House can be serious when they take up that line.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Dillon trying to trip the Minister for Health on the figures for unemployment.  When he gave the figures for last week, which showed a reduction for some 4,000 or 5,000 on the corresponding figures for the previous year, Deputy Dillon said: &ldquo;Tell us the figure for the week before that.&rdquo;  That figure was lower, but it also went up last year during this period, and what is the good of taking up little points like that, trying to hoodwink the people by pretending something has happened which has not happened.</P>
    <P>Unemployment figures always go up at this time of the year because the employment period has ceased and new claimants come on the register.  Every smallholder in Donegal registers as unemployed and qualifies for the dole, which he draws weekly.  He has a few cows or sheep, and a bit of land, as a supplement to his income.  He is available for employment, if it is there, and is prepared to take it.  The trend in the past few weeks is for unemployment figures to increase, and it was the same in previous years, but what the Minister for Health effectively pointed out is that the trend is not quite so great this year.  Let us take some encouragement from that even though we are not happy about the position.  We would like to see it 20 times better.  Nevertheless, I believe the outlook is good.</P>
    <P>Speaking in previous years on this debate I said I was not prepared to judge the Government on what was <Col N="1636" /> actually the position at the time, but that I was prepared to judge them on what the political, or rather the economic, barometer indicated for the future. I believe, in every aspect of our economy, consequent on the immense improvements in our financial position, confidence has been restored and we are moving forward towards greatly increased activity in every sphere of our economy.  What is more important is that we have completely dispelled the idea that the Government can do everything for everybody.  I think we have succeeded in getting the people to see that they must make an effort to put things right themselves.</P>
    <P>I feel elections took place too frequently in which we had one Party going out to outbid another as to what they expected to do in regard to social welfare benefits and other things.  This created the idea that the Government was prepared to do everything for everybody.  I think that has been changed and that many people realise the time has come when the Government can only point the way, leaving the people to do the rest themselves.</P>
    <P>I remember a few lines of a poem in the old school books which said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Land of our birth!  We pledge to thee</P>
    <P>Our love and toil in the years to be;</P>
    <P>That we may bring from age to age An undivided heritage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the spirit we want to foster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker said that the future of the country is in safe hands.  Now, I shall have to repeat what I said earlier to-day in another discussion.  When I left Leinster House last July for the Recess I came to the conclusion that, when I returned here in the autumn, this place would be a hive of industry and there would be schemes and proposals by Ministers, mainly by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I thought we would be very busy and I thought we would have something to be very busy about.  I am referring to the Minister for Industry and Commerce's £100,000,000&mdash;mark all the noughts; I am afraid they are nothing but noughts &mdash; and the 100,000 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have said here that one <Col N="1637" /> could not expect the Government just to blot out unemployment overnight, and the last speaker said that they would not hoodwink the people.  I know he is a fair man and I suppose he believes what he says.  What about this: &ldquo;All energies devoted to one aim, full employment.  Unemployment can be cured.&rdquo;  This is the famous opus published by Fianna Fáil.  What have they been doing?  We hear nothing now about the £100,000,000 and, of course, if the 100,000 jobs could be provided there would be no unemployment problem and I would not be standing here now speaking in this debate.</P>
    <P>On 23rd October Deputy Desmond asked a question about the unemployment position, and I made a comment at the time, a comment which was not published.  Deputy Desmond asked the Taoiseach if he would &ldquo;indicate what immediate steps the Government had decided upon to meet the serious unemployment position.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Donnchadh Ó Briain, replying for the Taoiseach, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...These incentives are:</P>
    <P>(1)  the raising from 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. of the relief for profits derived from increases in exports;</P>
    <P>(2)  an alternative concession in the form of a relief of 25 per cent. of tax on profits attributable to total exports of manufactured goods;</P>
    <P>(3)  a 25 per cent. increase in the wear and tear allowance on plant and machinery (other than vehicles);</P>
    <P>(4)  the extension to all securities issued to the public by Irish manufacturing concerns since 1932 of the income-tax remission granted under Section 7 of the Finance Act of that year;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I interjected there: &ldquo;And Uncle Tom Cobley and all&rdquo;, because this was just words, words, words.  The question was: What steps had the Government taken to meet the immediate serious unemployment position?</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Health was speaking to-day he told us that we should take our medicine.  Whoever first coined that phrase was inspired, because it was a medicine man's job that was being enacted over there&mdash;<Col N="1638" /> cheap mumbo-jumbo.  The Minister for Health came in here and had a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at Deputy McGilligan, former Minister for Finance; he said he was put into cold storage.  Where was Deputy MacEntee put when he was taken out of the Department of Finance?  Where was this wonderful financial expert who tells us about the finances of the country? Why did the Taoiseach not make him Minister for Finance?</P>
    <P>Let us take now what happened since this Government came into office.  In my opinion since the Government came into office, and particularly since the recess last July, they have gone into coma.  Occasionally some members wake out of the coma to attend some dinners and say, each of them in turn: &ldquo;What a good boy am I.&rdquo;  The main actor in this &ldquo;What-a-good-boy-am-I&rdquo; rôle is the present Minister for Finance. He is reported as having attended some dinner given by some bankers in some hostelry, where he told these nice gentlemen that things are good, a good deal of money is coming in now with the Prize Bonds, and ends with his little Jack Horner: &ldquo;What a good boy am I.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The next item was the balance of payments&mdash;&ldquo;What a good boy am I.&rdquo; What, in the name of Heaven, has the Minister for Finance done about any of these things since he took over office?  The latest brag by the Minister for health is the success of the last loan&mdash;£10,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in the House when that loan was introduced.  The Minister spoke about the good value of the loan and the good offer he was making.  When he sat down the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, got up and advised the people to put their money into the loan.  The Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Norton, rose and advised the people to support the loan with everything they had.  That was a great change from what happened when Deputy Costello's Government was in office and a loan was floated.  We had Deputy MacEntee's famous &ldquo;Kiss of Death to the Irish Parliament&rdquo; speech.  We had the then Deputy Aiken saying that nobody <Col N="1639" /> would put a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; into it.  I could see him putting the emphasis on the &ldquo;bob&rdquo;.  That was the loyal way these gentlemen helped us along when they were in opposition.</P>
      <P>Another question was asked about unemployment and we were told, again by the Parliamentary Secretary, that there were long-term proposals for unemployment. There were no long-term proposals when Fianna Fáil were telling the housewives to put their husbands to work&mdash;&ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil!&rdquo; The husbands were all going to work the following Monday.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health said that he was speaking to-day as a responsible Minister and for a responsible Party. Deputy J. Brennan referred to a debate which took place here when Fianna Fáil were on this side of the House and we were over there.  But Deputy Brennan subsequently ducked away from that and jumped to last March, and I would like now to remind the House of what happened. The entire Opposition was lined up behind Fianna Fáil.  It was the most scandalous performance I have ever experienced.  It is reported in the Official Report.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, would utter a few words and he would be interrupted immediately by three or four Opposition Deputies.  That is the atmosphere that existed in this House this time last year.  I came into the House this evening and even though the Minister for Health is usually on the bone he was let go.  They were drawing us and trying to trick us into doing what they were doing last year.</P>

      <P>The bullock that nobody wanted saved this country. They go around now to dinners and make speeches about increased production. They say that all we want is increased production but I asked the Minister for Agriculture to-day if he wanted increased production in butter and I got one of those Fianna Fáil crosswords of replies when I was told that his Department would be in favour of an economic production of butter. Deputy Dillon was being taunted by the Minister for Health who says that everything Deputy Dillon did was wrong and that Deputy Dillon was not responsible for the production of anything. The one thing about it is that the farmers did put in their crops last year and that they did have a good harvest and that there was a good cattle trade.  If we were able to avail ourselves of the good price for cattle it was because we had the cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great many people are going about the country telling us about the Free Trade Area.  We are a very innocent people down in Waterford and we would like to be told what it is all about.  It is a very nice thing for a Minister to go to Paris, come back and say that agriculture is going into the Free Trade Area but how would we find ourselves in the British market without the present of £20 per head which we get for store cattle?  How would we find ourselves with butter, even if we have to subsidise it, if Denmark, Holland and these other countries got in on the same terms as we have?  I think that people in this country forget that we have a substantial preference in the British market in return for preferences which <Col N="1641" /> they have here.  What this House should discuss and weigh up is the fact that if we allow other industrialists in we will not be able to give the British the preferences we have been giving them up to the present.  We should ask ourselves if this will interfere with us on the British market.  I put that question fairly to thinking Government Deputies.</P>
    <P>We have seen what happened recently with regard to ministerial changes.  We must ask ourselves, and we must answer the questions of our constituents who want to know, what is actually happening and why it is that, from the 78 members of Fianna Fáil, it was not possible to bring in a new Minister for Agriculture.  That question is being asked and the Taoiseach is the only person who can answer it.  Perhaps he is a better judge of his men than I am.  It is as well to let Fianna Fáil know that people are asking that question.  Their own supporters are asking it.</P>
    <P>On the question of fisheries, Deputy Brennan got up and extolled the Minister as if he had directed the shoals to our nets and all the rest of it. I think that kind of thing is wrong.  I know that the present Minister is very keen on his job and that he has gone out of his way to investigate the working of his Department and to do a good job to the best of his ability.  However, I would suggest to him that the policy of his Department as carried out for many years in concentrating all their handouts and all their boats on the western seaboard is not a good policy.</P>
    <P>The Government has put up £5,000 for an ice plant at Dunmore East.  It was first announced to be £50,000 but that was said to be a misprint.  We do not consider that £50,000 would be an excessive amount for Dunmore East. Any Deputy who reads the newspapers will see that Dunmore East is in the headlines notwithstanding the fact that it has got less money and fewer boats than any other fishing port in Ireland. They are catching the fish there and catching plenty of it.  There is a good market for it.  That is what I want to point out to the Minister.  There is an excellent market for fish in Dunmore <Col N="1642" /> East with English and foreign buyers. That is what made Dublin cattle market a good market, having all the different classes of buyers competing there.</P>
    <P>In the matter of ships and trade, there has been a policy of Fianna Fáil to build 10,000 tonners.  In answer to a question here, the Minister for Industry and Commerce told me that only the port of Dublin can take a 10,000-tonner fully loaded.  I respectfully submit that it is not to our economic interest to build these monsters.  In the first place, what they call a 10,000 ton parcel is too big for the average Irish merchant.  Even if these ships could be got into the small ports and to the small piers, on which so much money has been spent, there is nobody in these areas who could afford or would need so much cargo.</P>
    <P>My suggestion to the Government is that they build ships of smaller draught, and that they build them from 5,000 tons back.  They should also consider going into the coasting business. We discussed this here when discussing cross-Channel shipping rates. I want to repeat this because it is very important.  We sent 697,000 cattle in nine months, and we should have ships of our own to take some of them.  If the Minister is given the opportunity of meeting British Railways and the people who control shipping in and out of our ports, what he says will have no weight unless he is in a position to say that a company he is sponsoring or that ships he has available are ready to go into the market and carry these cattle.  But the answer to that is that you can only bring the cattle over and land them at the ports.  British Railways have you there.  They can tell you they will not have waggons until next Tuesday, and leave you at the port.</P>
    <P>There is no restriction on these matadors.  Perhaps it would be as well if we could get the lot of them out of the country.  If we had our ships plying between the Irish and English ports and 40 to 50 matadors, we could handle those cargoes of cattle.  Forty matadors at 12 a piece&mdash;that is 480 cattle, and that is a handy load.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Industry <Col N="1643" /> and Commerce have been asked in the House to try to direct factories down the country, and successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce have answered that they have no function in the matter.  I do not think that is right.  The majority of the people promoting industries go to the Government for concessions in the way of tariff protection and for money.</P>
    <P>I admit Dublin is a great city and a great capital and that there is a demand for industry in it.  But when you see 20 industries proposed for Dublin and one down the country, it is something to which attention should be paid.  I shall not be parochial about my constituency, but I am sure nearly everybody down the country can look around his constituency and see fine towns dying.  It is terrible to consider that if ten or 15 industries are being promoted over a certain period, nearly all of them will open in Dublin.  At least one third should be promoted down the country.  The Government have got themselves in with a great majority and by saying &ldquo;Let Us Get Cracking&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Aye, the Blueshirts and the Brownshirts.  You are over there now, a strong Government.  It was a pity to see what happened when we came back here.  Nobody came in from the Government Benches to discuss the Bills.  Nobody cared.  The Bills just ran through here.  The most important Bill to come before the House was hardly debated by any Fianna Fáil back bencher&mdash;the Agricultural Institute Bill.  No legislation was brought before the House, except the carry-over from the last Government. That proves that during the recess the Ministers did nothing despite all the &ldquo;cracking&rdquo; they were supposed to do.</P>
      <P>This morning we had a debate on money for C.I.E., and again I noticed the absence of the backbenchers.  Who cares about that?  I want to repeat that this matter about C.I.E. is very serious.  It is a very serious matter for the economy of this country that people should lightly come along and say they can chop off branch lines here and there, close workshops and tempt men out to take buttons for a pension. I know you can lightly do it over there and do it ruthlessly.  You would take the people's livelihood out of their hands.  I have seen it done in the city I come from, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the man who was to get &ldquo;cracking&rdquo;, came in to-day and asked us for £1,800,000 to keep the railways going. He should have had his permanent proposals here ready before the Dáil to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had the report of the Traffic Commission on his desk since May 27th last and what has he been doing ever since? That is the thing on which you build your Party&mdash;claptrap.  Read your kept-paper and if there is any constructive proposition put up to a Minister it is not printed in it.  That is not government. <Col N="1645" /> I do not know whether I am in order in talking about this matter, but the Chair can direct me if I am out of order.  I remember a time when matters like this would be discussed in the country and we would be told that statements would be made by leading members of the Government.  We discovered, if we went to the meeting to hear this magnificent opus, that it was &ldquo;Ireland free from the sod to the sky&rdquo;, the resurgence of the Gael and the resurrection of the Irish language.  That was the sort of thing that was handed out.  I was half expecting that would be dished out here to-day.</P>
    <P>In the matter of industry Deputy Brennan said that 98,000 people went into industry since 1932.  How many people went into it since 1947?  The greater portion.  How many people left the land since 1932?  This is something worth talking about, something that is far removed from the pavements and asphalt in Dublin.  Deputy Haughey can go down and look at parts of the country for himself.  If Kickham were to come back he could write <i>Knocknagow</i> again and truly say that Knocknagow is gone, for all the people have gone out of it.  I have been speaking here for some time and all I have heard are innuendoes, mumbles and mumbo-jumbo from the trained men at the back who come in here and who have not spoken since the Dáil met or even put down a question.</P>

      <P>They cheated the people with the opus in Belmullet and with the opus in my constituency in Waterford.  They cheated the people through the Waterford statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there would be no unemployment on the railways if Fianna Fáil were returned to power.  In this document I have with me they said they were out for action.  Look at the action we have got for the past three or four weeks.  We came here two <Col N="1648" /> days one week one day another week and we had no meeting at all another week because there was no business. There were no proposals, no 100,000 jobs.  That is the way they have cheated the people.  They are the people who now have the brass to say that they have a long term policy. They have the largest majority ever held by a Government in this House. Anything they want to do they can do it.  Let them do it.  Let them get cracking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House should have on an occasion like this a statement of Government policy.  One Minister has already given his contribution. I sat here during his speech hoping I would hear some indication of what Government policy for the coming year was to be like, but so far no such indication has been given.  The House has been treated with contempt and the people of the country with disrespect by the Government in this matter.  I think it is not good enough, in view of the fact that we have three kindred major problems at the present time&mdash;emigration, unemployment and the high cost of living.</P>
      <P>The high cost of living has been brought about largely by the removal of the food subsidies.  Deputy Brennan attempted to excuse the Government for removing the food subsidies on butter and bread by giving the stock argument that it became necessary to do this because of some action of the inter-Party Government.  I suppose other speakers from the Government side will maintain the same thing.  I want to ask those who think in that way what Government produced that situation in 1947 when, out of the blue, it was decided to increase the taxes on drink and tobacco.  Was there an inter-Party Government or Coalition Government prior to that time to produce such a background?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, when the inter-Party Government went out of office in 1951 we left the Minister for Finance with £24,500,000 of Marshall Aid money unspent. Despite that, they came along and cut the food subsidies in 1952 when they produced their disastrous Budget of that year.  We left the country in <Col N="1649" /> first-class shape again this time and again the subsidies on bread and butter were completely removed despite the fact that we left them £5,000,000 in the Prize Bond Fund which was not available to us.  Despite this they raised a further blister on the backs of the poor people.  They captured £8,500,000 from these poor people by the withdrawal of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe interrupted a few moments ago to say there is plenty of money now.  Of course they have plenty of money now.  We left them the Prize Bond Fund and the removal of the subsidies plus the £10,000,000 Loan brought the kitty up to £25,000,000. Despite that it is impossible for a person anxious to build his own house to get a grant either from the Government or from a county council.  Housing is completely finished.  Perhaps Deputy Briscoe could tell us why housing has been knocked on the head by the people who in all probability have fairly good houses themselves and who do not know what it is to live under the roof of an old shack, 150 years old. These people say to the poor occupants of such shacks: &ldquo;Continue on living in that shack because you will not get your grant to build a new one.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same is true of the land project which Deputy Dillon initiated when he was Minister for Agriculture.  Every possible obstacle has been put in the way of those who want their land reclaimed.  The land reclamation scheme was considered by every sensible person in this country to be the best scheme of its kind ever introduced. It was a tremendous boon to many farmers who are paying rent and rates for useless portions of their holdings.  Through this scheme it was possible for them to bring some extra acres into production.  Now the reply most applicants get is that their land is too shallow, too wet, too deep or too rocky.</P>
    <P>Would somebody on the Government side tell me why that scheme has been deliberately sabotaged?  It has been sabotaged in Mayo.  If the same does not apply elsewhere I shall be very glad to hear it.  If the Minister for Agriculture were here I should like to ask him what it is proposed <Col N="1650" /> to do in regard to the report of the Milk Costings Commission.  We heard a great deal of talk about it during the past three years when we were in office.  There is not a word about it now.  Have Deputies on the other side ceased to be so vociferous because there is some truth in the rumour that they intend to reduce the price of milk?  It is high time something was done about this report.  It is high time something was done about it.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Ó Briain, was wailing and shedding tears at least twice a week in this House during the period of the last inter-Party Government because the Milk Costings Report was not finished, as though the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, could walk up to the chairman of the commission, put a gun to his head and demand the report whether finished or not.</P>

I am glad that it is one activity, at least, that has escaped the axe since Fianna Fáil came back because I do not know of any other branch of Government activity that has not suffered despite the fact that Fianna Fáil lured the people into supporting them through the Tánaiste's £100,000,000 plan, and the promises from the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that the food subsidies would not be removed.</P>

      <P>I admit that, and that is why I do not blame the people so much for believing what they were told by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  I did not think they would have the colossal &ldquo;neck&rdquo; to do it particularly after the promises made by the Leader and Deputy-Leader of the Party that they would not remove the food subsidies.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Government why the import levies which we imposed on certain luxury goods were removed. We imposed such levies in order to bring the balance of payments into some kind of equilibrium.  We succeeded in that and I remember the Tánaiste speaking on this side of the House when these levies were imposed and saying that the only fault he had to find with them was that they were not severe enough.  I want to know why these levies were removed because it hits the people down the country though that might not appear to be so.</P>
      <P>The motor car manufacturers certainly seem to have a deadly grasp on the present Government and it would take a great deal of talk from the other side of the House to convince me of the contrary.  It appears that any string they pull, the Government, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce particularly, must dance to their music.  That is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>We had a Minister boasting to-day that the last loan was over-subscribed, but if we had floated a loan at an exorbitant rate of interest we would have had the same result.  We did not believe in asking the ordinary working man to pay 6 per cent. interest on a loan, because it is the small man in Deputy Davern's constituency and mine who must pay that interest.  The wonder is that the Government did not make it 10 per cent.  I should like to know who fixed or dictated the interest rate on this loan?</P>

      <P>My first reaction on hearing the last speaker is to say that anything which we could do quickly in this country to increase employment would largely be fugitive in character because the big problem is a long term problem requiring organisation, thought, study and careful action.  It would be easy enough to spend a few million pounds on giving employment temporarily to people, but that would be a useless expenditure if the net result was that we were unable to find further moneys to go on keeping those people employed.  That is the truth.  We will not solve the problems of the country by quick, rapid fire legislation.  The problems are deeper than that.  The problems may require legislation and organisation in many forms, Government action, Government assistance and Government capital guarantees. But, whatever else they may require, they are not the kind of problems which can be solved simply by shoving into the Dáil a mass of legislation within five months of our coming into office.  I think everybody appreciates that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter I should like to deal with before coming to the major comments I have to make is that, regardless of how Deputies in opposition may interpret individual statements made by members of this Party during the general election, that election was fought on the whole in a spirit of grim realism.  All we said was that we were going to do our best to get some <Col N="1655" /> of the wheels moving as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>A good deal has been said of what is now described as the £100,000,000 plan of Fianna Fáil.  It is as well to give the facts about the £100,000,000 plan.  We decided we would publish an elaborate statement dealing with all the financial and economic problems as we found them.  We made it absolutely clear in the preface to the first statement we published that these were ideas for consideration and did not constitute an official political policy.  We encouraged everybody to comment on them. We made it perfectly clear in the substance of the plan, as published, that it simply gave a blue print to the sort of things that might be done in order to achieve full employment.</P>

      <P>That plan was reprinted and in the second version we said we had to take account of the fact that there had been a serious disimprovement in the financial state of the country.  We made it absolutely <Col N="1656" /> clear that the raising of capital depended on capital being available and savings being available and we again repeated, beyond all doubt, that these were plans for study and consideration. Many of them could be quickly accepted as good ideas.  Others would require study in the light of conditions as we found them if we should be asked to form a Government. That was a very definite statement made in the publication of that plan and it is useless for Deputies on the other side to wave it around and call it the official programme of political action at the time of the election, because it was not.</P>

      <P>I would like to state again that in our official policy we said we would do as much as possible to get going; we said we had faith we could do the job in the end; that we could expand production and could find capital provided there was a stable Government and a stable financial policy, and provided everyone understood where we were going and how we were going.  I do not think anybody could deny that the general election was fought in that atmosphere.  We realised, and we made it clear, that our difficulties would be great.  We made it clear that our problems would be many.  Nobody yet on the opposite side has repeated the statement made by the former Minister for Finance that the savings of two world wars, totalling nearly £200,000,000, had largely been spent; therein lay the problem facing the Government in 1956 and in 1957.  That is the key to our present difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, that changed the situation.  All these savings were accumulated.  They were spent, and the adjustment has been painful.  On an average, over a period of ten years there was £20,000,000 extra circulating every year&mdash;a form of purchasing power that came from savings and not from current production. This was equivalent to an expenditure of about £37 per year in every household for a period of ten years.  Naturally this expenditure made a great difference to our economy, made a great difference to the appearance of things, gave people the idea that there was a kind of artificial prosperity and standards could be very quickly earned of an artificial character; that money was flowing freely in a permanent way and that money was available for this kind of scheme and that kind of scheme and for this kind of public service and that kind of public service; that the flow of money would continue and that nothing, apparently, was going to end it.</P>
      <P>The position is that we have now exhausted these reserves and they have to be built up again.  I might add that during that period everything possible was done by many members of the two Coalition Governments to confuse the mind of the public over these savings. The people went through periods of several years listening to Ministers of the Coalition Government criticising the Fianna Fáil Administration for checking the spending of savings.  But, if we had not checked the spending of these savings in 1952, the result would have been more serious than it was, in fact, in 1955.  We had no reserves to deal with a temporary trade recession. We were one of the very few countries with savings when the war ended. Most countries lost their savings during the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were very few in our lucky position and we should have dealt with our savings more carefully and used them for productive purposes and not for the purpose of giving the people the impression that they could enjoy a standard of living based on a rise in agricultural prices which simply could not continue indefinitely.  Everybody <Col N="1658" /> was given the impression that the Government somehow could induce employment on a permanent scale, using savings.  A false impression was given to the people as to what the capacities of the nation were in regard to maintaining the standard of living. A great deal of that was the result of the influence of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I remember lectures and lectures and lectures for months and months and months on the price of cigarettes and on the cost of living.  I remember discussions on the value of spending our savings as quickly as possible.  It did not matter how they were spent or on what they were spent.  I remember hearing people accusing the Fianna Fáil Government of being a hair-shirt Government, not wanting the people to enjoy themselves and, at the end, there came the real and genuine hair-shirt Government in 1956 when there were insufficient savings to enable us to get through what was not a major trade depression but simply a situation in which our exports temporarily decreased in relation to our imports.  We should, as a creditor nation, have had a full volume of savings available at that time to cushion us over that difficult period.  All that we can say in Fianna Fáil is that the facts are clearly there and that we were not responsible for the disruption of those activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister mind answering one question?  The major part of those savings was spent on housing.  Does the Minister think that is a good or bad thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the Deputy that they were spent on housing.  I think a great deal of that money was spent on importing consumer goods instead of capital goods. I understand that Deputy Dillon, in the course of his speech, referred to my deprecation of the spending of capital.  Deputy Dillon always likes to twist and turn statements made by other people.  I said that we had spent £228,000,000 of State capital from 1947 to 1956 and of that some £2,000,000 was spent on promoting industry and £26,000,000 on promoting agriculture, and that the remainder had not been spent directly for the promotion of useful <Col N="1659" /> production.  I said that it would be better if we had spent more of our savings in developing production, in solving unemployment; in preparing to face foreign competition; in preparing markets for our produce; in preparing new types of agricultural exports and in preparing to export more.  If we had spent money on those projects in the earlier years we would now be able to spend all the money we need on housing.</P>
      <P>It is the question of the direction of capital spending that is important.  I never advocated that we should not spend State capital for useful projects. All the useful projects that we have in this country at the moment were initiated by the present Government. In those years we should have been arguing about how we were going to develop our exports and instead of arguing here and listening to lectures from 1947 to 1951 on the cost of living we should have been arguing about the work of establishing the export economy of this country on a firm and expanding basis.</P>
      <P>We are now living in a different world.  We require to build up our savings sufficiently so that if there should be another trade recession, when our imports and our exports show adverse trends, we will have enough to get us over the crisis without having to impose levies or without involving ourselves in measures which would lead to unemployment. At the moment capital is difficult to get because the savings of our people have been depleted and the money has to be saved over again.  That has been said as much by the former Minister for Finance as by the present Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find it impossible to end emigration or to bring about an increase in employment when the finances available to the Government are not of the magnitude that they require.  One of the most important problems facing us in the future is to establish the right atmosphere in which money will be available for economic productivity. We have got to rely on private enterprise to improve our trade.  The Government cannot export goods or agricultural <Col N="1660" /> produce.  It is essential that the people recognise that we have a stable Government and a stable policy that is likely to last.</P>
    <P>The people in this country who are ambitious and who are going to help to develop our economy must be persuaded that we do accept certain vital facts in regard to our economic position and one of these is that our costs must be kept down.  If people are going to invest money, they have got to be convinced that they are investing in a stable economy and that their investments will be given a chance to earn profits.</P>
    <P>We must cheerfully face certain disadvantages. There is the disadvantage of the small home market; the disadvantage of being more remote from the main stream of European commerce, and there are also certain disadvantages with regard to freight rates.  We must overcome disadvantages and still go ahead and increase our exports.  We may be able to do it by producing goods of a better quality; perhaps by selling at lower prices.  This may mean changes in our marketing methods, Government help in stabilising exports and other changes, largely of a technical or marketing character, to bring about a stability in our economy which will encourage people to spend money here in producing more goods.</P>
    <P>People have got to become accustomed to the idea that there must be a certain definite fund of savings available to help in productive schemes.  One of our difficulties is the maintenance of capital saving, and there still is a deficiency of capital for productive purposes. For prosperity it is essential that the ambitious people in this country who are willing to help us to increase productivity get accustomed to the idea that capital will be available if they want it for productive purposes.</P>
    <P>All these matters require very careful study.  In regard to agriculture, we will have to examine the markets available; we will have to investigate the expansion of existing and new markets. We will need to study the whole problem of our export trade and to examine the export of agricultural products which have not yet been developed here.  All of that is of supreme <Col N="1661" /> importance.  We have also to face the coming into being of the Free Trade Area and its impact on this country. None of that can be done overnight.  It cannot be done by introducing Bill after Bill into this House.  It is ludicrous to think that we can bring prosperity by sitting in the Dáil and examining Bills. Prosperity will not come that way. Prosperity will come by the greatest possible personal leadership of Ministers and everybody in the House in persuading people to invest their money and making sure of providing more channels for exports if they are required.</P>
    <P>There are many problems such as, for example, the fact that many of our industrial units are small.  It may be necessary to have some sort of cooperative marketing scheme for certain industries, for any of them which will be able to afford to export, to provide new designs and to provide the commercial salesmen, to enable them to get over the difficulties of freight costs and the other difficulties of trading abroad.  That problem has to be examined.  As I have said, it takes time and it will need four or five years of hard and consistent work before we can solve these problems and help to develop the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>I heard references by some Deputies that we made some promises we would never reduce the subsidies.  We made no such promises.  We would be crazy if we had made a promise that we would never reduce the subsidies in the light of our experience in discovering a Budget deficit in 1951 and that on resuming office we would find ourselves with a second Budget deficit.  It was largely because of the Budget deficit which we faced that we found it necessary to abandon the subsidies.</P>
    <P>No one in this election voted against the members of the Opposition because of any statement made about subsidies.  They voted against the Opposition because they wanted a resolute Government.  We are here now and we have a very tough task before us which we will discharge to the best of our ability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has been in office for nearly nine months <Col N="1662" /> now and if it has succeeded in one way more than another, it has been in the direction of maintaining a complete wall of secrecy as to the policy it intends to pursue.  During the past nine months we have had speeches from Ministers, we have had debates here on the Budget and on important Estimates, but never once during the last nine months have we got from the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers a glimmer of policy as far as Fianna Fáil is concerned.</P>
      <P>It is true that the Minister for Lands travelled the country like a kind of human ready-reckoner, quoting figures in abundance and almost mathematising the country into prosperity by quoting these figures.  I commend the Minister's research proclivities, but when all has been said and done about these figures, we still cannot discover any indications as to the direction of Government policy.  The House will now adjourn for approximately two months.  Between now and 10.30 the Taoiseach might disclose the secret of the Government's policy which so far has been more closely guarded than any Budget secret of many years.</P>
      <P>I thought that this would be the occasion on which we would have an indication from the Tánaiste as to when the £100,000,000 plan would be put into operation.  When Fianna Fáil was in opposition they produced this famous plan.  The £100,000,000 was not to be got by taxation or borrowing.  Some kind of political wizardy would find the £100,000,000 and it would be used for the purpose of financing a kind of economic resurgence in the country. When that resurgence took place, 20,000 new jobs were to be found each year to take up the number of people offering themselves directly from the primary and secondary schools.</P>
      <P>Instead of telling us when they proposed to implement the plan, the Minister for Lands apparently has been sent in to lay the £100,000,000 plan to rest, because to-day he said: &ldquo;Do not take any notice of the £100,000,000 plan. It was never a plan.  It was a collection of ideas strung together while we were at leisure in opposition.  Some day we might come back to this £100,000,000 plan and see what we could do with this collection of thoughts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would be willing to give time, either to the Minister now or to any other Minister intervening later, to explain where the £100,000,000 plan is in operation and let us view it through the unemployment figures.  The plain fact of the matter is that the plan was a bogus sham by which the Fianna Fáil Party sought to mesmerise the people into giving them a new mandate in the belief that their political wizardy was such that, through the £100,000,000 plan, there would be 20,000 new jobs for people each year.  In any case, the Minister for Lands has now laid the £100,000,000 plan to rest.  Apparently we are to hear no more about that.  It has gone into the Fianna Fáil cemetery of unfulfilled and dishonoured promises and apparently it is to remain there.</P>
      <P>The question of prices has been raised in this debate and I notice that there have been interruptions from the Government Benches that Fianna Fáil never made any promises on prices. The Minister for Lands, in the course of his speech, said that Fianna Fáil did not promise to retain the food subsidies.  Everybody can remember the constant drumming of the Fianna Fáil Party, when they were in opposition from 1954 to 1957, about what they called the cost of living.</P>
      <P>From 1954 to 1957, the Government then in power held steady the price of bread, sugar and flour and reduced the price of butter by 5d. per lb.  That happened in no other country in Europe.  But notwithstanding the fact that we were able to hold steady the prices of these essential articles we were still subjected to criticism from the Fianna Fáil Party on the grounds that that was not sufficient.  In the recent elections Fianna Fáil clearly made it plain to the people that, if they were in office, the people would be presented with a better and much more attractive picture and a better and more attractive life as far as prices were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that Fianna Fáil fooled the people on prices in the last election and that they told the people <Col N="1664" /> they would retain the food subsidies. During the last election I said I backed my political reputation on the fact that I believed, if Fianna Fáil got back to office, they would abolish the remainder of the food subsidies.  I was convinced they would do so. There were many people who would not believe that Fianna Fáil would go to that extreme, but they did go to that extreme and the remainder of the food subsidies were abolished in the last Budget.</P>
    <P>But what did Fianna Fáil tell the people during the last election?  Did the Fianna Fáil Party not promise to retain the food subsidies in the last election? That statement of mine has been challenged by interruption and by direct statement during the course of this debate.  Let us get the facts and let us get them from the <i>Irish Press</i>, the political bible of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Speaking at a meeting at Doyle's Corner in Phibsboro as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> for the 1st March, the then Deputy Traynor, now Minister for Justice, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A blood-curdling story, a warning by Mr. Norton that Fianna Fáil would withdraw the food subsidies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and the paper goes on to say that Deputy Traynor said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Coalition groups having no further promises to make for themselves have switched to making sinister promises on behalf of Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Traynor was not on his own in that.  The Taoiseach speaking at Belmullet said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Coalition Party were changing their tactics in this election.  The opponents of Fianna Fáil were wondering what new dodge they could try to prevent the people from seeing the real issue in this election.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You know the record of Fianna Fáil in the past.  You know we have never done the things they said we would do.  They have also told you that you will be paying more for your bread.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> How right we were to tell the people that they would be paying more for their bread!  They are paying more to-day for their bread than they have paid during the past 35 years and all this notwithstanding the present Taoiseach's denial at Belmullet that there would be no withdrawal of the subsidies.</P>

      <P>Now we turn to the then Deputy Lemass, now Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There was nothing indefinite about his remarks.  He said on that occasion that some Coalition leaders were threatening the country with all sorts of sinister things if Fianna Fáil became the Government &mdash; compulsory tillage, wage controls, cuts in civil servants' salaries, and higher food prices &mdash; and he went on to say that the Fianna Fáil Government did not intend to do any of these things because they did not believe in them. He added, by way of clinching his argument: &ldquo;How definite can we make our denial of these stupid allegations? They are all falsehoods?&rdquo;  That was Deputy Lemass.  There was no doubt about the positiveness of that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier, speaking at Mallow, he said that the food subsidies must be accepted as being likely to be a permanent feature in the Estimates, unless a very steep fall in the cost of living should take place and that was not very likely.  He added that he would like to express a personal point of view, which he held strongly, that the maximum advantage could be obtained by concentrating all the money which could be afforded on food subsidies, on flour and bread alone.  Three months after that statement was made the food subsidies were abolished.  The concentration of all the money we could afford on the subsidisation of flour is now just <Col N="1666" /> a fragrant memory and instead of maintaining the food subsidies on flour and bread, the Government have abolished both and in the same Budget have given a free gift of £250,000 to the master bakers of this country.  That is the Government's record on prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Minister for Finance that the people would welcome our loaf to-day.  They could pay for it but they cannot pay for their bread to-day.  Ask any baker around the country how much bread he is selling to-day compared with 12 months ago.  That is the sordid history of the Government, of promises which have been repudiated, which have been ignominously torn up, promises made to deceive the people in the last election.  These promises succeeded in doing that and the Government is in office now with one of the largest majorities in this House for the last 35 years.  It is a majority which should give them the power to do things in the fulfilment of their promises but the majority is being used to enable them to repudiate the promises on which they rode into office, by deluding the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at the way the cost of living has moved since this Government came into office.  According to the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> the consumer price index in mid-February was 135. It had moved up to 138 by mid-May and by mid-August it had jumped to 143 so that between mid-February and mid-August the figure had jumped from 135 to 143.  I think international statistics will show that that is a <Col N="1667" /> higher increase than has taken place in any other country in Western Europe.  You can imagine the howls that would have gone up from the Fianna Fáil Benches if that striking and savage increase had taken place in a period of six months when the last Government was in office.  Yet this official index shows that Fianna Fáil, not being merely content to repudiate their election promises, now have to their discredit a price increase greater than, I believe, anything that has taken place in the last six months in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>I remember during the last election, in the course of my travels, seeing Fianna Fáil posters which urged women to vote for Fianna Fáil and put their husbands back in employment. That was another snare set to trap the credulous people and it worked in the last election.  A lot of people believed that the mesmerism of the Fianna Fáil Party was such that all they had to do was vote Fianna Fáil to ensure that all difficulties would be settled and would vanish overnight.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  I have here before me the last returns issued by the Central Statistics Office as to the number of people unemployed.  The number unemployed this year on the 23rd November was 67,392.  Last year there were on the same date, 71,157. But in November, 1955, there were only 54,424.  In other words the position is that the number of unemployed to-day is 3,764 fewer than this time last year but the number of unemployed to-day is over 13,000 above the number unemployed in November, 1955.</P>
    <P>The striking thing is that if you look at the figures for the week-ends of the 16th and 23rd November you find that the number of unemployed this year is now increasing over these weekly periods at a faster rate than the number increased during the same weeks of last year.  After nine months in office the Government has succeeded in bringing the figure of unemployed down by 3,700 as compared with November of last year.  But, as I said, it is still 13,000 up on the figure for November, 1955, when the inter-Party Government was in office.  Of course, <Col N="1668" /> this figure of 3,700 is easily explained. During the past nine months there has been unparalleled emigration from this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is living in a fool's paradise if he thinks there has not been this mass emigration during the past nine months.  It is increasing at an alarming rate.  I invite the Taoiseach to inquire from a number of building trade unions what has been their experience in the past nine months.  Some of these unions have now more members in England than in Ireland.  Building trade workers have packed their bags at an alarming rate during the past nine months and notwithstanding that, the present trade unions have still such a number of unemployed on their books that they have reached a period of employment stagnation greater than they have ever before experienced.</P>
      <P>These figures can be checked without difficulty.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that we have reached this situation? Look at the replies to questions in this House.  They have disclosed that there are fewer people employed in afforestation work this year than last year, that there are fewer people employed in rural electrification this year than last year, that there are fewer people employed on the roads this year than last year, that there are fewer employed in housing this year than last year, that there are substantially fewer people employed on drainage work for the simple reason that the Fianna Fáil Government, unlike the inter-Party Government, has stopped all grants which were payable under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How could unemployment figures be reduced by 3,700 were it not for the fact that there is unprecedented large-scale emigration, when these potent sources of employment &mdash; afforestation, road work, rural electrification, housing and drainage &mdash; are this <Col N="1669" /> year providing less employment than was provided last year in these various activities?  The Government must know that.  Anybody interested in ascertaining the facts can get the replies to parliamentary questions given in this House.  To-day, in reply to a parliamentary question, a statement was given on behalf of the Taoiseach that the Government had indicated recently what its proposals were when dealing with the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied with these proposals?  Has he still not got even a lingering suspicion that the proposals will make no substantial contribution to the relief of unemployment, that, while he is talking about proposals for the relief of unemployment the figures of unemployment of men and women keep on rising and rising at a greater rate than this time last year?  What is the use of leading people into the belief that the Government has a policy for unemployment when the people cannot see evidence of the Government's policy on it and when the people know it is harder to get jobs this year than it was last year?  That fact has been responsible for filling every boat that is leaving for England with people who have been frustrated from efforts to get jobs here, especially when they were told in the last General Election that if women voted for Fianna Fáil their husbands would get back to work.</P>
    <P>Somebody should keep faith with these people or apologise to these people because they were ensnared into voting for a Party which said it had an economic policy.  That policy has not helped these people find employment; it has put them into the boats to find employment in another country.  Even now I want to ask the Taoiseach what policy the Government has which is likely to bring down the number of unemployed.  I am certain it is going to rise rapidly after Christmas.  I am certain it will rise going into the spring and that then we will have a vast army of unemployed people here.</P>
    <P>What is the Government going to do to relieve that problem?  The Minister for Lands says he believes this country needs resolute Government.  Eighteen months ago he said in Rathkeale that <Col N="1670" /> this country needs 20 years of resolute Government.  I think Balfour was the last person who gave utterance to these views.  The Minister for Lands takes pleasure in saying that we have now a resolute Government.  Resolute in what?  Is it resolute in doing nothing while the employment figures rise rapidly, resolute in keeping social welfare benefits at a scale utterly inadequate having regard to the recent and rapid rise in the cost of living, resolute in not disclosing its policy, by sitting tight now that they have got into office and that they have got such a large majority that they are sure of staying there for the next four years? Would anybody believe a resolute Government of that character is any use to the people or capable of relieving the nation from the many difficulties which beset it to-day, or that it is calculated to bring a brighter ray into the lives of the people whose lives have been so long darkened by the consistent spectre of unemployment?</P>
    <P>This Government got from its predecessors a very substantial gift in the form of the steps which the last Government took to control the balance of payments.  We imposed levies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>And unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>To check the import of luxury and non-essential goods we imposed levies, and when we saw that the first levies were not sufficient to do that we increased the levies, and by doing so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;were responsible for the stopping of the importation of large quantities of luxury and non-essential goods.  That was a most unpopular action to take, but we believed the necessities of the situation demanded it.  I have no hesitation in saying that when the figures of the imports and exports are checked, and when allowance is made for our invisible exports in the form of tourism earnings, emigrants' remittances and dividends on foreign investments, it will be shown that in the 10 months from June, 1956, to July, 1957, we did, in fact, effect balance in our trade relations.  That balance was <Col N="1671" /> effected three or four months after we left office, and this Government knows that in July last the balance had been struck and equilibrium had been reached in our balance of payments. Were it not for the fact that we took these measures the Government now would be wrestling with the problem of restoring equilibrium to our balance of payments.</P>
      <P>Now Ministers can chirp round the country and say, &ldquo;Not only have we secured equilibrium in our balance of payments but we are building up sterling assets again.&rdquo;  One has only to look at bank figures to see that the banks are again building up sterling assets, adding more and more to these assets.  I do not complain about that; I think it is a good development.  That is the development we sought to achieve but it was very fortunate for this Government that within three or four months of taking office they were able to say that, in fact, a balance had been effected so far as our trading relations were concerned.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt we incurred considerable odium by imposing these levies at that time but it was the right thing to do then, and it would be cowardice to shrink from doing it.  As a result of doing it, the present Government was able to inherit a balanced situation so far as our payments were concerned much earlier than they would have been able to achieve that balance if we had not taken these steps as early and as drastically as we did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to find out what Government policy now is in respect of foreign investment.  Before and while I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I urged people outside this country to bring their money here to a country which had a stable Government which was not likely to be in the cockpit of war, which had no Communist movement.  I urged them to invest that money in setting up industries here to make goods which were not already produced here.  Barely had I said that when a howl of criticism was released from all the shallow minds of the Fianna Fáil Party saying this was absolutely anti-national, calculated to <Col N="1672" /> do irreparable damage to Irish industry.</P>
    <P>It was intended to do no such thing because Irish industrialists cannot live in a country from which the population is fleeing by every boat and plane leaving the country.  The Irish industrialist can only survive in a country where people have jobs.  He cannot make profits out of a situation in which 70,000 or 100,000 people are unemployed.  People cannot be consumers of goods if they have no money to purchase them.  I wanted to invite these foreign industrialists to come here and invest their money in manufacturing goods not already produced here.  That point of view and that advocacy of mine was subjected to the criticism of shallow minds.  I defended my action then and I defend it now, first, on the ground that every intelligent country in Europe has done, and is trying to do, the same thing.</P>
    <P>In my view, it is much better to get a foreign industrialists to invest money and start industries in Ireland rather than stand idly by refusing to think, while seeing tens of thousands of our young boys and girls going to work in foreign countries, in factories financed by foreign capital, and living according to a foreign concept of life when, in fact, by inviting foreign industrialists to invest here in establishing Irish industries we could adopt the far preferable course of finding employment for these people in their own land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party is now whispering its tune to foreign investment.  I think that is right.  It is a sane and sound policy and I hope it will remain their policy because it is the only intelligent policy for a country of this kind which is not rich in natural resources, which is an outpost of Western Europe and out of the main commercial stream and which is suffering from endemic unemployment and from an emigration problem the like of which is not confronting any other similar country in the world to-day.</P>
      <P>I avail, therefore, of this opportunity to welcome this conversion in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I hope the Control of Manufactures Act will be interred with appropriate honours side by side with the £100,000,000 plan which was laid to rest by the Minister for Justice this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I want to refer also to the Government's attitude towards what is now colloquially known as the Free Trade Area.  The Minister for Health was let loose recently to make a speech for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and in describing what the effects of the Free Trade Area were likely to be on this country he said: &ldquo;If we do not export we shall rapidly approach the time when the mainland of this country will be as depopulated as the Blaskets.&rdquo;  There was cheerful advice to give the industrialists as to what the Free Trade Area may mean to us unless, apparently, we go into it and can export goods to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt the Government will try to do its best to get from the architects of the Free Trade Area the best kind of settlement that can be got to suit our interests, but I am bound to say that I do not see anywhere in speeches by Ministers any recognition of how serious is the question of our entry to or our standing aloof from the Free Trade Area, so far as our industrialists and agricultural possibilities are concerned.  Whatever we do in this respect will be very largely dictated by the economic compulsion which will follow whatever Britain decides to do, so far as the Free Trade Area is concerned. <Col N="1674" /> If we do not go into the Free Trade Area we have the pleasure of standing aloof as an outpost of Western Europe; if we go in, all the tariff barriers will go down, maybe not immediately but progressively, and one day they will go entirely and then our infant industries will have to meet wintry competition from countries which are highly mechanised, which have a long industrial tradition and which have know-how vastly superior to what we possess in many of our industrial fields.</P>
    <P>My complaint is that I do not think the Government is adequately warning industrialists who will be affected by the coming into operation of the Free Trade Area.  I hear words used by the Minister for Industry and Commerce which seem to me to be a misrepresentation of the position.  He talks about the Free Trade Area being a great challenge to us, a Free Trade Area being something from which we will not run away.  That is too lurid language to use for the situation which presents itself to us to-day.</P>
    <P>The Government ought to make it clear to industrialists what the full effect of our entry into the Free Trade Area is likely to be for our industries if our industrialists are compelled to meet the unrestricted challenge of imports from highly industrialised, highly organised and highly rationalised industries in other countries.  I do not believe many of our present industries could survive in an export market.  I think a very large number of them will not be able to survive in the home market unless, in the meantime, they can gear their organisation and adapt and reorientate their organisation in such a way as to enable them to meet what, in my view, is not just a great challenge but what looks like being a mortal blow so far as Irish industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see a Free Trade Area, after all that has been done to develop Irish industry, operate in such a way that one industry after the other will go down under the blows of European competition; that will have the effect of converting this country again into a vast cattle ranch for the production of cheap beef and cheap <Col N="1675" /> foodstuffs for other countries.  I think the Government could well spend a good deal of time in analysing the consequences of the coming into operation of the Free Trade Area.  They should establish an economic secretariat for the purpose of warning industrialists and explaining to industrialists what it will be necessary for them to do if they are to meet the situation which will arise here so far as the implementation of the Free Trade Area is concerned.</P>
    <P>I think the problem and the difficulties have been played down too much &mdash; that there has been a certain lightheartedness about it because it appears to be far away.  It is already too close to us, too close to burke any further delay in realising what threatens us.  While, as I said, I believe and I am satisfied the Government will do everything possible to get the best terms for this country, at the same time I think something more than that is necessary.  The whole home industrial machine must have brought home to it the seriousness of the situation confronting it so that our industrialists, by every means available to them and with Government aid, if necessary, may meet this serious danger which, I think, could well undo all that we have tried to do to establish our secondary industries here over the past 35 years.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House further except to ask the Taoiseach to avail of this opportunity to tell the House what the Government's economic policy is.  What does it hope to do to deal with the serious unemployment problem at the moment and with the still more serious unemployment problem which will supervene when Christmas is over?  The Government told the electorate that they had a policy for dealing with all our economic ills. We have never got any details of that policy.  It was epitomised under the slogan: &ldquo;Get cracking!&rdquo;  The Government has adopted a Rip Van Winkle attitude so far as &ldquo;get cracking&rdquo; is concerned over the last nine months.  It is not too much now to ask them to wake up and, in face of the serious economic difficulties confronting <Col N="1676" /> the country, tell the people what they are going to do.  The people were promised that they would be led to &ldquo;Great Expectations&rdquo;.  After nine months of Fianna Fáil Government they see themselves being consigned to &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Government has now been in office for a period of nine months and on no occasion during that time has their general policy been disclosed. The Bills brought before the House were the identical Bills prepared by the inter-Party Government, even to the extent of the Bill setting up the Institute of Agriculture.  That was practically the identical Bill prepared by the inter-Party Government. If, however, the Government have shown inactivity in the preparation of Bills they have certainly shown great activity from another point of view, namely, in relation to the resounding blow they have struck the ordinary man in the street and the ordinary householder by the introduction of their Budget earlier this year, in which they increased the price of bread from 9d. to 1/2 per 2-lb. loaf.  When they took the subsidy off bread they removed bread from the table of the ordinary household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government did that because they were not in touch with the ordinary people.  Had they been in touch, <Col N="1677" /> I doubt if they would have removed the subsidy.  I have personal contact with people buying bread every day and I know the straits people are in trying to buy this essential commodity. One woman told me that she finds it impossible to keep bread on the table. I can well appreciate that.  She has a young family.  The situation may be all right for those wealthy people who go out to dine.  The situation is intolerable for the ordinary person who has to provide bread for every meal during the day.</P>
    <P>After the general election in 1954 the inter-Party Government felt that the ordinary people were being deprived of butter because of the prohibitive price and their first action was to reduce the price of butter from 4/2 to 3/9.  When the Fianna Fáil Government returned to office, not alone did they put back the price to 4/2 but they put on another 2d. and made the price 4/4.  In other words, they increased the price of butter by 7d.  That created a surplus.  I do not know if the Government realises that people are no longer able to buy bread and butter. There is a reduction of practically 20 per cent. in the consumption of bread. That is borne out by every bakery in the country.  What effect will that have on the wheat produced this year?  What surplus will we have at the end of the year because of reduced bread consumption?</P>
    <P>The same situation exists in relation to butter.  Admittedly, there are substitutes for butter and it is the substitutes the people are buying.  We are importing the raw material to manufacture a substitute for butter. There is more butter for export and on every pound of butter exported the Government is prepared to pay a subsidy of one shilling to one and three-pence. I have no great objection to a subsidy being paid on surplus butter. Where I do find fault is that we reduce our home consumption of butter, which we refuse to subsidise at 5d. per lb. for our own people, while we subsidise it to the amount of 1/-, 1/2 and 1/3 a lb. for the people of a foreign country.</P>
    <P>In the same Budget the Government removed completely the levy on high-powered <Col N="1678" /> motor-cars.  The person who wants a £1,500 motor-car no longer has to pay any levy on that car.  It is the same with wireless sets and other non-essential goods.  We may thank Fianna Fáil if the people of the country cannot have bread but can have oranges instead.  However, that is very small consolation to the poor people down the country.  If that happened in another country we would have a bloody revolution.  I am glad to say that the people of this country are sane and are not likely to go as far as that.</P>
    <P>However, during the past month we have had an unbloody revolution in North Central Dublin.  Last March every second person who voted in the general election voted for Fianna Fáil but last month only one of every four of the people who voted, voted Fianna Fáil.  Is that not a revolution in itself?  Does not that show the Government the way things are going? There never was such a fall in the inter-Party vote as there was in the Fianna Fáil vote in Dublin North Central.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is now 3,000 less than it was this time 12 months but we must remember that then we had a lot of unemployment in the motor-car industry last year and that helped to enlarge the figure.  In the meantime we have had mass emigration from this country.  We have all heard of the Lemass plan for the expenditure of £100,000,000.  For 12 months before the last general election we had the Tánaiste explaining his plan for full employment at meetings under the auspices of various Fianna Fáil clubs throughout the country.  We were tired of hearing of this plan and it is no wonder that the people changed the Government. Could you blame them with all the promises that were held out to them? We had promises from the Tánaiste to put 15,000 people annually into employment but since he has gone into Government he has been too busy with other things to bother about it.</P>
    <P>I can speak about my own town. Unemployment in Kilkenny was never greater and the unemployment is not <Col N="1679" /> the worst &mdash; it is the frustration that is behind the people.  If they had a hope that in a month or two there would be a change for the better, things would not be too bad but as it is they have no hope.  They are frustrated and you can read frustration in the faces of people in the streets.  The county council drivers have been notified this year that they are being let go.  That is a thing that never happened before and when I made representations to the county surveyor to keep them on until after Christmas he said he could not do so.  Even some of the clerks in the yard are being laid off.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister for Lands speak twice in the last week, once in Kilkenny and once here.  His speech to-night was very mild compared to the one he made in Kilkenny.  There he spoke about emigration and said that we should not decry emigration. He said that for the last 300 years Scotland had much more emigration than we had but that, because of the heavy industries on the Clyde, they were able to keep up the general level of the population.  He said that on one occasion all the people emigrated from Florida and left the place and that when they had all gone others came in.  Is it present Government policy that when all our people have cleared out others will come in?  What type of people will come back here?  Is it out of the Sputniks they will come?</P>
    <P>He said that the boom was over and that we should get down to hard work. He said that £20,000,000 was injected into the economy here every year for the last ten years.  He said that that money was money which the people did not earn, and I am glad he called that £20,000,000 slush money.  I am glad that I can place it on the records of this House that the Minister for Lands called that £20,000,000 slush money. Does he regard the money spent on the removal of the slums in Kilkenny as slush money?  I saw houses last week, two-roomed houses, with high walls behind them lest any light might get to them, in which people reared large families.  We removed those through the money spent on housing in the last ten years.  Does the Minister for Lands <Col N="1680" /> call that slush money?  Does he call the money spent on planting 90,000 acres of forestry in the last ten years slush money?  Does he regard as slush money the money that was spent on the land reclamation project which brought 1,000,000 acres of land into production? That is what the Minister called slush money.</P>
    <P>He mentioned a figure of £37 10s. per household.  One would think that that amount was sent down to each household and that they had a spree on it.  That money was not sent as a free gift to the people.  The people earned that money and with it we have built up domestic assets in the way of housing.  People who emigrated from this country 20 and 30 years ago and who come back now could not believe their eyes when they saw the improvements that had been made in our towns and cities with the expenditure of that money.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what the Minister meant when he said: &ldquo;Wives, get your husbands out to work.&rdquo;  I thought at first that it was some bright boy in Kilkenny who thought of that particular one until I discovered that it was posted up in every constituency in the country.  Now it is not: &ldquo;Wives, get your husbands out to work&rdquo;, but &ldquo;Husbands, bring your wives to England to work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We can see the mentality of the present Government.  They say now that they have a majority and that we cannot put them out.  They say that they will not move an inch.  A question was asked yesterday about the Grant-in-Aid for the improved marketing of agricultural produce.  That was grand window-dressing for the last Budget. Two questions were asked here yesterday about the £250,000 announced by Fianna Fáil for the marketing of agricultural produce.  The reply given to those questions was that the committee to deal with that has not yet been set up, even though we are practically at the end of the financial year.  Does that show efficiency?</P>
    <P>When Deputy Childers was in Kilkenny he spoke about efficiency experts.  They were to be the be-all and the end-all of everything in this <Col N="1681" /> country.  If I got an efficiency expert into my house, everything would be all right.  He said they were marvellous in the Post Office.  He got efficiency experts into the Engineering Branch and, for an increase of 7½ per cent. in employment, he got an improvement of 150 per cent. in the output of work.  I think the Government would be well advised to get in some efficiency experts so that they might set up this committee for the improvement of agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made a statement recently &mdash; at a bankers' dinner in Dublin, I think &mdash; that, due to the high cost of money, he was only raising a loan of £10,000,000 this year and that he did not want to be putting more charges on the Irish people. Why had he not the courage to say that, due to the £8,000,000 he raised on Deputy Sweetman's Prize Bonds, he did not require any more money to bridge the gap instead of putting on the old soldier and saying he did not require any more?</P>
    <P>In this the first year of the present Government they have taken away £8,000,000 in subsidies and have abolished the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I went to the trouble of finding out the details of the number of men employed under that Act in my own county during the last four years.  They are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In 1954: February, 142; March, 128. In 1955: February, 80; March, 159.  In 1956: February, 129; March, 99.  In 1957: February, 133; March, 48.  That is an average of 110 men employed per week.</P>
    <P>The Government have removed the grant enabling those men to be employed.  It consisted of about £20,000 to County Kilkenny over the last four years.  By their deliberate action the Government have put 110 men out of work.  What have they done with them? They have put them on the Employment Exchange.  They will draw unemployment benefits to the extent of £12,000.  Which is better?  To give the men £10,000 to £12,000 through the Labour Exchange for doing nothing or give them £20,000 and have them happy men, rearing families and bringing in <Col N="1682" /> money hard earned?  They earn only about £5 per week with the county council and they will draw roughly £3 per week in unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I would make one appeal to the Taoiseach.  I would ask him to consider during the recess renewing those grants.  They have taken the bread from the people's table by their deliberate action in increasing the price and they have taken the butter from their table by the same method.  They have put these 110 men out of employment by their deliberate action in taking the grant from the local authority.  I would ask the Taoiseach to give back these grants so that these men at least will have work again, even if they are not buying a lot of bread with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's aim is an expanding economy, paying its way in transactions with other countries and providing higher living standards for a growing population.  I am stating that principle and I am sure every Party will accept it.  Seeing there can be no dispute on that, I intend to proceed to see whether the Government has been maintaining that principle and whether anything has come from it.</P>
      <P>I want to quote again a few words from the Budget speech I made here last May.  I said at that time:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Government have full confidence in the inherent soundness of the economy and in its ability to provide higher living standards for an expanding population on the firm basis of an increase in production and exports.  The relaxation of restrictions and the assurance of new reliefs, together with the maintenance of the State capital programme at a high level and the prospects of a continuing improvement in exports, should strengthen business confidence and stimulate production.  The resultant growth of opportunities for work should effect a marked improvement in the unemployment situation and check the outflow of our people.  We cannot hope to solve all our problems at once, but with the co-operation of every section of the community, they can be reduced in scale and urgency.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1683" /> I just want to emphasise three points in what I have already quoted.  In that speech I emphasised that what we wanted was an increase in production and exports.  I think we can claim that there has been an increase in production and exports.  I am not now dealing with the point whether that was due to the policy of the last Government or to the fact that we came into power.  The fact is that over the last six or nine months we have had an increase in production and exports.</P>
    <P>Another point I made at that time was that we cannot hope to solve our problems at once.  Anybody listening to the speeches made by the Opposition speakers would not give me credit for making that statement in the Budget speech.  Far from promising that all our ills would be made to go with the greatest despatch, I said at that time that we could not hope to solve all our problems at once.  Everything that has happened since that only confirms me in the view that I expressed at that time.</P>
    <P>In reply to various questions about the steps the Government had decided on to relieve unemployment, I want to quote the Taoiseach.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only measures of real advantage from the point of view of reducing unemployment are those which develop the economy, increase the opportunities of lasting employment or create assets of permanent value.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees with that.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any attempt now to solve our immediate problems by using up, on unproductive schemes, the limited capital resources so necessary for productive purposes would merely be postponing our difficulties and, ultimately, making them greater.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a quotation from Volume 164 of the Dáil Debates, columns 2 and 3 of the 23rd October.</P>
    <P>I am merely quoting from my own Budget speech and from the Taoiseach's speech the principles we have laid before ourselves and on which we believe a proper economy can be built up in this country.  You may ask <Col N="1684" /> what we did to make this policy a reality.  Almost immediately after coming into office the Government relaxed the special import levies with a view to reducing their restricting effect on industrial activity.  I think there is no doubt that, at least in some cases, the relaxation of the import levies had the effect of increasing employment in certain industries, for instance, the motor industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crotty, in true Fine Gael style, again brought up this question about the big motor-car coming in free of levy.  It has been pointed out to Deputy Crotty and to the Fine Gael Party generally that this was necessary under the 1938 and 1948 Agreements made with the British and it was a thing that could not be avoided under the circumstances.  I do not think it is necessary to go into it because I am quite sure that Deputy Crotty will say the same again, despite whatever I may say on this occasion.</P>
    <P>In the Budget speech I announced a number of measures due to come into effect for the tax year 1958-59.  These were the raising from 50 to 100 per cent. of the relief for profits derived from increases in exports and an alternative concession which gave a 25 per cent. relief for total exports to any exporters who did not wish to have the option of accepting the relief on the increase of exports; a 25 per cent. increase in the wear and tear allowance on plant and machinery; and the extension of the tax remission provided by Section 7 of the Finance Act of 1932 to all securities issued to the public by Irish manufacturing concerns subsequent to 1932.  There was also a concession of a 40 per cent. investment allowance on new ships and tax relief on certain subscriptions made for research in universities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before the Deputy came in, I am not at this stage saying that this is due to one Government or another; I am just saying what has been done.  In addition to providing these tax reliefs and incentives <Col N="1685" /> £250,000 was provided for agricultural marketing; £50,000 for the benefit of the sea and inland fisheries, and £100,000 for increased expenditure on the elimination of tubercular cattle. It is manifest to all concerned that farmers are prepared to produce more wherever a remunerative price is assured.  The guaranteed prices for cattle, milk and sugar-beet and for grade A pigs have evoked a very significant response from agricultural producers.  The Government came to the conclusion that if the farmers could be assured of a remunerative market for their products, the response would be very marked in many other lines.</P>
      <P>The Government therefore came to the conclusion that, in order to maintain present conditions, and more so if we wanted to encourage increased production, it would be necessary to do something with regard to the marketing of agricultural produce.  With that object in view £250,000 was provided for the improvement of marketing. Because of the many changes in the office of Minister for Agriculture which were partly, if you like, fortuitous but partly unfortunate, the machinery necessary for the spending of this money was postponed.  Now I think it is fairly certain that in the very near future a committee will be appointed to look after this very important subject.</P>
      <P>The £100,000 for increased expenditure on the elimination of tubercular cattle was offered for the old cows which might be the means of spreading tuberculosis, on the basis that these would be paid for at their full value.  Rural Deputies know that up to that time a cow with open tuberculosis was paid for only at about one-quarter its value and the farmers therefore were a bit slow offering them under the tuberculosis scheme.  I cannot say at the moment what response there has been to this offer but I know that at the beginning it looked promising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government also committed itself to a very large public capital programme amounting to £40,000,000 and expenditure is running very close to <Col N="1686" /> this figure.  Provision was made for over £1,000,000 to assist new industrial development in the private sector.  The provision for housing, sanitary and other works carried on by local authorities is now considerably above the expenditure in 1956-57 and the indications are that in this sector also it will be practically all spent.  It will also be recalled that a special grant of £900,000 was put into the Road Fund, partly to discharge liabilities that had accrued and owing to the fact that the last Government had taken £500,000 out of the fund.  We had to discharge the debts left to us and give the fund a chance of getting over the difficulties created by the inter-Party Government last year.</P>
    <P>Housing finance was put on a more orderly basis and uncertainty on the part of local authorities as regards drawings from the Local Loans Funds was removed.  All the sums owing at the time were paid out and certainty with regard to future payments was created.  As a step towards relieving the immediate difficulties the Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes was supplemented to the extent of £250,000.  The strain which the financing of all these schemes has put on the Exchequer is not generally appreciated but I can say I am not overstating the case when I put it that it was severe.</P>
    <P>While it was eased by the success of the recent National Loan, it is by no means removed.  Indeed, as will be mentioned later, the budgetary statement on the outlook for the present year was by no means conservative.  No measure that any Government can take will change the whole face of the economy over-night.  The Government can only try to stimulate progress and accelerate movements in the right direction.  It is the enterprise, energy and general attitude of the private individual, industrialist, farmer and worker which are the most important in the end.  Even in the relatively short period since March last, however, some progress has been made in the basic fields of production and exports.  There are of course no figures available yet of agricultural output this year but there is little doubt that the indications <Col N="1687" /> are it will show a considerable increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One has only to think of the situation in regard to wheat, where we have produced an estimated 370,000 tons for milling, as against a requirement of 300,000 tons; milk where we have an enormous surplus for export in the form of butter, about 14,000 tons, and above all cattle and meat, exports of which have increased in the first nine months by £17,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed as regards cattle exports, live and processed, the total number exported during the first nine months of this year in fact exceeded the number for the whole of 1956.  Even allowing for imports of live cattle, the net increase in cattle exports in the first nine months of this year was of the order of 188,000, an increase of 33 per cent.  Those are the figures and, whether they suit this Government or that, we can all draw our conclusions from them.  A big factor in this increased export of cattle was the low prices in 1956 which compelled farmers or induced them to hold on to their cattle in the hope that prices might improve in 1957.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not ashamed to mention it anyway.  I think there is no doubt whatever that at the rate cattle exports are going at the moment we cannot hope to maintain exports at that level.  We have a bigger export figure this year because it was low last year.  The position has arisen now where we have depleted our stocks and we will also have to replace the cattle slaughtered under the T.B. scheme.  For all these reasons it would be too much to hope that our cattle exports in the next couple of years will be so good.  It must be recognised that some of the increase in this year's exports has been at the expense of stocks&mdash;the June, 1957, cattle census revealed a fall of 106,800 in cattle stocks, mainly two-year-old and upwards.  This encroachment on stocks, together with the need, which will be a growing one, to replace T.B. cattle, must in time adversely affect export potentialities. These increases, at any rate as regards wheat and milk, are not without their drawbacks from the narrow Exchequer point of view inasmuch as present arrangements provide for the payment of prices to farmers for any surplus to home-grown consumption which are now far in excess of the prices realisable on the export market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation with regard to the mounting requirements of subsidies on these commodities would give any Minister for Finance food for thought. The very uninformed economic suggestion made by Deputy Crotty has often been made by other speakers, that is, that we are exporting butter and maintaining our high export level while, at the same time, denying our own people cheaper butter for consumption at home.  Everybody knows that this is due entirely to budgetary considerations. We could give our people much cheaper butter out of State finances but we cannot afford it.  There has, of course, been a balance of payments gain from the increasing production of wheat and barley in particular.  As compared with 1956 there was a reduction of £2,135,000 in imports of maize in the first nine months of this year. <Col N="1689" /> That, of course, is a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>We have succeeded in building up our wheat and barley production and I am glad to say we no longer suffer from the difficulty of which Fine Gael have until recently been afraid &mdash; that we cannot grow our wheat and barley at home.  Fine Gael now realise that we can, so we have no further dispute in regard to that matter.  We can not only supply ourselves with our wheat requirements, with the exception of the small quantity of hard wheat which the bakers think is necessary, but we can  supply ourselves with animal feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>As regards industrial output, the position is that it has not yet recovered to the 1955 level.  Output in the first threequarters of 1957 was lower than in the first threequarters of 1956, but the rate of decline was checked and the September quarter index for 1957 is almost the same as the corresponding index for the year previously.</P>
    <P>I spent some time studying the position of our exports and I was rather pleased to see that in the industrial side we have, in the group including yarn, thread, textiles, boots and shoes, paper and cardboard, reached a stage when the export value of these items is £10,000,000 a year. That is certainly a tribute to the long term policy of Fianna Fáil because when Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932 we were importing our textiles, all our thread, most of our shoes and boots and whatever paper and cardboard we were using.  We have now reached the stage where we are largely self-sufficient and have a surplus of £10,000,000 for export.</P>
    <P>We can now take the sugar group &mdash; sweets, sugar preparations, chocolate and cakes.  Our exports in that regard amount to about £1,000,000 a year. Again, in 1932, in this country we were producing only about 25 per cent of our requirements in sugar.  Now we are practically self-sufficient in sugar.  In 1932 we imported a great deal of confectionery from Britain and from Belfast.  We are now producing our own and exporting it as well.  These items <Col N="1690" /> are a tribute to the long term policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton this evening gave the impression that we were now prepared to scrap the Control of Manufactures Act.  I believed it was necessary at the time it was introduced and it has served a very useful purpose.  I believe indeed that the Act is still necessary under certain circumstances but it is possible it can be relaxed now much more than it was some years ago.  It was foreseen at the time that relaxation would be necessary and in the Act itself provision was made for that relaxation.  Accordingly, there was nothing very strange as far as our attitude to the Control of Manufactures Act was concerned.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government did, in their time, invite foreign capital in here and in fact when people came in to start factories they were referred to by the Labour Party as spivs, fly-by-nights and other such names.  One would imagine from Deputy Norton now that he was the first to advocate that foreign capital should be brought in. I remember very distinctly in an election held perhaps in 1948 &mdash; I am not sure that was the one &mdash; when the Labour Party in criticising our attempts at tourism appealed to the people of this country to withhold their votes from Fianna Fáil because Fianna Fáil were trying to bring in millionaires to take the food off the poor man's table.  These were the sentiments we had from the people who are now trying to give the impression that they were the first to speak about bringing in foreign capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade figures for the ten months, January to October, showed the following results: Our imports are down £1.7 million and our exports are up £21.8 million so that we have a more favourable balance as compared with <Col N="1691" /> the ten months of last year to the extent of £23.5 million.  This great improvement, as I mentioned earlier, is due for the most part, to increased exports of cattle and meat.  The change for the better has been so good, in fact, that there is no doubt now that there will be a balance of payments surplus for the calendar year 1957 of the order of £5,000,000.  I should say that covers both visible and invisible imports and exports.  That surplus is against a deficit in 1956 of £14.4 million and in 1955 of £35.5 million.  In fact, if this surplus works out as we anticipate, it will be the first surplus since 1946.</P>

      <P>The trade gap widened somewhat in October as compared with October, 1956, and this I mention as a reminder that there is a danger of complacency.  Indeed, in each of the three months, August, September and October, imports were actually higher than they were for the same three months last year and, for the first time, in the month of October there was a decline in exports.  These are indications that we must not be complacent about our position.  We must be watchful, and it is necessary to keep a close watch on the trade balance so as to ensure we can continue to pay our way in our external transactions.</P>
      <P>I should not like it to be taken that a decrease in imports would always be the sign of a good economy.  An increase in imports is not to be deprecated provided we are earning, through increased exports, the means of paying for them.  I would say the economic ideal would be to balance imports and exports on the highest possible level.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking the savings position is not unsatisfactory but the savings made available to the Government by the public are not yet adequate to support State capital expenditure on its present scale.  Two new methods of collecting and stimulating the savings of the public have met with gratifying success, the first being Prize Bonds, for which on more than one occasion I have given credit to Deputy Sweetman.  On the one occasion when I did not I was pulled up about it.  On many occasions I have done it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did it in the Budget which was the important occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And on other occasions, too.  No less than £8,000,000 was raised by the two issues of Prize Bonds in March and September.  A particularly satisfactory feature was that the money subscribed consisted for the most part of new current savings and was not just a transfer of past savings.  The £2,000,000 issue of Exchequer Bills in July and the £3,000,000 issue in September were both over-subscribed.  The difference in the receipts from the two issues of the Prize Bonds suggests a strong element of once-for-all success in the venture.  It would seem as if the aggregate of subscriptions will inevitably reach a ceiling in the course of a year or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bank deposits increased by £17,000,000 between October, 1956, and October, 1957.  The banks' external assets have gone up by £11,000,000 and their bills, loans and advances within the State by £6,000,000.  Small savings in the form of Saving Certificates and Savings Bank deposits are not doing as well as <Col N="1693" /> last year but this is only to be expected in view of the competition from Prize Bonds.</P>
    <P>All told, taking small savings, Prize Bonds and National Loan subscriptions, I am afraid we may still be short of meeting the requirements of the public capital programme and a further increase in indebtedness on Exchequer Bills may be necessary.  I need hardly remind Deputies that borrowing by Exchequer Bills is not the most desirable way of getting money for State capital purposes.  It is short-term borrowing.</P>
    <P>No effort can be spared to stimulate savings if we are to continue the work of national development.  I should like to refer to the Savings Gift Tokens now on sale as a result of a recommendation of the Savings Committee.  I hope this scheme will be availed of extensively by parents and others who wish to make Christmas gifts to children.</P>
    <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Bill just introduced in the Dáil and the Trustee Savings Banks legislation which is about to be introduced, should help to channel more savings into Irish securities.</P>
    <P>The unexpectedly heavy subsidies required for C.I.E. and also for some items of agricultural exports threaten to throw the current Budget out of balance.  There appears to be little prospect of revenue rising above the budgetary estimate.  On present indications, I believe further that the prospect for the coming year is not encouraging&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would any Minister for Finance say anything else at this time of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot say it anyway.  In other words, while the country as a whole is in surplus in its accounts with the rest of the world, the Exchequer is not yet sharing in this turn of fortune.  Indeed it would seem that while certain increases in expenditure are impossible to avoid, tax revenue has lost its buoyancy under many important heads.  One might say that the limit of taxable capacity has been reached in some directions and it is difficult to see any <Col N="1694" /> method by which additional revenue on a substantial scale can be raised without very injurious effects on employment and on economic activity in general.</P>
      <P>Everyone would agree that we must strive to reach a position in which we can reduce the heavy burden of taxation. This is the greatest fillip that could be given to economic development and progress.  The difficulty is to get agreement on any substantial item of retrenchment.</P>
      <P>The greatest contributory cause of increased taxation, because of its effect in increasing expenditure year by year, is the growing cost of the service of debt.  This is rising at present by about £2,000,000 a year.  Obviously there can be no relaxation of the policy announced in the Budget speech of switching the public capital programme progressively from non-productive to productive works.  It will be understood that the longer a public capital programme of a predominantly non-productive character is persisted in, the more dependent employment will become on this artificial support and the less resources will remain for the productive investment which alone can yield lasting and self-sustaining employment and give higher real incomes. What we want is that workers should enjoy as high an income as possible based on the sale of the products of their work at economic prices, either at home or abroad &mdash; not that workers' income should depend on the proceeds of State taxation or borrowing.</P>
      <P>When imports and exports, both visible and invisible, are balanced we know for certain that, as a community, we are not living beyond our means. Internally, however, the current Budget should be balanced and savings must balance capital requirements because otherwise the balance of payments would again go out of gear.  As I have said already, the Government is not getting enough practical support from the public for their capital programme. A good lot of the money has to come from the banks and it is lent eventually to the Government in the form of short-term loans, which is unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have quoted figures in <Col N="1695" /> relation to unemployment, and quoted them correctly.  They have pointed out that we are about 3,764 down as compared with this time last year; but last year was 16,394 higher than in the same period in the previous year.  While this improvement is nothing to boast of and not a figure on which the Government would like to congratulate itself, it does represent a reduction and it gives some promise for the future.  That is the most we can say about it.</P>
    <P>Employment in agriculture &mdash; that is, the number of males engaged in farm work on 1st June &mdash; declined by 6,700 in 1957 compared with 9,000 in 1956 and 3,000 in 1955, representing an average annual decrease of over 11,000 between 1941 and 1953; 1954 was the only year which showed stability in agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>Employment in transportable goods industries in the September quarter of 1957 averaged 149,100 as compared with 151,100 in the same quarter in 1956.  All that we can say is that the downward trend which appeared in 1956 has been checked, but has not yet been completely wiped out.</P>
    <P>Consumer prices have, of course, increased.  The Index for August, 1957 (to base 1947-100) was 143 as compared with 135 in August, 1956.  This increase up to August, 1957, has been mainly due to the provisions in the Budget.  Of the eight points by which the cost of living went up in the last 12 months, five points were caused by the Budget and the other three points are attributable to other causes. As compared with pre-war, consumer prices have gone up by 163 per cent, weekly industrial wage earnings have gone up by 190 per cent, and the minimum agricultural wage has gone up by 255 per cent.</P>
    <P>Neither private individuals nor the Government can afford to neglect the lessons of the past two years in deciding future action in the economic or financial spheres.  It is too easy to generate a situation in which at the cost of a heavy deficit in our balance of payments we may enjoy a temporary semblance of prosperity.  We know now that prosperity depending <Col N="1696" /> on realisation of external assets can only be of very short duration. Indeed, we cannot afford any more of the short-lived boosts because our external reserves could not bear a further impact of the 1955 magnitude.  With great difficulty, and at great cost in terms of reduced industrial output and employment, the ruinous drain on our external reserves which set in in 1955 has been stopped.  It is much too early to assert that the leak has been permanently plugged.  As was mentioned earlier, the October trade figures carried a warning of the danger of rising imports and of flattening out of exports.</P>
    <P>A breathing space has been gained and our external position made right for the first time since 1946.  It is particularly important that, as we can no longer afford heavy deficits, we should take care not to add to unproductive spending or do anything else which may generate increased imports for which we cannot pay or hamper production and exports.  It is essential that our spending should satisfy the test of productivity, so that we may strengthen still further our ability to pay for the raw materials and basic commodities needed to support an expansion in home production.</P>
    <P>There is a real danger to our economy from increases in expenditure not offset by economies or increased production. For that reason further increases in costs and prices must be avoided to the utmost extent.  It is better to avoid such increases now than to accentuate the difficulties of the immediate balance of payments situation and the problems of adjustment to the freer trading conditions which seem to face us in the near future in Britain and on the European Continent.</P>
    <P>The Government is very much concerned with the problem of future economic development of the country. It is receiving advice in this matter from the Capital Investment Advisory Committee and, of course, the various Departments concerned are giving special thought to it and examining the possibilities of development both general and specific.  So as to have the <Col N="1697" /> best advice, not merely from home but also from external sources as to future lines of productive development, the World Bank, which Ireland recently joined, has been asked to study our investment needs at first hand by sending a mission here.  The bank has unrivalled experience of the problems of the less developed countries and we hope to benefit from its expert advice and assistance.</P>
    <P>It is clear that only a combination of capital enterprise and technical competence, backed by advice from the most reliable sources available to us, will achieve what I stated to be the Government aim when I stood up to speak, namely, an expanding economy paying its way in its transactions with other countries and providing higher living standards for a growing population.</P>

      <P>I take pride in having the honour of speaking here.  I have been 20 years trying to get here.  That will give the House some idea of how hard it is for young people or new people to get into politics.  One hears a great deal about it.  But it is like a lot of other things&mdash;people do not mean what they say.  Join a political Party and, if you have any independent view at all, out you go.  Even if <Col N="1698" /> you try to form a Party there are many obstacles put in your way because people control the Press, or something else, and give you no publicity.  However I did not come hear to elaborate on that.  It took me 20 years to get here and now I want to protest in the name of the plain people, of whom I am one.</P>
      <P>I won the recent by-election and I believe I could have won a by-election in at least six areas of this city had there been a by-election in those areas. The people have made their attitude very clear.  They condemn all Parties. Up to recently, they had no choice but to vote for one Party or the other. People like to have confidence in somebody but they have been tricked so often that they now find it difficult to have confidence in anybody.  If they have any confidence in me, it is because of very hard work.</P>
      <P>I understand that on this debate on the Adjournment one can express opinions on Government policy. Naturally, I have something to say on the policy of the present Government. Before the recent general election we had grandiose statements in the Press, particularly in the <i>Irish Press</i>, of the plan the Government had in mind and how they could get £100,000,000 to put everybody to work. I know that most political Parties make promises in order to get into power.  It is inherent in every political Party that they want to get into office and the aim of every one of them seems to be to get a majority and get it whatever way they can, particularly through the making of promises.  In saying that, I am not trying to say that the Party system is knavish or venal but to some extent it is.  There are honourable men in all Parties.  Every Party in turn does a certain amount of good but the trouble seems to be that no Party will give credit to the other for the good it has done.  There is a good deal of knavery in politics and it was knavery to say that you could put everybody to work and that you could get £100,000,000 to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public are largely agitated at present owing to the decision to withdraw the subsidies on foodstuffs. <Col N="1699" /> The Government Party never mentioned, before the election, that they might do that but then, Parties never tell the truth at election times.  While there might have been some grounds for withdrawing the food subsidies there was no possible justification for withdrawing them in the case of people who are already in need, people in receipt of social benefits.  In getting back £5,000,000 or £7,000,000 the Government could have given back a small percentage of that to these poor people.  But what did they do?  They gave them a miserable 1/- a week.</P>
    <P>The average man will eat five or six loaves of bread every week.  He will eat a lb. of butter and use a half lb. of tea.  I do not use statistics.  I have heard them used here to-night and, while it is said that statistics do not lie, they are used in order to confuse. These people each eat five or six loaves of bread; they eat a lb. of butter and use a half lb. of tea in the week.  The withdrawal of the subsidies has cost them 2/8 or 3/- each per week and all you gave them back was a miserable shilling.</P>
    <P>The class of people to whom I refer could not afford to pay the increased cost of food due to the withdrawal of the subsidies.  Owing to that withdrawal, you have had a demand for a 10/- a week increase by employed persons.  An employed person may have £7 or £8 a week coming into him and he says that is not enough and that he wants an additional 10/- to offset the increase in the cost of living but the person who is in receipt of social benefit gets only 1/- a week. What does the Minister for Social Welfare propose to give those people now assuming that the employed person gets an extra 10/-?  Is he going to give them another shilling?</P>
    <P>Compare social benefits here with the social benefits in England and in Northern Ireland.  I wonder if it was put to the people of Northern Ireland that they could come in here if they wished, if England said to them that she would withdraw her forces and that they could have a free vote about coming in here, would they really vote to come in?  I do not believe that they <Col N="1700" /> would unless they were fools.  While I do not expect that social benefits here can be on the level that they are on in England, I do expect that the people who are in receipt of them here should get at least three-fourths of what they get in England.</P>
    <P>I am in touch with the people.  I do not come along and get on any platform but I know the people.  I mix with them and I know what they feel. I meet them in the corporation and I meet them in the streets.  Compare the benefits here with the benefits in England.  The single man there gets 30/- a week and old age pensioners there get anything from £2 to £2 10s. 0d. a week.  In addition, they can travel free on local bus services where the buses are owned by the municipality.  They get into cinemas at half price.  What do they get here? Nothing.</P>
    <P>I know this is not a rich country but I am pretty sure that we are living a little bit too high and mighty for a poor country.  I am not sure that we need so many Embassies and Consular Offices abroad and that we are getting value for the money we spend on U.N.O. I say, in the name of the people who sent me here, that I protest against the miserable 1/- a week that they got as a result of the withdrawal of the subsidies.  I am asking what the Government proposes to give them in view of the general increase in wages and in view of the fact that the price of commodities will rise again as a result of that increase, as they must.</P>
    <P>I am not tagged to my Party here. As a member of the corporation I am not tagged to any Party and I put down motions at that body without consulting my colleagues.  I do not consult anybody here.  I recognise that there are honourable men in all Parties. I recognise that the Taoiseach is an honourable man, I do not care what anybody else says.  I know politics from the bottom up.  That is one advantage I have over quite a number of Deputies here.  They came in at the top while I came in at the bottom.  I know we are not a rich country.  I know our difficulties.</P>
    <P>I know our difficulties about partition, and I want to protest that the Government seems to have no idea of <Col N="1701" /> a plan in that connection.  If there are people in the Curragh to-day the Government must take some responsibility for it.  It may be that the men who lead the Parties here have got too old. I know that there are back benchers who have got old sitting back in their seats, but the youth of to-day expects some encouragement and hope.  There is a patriotic outlook in this generation as there was in the past.  Patriotism did not cease to exist in 1921 and 1922.  Unless these young people get some hope and some lead they are going to go on an independent course. I considered that John Redmond was an honourable man and that he was doing his best for the country but, nevertheless, we ignored him and went out ourselves.</P>
    <P>It is time that the Government gave some lead.  It is all right saying that it is tough.  We know it is tough, but the present Government would have thought differently 20 or 30 years ago and they can now blame themselves that the young men of to-day are acting as they are.  We are up against it. If they were honest with those young men, maybe they would see there is some sense in what they are saying. We are giving no lead or no example. The result is that we will have this state of affairs now, in the next generation and in every generation.  If you are not able for it you should back out and let the young people in.  I know the difficulty.  I have learned my history.</P>
    <P>I did not come here to say much more except to make a protest on behalf of the people who sent me here.  I will say nothing further beyond this.  Do not ask the youth to come into politics if you are just going to keep them running around with a bucket and a pail of water.  Do not ask the people to live on a few pence, such as the miserable shilling you offered them recently when you took approximately 3/- each from their pockets.  Do not ask the people in the North to come in when that is what they would get.  Try and bring up the people who are down. Do that and the people will not be so suspicious.  In conclusion, I would appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare <Col N="1702" /> to keep in mind the people on social benefits and give them a rise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain things were particularly noticeable about the speech made this evening by the Minister for Finance.  It was perhaps the most complete vindication, not merely that has been given but that could have been given, of the economic policy put into force a year ago by the inter-Party Government and for which that Government, and I particularly, were assailed by Fianna Fáil.  They have now heard the Minister for Finance express here to-day the results of that policy in certain of the aspects to which he adverted.</P>
      <P>If it was a vindication, as it was, of our policy, it was also the most damning exposure of the hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil during the general election campaign of last year and previously. It was particularly noticeable that the Minister when speaking never once made any reference whatsoever to any plan, to any project, to any promise or to any speech made by him or any of his colleagues prior to the election that took place on the 5th March last.  It was particularly noticeable that he ran away from any attempt to justify, as Deputy Childers, the Minister for Lands, did earlier, the hypocritical promises, pledges and carrots that were dangled before the electorate last February and March.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan is now the Minister for Finance.  It is he who now controls the purse strings.  It was he who made a broadcast on behalf of Fianna Fáil during the General Election campaign and it was he who in that broadcast, in the implications of the words he used, deliberately got not merely hundreds, but many thousands, of farmers to vote for Fianna Fáil.  They did so in the belief that he was sincere, honest and honourable when he criticised the then existing price for wheat and impliedly made it clear, and was accepted as doing so by everyone listening to that broadcast, that if only Fianna Fáil were returned to power on the 5th March, there would be an increased price given for wheat for the 1957 season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> What did he say?  He criticised the previous cut in the price.  He said it was &ldquo;cruel and unjust to cut the price down to a level which farmers believed to be uneconomic.&rdquo;  He went on from that to say that a remunerative price would be fixed by Fianna Fáil for crops such as wheat.  What would anybody around the country think that was meant to be?  Was it not as clear an indication of a promise of an increased price for wheat by Fianna Fáil in 1957 as was ever made by any public man?</P>
    <P>In that broadcast he passed on to the Milk Costings Tribunal.  He accused the previous Government of vacillation and evasion by their spokesmen in relation to that tribunal.  Admitting the fatality in relation to the Department of Agriculture which we all sincerely regret, what has this Government done in relation to milk costings during its nine months of office?  Nothing.</P>
    <P>They would be better respected by the people if they were men enough to get up and say that the criticisms they were hurling against us, and against Deputy Dillon in particular, last year were unjustifiable and had no reality or honesty.</P>
    <P>The plain fact of the matter is that when in Government we did the hard, unpalatable things&mdash;the things that were bound to be unpopular&mdash;and that the present Government and the present Minister for Finance in particular are now reaping the benefit of the things we did.  That is undeniable in any analysis of our present economic trends.</P>
    <P>We had the twofold policy at that time of ensuring by a positive policy of production that we would be enabled to expand our exports to a level at which we would be able to afford a greater proportion of imports.  I was glad to hear the Minister for Finance saying that he had now been converted to the view we have held in this Party for a long time that the desirable thing from the economic point of view was to balance imports and exports at the highest possible level.  It is a long advance from the day Deputy Aiken said down in Athlone that it would be better for this country if all the ships were down at the bottom of the sea.</P>

      <P>It is a welcome conversion that they have now come along that road with us.</P>
      <P>During the course of the General Election campaign the present Taoiseach&mdash;Deputy de Valera as he then was&mdash;said in some speech that they would have to take care in relation to the balance of payments.  I remember prophesying, long before any person in Fianna Fáil ever took that line, that he need not bother.  I remember saying in February that he need not bother, that we had laid the basis and that, by virtue of the change in the balance of payments situation in 1957, we would be on a reasonably easy keel.</P>
      <P>We had done that because we had laid down a twofold policy&mdash;a positive policy of production which would ensure more exports.  Pending the time that that positive policy would take effect, the negative side of our policy, the policy of restricting imports on non-essential goods, had to operate. As I said, it is inevitable that that would not be too popular.  But there is no doubt whatever that the course we adopted at that time has shown dividends now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Government took office in March at a time when the trends in our external trade were already beginning to show and when it was already clear that we had turned the corner and surmounted the hump.  It is equally clear, and I think every economist and every administrator will admit that in relation to imports a Government can influence the flow of imports restrictively or in an expansionist way almost immediately but that in relation to exports it takes a very long time for a policy, comparatively speaking, to have effect in relation to those exports.  I think it would be fair, therefore, to say that in considering the position in the nine months that Fianna Fáil have been in <Col N="1705" /> office it is undeniable that in relation to exports during that period, and particularly bearing in mind the type of exports, that they had no hand, act or part, to a material extent, in the £22,000,000 by which exports have increased in that period.  Those exports are solely the result of the policy of the Government of which I had the honour to be a member.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Finance a few minutes ago suggest that the financial position with which he is faced at the present time is not satisfactory. No Minister for Finance ever likes to admit, particularly at this time of the year, that the Exchequer position is satisfactory.  What are the facts?  We find that there has been a revenue of £70,120,000 compared with £67,710,000 last year.  Deduct the special import levy in each case as going to capital and deduct motor vehicle tax as going to the Road Fund and the revenue alone is up by some £3,000,000, current revenue, that is to say, up to 23rd November last.  I would suggest that the Minister for Finance should take a little heart from that or perhaps he was, early or in advance, only trying to create propaganda for another tough Budget.</P>
    <P>The most damning thing in relation to the present Government, however, has been the manner in which they have failed completely to redeem any of their promises in relation to unemployment which they made during the last general election.  I listened to-day to the Minister for Lands, Deputy Childers, and he spoke about certain things&mdash;that they may have to be done, that they might be considered, that they require long thought and that the long term implications should be studied.  Everything that he put forward was put forward as a question mark, a policy which might be considered but he added they had not yet decided on what they ought to do. The only thing I could find they had decided upon definitely was that Deputy Childers had concluded that the Minister for Industry and Commerce's plan for £100,000,000 had definitely been thrown overboard.</P>
    <P>During the general election campaign <Col N="1706" /> when Deputies over there were seeking votes from the people, they were not saying that things had to be considered or that a policy had to be thought out; they were saying that they had a positive and complete plan, one that was ready to go into operation at once.  We have in this House members, who are not at present in the Chamber, from County Cork&mdash;Deputies Galvin and Healy and the Minister for Education.  I have here in my hand the leaflet that they issued in the last general election.  They did not say that Fianna Fáil were going to consider how to deal with unemployment. They came down flat-footed and said Fianna Fáil had a plan for full employment.  I should like to see the Minister for Education and Deputies Galvin and Healy coming into this House and going to the people of Cork, apologising for having misled them and for saying that Fianna Fáil had a plan whereas from what we have heard to-day it is quite clear they have no plan, whatsoever, different from that which we had initiated some 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, for example went down to Waterford and when speaking there he made it clear that the plans they had were not long term plans but plans that were going into complete and immediate operation. He went to Wexford and there made it clear again that their plans were ones for immediate employment. Even the Taoiseach said that Fianna Fáil's first objective as a Government would be to deal with the present serious unemployment position.  That was at Ennis on 24th February.  We remember the advertisement that was published in every newspaper &ldquo;This is the only issue&mdash;how to put our men and machines to work.&rdquo;  That was the advertisement that followed the initial speech of Deputy Lemass at Dundalk when he said these things would be done at once in relation to unemployment.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  I should like the Taoiseach, if he speaks in this debate, to give some explanation so far as his stewardship is concerned.  No Government ever got such an opportunity or <Col N="1707" /> such a chance as this Government. They came into power at a time when we had done the unpalatable things and they were able to reap the reward of those things.  In the first eight months they were in office they were given more co-operation than was ever given to any Government by any Opposition since the State was founded.  They were given the Estimates speedily and without great discussion because they made the plea that they wanted the time and the opportunity to settle down.  They were given even the Budget without an unduly protected debate and they were given the Finance Bill as well.</P>
    <P>They had a very different time, a very different task than, for example, the task given to me when, 14 days after I became Minister for Finance, they launched into an all-out assault to try to ensure that I would not be able to get down to doing the nation's work. We gave them every chance, every opportunity.  During this period they have shown they had no plans or, that if they had, they were keeping them a secret to themselves.  The results are tragic to behold.</P>
    <P>Louth, Meath, Kildare, Dublin, Wicklow and Monaghan represent a very cohesive chunk of our territory. In every one of those counties, according to the unemployment figures for October-November, there were more people unemployed, more people registering at the exchanges, than 12 months ago.  In the three Ulster counties that we have under our jurisdiction, if you want to take that territory for the purposes of a comparison instead, again there were more people registered as unemployed than in the equivalent period of last year.  That was after eight months of Fianna Fáil administration. In three out of four of the employment exchanges in Kildare, there were substantially greater numbers registered than in the previous year.</P>
    <P>We have that at a time when anybody who moves throughout the country knows that, during the past summer, there has been wholesale emigration on a scale and of a type <Col N="1708" /> never before known in this country. We never before had the experience of entire families packing up and going away.  We had seen, unfortunately, people going as individuals, sometimes perhaps followed by their families, but during last summer for the first time we have seen widespread emigration of entire families because they found out that there was nothing but hypocrisy in the promises that had been made.  Disillusionment came upon them when they realised what the Government were doing compared with the rosy promises made at election time.</P>
    <P>One cannot compare the figures of unemployment for one year with those for another without at the same time considering the position in relation to emigration.  I ask every Deputy on the other side if it is not true that there has been worse emigration from the parishes they know during the past six to eight months than there was, not merely in the equivalent period last year but in any similar period they can remember.  I would ask them if it is not true that there is scarcely a parish in Ireland from which whole families have not pulled themselves up by the roots and gone away because they have lacked any confidence or any hope in the future of our country, largely because of the type of propaganda the Fianna Fáil Party were prepared to use for the purpose of getting over to that side of the House.</P>
    <P>The September quarter of 1957 would be a suitable quarter to mention in relation to industrial employment.  If the present Government had a plan readymade as they told the electorate, surely that plan or policy should have been put into operation by them.  Yet in relation to that period there were some 2,000 fewer people employed in manufacturing industries than in the equivalent period last year&mdash;140,000 as against 142,000.  I know a number of other people wish to speak and I do not propose therefore to delay the House unduly to-night.  I want the Government to tell us, even at this late stage, what is their policy in clear and unmistakable terms.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a future for this country if only we can get a Government in office to ensure that they carry <Col N="1709" /> on with the economic policy we framed some thirteen months ago and that we then announced.  I want the Government to tell us, for example, what is their policy in relation to whether we are to have a high or low cost economy. We must have exports other than agricultural exports if we are to succeed. How can we get those exports if, by deliberate action of the Government, we have got into a situation, as we said we would last May, where we are going to have a high cost economy which will put our manufacturers in a comparatively worse state than before the Government took that action?</P>
    <P>I do not think the present Government know where they are going in this respect.  We warned them then that the result of the action they were taking was likely to lead to the situation in which we have started another spiral of prices chasing prices and wages chasing prices and the inflation which was bound to mean that we would be in a far more difficult position to compete with other countries for the exports which we so badly need for our own salvation.</P>
    <P>I commend for the study of Deputies the economic data issued by the Central Statistics Office on the 2nd of this month so that they can see what our actions were designed to do, unpopular and unpalatable though our task was, attacked and impugned as we were by Fianna Fáil.  Our work was designed to remedy the situation, to ensure that we would have sufficient reserves to avoid the mass unemployment that would have arisen if those reserves had been encroached upon unduly.  All the analyses of our economic statistics at the present time make it certain that we can claim the present Government got the opportunity presented to them but that they did absolutely nothing about it.  Their inaction has been noticeable even during this session of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>They have brought to the Dáil during this session practically no business of their own.  Bill after Bill discussed here have been Bills not merely prepared by us when in Government but even published by us before we left Government.  This Dáil has sat less in <Col N="1710" /> this autumn session than it has ever sat before in the same period and I venture to say, although I have not checked on the matter, that during the period of this session we have not had more than three working days in the Dáil in which business prepared by the present Government was fruitfully discussed.  Everything that was discussed, with the exception of two items, was business which we had prepared and publicised before leaving office.  So the Government are prepared to ride along on the work we have done. That will not do the country any good. That is not the way in which we should go into Christmas Recess.  If that is the position no wonder the Minister for Finance worries about future problems. If that is the position we are going down the hill from the happy position in which we left the country last March.</P>

      <P>The happy position in which we were left last March was that we had unemployment figures at about 86,000, that we had a deficit in our current Budget, that we had had a violent attempt to try to deal with a situation which should have been foreseen.  It was clear to everybody paying attention to the country's affairs that two or three years ago an economic blizzard was threatening us, but we had in office a Coalition Government, the members of which, when we tried to rectify the errors of their previous term of office, went round the country and pretended that every step taken by us to make the economic position right was something that was completely unnecessary.  When we warned about the position regarding our external reserves, the cry from every one of them was that we had huge foreign investments and that these should be repatriated.  It was an echo of what Deputy McGilligan said during the previous period when we were building up some of these assets&mdash;not that we wanted to do it at the time, but we were unable to get in products from outside&mdash;that we were only piling up a quantity of waste paper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>During that whole period of the first Coalition the people were told &ldquo;We have given you good times&rdquo;.  The period ended in our having a deficit in the external balance of payments of some £61,000,000 and also an unbalanced current account. We came in at that time to try to remedy the situation.  Large sums were being used in subsidies and we had a deficit of £14,000,000 or £15,000,000&mdash;I forget the exact figures now.  We could not get that by extra taxation, and we had to cut down on subsidies.  Because we did that we were told it was quite unnecessary, that it was cruel and unjust.  Every epithet that could be coined was used <Col N="1712" /> in trying to misrepresent the situation and in trying to get the people to think that burdens were being put on their shoulders that they should not have to bear.</P>
      <P>That was how we were met after the first Coalition Government when we tried to set the finances of the country right.  It was a difficult task.  But that was not the spirit in which we, when we were in the opposite benches, met the proposals of the former Minister for Finance.  We told him at that time that we understood the difficulties of the situation and, so far as we could, we tried to get the people to understand also.  But we pointed out that they were measures that should have been foreseen, that they were hasty and panicky and were causing an amount of unemployment which was not absolutely necessary.  We said that if the situation had been handled with prevision some of the difficulties need not have been imposed.  We did not go round the country telling people these steps were unnecessary or cruel or unjust or that the restrictions need not have been imposed or that the situation could be rectified without them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy could not have known then the way agricultural prices would go.  They pretend now after the event that they could foresee all the things that have happened since.  They could not.</P>
      <P>We believed at that time that some of the measures would not be effective. They very well might not have been.  I said previously, when we first succeeded the Coalition Government, that we were favoured not merely by the steps which we took and by the things which were done but also by good fortune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time, however, we had to face the position of an unbalanced Budget and we had to try to set the finances of the country right because unless that is done and unless external <Col N="1713" /> trade is set right there is no hope for the country.  That was only realised by the second Coalition Government when they had done everything they could to mislead the people about the unimportance of our external investments. It was better, however, to have a conversion at the end than not at all.  We came into office in a situation where there was a very great unemployment problem and a great emigration problem.  We have been talking about emigration here over a long period and it always happens that when we are in office emigration is the highest ever.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not true. It has been proved untrue time after time, when the statistics have come to hand.  In the period of the Coalition Government it was said that Fianna Fáil had the greatest emigration figures ever but when the statistics became available, when the census had been taken it was proved that the years in which it was claimed that emigration was highest were the very years in which the improvement was taking place and that the time when the Coalition was in office was the time in which the position worsened.  So far as any estimates I have been able to get show, the figures for emigration were rising during the whole time of the last Coalition Government.  What they are now I do not know, but I am very much perturbed about them&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know it is a serious position both in regard to unemployment and emigration and so far as I am concerned these would be the matters to which I would direct, as far as possible, all the attention of the Government.  We have been doing something in that respect: the figures show it.  We are told that the unemployment figures are not as good as in 1955, but we did not start from 1955 because one starts from where one finds oneself, and we found ourselves starting from where the Coalition put us.  There has been an improvement&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvement has been this, that in March when we came in the figure was 86,000, 16,000 more than in the same period of the previous year.  Now, it is some 4,000 less than it was at the same period last year.  I am told it is not the same as compared with the year before that, but we have to compare these figures with those for the year immediately preceding the point of time at which we came into office.</P>
      <P>We tried to remedy the situation as we found it.  We believed that the restrictions which had been imposed could be relaxed and that increased employment would result from that relaxation, without endangering the prime purpose of the steps taken by the previous Government to remedy the balance of payments deficit.  That relaxation did help.  The relaxation in the motor car industry and so on did help.  We tried to help in the case of the building industry.  In the nature of things, building is something which will diminish in the country as a whole. Housing needs have been substantially met throughout the country, but not so in Dublin.  There is still a problem here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me repeat now my conviction.  I have expressed it time after time.  I have always believed it was wise to embark on the policy upon which we embarked in 1932, a policy upon which the Government in office prior to that time did not embark.  It was wise to lay the foundations of good living here by providing decent houses.  I admit that perhaps, we may have gone a bit too fast.  Deputy Dillon spoke about the slums around George's Street and Hardwicke Street with which he was familiar as a boy. All these slum dwellings have been replaced by decent houses for our people.  I am glad of that.  These slums had to be removed at all costs. They were a disgrace and they would continue to be a disgrace to any people who, by joint effort, could get rid of them and failed to do so.  There were, however, cases where building took place where others might hold the view <Col N="1715" /> that it would have been better economy not to have made these improvements but to have established, rather, the foundations of expanding and thriving economy.</P>

It would be quite possible for an economist, divorced from politics or irrespective of political affiliation, to look over the expenditure of external reserves in the last ten years and say that a good deal of the money was not spent as wisely as it would have been had it been invested in productive enterprise. That is a statement which any person can quite reasonably make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything that was done was done towards achieving an excellent objective, and I stand by that objective.  I am quite willing to admit there may possibly have been, in the general effort, a too rapid expansion of the building industry, so rapid an expansion that when a sudden decline comes we are faced with the problem of diverting those hitherto engaged in building into alternative productive employment.  The fact is it was we who pursued that policy of house building and it is we who will have to bear the brunt of any adverse criticism of that policy.  In our time we built more houses than did any other Government.  We built and reconstructed more houses than any other Government.  It is true that, in our effort to provide good houses, we may have overstrained ourselves.  I can see economists coming along and stating that is so.  It is open to any economist to come along and say that we might have done better and established a sounder foundation had we <Col N="1716" /> diverted more of the money spent on housing into building up productive industry.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to talk about building up industry.  When we came into office originally there were very few industries here and, when we started out to develop industry, we were attacked by the Opposition and we were told that the development of industry was not in the farmers' interests. We believed it was then and is to-day in the farmers' interests to have manufacturing industries built up here.  They provide the farmers with a market for their produce and they provide occupation for those members of the family who cannot hope to remain on the land.  The two are interdependent. The development of our agriculture and the development of our manufacturing industries ought to go hand in hand.</P>
      <P>It was relatively easy at the beginning to establish industries.  We had the cream to skim off.  Now we have reached the situation in which the cream has been removed and so the situation is somewhat more difficult. But, as a result of our industrial development, we have doubled the numbers employed in industry during our period of office.  That is a good thing for the country.  It has been said that the people are leaving the land.  I do not think that we could have prevented that by any process.  Every person employed in industry to-day means one less forced to emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to buy from outside those things which are needed for our development here and we have to produce here the things that will buy the imports we need&mdash;the capital plant and the raw material.  We have two ways in which to do that.  We can do it through the medium of our agricultural exports, which offer the biggest and the best hope, and we can supplement those by our manufacturing industries capable of producing goods for export. We need both.  It is no use maintaining we can have one without the other. I believe, as I have always believed, that our agricultural industry is a fundamental one in conjunction with those manufacturing industries which <Col N="1717" /> can be based upon agriculture.  These are the most valuable in our particular economy.  They are the most economic forms of production and provide the best security in time of danger because there will be no necessity to import raw materials from outside.  But we cannot depend upon these alone.  We want the others as well.</P>
    <P>We came into office with the hope that we would be able to develop production in the agricultural industry to start with.  I have no doubt about it that we can do that.  With a little bit of co-operation and effort and understanding on the part of our farming community we can increase by 50 per cent. the agricultural output from our farms.  If we treat our grass lands properly we shall be able to increase our cattle and sheep population up to 50 per cent.  I have no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>We are continually being asked, as the former Minister for Agriculture asked, what is the use of increasing production unless you can get a remunerative market for your products. It is necessary to secure these remunerative markets, and a study of the possibilities of expanding our markets is as important as an all-out effort to try to increase production from the land.  In saying that I am not saying that we should wait for that alone.  I am not one of those who says that increased production must necessarily lead to lower returns but even if there was a reduction of prices it would have to be very big indeed to offset what could be gained by an increased volume of production.</P>
    <P>What we are aiming at this year is to see that our finances are all right. This year the balance of our external payments is right.  We do not know if it will continue to be so.  We had it almost right in 1954 but in a year or two the situation very quickly changed. We had an adverse movement in the terms of trade and other things which brought about a deficit, and the same thing could happen again.  The Minister for Finance was not manoeuvring about his Budget position for next year but he was pointing out to the members of the House and to the <Col N="1718" /> country the fact that, because we have obtained a balance this year, it is not to be taken that we will be able to do so next year.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that we are not out of the economic danger in which we found ourselves.  We have to proceed with the greatest caution.  There are no sums available for the Minister for Finance to give for relief works as he has been asked to do.  We simply have not got the money.  It is not available.</P>
    <P>When people talk about the subsidies they forget that money for subsidies has to be got in increased taxation, and increased taxation is detrimental to the probability of increased activity in industry.</P>
    <P>There has been a reference to the withdrawal of the subsidies this year and it was said that I had promised that there would be no change in the subsidy position.  What I said was that Deputy Norton, and others like him who were attempting to arouse certain fears, were not right.  I had no intention of removing the subsidies; neither had I the intention in 1952 of changing the subsidies.  We were up against the grim necessity of having to do it&mdash;the same type of necessity which Deputy Sweetman uses now to justify his action in putting into operation measures which reduced our imports.</P>
    <P>We had to abolish the subsidies, otherwise we would have had to get the money by increased taxation.  One Deputy spoke about the shilling by which social assistance payments were increased.  The fact is that £9,000,000 would have to be provided if the subsidies remained.  That meant £7,000,000 from the point at which withdrawal of the subsidies became effective.  There was a reduction of £7,000,000 in the subsidies this year but we tried to make matters easier for the poorer sections of the community.  We did try to help them and we were sorry that we could not do more.  We gave back £2,000,000 out of that £7,000,000 which reduced the saving to £5,000,000.  If we had given more, that saving would have been still less.</P>
    <P>We did that to a very substantial extent when the same issue arose in 1952.  In 1952 the position was that the <Col N="1719" /> people in whose interest these things were done saw what was taken off but they did not see what was given.  When we assumed office this year we were faced with a position in which the Budget for the year which has just closed, was unbalanced to the extent of about £5,000,000.  A deficit in one year can be got over but the position is different if there is a series of deficits, year after year.  We tried to get a balance but could not do it because the current was running against us. That current had been running against successive Governments every year on account of the increases in the public debt service and increasing costs, not due to any expansion in the services but due, for example, to increases in superannuation and increases of salaries, all of which go to add to our burden.  They add to our burden to such an extent that every year the increase in debt charges alone amounts to £2,000,000, which has to be met from taxation.</P>
    <P>Can anybody say where we could have got that £9,000,000, if subsidies had been retained?  What taxation would be put on in order to get it?  What would be the effect of that taxation on the people?  We took the subsidies off bread and butter simply because we could not get the money to keep them on.  I am willing to admit that Deputy Norton, who was a member of the Government at that time, had better opportunities of being able to foretell the financial difficulties and what financial necessity would compel us to do.  It is quite possible that it was on that basis that he was making his prediction during the last general election.  I do not think it was on that basis but rather on the basis of saying to the people that if his opponents were elected they would &ldquo;skin&rdquo; them.</P>
    <P>I had no intention of removing the subsidies and neither had I any intention of removing them in 1952.  Neither had we, as a Party, any policy or intention to do that.  We did these things because they were necessary.  I might as well say to Deputy Sweetman that when he came into office he did so because of promises that he could not put into operation.  I shall not say that <Col N="1720" /> Deputy Sweetman and his Party assumed office with the intention that they would restrict imports.</P>
    <P>Our policy, all the time, has been this&mdash;to try and get our people to build up our agricultural and industrial production.  That is where the prosperity of our country is to come from.  There is no other way.  If you try to go in a contrary direction, if you tell the people: &ldquo;Have a good time; do not worry; we have any amount of money; we can spend freely&rdquo;, then you are telling the people to do something which they will rue sooner or later.</P>
    <P>The people on the opposite side who spoke so much about sacrificing enterprises to the sacred cow of sterling, or whatever it was, have been brought down to earth.  They have now to go to the people and say there are no such things as these immense reserves.  A large portion of them has been used&mdash; whether on every occasion wisely or not is another matter&mdash;and to that extent are no longer available.  We have got to maintain reserves if we are not to get ourselves into a position in which we will have even greater unemployment and greater emigration than before.</P>
    <P>We are trying to get the finances and economy of this nation on a sound basis.  We will not do so by talk.  If eloquence and so on were to solve our country's ills, there is no doubt that the eloquence of certain members on the opposite side would have done it long ago.  It is not by those means we will succeed in our national task.  It is by acting on the simple but very important principle that we must earn enough to meet, on the one hand, our current expenses and, on the other hand, to make provision for such capital expansion as we need.  Savings, no waste, trying as far as possible to get expansion in production&mdash;these are the only ways in which we can hope to bring this country out of its present position.</P>
    <P>I have never had any doubt about our ability here to get for our people a reasonable standard of living.  We are told we are not as good as Britain. We used to hear a long time ago that we were not as good as the United <Col N="1721" /> States of America.  At other times, it was New Zealand that was held up to us as a model.  Before that it was Denmark or Holland.  We have a certain area.  We have a certain amount of productive land.  We have a certain number of people who are producing there and it is on these that the future of the country will depend and from these that the prosperity of the country will come.  I believe our resources are sufficient to give, at least to a population such as we have, a reasonable standard of living.  I do not say we can have a standard as high as the highest.  That depends on a number of circumstances, but I do believe that we can get the material resources for a decent living here in this country, if we set out to look for it and if we remember it cannot be all play and no work.</P>
    <P>We must all realise&mdash;those who are engaged in production, whether they be employer or employed&mdash;that it requires a big and intelligent effort to make a country of our size and resources a country where the material resources for a happy existence can be found.  I think it can.  We are working towards that in a steady way.  We have been told we have been doing nothing because we have not brought in here a plethora of Bills.  The activities of a Government are not confined to bringing in legislation.  I remember&mdash;I was not a member of the House at the time &mdash;reading of a Parliamentarian here who said that the best thing that could happen the country would be if the Dáil adjourned for six months, allowed the Executive to get after its immediate tasks and tried to see that the various services were carried out efficiently and that the programme was effectively carried out.  We are trying to work in that particular way at the moment.</P>
    <P>There must be a continuity in government.  Each successive Government when it comes in finds that certain measures have been advanced to a certain point by the previous Government.  For instance, it used to amuse us when we saw the Tánaiste of the day, Deputy Norton, going round opening factories and doing <Col N="1722" /> things that had just matured at the time but the foundations for which had been laid by the previous Minister. For example, there are schools being opened in our time that were planned during the previous Government, but this happens during every Government's term of office.</P>
    <P>There is continuity in government. A new board of directors comes in, so to speak.  Fortunately, the concern is a working concern and it continues on, either good or bad, up or down, according to the ability and the operations of the Government in office.  Sometimes something happens completely outside of the Government, something they could not have arranged for, claim credit for or bargain for.</P>
    <P>Take the example of the Agricultural Institute.  I do not know what precisely Deputy Dillon had in mind. The proposal had reached a certain stage when we assumed office in 1951 and I continued it because I believe that if programmes have been planned by a previous Government, it is in the national interest to continue them unless you have definite objection to them and unless you find they are fundamentally unsound or bad.  I advanced it to a certain stage.  Then the forces were too great for Deputy Dillon apparently, and as a result of discussions with outside bodies and so on, he had to change the whole fundamental plan.  We then found a new plan and the first thing we had to do was to make up our mind whether we would revert to the situation when we left office or whether we would take into account the position as it existed in March of this year.  I felt that, whatever my own predilections or prejudices might be, it was in the national interest to get the institute going as quickly as possible, although it is not the grandiose institute Deputy Dillon spoke about with his usual eloquence when he mentioned it first several years ago.  Then it was going to be the greatest Agricultural Institute in the world.  I am afraid that, on the foundation on which we are working now, he would not be able to boast like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will do good for the country.  I hope we shall get co-operation because it does depend fundamentally on getting the proper co-operation.  If there is an attempt by some of the interests who would be concerned to act selfishly and not for the general good or the good of the institute, then it can be useless.  If, on the other hand, there is a desire for co-operation&mdash;and I take it that the change was made to try and win that co-operation&mdash;if that co-operation is forthcoming, then it can be and may well be even better than the previous plan.  But that remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>I take that simply as an example to show the way we approached these matters.  We did not say what some Deputies said when they came in first, that everything we did was just for demonstration purposes.  We have gone over the Bills prepared by our predecessors in every Department.  Every Minister has looked at them critically to see whether he was prepared to accept them as policy he would put before the Government for approval.  Wherever these Bills have come before the Dáil, they have passed through that process.  Each Minister has had to satisfy himself, if he is to bring in a Bill on any particular matter and for which the responsibility naturally rests with him, that the things it provides are in the national interest, and whether it is a sound Bill or not.  He has a good deal of work if he does his work, and I expect he does, conscientiously. He has to go over it as a proposal that is new to him, as it is indeed, new to him.  He has to go over it to see that he can stand over it as a Bill that would be approved by the Government.  We have, therefore, a number of Bills that have reached a certain stage and that have matured and they are there for putting through Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say again that in my opinion, anyhow, the activities of a Government are not to be judged simply by the number of Bills they bring <Col N="1724" /> before Parliament.  You must have a Bill of course if there is a new scheme or some new plan.  Then you have to bring in a Bill in order to get it into operation But what we need at present is not so much new plans as to make the foundation right, to see that we can, in our present position, make progress.  I believe we are doing that. I believe it has been done fairly successfully in the past eight months.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, when he says that the Minister for Finance is, at this stage, trying to frighten Departments into making economies or to clear the way for a future Budget.  The position is, to my mind, serious because I would regard it as a terrible thing if, after all our efforts, we were to have another deficit in our current account this year.  We have had a deficit year after year.  We hoped that the measures which we took this year were sufficient to ensure a balance this year.  If there is a deficit, it will be a heartbreak for me, at any rate, because I think whilst you can afford to have a deficit one year or two years, you cannot afford to have a continued set of deficits which means that you are borrowing and using up your past savings in order to meet your day-to-day expenses.  No individual family could live or no nation could live on that basis.  Although we have our external payments in order this year, we dare not face continued deficits in the balance of payments.  I think therefore that the Minister for Finance, in mentioning the dangers that are present, is not trying to cry &ldquo;Wolf, wolf!&rdquo;  or anything of that kind.  He is simply trying to face the situation as he sees it.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Dillon I only regretted I had not got his artistic oratory, and would be inclined to ask myself &ldquo;Upon my word, am I dreaming?&rdquo; He was claiming, on the other side of the House, as his policy, things which in fact had originated with us. He mentioned &ldquo;we&rdquo; in regard to housing.  If he meant the Dáil as a whole, certainly it was &ldquo;we&rdquo; because everything had to be done with the approval of the majority of the Dáil. <Col N="1725" /> If you look back on the history of the Fine Gael Party you will find they were not very oncoming when we were on the housing programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, mentioned a figure of about 380,000 tons of wheat and when I heard Deputy Dillon gloating that we had the greatest wheat production at any time in the history of this State, I said: &ldquo;It is wonderful.  It is delightful to hear Deputy Dillon talking about the great amount of wheat grown in this country when we were told at one time we could not get it grown at the point of a bayonet.&rdquo;  When we came into office first, 20,000 acres was all that was grown in this part of the country and we were told by the people on the opposite benches that it was wrong national policy to increase that figure.</P>
    <P>When I heard him talking about the limestone project, as one of the fundamental plans in the Fine Gael programme, I was amused because Deputy Dillon had to be driven into that scheme at the point of the bayonet.  Then I heard him talking about the land rehabilitation project&mdash; he has grand names for these things. We had a farm improvement scheme for which, on average, an annual sum of close on £400,000 had been provided in our time.  It was done in a very good way because it was associated with the relief of unemployment.  It was for giving employment directly on the land.  It was stopped and only when the £40,000,000 of the American Loan was available, did Deputy Dillon embark on what he called the land rehabitation project.  Grand fine words! We operated that project but, just as in the house building there may have been money well-spent and money ill-spent, so it was in that project.</P>
    <P>I have listened to Deputies talking quietly about that project.  They were not out to make political capital but were speaking privately amongst themselves. I heard Deputies talking of land on which large sums of money had been spent and which would not be productive.  We had said it was much better to start, if you are to get increased production, with land that will produce quickly.  Get quick results to start with and then go on to the <Col N="1726" /> marginal land.  That was the only difference there ever was between us on the idea of land reclamation.  We wanted to have any money that was available for spending spent so that it would produce results quickly and effectively.  Just as you might reclaim land, if you are hard up for land, from the sea at prohibitive costs, so also you can pay prohibitive sums for land that will not give returns.  That is particularly so if you do not secure that the necessary treatment is continued on that land afterwards.  The land rehabilitation project would not have been dreamt of even, were there not the £40,000,000 which was offered through the American Loan.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of good work has been done and some very bad work has been done, everybody will admit.  One of the things that should be carefully done is to see that any further expenditure in that direction will give good value for the money spent.  I do not know whether I should go over the bovine tuberculosis question again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point in the Fine Gael programme as put forward by Deputy Dillon was what he called the parish plan.  That was the idea of having, for two or three parishes, an advisory service available, an idea with which I had previously agreed.  Then there is the question of administration. To whom are these people to report? That is a very different matter from the general idea of having advisers locally who know their business and who would generally be able to give expert advice to the farmers in the locality.  With that idea I am completely in agreement; it is a good idea and I think it should be put into operation as soon as we can get the instructors with the requisite qualifications. But I am not satisfied and I never have been satisfied that the method of reporting, or of organisation, provided in the Parish Plan is the best.  I think we should not have two groups advising the farmers locally.  There should be co-ordination and, so long as we have county committees of agriculture, we should see that these people are provided and available to them and answerable to them.  I agree that the headquarters department ought to be there, that the recommendations they make should be made there and that they should be generally in touch with the Committees of Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wished to run over these points as I was challenged to do so.  We claim that most of the schemes had been initiated by us and Deputy Dillon was claiming that they, and any advantages that came out of them, were part of his policy.  I am dealing at the moment with the parish plan. I agree that the provision of qualified people to help local farmers is a good idea and I do not care who agrees or disagrees with that.  In regard to the method of reporting, however, are they to be answerable to the county committees of agriculture or to whom? That is another matter and I think a great deal can be said for having these people responsible to, and working immediately under, the control and direction of the county committees of agriculture and also helping to direct the activities of these committees.</P>
      <P>In regard to soil testing, we also stood for that and the Deputy forgets that back in 1945 or 1946, before the first Coalition Government came into office, the question of Johnstown Castle and its equipment was being considered. We had tried to get equipment from outside.  The Deputy spoke about seeing a bicycle wheel and a medicine bottle somewhere, but it must be remembered that the question of soil-testing is not a very old one and it had not been practised extensively in other countries before the war. During the war it was difficult to get equipment.  The fact, however, remains and it can be verified, that the importance of soil testing was recognised back in 1945-46 and that provision was being made to get equipment for Johnstown Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to bovine tuberculosis <Col N="1733" /> eradication we provided a special £100,000 this year to deal with old reactors that were spreading the disease.  That shows we were anxious to deal with that situation.  The only difference between us in matters of that sort is regarding the methods by which we shall get results most quickly. It is evident that this matter of the elimination of bovine tuberculosis is one of great urgency because in a few years it will seriously affect the prosperity of our cattle trade in the foreign markets.  It is really a question in that case of how we can get going quickly.</P>
    <P>As regards lime, Deputy Dillon's position is not nearly as sound as ours I think one of the men who pressed very strongly on that matter was Deputy Aiken whose views in regard to the importance of lime are well known.</P>
