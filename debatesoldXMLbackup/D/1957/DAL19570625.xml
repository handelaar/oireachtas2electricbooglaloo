      <P>Stud farms are not separately distinguished from other farms in the agricultural statistics, but it is estimated that there are about 750 farms on which one or more thoroughbred horses are kept.  The number of specialist stud farms included in this total is rather less than 70 and their estimated total area is about 40,000 acres.  A specialist stud farm in this context means a holding which is primarily utilised for the breeding of thoroughbred horses, and which is specially equipped in regard to buildings and paddocks for that purpose. Farms at which a few mares are kept for breeding but which are primarily used for other forms of agricultural activity are not regarded as specialist stud farms.  No reliable estimate of the number of persons engaged on these farms is, I regret, available.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will ascertain from the G.N.R. the reason for the breakdown in their passenger train system on Sunday, 16th June, 1957, which caused inconvenience and <Col N="1122" /> upset to so many people, and why arrangements were not made to have buses available at Amiens Street station when the seaside trains returned too late for the ordinary bus connections to Ballyfermot and other suburbs.</P>

      <P>The operation of G.N.R. train and bus services is the responsibility of the G.N.R. Board.</P>
      <P>I have, however, made inquiries and have been informed that the difficulties to which the question refers arose primarily from the fact that whilst the outward traffic was spread over the morning and afternoon, the vast majority of passengers sought return transport within a very short interval in the late evening.  The task of conveying some 19,000 inward passengers from 8.30 p.m. onward involved intensive working in which it was not possible to rectify the cumulative effect of delays at intermediate stations.</P>
      <P>All the board's road vehicles were fully employed up to a late hour in clearing the road traffic, but some assistance was provided by C.I.E. in conveying the late-arriving train passengers to their destinations.</P>

      <P>I am aware that cricket balls, in common with a wide range of other requisites for sports and games, are liable to an ordinary customs duty of 15 per cent. ad valorem (10 per cent. preferential rate) and also to Special Import Levy at 60 per cent. ad valorem (40 per cent. preferential rate). In the case of the ordinary duty there is provision for the issue of duty-free licences where recommended by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. There is no similar licensing provision in the case of Special Import Levy.  The question of the need for retaining the Special Import Levies under their various headings is kept constantly under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture what steps have been taken to deal with the large increase in the production of wheat and barley this season by the provision of proper drying and storage facilities; and, if no such steps have been taken, if he will approach the milling concerns in order to secure their co-operation in copying with the estimated increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of dealing with the grain harvest this year is under active consideration.  I have already discussed the question of the marketing of feeding-barley with representatives of the growers and I have arranged to see representatives of the provender millers and the barley purchasers next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards storage and drying facilities <Col N="1128" /> the Deputy is, no doubt, aware that a substantial increase in these facilities has been effected in the past three or four years.  It is estimated that 38,000 tons of storage and 3,500 tons per day of drying capacity in excess of that available for the 1956 harvest will be available this year. While the total drying and storage facilities should be sufficient to meet normal requirements this does not mean that there will not be local difficulties from time to time.  These problems will have to be dealt with as they arise but farmers themselves could help considerably by delaying threshing, where possible, and by making advance arrangements with the purchasers of their grain with a view to regulating deliveries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is true, as the Minister states, that considerably increased storage facilities have been provided, they have been provided in the main by co-operative societies. Would the Minister bring home to millers that the farmers feel that they have their contribution made when they increase production and that there is a responsibility on the milling interests to take their coats off and to provide the increased storage facilities that the output of this year's harvest would require?</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm the Provisional Order set out in the Schedule, i.e., the Wicklow County (Extension of Boundary) Provisional Order, 1957, which was made by my predecessor on 13th February last and which proposes the inclusion in County Wicklow of 78 acres of land at present in County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bray Urban District Council intend to make an application to the Wicklow County Council to include this <Col N="1135" /> area in Bray Urban District.  The estimated population of the transferred area is about 600 and the valuation about £1,850.  There are at present 130 houses belonging to the Bray Urban District Council and 12 private holdings in the area.</P>
    <P>Under the existing law, i.e., Section 10 of the Local Authorities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1936, an urban district council which is not a borough may at any time apply to the council of the county in which it is situate for an Order under the section altering the boundary of the urban district in the manner specified in the application.</P>
    <P>To enable the urban council to initiate their application to the Wicklow County Council, it is necessary first to bring the land in question into Wicklow County.  The step of transferring the land from the Wicklow County Health District to the Bray Urban District Council under Section 10 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1936, will be a separate matter and will involve the usual procedure of discussion between the county council and the urban district council, advertisement, right of aggrieved parties to make their objections to me, and so on.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the present Provisional Order was fully discussed at a public inquiry.  Dublin County Council was represented at that inquiry and raised no objection other than matters relating to the ownership of water pipes and consequential financial adjustments.  The Provisional Order does not affect local authority property rights in the area and financial adjustments are outside the scope of the Order.  Those adjustments will be made subsequently under the provisions of the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1988, either by agreement or by arbitration.</P>
    <P>The Provisional Order contains the usual provisions in relation to the preparation of maps, the continuance in effect in the added area of resolutions, orders and notices of the Dublin County Council which are not inconsistent with the terms of the Provisional Order, arrangements regarding <Col N="1136" /> jurors, areas of jurisdiction of coroners, valuation lists, registration of electors and saving from disqualification of members of the Dublin County Council who, by reason of the transfer of the area, may cease to be local government electors for that county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Dáil adjourned on Wednesday afternoon last, I was dealing with the affairs and administration generally of that section of the Department of the Gaeltacht known in this country and in other countries as Gaeltarra Éireann. <Col N="1137" /> For the benefit of the House, I might state briefly that Gaeltarra Éireann activities include the production of knitwear, tweeds, toys, certain types of school bags and linen, mainly embroidered. This industry, as I have already stated, had its beginnings in the days of the old Congested Districts Board.  The centres of the knitwear and crocheting industries have largely been the same ever since.  There have been cases where new centres have been set up and where the labour content in certain of them has increased from time to time.</P>
      <P>There have also been cases, particularly recently, where the labour content, especially in the knitwear industry, has declined with a fall in production. In the course of the Minister's opening statement, he used a rather queer statement, having regard to replies given to parliamentary questions put down by me in relation to the labour content of the knitwear industry and in relation to production. On page 3 of his opening statement, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The position is not quite so satisfactory in the cases of the knitting industry and the toy industry and special consideration will have to be given in these industries in order to gear production to market requirements.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is true, of course, that the Minister did not use the expression &ldquo;gear up&rdquo; or &ldquo;gear down&rdquo;.  He was content to say &ldquo;gear production to market requirements&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first essentials in the gearing of production to market requirements&mdash;I take it the objective would be to increase production and to seek bigger, better and wider markets for that production&mdash;is the appointment at once of a production manager.  The last Gaeltarra Éireann production manager died in or around 1953.  He has not been replaced, except in the queer way of giving an already fully occupied official of that Department&mdash;the tweed designer&mdash;something like £300 a year extra as acting production manager. Such a state of affairs in relation to production is not, in my opinion, calculated <Col N="1138" /> to improve production in any way, particularly where the management, control and inspiration for higher production is in the hands of a man who must already be over-occupied at his own job of designing.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell the House what exactly he means by gearing production to market requirements. Does he mean a continuation of what is in operation at the moment in these centres where production has been decreased by reason of the fact, as stated by the Minister in reply to several parliamentary questions to me, that the sales of this material were not as great as the amount produced?</P>
    <P>In the main, the girls who work in these centres work hard.  The manageresses in charge of them work equally hard.  Many of these centres in the remote Gaeltacht districts are devoid of the amenities to which the manageresses were accustomed before going there.  In my opinion, their work there is to a very large extent vocational, having regard to the small amount of money they earn.  Of course, the girls who work in these industries enjoy the advantage of having them near their homes and it meets with the overall desire not alone of this Parliament but of the whole of the country to keep as many as possible of these girls at home.</P>
    <P>I understand that within the past couple of months in centres of which I have personal knowledge certain of these girls have been allowed to go. Some have left of their own accord, but, significantly enough, their places have not been filed.  Where did they go?  Did they seek employment in other types of work?  They did not.  They emigrated.  All of it is due to the fact that what they produce, according to the official replies given to me and information at my disposal, is not being sold as widely and in as large quantities as it might be.  When I was in charge of this Department, it was, as I think it could reasonably be said now, in its infancy.  Long before the Department was set up and long before I ever knew that I would be put in charge of it, there were certain happenings in relation to Gaeltarra <Col N="1139" /> Éireann, its management and control that merited, to say the least of it, inquiry.</P>
    <P>The system of sales for Gaeltarra Éireann is conducted partly by established civil servants and partly through agents who are not civil servants, but who are employed on a commission basis and who are allocated certain areas.  In addition, they are sometimes, as I hope to point out in detail, confined to certain articles.  For instance, in the City of Dublin, there is one agent for tweed alone.  There is another agent for linen and knitwear.  There are two other agents.  The City of Dublin agent for linen and knitwear has the Counties Dublin, Louth, Meath and Wicklow.  The remaining 22 counties are divided&mdash;I speak from recollection now&mdash;almost equally between the other agents&mdash;one for the south-west and one for the north-west and west.</P>
    <P>It will, I am sure, be a matter of some interest for Deputies to know the wages paid in these centres.  I do not propose to go into them in any great detail.  I just want to give the House and the country an idea of how this industry that is so long on its feet is now in a position to let workers go and at the same time try to keep them working.  I am satisfied that the rates of pay are not adequate to meet living costs imposed upon these people.  They are certainly not the wages that would entice our people to stay at home.</P>
    <P>In the knitting centres, the rates of pay of the workers, excluding those in respect of whom the details will be found in the Book of Estimates, are as follows.  Those who work machines get 1/5½ per hour, if they are of average standard.  Those who work circular machines get 1/7 an hour.  The same standard is applied.  Hand-knitting is paid at the rate of 6d. per hour; crochet work, 5½d. an hour; winding, a penny, 1¼d., or 1¾d. for two ounces of yarn, according to the kind of yarn.  In the finishing centre at Tourmakeady in County Mayo, the rates are based on age and the service of the worker rising to a maximum rate of £3 15s. per week to each worker on reaching 21 years of age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> In the crochet centre at Bruckless, the position is something better.  The assistant supervisor in charge of the crochet work gets £4 10s. per week.  In regard to the linen and embroidery centres, girls work at piece-rates based on 6d. an hour.  For finishing, washing, pressing, and so on, again girls are employed and, again, for time rates based on age and service the wage rises to £3 15s. per week for all workers on reaching the age of 21.  For the purpose of the criticism which I propose to offer of the administration and management of this section of the Department, I should like Deputies to bear in the mind the princely figures earned by our girls whom we exhort week-in and week-out to stay at home in their own country.  Everybody knows, on looking at the Book of Estimates, what is earned by the Civil Service section of this industry. Salaries generally are not very high except for those holding superior executive positions and then, even with bonuses, I think you will not find any of them reaching £1,700 a year or so&mdash; all of which is known and subject to whatever inroads can be made upon it by the Revenue Commissioners in each year.</P>
    <P>Let us move, then, from the wages paid to the workers and the salaries paid to the civil servants on to the commission earned by the agents.  There is one agent for the whole of the country and for Great Britain for toys. Admittedly he probably employs subagents or travellers.  However, I will take the years 1952 to 1956 and give the House and the country the total commission paid to these agents for work which I shall submit and, I hope, prove, is very inadequately done&mdash;and it is no wonder it is inadequately done because when a man reaches a certain figure by reason of income-tax, surtax, and all the rest of it, there is very little incentive to go any further.</P>
    <P>In the year 1952, the agent for toys received £2,710 in commission.  In 1953 he received £5,042.  In 1954 he received £5,948.  Who would be Taoiseach of this country when there are vacancies for agents as profitable as that?  In 1955 he received £5,137.  In 1956 he received £3,874.  Deputies might do <Col N="1141" /> well now to look at the series of questions I have been directing to the Minister for the Gaeltacht in English for the very special reason that this is a matter that affects the nation as a whole, affects our export trade and affects various facets of the lives of our people The questions were answered in Irish.  The Minister is perfectly entitled to do that.  However, as this section of the Department would like, the import of the answers given in Irish would not be felt so widely.</P>
    <P>The sales agent for linen and knitwear in the City of Dublin and the Counties of Dublin, Louth, Meath and Wicklow for the year 1952 drew as commission £4,016.  In the year 1953 that same agent drew £1,766.  In 1954 he drew £2,125.  In 1955 he drew £3,200 and in 1956 he drew £2,766.  The agent for the southern counties in the same years earned £2,329 in 1952; £2,006 in 1953; £2,607 in 1954; £3,036 in 1955 and £3,436 in 1956.  The western agent was not there in 1952.  He started in 1953 and earned £2,101.  In 1954 he earned £2,415.  In 1955 he earned £2,775 and in 1956 he earned £1,994.</P>
    <P>The tweed agent for the City of Dublin does not do the work.  He is ill.  He does not employ anybody to do the work for him.  There is no necessity for him to do it because he is supplied with a member of the existing staff of Gaeltarra Éireann, a warehouseman, who draws his salary from Gaeltarra Éireann as a ware houseman and gets a certain percentage of the commission.  How can a warehouseman do the job of the other man and draw commission in respect of it and probably be told he is part-time and, at the same time, draw his full salary for the job at Westland Row?  That is something that may interest Deputy J. Murphy, particularly, having regard to the questions on the Order Paper to-day about people in certain established jobs getting part-time work elsewhere.  That is something which I am sure will interest fair-minded Deputies on the Government side of the House.</P>
    <P>In 1952 this tweed agent for the City of Dublin earned £655.  In 1953 he earned £1,908.  In 1954 he earned £4,242.  You will find people in this <Col N="1142" /> country who will tell you that Deputies are too well paid.  In 1955 the figure for this agent's earnings was £3,306 and in 1956, it was £2,239.  He did not do a bat in that year; he did not employ anyone in the strict sense of the word.  Admittedly, a little of his commission was taken away, but these commissions are very high.</P>
    <P>I know agents travelling for tweed firms and linen firms whose commission is barely over one-fifth of what the agents of Gaeltarra Éireann are paid. I know one particular man, travelling for a most reputable firm in this country, who gets 1 per cent. commission. Gaeltarra Éireann agents get 5 &mdash;at least 5.  There was one case where it was 6¼ until it was reduced recently, in the words of the Minister, to bring it into line with the others&mdash; but only when attention was drawn to it.</P>
    <P>We have an agent in Germany for Gaeltarra Éireann and in 1952 he drew £856; in 1953, £4,581; in 1954, £4,047; in 1955, £6,326; and in 1956, he is down to £1,387.  We have an agent in America.  In 1952, he earned £1,721; in 1953, £2,453; in 1954, he is down to £909; in 1955, he is up again to £1,769; and in 1956, he received £4,902.  People who say that they are losing faith in this country should take heart.  There are great jobs here&mdash;great jobs.</P>

      <P>The amount received from the sales of knitwear in 1942-43 was £100,416.  That figure has remained more or less static down the years, sometimes going above £100,000, sometimes going below it, until in 1956-57, it reached a total of £124,546.  Having regard to increasing prices, in 14 years that is the increase in production&mdash;is it very appreciable?</P>
      <P>Linen has shown a fairly good increase, starting at £4,746 in 1942-43 and ranging up, and down occasionally, to a total of £20,225 in 1956-57.</P>

    <P>Tweed is the product in regard to which a remarkable increase is shown and it is a tribute to those responsible, particularly the weavers, particularly the workers who work for small wages <Col N="1143" /> and who turn out tweed of such design and standard and quality that it has increased its market from £51,110 in the year 1942-43 to over £262,000 in the year 1956-57.  Toys have shown some increase but not very much.</P>
    <P>The standard trade discount allowed on knitwear over the whole country is 13 per cent.&mdash;that is, where goods are standard and of the recognised Gaeltarra Éireann quality&mdash;which, when the goods are standard, is very good.  In reply to a question last week or the week before the Minister told me that these knitwear goods were divided, upon examination by experts, into three classes&mdash;standard, which would be sold in the ordinary way less 13 per cent. trading discount; substandard but saleable; and substandard and unsaleable.  Now, we can ignore altogether the &ldquo;substandard and unsaleable&rdquo; because no price is put on it.  The Minister tells me, in a parliamentary reply, that the substandard and saleable is priced and the agents are informed of its general quality and the price&mdash;which, I take it, is either a lesser price than that for a standard quality or a higher percentage trading discount is allowed on substandard goods.</P>
    <P>Deputies&mdash;and the country&mdash;will be surprised to know that perfectly good standard Gaeltarra Éireann knitwear was invoiced from the Gaeltarra Éireann headquarters, the invoices being initialled by the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann, at the price stated, less 13 per cent.  That, in itself&mdash;an invoice bearing the price, bearing a trading discount less 13 per cent., signed by the management of Gaeltarra Éireann&mdash;means only one thing, that those are standard goods.  As I said, Deputies will be shocked to know that while these girls are working for 1/5½, 1/7 and in some cases for 6d. an hour, standard goods of Gaeltarra Éireann were being sold as substandard and a percentage reduction trading discount given on them as high as 25 per cent. and in some cases even higher.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to believe that.  That might happen for a little while in the <Col N="1144" /> average business house, but the management of an averagely well run business house upon discovering it would, I feel sure, get rid of the sources of the evil.  But when you find that this section of the Department, which is politely referred to here each year as a social service, when you find civil servants in this country, where civil servants enjoy an extremely high reputation for honesty and integrity and for fearless concept of duty at all times, turning the blind eye&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>When you find the Minister standing over that kind of conduct, what are we to expect?  I shall not delay the House with long and detailed examples but I want to quote a few instances of the type I mentioned. I forgot to tell the House when dealing with the agents that they sign a letter of acceptance of their appointments in which there is a variety of stipulations.  Paragraph 4 of a letter of appointment, dated 12th May, 1952, the terms of which were accepted by the linen and knitwear agent for the City of Dublin, the County of Dublin and Counties Louth, Meath and Wicklow, says: &ldquo;You will have to fulfil the duties imposed on you from time to time by order of the Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo;&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary was in control then&mdash;&ldquo;as duties suitable for the post and you will always have to pay due heed to the directions of the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann with regard to your duties, with regard to the sort, amount and area of sales inside your agent's district and with regard to any arrangement that may be necessary regarding trade with any particular customer.&rdquo;  I take that simply to mean that the person appointed would have to do the job under the directions of the manager or management generally of Gaeltarra Éireann and that any arrangement with a customer would be dealt with beforehand by the agent with the management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> While I am on that letter of appointment I can also tell the House that paragraph 8 stipulates that the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;the Minister now&mdash;&ldquo;can put an end to the agency at any time by giving three months' notice in writing, but in cases of misconduct the Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo;&mdash;the Minister now&mdash;&ldquo;can end the agency without notice and without stating a reason.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my view it is misconduct if a substantial amount of goods, invoiced less 13 per cent. and obviously standard, are sold at a discount of 25 per cent. It is misconduct not to approach the management or those responsible beforehand prior to making any such arrangement with any customer.  These positions are whole-time positions and an agent doing his work must of necessity give a great deal of time to it, so much so, in my view, that other avocations followed by agents would interfere considerably with the carrying out of their work as whole-time agents.</P>
    <P>I found that to be the case.  I found that the agent for the City of Dublin and the four counties I have already mentioned is, on his own telling, the sole owner and sole director&mdash;there will be play about &ldquo;sole owner&rdquo; and &ldquo;sole director&rdquo; here&mdash;of a firm trading in the same goods, trading abroad and in certain instances trading at home in this market, contrary to the conditions upon which he gets the goods from Gaeltarra Éireann for his company.</P>
    <P>In additions to the figures I have mentioned by way of commission there is a company, the name of which is well known to the Minister, in which this agent has an interest.  When the Minister told me in reply to a parliamentary question that he was not satisfied that he was the sole owner of that business, that another director had been elected on the 19th December last, I could hardly believe that the Minister&mdash;not by himself, but by some official&mdash;would not have taken the same steps that I took and gone to the company office and found out that this company was originally a company of 9,000 £1 shares, 4,500 held by an Englishman and the other 4,500 held by this agent on the 10th December last.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the agent, it should be <Col N="1146" /> stated that he notified Gaeltarra Éireann that he was now sole owner, but the Minister must take advantage of a technicality in company law to find that he is not because on the 19th December the English partner's 4,500 £1 shares were transferred to the Dublin agent and the secretary of the company in this proportion&mdash;4,499 £1 shares were transferred to the agent, who already held 4,500 shares, and in order to comply with the technicality of the Companies Acts one £1 share was transferred to the secretary of the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells me the agent is not the sole owner; there was another director elected on the 19th December, the Minister says with great solemnity.  The position now is that of the £9,000 capital of that company the knitwear and linenwear sales agent for Dublin City and County and Counties Louth, Meath and Wicklow has 8,999 shares and the little girl in the office has one £1 share.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the agent is not the sole owner, not the sole director.  The agent himself told me personally that he was; he informed Gaeltarra Éireann that he was but of course he must be covered at all costs, and, mind you, I do not blame the Minister for this.  I want to be fair to him.  He has been acting as Minister for the Gaeltacht since 20th March and I believe that the present Minister had not a free hand in the matter of this agent whom I dismissed for misconduct as a result of an official inquiry held by the officials of the Department and competently superintended by the permanent head of the Department.  He had not got a free hand; he got a direction because this agent, who earns this princely sum by way of commission, was able to persuade people in high places that he was dismissed because of political prejudice. If it was political prejudice I want to put it on the records of this House that the action I took was agreed to by the staff of the Department.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the Minister allowed himself to be handled in this way, to make a decision against what must have been the best advice <Col N="1147" /> offered to him in the Department. When I took the step the permanent head of the Department agreed with me.  There was only one detail on which another member did not agree. He felt that the agent should have got a month's notice.  When it came to the handling of public moneys, as they were handled in this case, I was satisfied that a month's notice would be too generous a treatment for that kind of conduct.</P>
    <P>When you sell standard goods in one area, say in Dublin City, to the big houses, as they have been sold at a trade discount of 25 per cent. and the man from the West, or the man from the South, sets out to sell his wares less 13 per cent., what does he find?  He finds that his area has been flooded by the Dublin houses who got the wares less 25 per cent. or some higher percentage than 13 per cent. and the agent for the area cannot sell it less 13 per cent.  The Minister had evidence in his Department of a complaint from the southern areas sales agent, complaining that he could not sell Gaeltarra Éireann knitwear in the South of Ireland because the Dublin houses were able to sell it at a lower price.  That is the position that obtained prior to the inquiry I held into this matter.  I was precluded from having this inquiry as exhaustive as I should have liked, owing to the limited time at my disposal and to the fact that we were thrown into a general election when the inquiry was actually going on.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of what I mean and of what I am stating positively to be true.  On the 15th March, 1955, a Dublin firm was supplied with 2,160 garments for £2,580, less 13 per cent.  On the 28th March, 1955, an invoice was sent to the same firm for 1,196 garments at a cost of £1,138 1s., less 13 per cent.  On the 31st March, 1955, there were invoiced to the same firm 1,120 garments, £932 1s. 9d., less 13 per cent.  The latter two of those invoices were initialled by the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    <P>Those three transactions were on the 15th, 28th and 31st March, 1955.  On the 18th June, 1955, three months later, you find the first reference to a claim <Col N="1148" /> from this particular company for 25 per cent.  Note well, the goods went out as standard goods less 13 per cent. trading discount in March.  In June the company asked for a special discount of 25 per cent.  That is the first hint.</P>
    <P>Not until the 19th July, over a month later, did I find a query from the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann written down.  It is there in black and white for the Minister: &ldquo;Ask&rdquo;&mdash; I am not using this man's name&mdash;&ldquo;the City of Dublin knitwear agent what this is all about?&rdquo;  On the 27th July, 1955, a strong letter, that is how it is described, was received in the office from the sales agent for the southern area complaining that the garments, the same type of garments, were to be found in his area at a lesser price than he could sell them.</P>
    <P>Does the matter end there?  Is the company's claim for this special higher percentage rejected or is it allowed then and there?  There is no record of any further inquiry being made with the company.  The only record is: &ldquo;Ask the agent what is this all about?&rdquo;  The manager must have asked the agent and the agent must have told him, because we find on the 13th September of that year a memo from the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann that this special discount be allowed by reason of the fact that these goods were substandard.</P>
    <P>Here are goods the invoices for which went out, two of them signed by the manager himself, and marked less 13 per cent.  There was no question of their being substandard and it is significant that when the company claimed the special discount they did not say that the goods were substandard. I accept the explanation given by the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann to me personally, in the presence of the senior officials of the Department, when he told me that this higher percentage had been offered by the agent without prior authority.  Why should a man who initialled invoices for standard stuff less 13 per cent., in March of 1955, six months later enter a memo. in the particular file saying, and specifying these garments by their trade numbers, that they were substandard, that he examined them himself <Col N="1149" /> and asked the agent to sell them as best he could?</P>
    <P>On being questioned about that the manager agreed that he had no means of verifying whether they were substandard or not.  In addition to that, and to lend support to the view that these garments were not substandard, the southern areas sales agent positively stated to me, in the presence of the senior officials of the Department, that the garments for sale in his area at a lesser price than he could offer them, were not substandard nor were they faulty in any way.</P>
    <P>The House, I hope, will get a more detailed explanation from the Minister in relation to those three items than he has given to me in reply to a parliamentary question put by me when he said he was satisfied that the higher percentages were authorised by the management.  Technically that is correct. Technically they were authorised by the management but they were authorised by the management in retrospect.  They were authorised by the management under duress from this agent.</P>
    <P>The manager of Gaeltarra Éireann, who by the way is not now doing his regular duties, told me that he was somewhat under the influence of this particular man.  The Minister, in reinstating this man, put somebody back into Gaeltarra Éireann with access to Gaeltarra Éireann stores, with access to Gaeltarra Éireann employees, and who, admittedly, is a man who is able from time to time, and has been doing it down the years, to coerce the management into doing what he wants.</P>
    <P>The amount of extra discount that was given on those three orders to this Dublin firm in March, 1955, is £332 8s. 4d.  That, scattered over a few of the centres where girls work for 6d. an hour, might have made some little difference to them and their economic happiness.  The Minister knows&mdash;he has it on record&mdash;that there was only one officer of this Department who challenged this kind of thing.  Significantly enough, that officer is not in the Department of the Gaeltacht now; he was allowed to leave.  I would commend the Minister, and ask him to <Col N="1150" /> commend it in turn to his successor, to examine the closed borough that is Gaeltarra Éireann.  Men come; they rarely go&mdash;they are rarely let go&mdash;but the officer who challenged these percentages has gone.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister in a parliamentary question the reasons for giving a higher percentage discount than 13 per cent. to certain Dublin traders and who they were and he gave me the name of this Dublin trader who got the three consignments in March, 1955, and the Minister had in front of him the admission of the manager that he was forced to do it by reason of this agent's &ldquo;strong character&rdquo;&mdash;as the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann put it&mdash; and by reason of the fact that he was a good customer of Gaeltarra Éireann. I will tell the House and the country how good a customer he is of Gaeltarra Éireann and how he has every reason to be, because of the facilities he gets from moneys over which the Minister has charge.</P>
    <P>I could set up a company to-morrow morning if I knew that I was going to get almost unlimited credit from a Government-sponsored company and that I did not have to pay, except in rare cases, until I got my own money in. Will the Minister tell this House how much at this very moment is owing to the accounts of Gaeltarra Éireann from this company which is virtually owned by the present agent whom the Minister reinstated because the Minister's standards of misconduct and my standards of misconduct do not happen to coincide?  Let me add that I believe that, in his heart of hearts, the Minister's standards and my standards are the same, but he has been fooled in this case and he is trying to make the best of it now.</P>

      <P>I shall be interested in the reply and I ask Deputies to take note of the three consignments in March, 1955.  The Minister has told me in black and white in the Dáil Reports that the reason higher percentages were given was that the goods were substandard when he had the evidence before him of the then manager&mdash;I do not know what this man is now&mdash;that these goods were not, in fact, substandard, that he had no means of verifying it, that it was six months afterwards, but that he did it by reason of the &ldquo;strong character&rdquo; of the agent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have heard me reading out the commission paid to agents.  I do not know what the profit on tweed is, but, since 1946 up to date, Gaeltarra Éireann has supplied this firm of which this agent has 8,999 shares out of £9,000 capital, with £250,206 worth of tweed, on condition that he sells it in the foreign market. The House will be told that he did not sell it in the home market except in one instance: it is common knowledge that this agent sells, not alone tweed, but all the wares of Gaeltarra Éireann, not alone in his own area, but in the other agents' areas, and that he sells tweed all over the country.  It is common knowledge among the trade, and Gaeltarra Éireann has lost custom over this practice.  One sales agent stated <Col N="1152" /> to me in the presence of senior officials of the Department of the Gaeltacht that his commission in 1956 dropped by £800, by reason of the fact that he failed to get the orders he had got before from people who resented Gaeltarra Éireann goods being available in the area cheaper than they could buy them from him.</P>
      <P>It is very easy to do business to the tune of a turnover of £250,000 with one customer, and to be a good customer when you have unlimited credit.  I want the Minister to tell us the amount of money owing to date to Gaeltarra Éireann by this firm which is owned by this agent.</P>
      <P>Gaeltarra Éireann use a certain amount of linen for processing and embroidery.  Nobody knew better than the knitwear and linen agent for the City of Dublin and surrounding counties the quality of that linen and the kind of linen that Gaeltarra Éireann used.  Last year, this agent sold&mdash;I will use the word &ldquo;sold&rdquo; for the moment&mdash;a quantity of linen of a quality and type which was never before used by Gaeltarra Éireann and which would never be used by them and succeeded in getting from the management of Gaeltarra Éireann a credit note for tweed to the tune of £109. That linen would be resting in Gaeltarra Éireann's stores to-day as unsaleable, were it not for the fact that there are a few people in Gaeltarra Éireann who do not close their eyes to things like that.  He was made take it back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the man the Minister reinstated and that is a transaction in relation to which the permanent head of this Department thought fit to visit a very severe punishment on the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann.  The Minister, I take it, will not deny in his reply that the manager was so punished financially. However, the man who was able to coerce that unfortunate official into taking an article that was dud and getting for it a credit note for over £100 towards his own account has been allowed back into the environs of that organisation again, and if I might say so, goes back stronger than he was before, because he now feels that he has backing because he was able to <Col N="1153" /> persuade somebody in high places that his dismissal was a political dismissal. I know it went out to Government Party supporters all over the country that the dismissal was a political dismissal. From the few facts that I have put forward already, is there anybody on that side of the House now who will say it was a political dismissal?  I see people over there who are in business; I see people who teach the Catechism to the children of this country.  What do they think of this transaction?</P>

      <P>In the course of this inquiry which I held&mdash;and it was conducted by the permanent head of the Department&mdash;certain figures were supplied. These figures were challenged by this agent as incorrect and there again we have the rather curious position of a man who was able to challenge <Col N="1154" /> official figures compiled by a reputable official, so reputable, in my opinion, that I put on record in the Department before I left my appreciation of him.</P>
      <P>This agent has now been put back by the Minister into a position where he can bully and intimidate these men who are trying to do their duty under very difficult circumstances.  It is, of course, extraordinary that in the course of that inquiry the recollection of certain people was very faulty.  I do not believe now, any more than I did then, that all this substandard racket was going on without the knowledge of people who pretended they did not have such knowledge.  It might be asked why this agent does no business in the Counties of Wicklow or Dublin.  I can accept the position that in County Dublin the people would go into the bigger Dublin wholesale houses; I do not accept that position for the Counties of Meath, Louth or Wicklow.  Of something over £3,000 commission in the past year, £22 odd was in respect of orders in County Louth, £1 15s. 10d. in respect of County Meath, none for County Dublin and none for County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>Still, the Minister tells me that he is satisfied with the outside activities of this agent in this company, a company which is the favoured child of Gaeltarra Éireann, and an agent who is not impeded in any way by reason of that in doing the duties of his office as agent, full-time.  In thriving towns in County Meath, he can place only enough orders in the year 1956 to earn him £1 15s. 10d.  In County Louth, his earning were £22 odd in 1956 and £40 the year before.  In spite of that fact, in reply to a question put to him by me, he told me that the figure of £24 as given by the officials of the Department was a fantastic figure, that it could not be true and that it was not true.  To use his own words, he had at least five good customers in the towns of Drogheda and Dundalk.  But that was the extent of the good customers&mdash;never more than £50 in the past three years and under half that sum in two of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the products of Gaeltarra Éireann in knitwear and linen are being sufficiently pushed <Col N="1155" /> in the Counties of Dublin, Louth, Wicklow and Meath?  If he is, and he accepts the view that the people in these counties would prefer to deal with the Dublin wholesale houses, then all I can say is that, if the Dublin wholesale houses are engaged in a large-scale substandard racket, it pays the people from these adjoining counties to come in and get it more cheaply than they would from the agent going out.  Even the Cork people come to Dublin to buy the cheap stuff. The people in the West refused to place further orders or reduced their orders considerably.  That has happened in Counties Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim.  Complaints have reached the office, both orally and in writing, in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>Yet, when I put down a question a fortnight ago asking the Minister if he had received a letter from any trader complaining about these higher percentages in the Dublin area and regretting that he could not place any order because of that, the Minister said that he had not got any such letter.  I take it that he is relying again on some sort of technicality devoted to the order of accuracy.  I had not got a copy of the letter and I could not frame the question strictly within the terms of the letter; therefore, if the question did not coincide with the terms of the letter which was received, although the general import was the same, the Minister feels himself entitled to deny that he received any such letter.  But the letter is there.  Letters are there. They are in the office.  Not alone were there oral complaints and written complaints, but there was one instance in which a certain trader was so irate in the offices of Gaeltarra Éireann with this agent that the agent had to rush out by another door in order to avoid being assaulted.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell the House and the Country if there is any charge to this agent's company for storage of goods?  Is there any change in the price of goods purchased on paper by this agent when there is a subsequent general change in tweed prices?  My information is that this agent, on behalf of his company, can <Col N="1156" /> order large stocks of tweed on credit, leave them there at the prices then obtaining and, should there be a fluctuation upwards in price subsequently, the price goes up to everybody else but not on that particular agent's stuff, which is being stored free of charge.  That stuff cannot be touched.</P>
    <P>In the course of my series of questions to the Minister, I asked him the names of the houses and the amounts of money by way of extra discount given, and the reasons therefor.  I will give the Minister a copy of a document showing where one firm was left out of his reply and that firm got an extra discount to the tune of £428 15s. 10d.  I am not saying that the Minister withheld that because, after all, the Minister can give the House only the information that is supplied to him.  The answer will probably be again that this sum did not fall within the framework of the question I asked. Still, it is £428 15s. 10d. extra discount given, for no reason other than that this agent was able to place his order with the company, say nothing about it, come back to Gaeltarra Éireann and say there: &ldquo;You will give it now, or lump it.&rdquo;  And they gave it.</P>
    <P>On the 20th March, 1956, another Dublin firm got £196 4s. extra discount to which they were not entitled for any valid reason appropriate or applicable to the giving of trade discounts. On 31st August, 1954, on 15th April, 1955 and on 16th March, 1956, there was given to yet another Dublin firm a total of £354 10s. 6d. by way of extra discount for which no valid reason is given.  On 15th June, 1955, 17th June, 1955, 26th July, 1955, and 22nd August, 1955, there was a total of £57 12s. 5d. given to still another Dublin firm without good and sufficient reason.  In the months of November and December, 1954&mdash;in fact, a substantial amount of it in one month&mdash;there was given to another Dublin firm £208 10s. 6d. by way of extra and additional discount for which there is no good and sufficient reason apart from the bullying in retrospect.  It is easy to get orders if you can do it that way.  I have a copy of the document showing the extra firm that is left out in the <Col N="1157" /> Minister's reply, if he wants it, but I think he will be able to come across it all right.</P>
    <P>Does any businessman in the House know of a situation where a customer can come back to his supplier up to six months after receiving the goods, and give no reasons except that the agent promised it, looking for extra discount?  I do not know of any and I do not know of any firm or business house that would keep such an agent in employment for any length of time.</P>
    <P>I have said enough on the question of standard goods, substandard and saleable goods and substandard and unsaleable goods.  I hope the Minister, for his own sake, will be able to explain to the House why he said, in regard to the goods which were subjected to a higher percentage than 13-25 in some cases, sometimes less than 25, in a few instances higher than that&mdash;that that was done by reason of the substandard quality of the goods when he had evidence before him on official files showing that the manager acknowledged that such was not the case.  I hope the Minister will be able to explain that to the House and to the country.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note, and the Minister will note, that where application was made by those firms for increased discount an allegation that the goods were substandard was never made by them. It was made afterwards by the manager who sent them out as standard and six months afterwards suddenly remembered that they were substandard.  I hope the Minister will give a better reply than he gave me when I asked him was he satisfied that in all such cases where a higher percentage was given it was justified.</P>
    <P>Those Deputies here who understand Irish will recollect that this reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am satisfied that these increased percentages were authorised by the management of Gaeltarra Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have no way of seeing the goods now so as to satisfy myself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, we had the curious situation arising from that reply that <Col N="1158" /> the Minister knows nothing of his own knowledge in relation to these goods. That is probably as it should be.  I am not requiring the Minister to go to Westland Row and examine all these things himself.  Far from it.  The Minister has there, I take it, a competent staff of examiners who grade these goods and it would be only fair to the people who examine these goods and who grade them as standard that this matter should be cleared up once and for all.</P>
    <P>The Minister probably knows&mdash;it is certainly well known in his Department&mdash;that there is general unrest, discontent and distrust in this whole industry, particularly in relation to the sales end of it.  I would ask him, in the interests of the girls who work in these industries, in the interests of the manageresses and supervisors who spend long hours directing, teaching and superintending, to clear it up.  I would ask him, in the interests of the country and of the industry as a whole, to have an inquiry into this matter.  If I am wrong in the allegations I am making here I shall be the first to apologise.  If I have told one untruth here this evening I am prepared to withdraw.</P>
    <P>I have not come here, I have not devoted considerable time and study to figures, merely for the sake of being awkward.  I feel very strongly on this matter, particularly when one contrasts how badly done the job is at the sales end with how badly the workers are let down by those at the top.  The House will not be surprised to hear that these things were done under duress at the instance of this agent.</P>

Deputies will not be surprised that people can be treated in that fashion when they hear that an inquiry was started at the end of the year, that it was continued until March and was to be resumed in the Minister's office in Earlsfort Terrace at which the senior permanent officials and the three agents were to be present and that this agent refused <Col N="1159" /> to turn up.  Deputies will not be surprised at how the orders of the management to Gaeltarra Éireann were flouted.  The Minister may have very little respect for me personally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but he must have some respect for the dignity of an office, irrespective of who is the holder. When a man flouts the authority of the permanent head of the Department that is employing him, flouts the authority of the Minister who is the political head of the Department, how can the Minister justify bringing back such an evil influence into the midst of honest men?  I know what the Minister will say.  He will talk about the reason that are in writing for this man's dismissal.  But is there not an overall picture?  The reasons the Minister has were those formally issued by the officials.  But there is a general trend of misconduct in this case meriting more than reinstatement and an effort to close the matter at that.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to set up an inquiry into the affairs and management of this industry generally, with particular reference to the outside interests of agents, whether they conflict in any way with their duties as agents of Gaeltarra Éireann in relation to this substandard business, and particularly in relation to the item of dud linen planked on Gaeltarra Éireann. The Minister has some experience of evidence; he has some experience of the types of charges sometimes made against people.  I do not think he will have any difficulty in finding the appropriate word to apply to that particular transaction.  Has the Minister taken note of the complaints made by the western agent and by the southern agent that this practice, resorted to fairly generally and with impunity by the Dublin agent, was detrimental to the trade?  That evidence is on record in the Department in black and white.</P>

These allegations are there in writing; they are contained in the report of this inquiry, furnished to me by the Minister himself. In the course of replies to a series of parliamentary questions asked by me as to whether he would state the reasons given by Dublin traders when they applied to his Department for a trade discount of 25 per cent. on knitwear, the Minister stated that the traders in question claimed discount by sending in debit notes.  No reasons were given for the claims on the debit notes and there was no record in his Department that these traders gave any reason for their claims in any other way.</P>

      <P>Anybody who is receptive of the truth will have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion, first, that there was irregularity; secondly, that the dismissal of this agent by me was not a political one; thirdly and finally that the whole situation is one which demands the closest scrutiny.  The Minister would be fair to himself as well as to others if he sets up, or commends his successor to set up, an inquiry <Col N="1161" /> into these matters because I am satisfied that I have touched only on the fringe of all this.  I am as satisfied of all that as I am that the information given to me was not all of the information. It was not satisfactory.  It was not complete.  It is within the Minister's power and competence to see that these matters are put right and the public mind is set at rest.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that there is a considerable amount of unrest in the public mind in regard to the whole affairs of Gaeltarra Éireann.  I think of the misguided strike in one of these centres about a year ago due to the over-enthusiasm of the girls on the one hand and the lack of experience possibly of the well-intentioned supervisor on the other.  However, after some time we managed to get the matter straightened out with the help of some of the officials of the Department. I was then merely the Deputy in the area who took an interest in the matter.</P>
      <P>Afterwards I tried by way of <i>ex gratia</i> payment to get something for the girls in lieu of the time they were out. Everybody was horrified.  Everybody was utterly shocked to think that anybody would try to give money to people for work they did not do.  I explained that I thought it an essential for the sake of goodwill.  &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I was told.  &ldquo;You could not do that with public moneys.&rdquo;  If you could not do that with public moneys you could not do it in respect of all that has been done over the years in the connection I speak of and to what extent God only knows.</P>

      <P>Bhí sé sin an-shuimiúil ar fad agus má tá leath an mhéid adúirt an Teachta Mac Loingsigh fíor do mholfainn don Aire féachaint isteach sa gceist.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil an scéal chomh holc agus a luadh anso.  Is fiú don Aire iniúchadh géar a dhéanamh ar na nithe a luadh anso. B'fhéidir gur mhaith an rud é Bord a bhunú chun an t-iniúchadh sin a dhéanamh.  Is mór an trua má tá na nithe sin fíor mar déanfaidh sé damáiste do cheann de na tionscail is mó a raghaidh chun tairbhe don Ghaeltacht.  Bheadh an scéal olc <Col N="1162" /> go leor dá mba tionscal a bhí ann a bhain le háit ar bith sa tír, ach nuair a bhaineann sé le tionscal atá ag dul chun tairbhe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do mhuintir an Iarthair tá sé i bhfad níos measa.</P>
      <P>Is dócha go mbeidh na páipéirí lán amárach de na nithe adúirt an tIar-Aire. Chun meon na ndaoine a shásamh agus chun na daoine a shásamh is gá na nithe adúirt an t-Iar-Aire a bhréagnú nó Bord a bhunú chun na nithe sin d'iniúchadh agus más fíor iad féachaint chuige nach dtitfidh siad amach arís.  Níl d'eolas agamsa faoi na nithe sin ach an méid adúirt an t-Iar-Aire agus bhí seisean ábalta eolas d'fháil nach mbeadh ag an ngnáth-Theachta.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an Meastachán i gcóir Roinn na Gaeltachta, déarfainn gur maith an rud é ní atá chomh tábhachtach leis an nGaeltacht a chur fé Roinn Rialtais agus Aire fé leith a chur ina bun.  Bhí a lán cainte le blianta anuas faoi cad dob fhearr a dhéanamh chun cuidiú leis an nGaeltacht.  Dúradh dá dtéadh an Ghaeltacht ar ceal go n-imeodh an Ghaeilge.  Bhí tuairimí ann gur cheart Bord a bhunú; gur cheart féachaint chuige an scéal a leigheas trí mheán mhuintir an Gaeltachta iad féin agus gur cheart údarás a chur ar bun.</P>
      <P>Sílim féin gurb é seo an tslí is fearr agus is tairbhí chun fóirithint ar an nGaeilge agus ar an Ghaeltacht.  Níl dabht ar bith nach bhfuil toradh mar ba chóir ar an méid oibre a deineadh ar son na Gaeltachta ó cuireadh an Stát seo ar bun.  Rinne gach aon Rialtas a bhí ann go dtí seo a lán.  Do réir dealraimh níl an toradh do réir na hoibre a rinneadh.  Sílim féin gur gá athbheochaint ar spiorad na náisúntachta i measc an aosa óig.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar adúras cheana, sé an aidhm atá ag an Roinn (1) an teanga Ghaeilge a shábháil sa Ghaeltacht agus í a leathnú ar fud na tíre agus (2) an cultúr Gaelach a spreagadh agus a leathnú, ní hamháin sa Ghaeltacht, ach ar fud na tíre.  Tá daoine ann adeir gur cóir dúinn aidhm eile a bheith againn, sé sin, feabhas a chur ar saol geilleagrach agus shoisialach mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Bíodh gur gá an dá aidhm sin do chur i ngníomh níl iontu ach &ldquo;stepping stones,&rdquo; mar <Col N="1163" /> adéarfá, chun an chéad dhá aidhm a luaigh mé a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>Is minic a phléann daoine na cúiseanna is fearr le fóirithint ar an nGaeltacht.  Sílim go ndéanann siad dearmad ar fad ar an aidhm ba chóir dóibh a bheith rompu.  Níl aon amhras nach shin iad an dá aidhm ba chóir a bheith againn&mdash;sé sin, an teanga Ghaeilge a shábháil i measc mhuintir na fíor-Ghaeltachta agus ansin an Ghaeltacht a leathnú ar fud na tíre. Is gá iad sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine ann agus cuireann siad an cheist seo: &ldquo;Cad na thaobh go bhfuilimid ag tabhairt an oiread sin aire don Ghaeltacht?&rdquo;  Cuireann scéimeanna don Ghaeltacht imní ar mhórán daoine, freisin.  Is gá an Ghaeltacht a shábháil mar is sa nGaeltacht atá tobar fíor-uisce na Gaeilge.  Is ann atá na daoine a fuair an Ghaeilge óna dtuismitheoirí.  Is ann a tugtar an teanga ón athair don mhac agus ó na tuismitheoirí don chlann.  Is ann, freisin, atá an spioraid beo.  Tá an teanga Ghaeilge beo agus tá an cultúr Gaelach beo ann fós. Is gá féachaint chuige nach dtiocfaidh a thuilleadh laghduithe orthu.  Chun é sin a dhéanamh, beidh ar an Roinn nua i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh ná mar a rinneadh cheana.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an dá chuspóir a luaigh mé cúpla nóiméad ó shin a chur i ngníomh, is gá slite a cheapadh chun é sin a dhéanmh.  Tá mórán cúiseanna leis an meath atá ag teacht ar an nGaeltacht, nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt anois mar ghnáth-theanga in áiteanna ina labhairtí í 20 nó 30 bliain ó shin.  Is í príomh-chúis atá leis sin ná an imirce&mdash;imirce i measc an aosa óig, imirce chainteoirí Gaeilge ón Ghaeltacht, imirce ón Ghaeltacht go Sasana, go hAlbain agus go dtí cathracha na tíre seo féin.</P>
    <P>Cúis leis an imirce is ea easpa slí bheatha sa bhaile, easpa slite chun am saor a chaitheamh.  Dá bhrí sin, chun an imirce a leigheas, is gá slite a cheapadh chun cabhrú le hiascaireacht sa nGaeltacht.  Tá na ceantracha Gaeilge go léir comhgarach don fharraige.  Tá cáil na hiascaireachta ar fhormhór na Gaeltachta.  Má dhéanann an Roinn, fé mar atá tosnaithe acu ar <Col N="1164" /> an obair, báid mhaithe a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus má tugtar oiliúint do na leaids óga chun tugtar oiliúint do na leaids óga chun bheith ina n-iascairí maithe, má cuirtear céanna agus calaphoirt níos fearr ar fáil, cabhróidh na nithe sin go léir le tionscal na hiascaireachta.  Má cuirtear monarchain ar bun cosúil, mar shampla, leis an obair a déantar sna Cealla Beaga, cabhróidh sé le cosc a chur leis an imirce.  Is féidir, fosta, mórán a dhéanamh mar gheall ar iascaireacht intíre, sé sin, bradáin, bric, agus mar sin, ar na haibhne agus ar na locha.  Tá tús curtha leis an obair sin.  Ba chóir don Roinn féachaint chuige go bhfaighidh an Ghaeltacht a cuid féin de na buntáistí a bhaineann le hiascaireacht intíre.</P>
    <P>Arís, is féidir leathnú a dhéanamh ar fhoraoiseacht sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá talamh ann atá fóirstineach.  Tá na hoibritheoirí ansin.  Tá córas againn chun foraoiseacht a chur ar siúl in áiteanna eile ar fud na tíre.  Sé mo thuairim go ndearnadh fíor-bheagán don Ghaeltacht maidir le foraoiseacht go dtí seo. Bhí cúiseanna leis sin.  Ní fada ó cuireadh tús le hathphlandáil crann in Éirinn agus, mar gach tús, bhí an tosnú mall.  Ós rud é go bhfuil tús maith déanta againn sa treo sin, ba cheart buntáistí scéimeanna foraoiseachta a thabhairt anois do na ceantracha Gaeltachta.  Ceapaim gur mór an tairbhe a thiocfas as rudaí mar sin chun obair a thabhairt do na daoine nó scéimeanna móra eile a bhfuil daoine ag caint fúthu, scéimeanna mar monarcha agus mar sin de.  Ní mórán a chosnós an talamh agus ní mórán a chosnós na crainn agus tá obair ann ar feadh na bliana do dhaoine a bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu.</P>
    <P>Cé nach féidir a lán barraí a fhás ar thalamh bocht na Gaeltachta, mar sin féin ní ceart do Roinn na Gaeltachta ná don Roinn Talmhaíochta féachaint ar an talmhaíocht mar rud nach féidir a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht. Is féidir.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil seans talmhaíocht a dhéanamh mar bhíos sí ar siúl in Oirthear Thír Chonaill nó i gContae na Midhe ach is féidir speisialtacht a dhéanamh, mar shampla, ar phrátaí nua, na tithe gloine, agus dul níos faide ná sin.  Ní féidir liom anois rudaí eile a lua, ach tá go leor <Col N="1165" /> rudaí mar sin ann, mar inniún agus glasraí fá choinne na mbailte móra, ar féidir iad a fhás go maith ar thalamh phortaigh.  Prataí luatha&mdash;is féidir sin a dhéanamh agus tá a lán nithe eile is ar féidir leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta a fheabhsú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Sean-nós feirmeoireachta a bhí ann&mdash;beagán prátaí agus beagáinin coirce.  Níl maith ar bith bheith ag plé le rudaí mar sin.  Is ceart athrú mór a dhéanamh ar an saghas feirmeoireachta. Chuige sin sílim gur féidir leis an Roinn úr&mdash;iad féin agus an Roinn Talmhaíochta&mdash;mórán a dhéanamh d'fheirmeoirí beaga na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá cuartaíocht ann.  Is féidir a lán cuairteoirí a thabhairt isteach go dtí na tráigheanna, na bailte beaga, na cnoic agus na sléibhte agus saol sócúlach na ndaoine.  Is maith an áit shaoire í do dhaoine as bailte móra. Is gá bealaí móra d'fheabhsú.  Is gá deontaisí a thabhairt do thithe chun go mbeadh siad ábalta lóistín agus aíocht a thabhairt do chuairteoiri a thiocfas isteach ann.</P>
    <P>Deirtear gur olc an rud é cuairteoiri a thabhairt isteach, go mórmhór ó Shasana, go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Ní dóigh liom é.  Tá an radio agus mar sin de ag cur isteach ar an Ghaeltacht.  Ní féidir linn ár gcinn a chur sa ngainimh agus gan teagmháil leis an domhan taobh amuigh.  Sa saol atá ann inniu caithfimid dul ar aghaidh.  Ní féidir linn &ldquo;Iron Curtain&rdquo; a chur timpeall na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine ann adeir nár mhaith an rud é monarchain a chur sa Ghaeltacht, mar tá dainséar ann go ligfidís isteach daoine a thabharfadh drochshampla do lucht na Gaeltachta.  Caithfimid troid in aghaidh na tuairime sin. Má tá dainséar ann, caithfimid rud a dhéanamh chun an dainséar a chur ar ceal.</P>
    <P>Leis na rudaí sin go léir a luaigh mé chun cuidiú leis an nGaeltacht, tá go leor slite eile chun cuidiú leis an nGaeltacht, chun obair a chur ar siúl, sa dóigh go gcoinneoimid formhor an aosa óig sa Ghaeltacht, agus chun líon na ndaoine a mhéadú ann, agus ardú ar líon na ndaltaí ag dul go dtí na scoileanna náisiúnta.  Beidh orainn na rudaí adúirt mé a dhéanamh chun <Col N="1166" /> na daoine óga sin a choinneáil.  Ceantar a luaigh mé sa díospóireacht anuraidh. Teileann, níl ann ach cúigear ar fad san aois-ghrúpa fiche bliain go 40 bliain, sé sin, daoine in-phósta.</P>
    <P>Chun na rudaí sin a dhéanamh. beidh airgead riachtanach, agus caithfear deontaisi a thabhairt.  Cuir i gcas, ceist na mbóithre, a luaigh an tAire, nuair a bhí sé ag caint ar an Meastachán, bóithre sa Ghaeltacht, scéimeanna uisce agus séarachais, mionoibreacha mara beidh airgead go leor de dhíth leis an obair sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Ní maith an rud é, sílim, bheith ag tabhairt Meastachán agus Fo-Mheastachán, b'fhéidir, isteach i rith na bliana.  Mholfainn don Aire agus don Rialtas ciste a chur ar fáil, cosúil leis an gCiste Forbartha Náisiúnta, abair Ciste na Gaeltachta, sa dóigh nuair a bheadh scéim thábhachtach le déanamh, ar bhféidir í a dhéanamh i mbliana, nár ghá fanúint i gcóir Fo-Mheastacháin, nár ghá fanúint go dtí an bhliain seo chugainn.  Cuir i gcas, má shíleann an Roinn go bhfuil gá le rudaí a dhéanamh, go bhfuil deithneas leo ghearrfadh Ciste na Gaeltachta amach cuid mhaith den &ldquo;red tape.&rdquo;  Ní bheadh iachall ar an Aire troid a chur suas gach bliain chun airgead d'fháil.  Bheadh an Ciste sin ar fáil i gcóir oibreacha áirithe.</P>
    <P>Tá rud amháin curtha fé chúram Aire na Gaeltachta a tógadh ón Roinn Oideachais, deontas an £5.  Do réir chaint na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht&mdash; bhí tuismitheoirí ag labhairt liom i rith na bliana&mdash;sílim go bhfuil riaráistí móra go dtí le gairid le híoc an deontais sin.  Bhí an scéal an-mhíshásúil ar fad.</P>
    <P>Sílim gur ghnáthach an deontas a íoc roimh Nollaig gach bliain sa dóigh go raibh tairbhe le fáil sa Gheimhreadh ag na páistí a bhí cáilithe chun na deontaisí a fháil.  Sílim le cúpla bliain anuas nár híocadh cuid de na deontaisí go dtí deireadh na bliana airgeadais, nó b'fhéidir fíu amháin ina dhiaidh.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom dá scrúdaíodh an tAire an scéal sin agus, más fíor é, réiteach níos fearr a dhéanamh i gcóir na bliana seo.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist eile ann agus is deacair tabhairt fé, sé sin, stát-sheirbhísigh <Col N="1167" /> agus daoine cosúil le Gardaí a bheith ag obair sa límistéir ar a dtugtar an Ghaeltacht agus gan an Ghaeilg acu nó gan Gaeilge ró-mhaith acu. Níl mé ag rá gur ceart cur isteach orthu sin ar chor ar bith.  Ní ceart, ach tá cuid acu agus b'fhéidir gur mhaith leo aistriú a fháil go dtí cuid eile den tír, go Baile Átha Cliath nó go dtí cathair eile.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil an scéal mar sin.  Tá stát-sheirbhísigh agus gardaí a chuaigh go dtí an Ghaeltacht, b'féidir 10 mbliana nó 20 bliain ó shin, gan mórán Gaeilge acu agus ar mhaith leo anois dul go dtí áit éigin eile.  D'fhéadfaí ansin daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu a chur isteach sa Ghaeltacht ina n-áit.</P>
    <P>Sé mo thuairimse nach cheart postanna sa Ghaeltacht a thabhairt ach do Ghaelgeóirí, go speisialta na postanna ardanna.  Tá a lán postanna arda ann a bhfuil cáilíochta speisialta ag teastáil lena n-aghaidh agus de gnáth ní bhíonn Gaeilge ag na daoine a ceaptar.  Dá airde an post is amhlaidh is riachtanaí Gaeilge a bheith ag an duine a ceaptar.  Is uafar an rud é go n-iarrtar mar cháilíocht do phost beag de thuarastal £6 nó £7 Gaeilge a bheith ag na hiarrthóirí, nuair nach mbíonn sí riachtanach d'iarrthóirí ar phostanna níos tábhachtaí.  Ba cheart go mbeadh sé mar riail ag Aire na Gaeltachta teagmháil a bheith aige leis na Ranna go léir ionas gur Gaeilgeoirí amháin a bheadh sna brainsí éagsúla atá ag feidhmiú sa Ghaeltacht agus sna gníomhaireachta Stáit eile, cuir i gcás Gaeltarra Éireann, agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Sílim gur maith an rud don Roinn stiúrthóir a cheapadh do gach Gaeltacht. Tá Gaeltacht amháin, Gaeltacht an deiscirt, nach bhfuil stiúrthóir ar bith ceaptha inti go fóill.  Ba cheart an scéal sin a leigheas go tapaidh. Má ceaptar na daoine ceart déanfaidh siad obair mhaith don Ghaeltacht, daoine le meoin agus dearcadh Gaelach, daoine a bhfuil fuinneamh acu agus a bhfuil taithi acu ar na daoine sa límistéar ina mbeidh siad ag obair. Is maith an beart na stiúrthóirí sin a cheapadh mar beidh teagmháil aca leis an Roinn agus le gnóthaí na Gaeltachta.  Pé scéal é, má mholann <Col N="1168" /> na stiúrthóirí scéimeanna agus mura dtugtar go leor aird orthu ní bheidh mórán céille ann.  Is dócha go mbeidh fonn mór orthu obair mhaith a dhéanamh agus, mar adeirtear i mBéarla, má bhionn cúpla &ldquo;blanks&rdquo; acu imeoidh an díograis agus cuirfidh sin siar iad.</P>
    <P>Tá mórán scéimeanna ag na comhairlí contae.  Mholfainn do Roinn na Gaeltachta teagmháil a bheith acu leis na comhairlí contae éagsúla sa Ghaeltacht, áit a bhfuil comhairlí contae maithe cosúil le comhairle Thíar Chonaill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>As I gradually began to understand the Gaeltacht Services Division of the Department of Lands, as it was then, I was afraid that what had occurred in the years following the cessation of the 1914-18 war would happen in the years following the last war.  From approximately 1920 until almost 1930, the Gaeltacht industries were almost completely wiped out. That was due to many reasons.  I am very glad and proud to learn from the Minister's opening speech this evening that there has been very steady progress in the years following the last war, particularly since 1948.  That is very heartening even though some Deputies feel that more progress should have been made.  I am more than satisfied and very pleased with the progress that was made in the work of the Gaeltacht Services Division, particularly in the tweed and other industries, such as toy-making, glove-making, knitwear, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tweed industry has shown a remarkable increase.  That is largely due to good management and hard work on the part of certain officials in Gaeltarra Eireann.  In 1948, when I first took over, the storehouses held a huge quantity of tweed that was of very poor quality.  It was unsaleable. <Col N="1170" /> It can truly be said that that was nobody's fault.  The Minister at the time, Deputy Moylan, and his officials did their very best to dispose of that tweed but during the war years very peculiar conditions existed.  A vast quantity of inferior quality tweed was turned out and the moment the war was over and things became more or less normal, particularly in the British industries, tweed that was quite good for war time purposes was left on the hands of the Minister at the time.  I inherited about 160,000 yards of tweed that was practically unsaleable.  We managed to dispose of it without any great loss.</P>
    <P>I remember working with the director and other officials of Gaeltarra Éireann in those years.  I was determined to put the industry on its feet. I realised then, and I am glad to see that I was right, that if we were to continue selling Irish homespun tweed we would have to manufacture a good quality and produce a range of patterns that kept constantly in touch with fashions.  The men in the Gaeltacht Services Division got down to that task and the report the Minister gave the House to-day, that the sales of tweed have trebled, from £108,000 in 1950, to £277,000 to-day, proves that their efforts have borne fruit.</P>
    <P>The Minister&mdash;I understand that he will have a successor in the very near future&mdash;should be very proud of the fact that practically all the industries have been completely overhauled and equipped with the most modern machinery.  That is a big step forward. It is not easy to get money from the Minister for Finance for these things. Each Minister always looks for more than he can expect to get from any Minister for Finance.  Nevertheless, great strides have been made and it is very heartening to see these advances.</P>
    <P>The principal reason I rose to speak was to point out to the Minister one method of keeping the Gaeltacht alive and keeping as many young people as possible there.  It has nothing to do with the work of the Minister's Department as it is now constituted.  I am referring to forestry.  I believe that my pushing of forestry in the Gaeltacht areas during my term of office did as <Col N="1171" /> much, or even more, as any other work in keeping at least some of the young men at home.</P>
    <P>Very often I feel sorry that there could not be some kind of union between the Department of the Gaeltacht and the Department of Lands, particularly in regard to the Gaeltacht areas.  I know it would be impossible and that it would mean overlapping, but I would advise the Minister not to forget his colleague, the Minister for Lands, and to get him to push forestry as hard as he possibly can in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>It is a grand thing to speak Irish, but I want to tell the Minister that it is not because the young men in the Gaeltacht, or outside it, speak Irish or English that they emigrate; they emigrate because of economic necessity.  If we want to keep them at home, there is only one way to do it, regardless of whether they speak English or Irish. We must give them employment at home.  There were good wages in England up to a short time ago, but now I am told the conditions there for the working man are not as good as they used to be.  Nevertheless, we must give the young men employment in the Gaeltacht areas, if we wish to keep them at home.</P>
    <P>Forestry is one of the best possible means of providing employment in these areas.  The quality of the land is very poor and some of it is not capable of growing trees, even of less than commercial quality, but the majority of it is.  The Minister, whether he be Deputy Lynch or Deputy Moran, would be well advised to push forestry as much as possible, without at the same time losing sight of the industries that have been run by the Gaeltacht services, such as the toy industry, knitwear, gloves and, above all, the tweed.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say what he is paying at present for sea rods and other seaweeds and what he thinks will be the future of the industry as at present constituted.  I should also like him to tell us what success has attended the research into the processing by ourselves of sea rods <Col N="1172" /> and seaweeds around the coast here. Research was going on in my time and also later when Deputy Lindsay became Minister.  I understand that there was a prospect of some success attending that research.  I was very keen on it myself.  If we could process the sea rods and seaweeds ourselves, it would be much more profitable and would give much more employment.</P>
    <P>It is very heartening to see the figure of close on 300 new houses and almost the same number of reconstructions in the Gaeltacht.  That is excellent work.  If we want to expand our industries there and to sell our products, we must put on the market a product as good as any other firm.  Gaeltarra Éireann should be capable of doing that, because, as I have said, they have a factory newly built and equipped with the most modern machinery.  By keeping in touch with modern developments and fashion they should be able to produce an article second to none.  The way Irish tweed has taken on the American market, where competition must be fierce, is proof of the fact that the Irish homespun tweed at present is a really first class product.  By keeping up that good quality, the slump that almost wiped out the industry in the first world war will never occur again.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to lose sight of the activities of his colleague, the Minister for Lands, in the Gaeltacht areas.  The quality of the land is very poor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Native Governments, since we got our freedom, have been only fiddling with the Gaeltacht. It irks me to hear Ministers talk about little mushroom industries.  We have got to make up our minds on one thing.  What are we trying to save&mdash; the land which forms the areas of the Gaeltacht or the Irish speakers on it? If it is the land we are trying to save for afforestation and other things, then <Col N="1174" /> thank God for coast erosion; but if it is the Irish speakers we are trying to preserve, I am prepared to do all in my power to help in that object.</P>
      <P>It is almost 40 years since we got our freedom.  At that time, we had a very large Gaeltacht and a very great number of Irish speakers.  Despite what native Governments have done, that number is dwindling and dwindling year by year and I lay the blame on one policy and that is the policy of compulsory Irish.</P>
      <P>I think that a language is a badge of nationality.  Latin and Greek are no longer badges of any particular nationality; it is the spoken language which is the badge of nationality and it is the spoken language that we should set out to preserve.  Look around the House and see the number of young Deputies we have on all sides of the House.  They were brought up in the national and secondary schools and taught through the medium of Irish.  How many of them can speak Irish to-day and how many of them do speak Irish to-day?  Then look around the House and see gentlemen like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and a few others who acquired their knowledge of Irish voluntarily through the Gaelic League because the vernacular was what we were taught.  We were taught in the language of the rest of our forebears, although the Irish language continued to be the spoken language of the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>I think our approach to the subject is completely wrong.  Instead of having compulsory Irish in the schools; instead of giving teachers additional fees for teaching through the medium of Irish and instead of giving doctors additional fees for practising in Gaeltacht areas, we should concentrate more on making the children Irish speakers.  I know that I will be asked how we are to do that.  My suggestion is to give every child in this country three months in the Gaeltacht and I will guarantee that at the end of the period he will come out of it a native Irish speaker, provided you do not ask him to go to school during those three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Or to do examinations. Let us go down to Ring and look at the magnificent work being done there.  Let us look at Rannafast and see what has been done there and in the various other Gaeltacht areas. If the children were required to go there and mix with the Irish speakers, they would come out not alone with a knowledge of the Irish language but having had a very good holiday.  Every household in the Gaeltacht areas could be fully employed and occupied if we sent the children down to them for three months of the year, and not only for the summer months but for all the year round.  Every house could become a hostel for these children and every owner could become a fear a' tighe and a bean a' tighe teaching the language they know and teaching in the módh díreach and the módh scartha.  We can get that only by going to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and if we do that, we will have each house fully employed teaching these children through the módh direach and every inch of ground will be cultivated to provide for these children the vegetables they will require.</P>
      <P>I think it is time&mdash;and I am not referring to the present Minister or the Minister who will succeed him&mdash;to get down to the fact that we are losing the Gaeltacht and losing it very fast. Immediately it goes, the language goes.  There is not much use in passing examinations or having sufficient knowledge to be able to write or read a letter in Irish, unless we keep our language alive.  I hope that no modern industry will be set up in the Gaeltacht and that we may be able to employ these people without bringing in foreign technicians, because that is one of the methods by which we have endeavoured to wipe out the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us realise the amount of money which we are voting for the Gaeltacht. The Gaeltacht is diminishing and is it not time that we realised that it is diminishing?  Is it not time that we got together to see what we can do to prevent it diminishing further?  My suggestion may not be a good one, but it is an alternative, and it is worth trying. I know students who have procured the Fáinne and gone on to the university, <Col N="1176" /> but the mere fact that they were compelled to learn Irish makes them detest the language.  For most of the older people here, who were members of the I.R.A. and Sinn Féin, it was a pleasure to go to the Gaelic League classes at night and try to pick up new words and phrases in Irish.  Through repetition, they eventually acquired a knowledge of Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  The Deputy has put his finger on it&mdash;because it was banned.  Once it was made compulsory, it was a different matter. There is one thing about the Irish people&mdash;you can lead them, but you cannot drive them.  While they were being driven, we lost the language, but while they were being led, we went places.  If we realise that the spoken language is our badge of nationality, we will be getting some place.  We will be getting Irish speakers and giving full employment to the people in the Gaeltacht areas.  We will be making the fear a' tighe a hotelier in the little house he owns and he will be cultivating the little plot of land he owns.</P>
      <P>Believe it or not, I know a Gaeltacht at the moment in which most of the native speakers are branded as shoneens simply because they play a game which is not Gaelic football.  I would not like anybody to misunderstand me because I have the greatest respect for Gaelic football, but I am thinking of Aranmore Island and of the place called the Rosses, where, if you searched the entire area, you could not possibly procure a Gaelic football pitch up to the standard required by the G.A.A.  I do not think the G.A.A. should lower the standard of their pitches, but there are people there who are associated with soccer players across the water and they should be catered for.  I have seen soccer matches in my own native Rosses where not one word of English was spoken.  They should not be branded as shoneens, if they do not play Gaelic football.  We are driving them away from the ideal we are trying to achieve. I am not casting any aspersions on the G.A.A., an organisation for which I have the greatest respect.</P>

      <P>That is fair enough. We should not brand these Irish speakers as shoneens when they play a foreign game, when they have no alternative game to play.  I know a player from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht on Aranmore Island who was honoured by Ireland last year by receiving a cap for playing professional soccer.  I do not see why he should be branded as a shoneen.</P>
      <P>These are only suggestions I am throwing out.  We should remember where these Irish speakers live.  Let us not forget that.  What we are trying to do is to acquire an expert knowledge of the spoken language.  If we want scholars let those people who can afford it go to the universities and acquire a full knowledge of the written language there; but if we are to cater for the labourers' sons, the farmers' sons and the shopkeepers' sons, let us do something for them by giving them a holiday in the Gaeltacht and let them try to converse with their neighbours in the Irish language.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham referred to stiúrthóirí or directors in the Gaeltacht. That is what is wrong with it.  There are too many stiúrthóirí and directors sent to the Gaeltacht.  Let us send down people to try to learn the language we have got.</P>

      <P>Cut out the £5; there is no necessity for it.  I remember some 12 or 14 years ago Gardaí procuring additional salary for coming down to Irish speaking districts and <Col N="1178" /> district justices who did so also got additional salaries.  Doctors, if they had a knowledge of Irish, got preference in appointments to these districts. What is happening to-day?  I practise in the courts and when we hear Irish spoken, it is only when we have some unfortunate person who does not understand English.</P>

      <P>Of course it is&mdash;more hypocrisy and nothing else but hypocrisy.  More Irish is spoken in the Orange City of Belfast to-day than in the City of Dublin.  More is being done by the voluntary body of Comhaltas Uladh for the módh díreach of Irish speaking than is being done by the Department in Dublin.  We have a new Minister&mdash;or we will have one within a week&mdash;and I hope he will sweep clean.  What we want is employment in the Gaeltacht and the only method of giving that employment is sending people down to live with us. If you do that you will preserve the language as it was in the old days, as a Deputy from Sligo-Leitrim has rightly pointed out, when it was compulsory not to learn it, and then when it became voluntary, we got to work.</P>

      <P>Sé an chúis go mba mhaith liom monarcha a bheith againn chun na rudaí sin a dhéanamh ná go bhfuil an bun-ábhar sa Ghaeltacht féin.  Fosta, tá comhlucht in Albain ag déanamh an tsórt oibre seo agus, do réir mar is eol dom, tá siad sásta monarcha a chur ar bun nó cuidiú a thabhairt le monarcha do chur ar bun i gContae Dhún na nGall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> Fé mar is eol dúinn go léir dob fhéidir mórán a dhéanamh do na hiascairí sa Ghaeltacht.  Thiocfadh linn monarcha a chur ar bun chun iasc a chur i gcannaí, mar shampla amháin.</P>
    <P>Fá dtaobh de na tithe gloine, sé mo bharúil gur féidir mórán a dhéanamh. Fá dtaobh díobh seo mo chomh-Theachta, ó Chontae Lughbhaidhe, an tAire Gnóthaí Eachtracha, Proinsias Mac Aogáin, a chuir tús leis an obair sin sa Ghaeltacht.  Is cuidiú mór do mhuintir na Gaeltachta na tithe gloine sin.  Fé mar is eol dúinn go léir, tá muintir na Gaeltachta ag brath go mór ar na tithe gloine agus ar na trátaí agus na hinniúin a fhásann iontu cionn is go bhfuil a gcuid talún chomh hole.  Tá suim mheasartha airgid á déanamh acu astu.</P>
    <P>Do dhein an Teachta Mac Cuinneagáin tagairt don fhoraoiseacht.  Ní gá dhom mórán a rá faoi sin ach sílim go dtiocfadh leis an Roinn cuid mhór a dhéanamh fá sin sa Ghaeltacht.  Níl an talamh atá inti oiriúnach do ghnáth-bharraí agus dá bhrí sin sílim gur féidir a lán a dhéanamh ó thaobh na foraoiseachta.</P>
    <P>Dhein an Teachta Mac Cuinneagáin tagairt fosta do bhóithre na Gaeltachta. Tá cuid de na bóithre seo maith go leor ach tá roinnt eile díobh atá go fíor-olc, agus ba cheart iad a dheisiú gan mhoill.</P>
    <P>Rud eile dhe, ba chóir tithe maithe a sholáthar do na daoine.  Ní leor caint a dhéanamh faoi dhaoine a choinneáil sa Ghaeltacht mura bhfuil tithe fóirstineacha ann dóibh.</P>
    <P>Mholfainn fosta gan aon oifigeach a chur imbun scéime ar bith sa Ghaeltacht mura bhfuil an Ghaeilge go maith aige.  Tá cúis gearáin mhóir ag muintir na Gaeltachta faoi sin.  Tagann daoine go bhfuil postanna arda acu isteach sa Ghaeltacht agus gan ach an Béarla acu.  Níl fhios agam an mbíonn ar na daoine sin dul fé scrúdú béil ach, cibé ar bith, ní leor scrúdú béil, im bharúil.  Ní muintir na Gaeltachta an sclábhaíocht agus gheibh na Béarlóirí an t-airgead maith.  Sin fíor-dhroch-shampla.  Mholfainn don Roinn gan aon duine a cheapadh feasta agus a chur i gceannas scéime ar bith sa Ghaeltacht gan Gaeilge a bheith aige.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> Rinne mé tagairt cheana do chuairteoirí. Dúradh go mb'fhéidir nár mhaith an rud é cuairteoirí a thabhairt isteach sa Ghaeltacht agus Béarla a labhairt inti.  Tá aithne agam ar cheantar amháin a dtéann mórán daoine ag cuartaíocht ann gach bliain agus níor deineadh dochar ar bith sa cheantar sin.  Ag an am chéanna, sílim go mba chóir do Ghaeilgeoirí, i mBaile Átha Cliath agus i mbailte móra eile, cumann a chur ar bun chun Gaeilgeoirí a mhealladh chun na Gaeltachta.  Ansin, thiocfadh leo dul i gcomhairle leis na daoine atá ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht agus áiteacha sna tithe a chur in áirith do na cuairteoirí.  Do chuideodh sé sin le muintir na Gaeltachta agus, ina theannta sin, chuideodh sé leis na daoine a dteastaíonn uatha feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhíos ag caint ar Mheastachán na Roinne Oideachais do mholas scrúdú béil do na scoláirí a bheadh ag dul fé scrúduithe na Meán-Teistiméireachta agus na hArd-Teistiméireachta. Má dhéanann an Roinn Oideachais é sin, sílim go rachaidh i bhfad níos mó daoine óga a bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Cuidíonn na Coláistí Gaeilge go mór le muintir na Gaeltachta agus dá mhéid coláistí a bheas inti sea is fearr.</P>
    <P>Níl aon rud eile le rá agam ach rath Dé a ghuidh ar obair an Aire úir. Guidhim go mbeidh feabhas mór ar staid na Gaeltachta i gcionn tamaillín. Tá sé soiléir do gach éinne anois gur gá tréan-iarracht a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeltacht a shábháil nó caillfear í agus, má imíonn an Ghaeltacht, imeoidh an teanga Ghaeilge fosta.</P>

Níl fhios agam cad é an bhaint atá ag Cumann Lúthchleas Gael leis an díospóireacht seo ná a rialacha, ná cad é an bhaint atá ag Gaeilge éigeanteach leis an scéal.

    <P>Nílim ar aon-aigne leis na tuairimí <Col N="1182" /> a nocht an Teachta Ó Domhnaill mar gheall ar an dá cheist agus go háirithe leis an méid adúirt sé mar gheall ar Ghaeilge éigeantach.  Sean-phort is ea é sin.  Ba chóir é a chur ar leataobh, go háirithe sinne atá inár nGaeilgeoirí. Do bhí an tsean-bollscaireacht sin ag na daoine a bhí i gcoinne athbheochaint na teangan.</P>
    <P>Nílim ar aon-aigne leis an Teachta Ó Domhnaill nuair adúirt sé nach bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta agus nár deineadh rud ar bith gur fiú trácht air le blianta. Do deineadh dul chun cinn; do dheineadh mórán agus tá mórán le déanamh fós.</P>
    <P>Nílim eolasach mar gheall ar staid na teangan agus staid na ndaoine san Gaeltachta go léir sa tír chun tuairim a thabhairt ar an scéal fé láthair sna Gaeltachta go léir sa tír.  Mar sin féin, nílim den dtuairim go bhfuil bunús leis an olagón atá ar siúl fé láthair go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag imeacht chomh tapaidh is adeireann daoine áirithe.  Níl Gaeltacht Chiarraí ag imeacht ar chor ar bith.  Tá mórán daoine óga imithe ón nGaeltacht, ó Chorcha Dhuibhne.  Tá a fhios sin agam.  Tagann siad anso go Baile Átha Cliath nó téann siad ar fuaid na tíre mar mhúinteoirí, gardaí, banaltraí, cléirigh agus i bpostanna eile mar sin&mdash;agus, faraor géar, téann cuid acu go Sasana agus b'fhéidir níos faide ó baile.  Mar sin féin, ní fíor go bhfuil an Ghaeilge imithe i léig sna ceanntair sin.  Tá eolas agam ar Chorcha Dhuibhne agus, fé mar tuigtear dhom, a mhalairt ar fad atá fíor ann. Breis agus bliaín ó shin thug mé cuaird ar gach teaghlach sa cheantar. Sé a fuair mé amach ná nach bhfuil an teanga ag imeacht i léig sa cheantar sin ach go bhfuil an scéal níos fearr ann anois maidir le labhairt na teangan ná mar bhí tríoch bliain ó shin.</P>
    <P>Deirtear liom go bhfuil an scéal níos fearr in Árainn ná mar bhí sé tríocha bliain ó shin.  Tá an Ghaeilge dá labhairt in áiteanna anois as a raibh sí ag imeacht roinnt bliain ó shin. Tá sí níos láidre in áiteanna ná mar bhí sí tríocha bliain ó shin.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nár leor na rudaí na rudaí rinneadh agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil a lán eile le déanamh fós.  An obair a rinne an Roinn Oideachais, na múinteoirí <Col N="1183" /> náisiúnta, agus cuid mhaith de na sagairt sa Ghaeltacht, chuaigh sí chun tairbhe don Ghaeilge agus do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Fiú amháin na Gardaí le Gaeilge a cuireadh go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus na hoifigí rialtais eile a cuireadh go dtí an Ghaeltacht, chuaigh an obair a rinneadar chun tairbhe do staid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán lagaí eile le leigheas fós. Ní féidir sin a cheilt.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh ar chumas na Roinne agus an Aire nua tabhairt fé na rudaí sin go léir agus an leigheas d'fháil.  Is deacair na fadhbanna atá le réiteach a réiteach ach tá an réiteach ann. Gheofar an réiteach chun an Ghaeilge a choimeád beo sna ceantracha seo. Tá dhá cheist ann&mdash;an teanga féin agus saol geilleagrach na ndaoine. Ní mór dúinn obair a thabhairt dóibh agus iad a dhéanamh níos sásta sna ceantracha seo.  Caithfidh na Ranna rialtais go léar chomhoibriú lena chéile chun an cuspóir seo a bhaint amach. Ní mór do na daoine cloí leis an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá muintir na Gaeltachta ag braith air go mbeidh na daoine sa gcuid eile den tír taobh thiar díobh.  Fé mar adeirim, tá an dá rud ann&mdash;an Ghaeilge féin, agus obair a chur ar fáil do na daoine.  Sin iad an dá rud nach foláir don Roinn seo a dhéanamh.  Ní labharfainn in aon chor murach gur theastaigh uaim a rá nach raibh mé ar aon-aigne leis an dTeachta Ó Domhnaill faoi Ghaeilge éigeantach. Is trua liom nach i nGaeilge ar fad a labhair sé, rud is féidir leis a dhéanamh.  Tá meas agam air ach thabharfainn comhairle a leasa dhó.

Ba mhaith liomsa cúpla focal scoir a rá ar an <Col N="1184" /> Meastachán seo.  Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Roinn mar gheall ar an méid oibre atá déanta acu sa Ghaeltacht.  Rinne sí a cuid oibre go maith.  Tá dóigh níos fearr ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta ná mar bhí orthu blianta ó shin.  I ndiaidh a bhfuil déanta ag an Rialtas agus i ndhiaidh a bhfuil déanta ag na scéimeanna chun cuidiú le muintir na Gaeltachta, is mór an trua go bhfuil níos mó daoine ag imeacht as an Ghaeltacht ná mar d'imigh nuair a bhí an scéal níos measa sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Dúirt mé go raibh dóigh níos fearr ar an Ghaeltacht anois ná mar bhí uirthi san blianta a chuaigh thart. Chuidigh scéim tithe na Gaeltachta go mór leis an Ghaeltacht.  Na tithe atá ag na daoine sa Ghaeltacht anois, tithe breátha follaine is ea iad.  Sílimse go dtiocfadh leis an Roinn agus leis an Rialtas níos mó a dhéanamh chun cuairtoirí a thabhairt go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Má tá dóigh bhreá ar na tithe beidh ar chumas na ndaoine féachaint i ndiaidh na gcuairteoirí.</P>
      <P>Sinne atá ar an gcomhairle chontae i dTír Chonaill, táimid ag déanamh ár ndíchill maidir le scéimeanna uisce agus bealaí móra a thabhairt do na ceantracha sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil an t-airgead gann ach mura bhfaighimid cuidiú ón Rialtas ní bheidh ar chumas na chomhairle contae na scéimeanna sin a thabhairt do na daoine.</P>
      <P>Tá lúcháir orm a fheiscint go bhfuil airgead ar fáil le haghaidh na scéimeanna seo&mdash;airgead a gheobhaidh an chomhairle chontae agus a cuirfidh ar a cumas scéimeanna uisce a thabhairt do na ceantracha nach bhfuil scéimeanna uisce acu fós.</P>

Tá lúcháir orm a fheiscint go bhfuil a thuilleadh arigid ag dul isteach sa tionscal sin i gCill Chearra.  Tabharfaidh sin a lán oibre do na daoine in áiteacha ar nós Gleann Colmchille.

    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> Sílim gur ceart cuidiú a thabhairt ní hamháin don Ghaeltacht ach don Bhreac-Ghaeltacht.  Má táthar chun an Ghaeilge a choimeád beo bríomhar, is ceart an Bhreac-Ghaeltacht a dhéanamh níos Gaelaí ná mar atá sí. Tá an Ghaeilge beo ansin go fóill ach le cuidiú beag d'fhéadfaimis í a thabhairt thar n-ais ar fad sna ceantracha seo leis na scéimeanna atá beartaithe ag an Aire agus ag an Rialtas.  Sílim gur ceart cuidiú a thabhairt don Bhreac-Ghaeltacht chomh maith leis an bhFíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Má fhaigheann an Ghaeltacht bás sin deireadh leis an teanga.  Tá a lán daoine ann a bhfuil an tuairim acu go bhféadfaí an Ghaeilge a shábháil sna Sé Contaethe Fichead dá bhfaigheadh an Ghaeltacht bás ach níl an tuairim sin agamsa.  Sílim dá bhfaigheadh an Ghaeltacht bás nach mbeadh ann ach cúpla bliain go dtí go mbeadh an Ghaeilge marbh ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom trácht ar an spiorad Gaelach agus an spiorad náisiúnta atá sna Sé Contaethe.  Go Tír Chonaill achan bhliain tig na céadta scoláirí isteach sa Ghaeltacht leis an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Dá mbeadh an spiorad céanna sna Sé Contaethe Fichead atá sna Sé Contaethe, ní bheadh moill ar bith an Ghaeilge a thabhairt ar ais sa tír seo.</P>
    <P>I gcás mhuintir na Sé Contaethe, go speisialta an t-aos óg, tá an spiorad náisiúnta, an spiorad Gaelach, beo ansin agus bhí riamh.  Ba cheart d'aos óg na Sé Contaethe Fichead iad sin a leanstan san obair mhaith atá siad a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tuigimid uilig nach bhfuil scoláirí na Sé Contaethe ag fáil mórán cabhrach san obair sin.  Ina dhiaidh sin agus uile, ní siad an obair seo ó bhliain go bliain agus ba cheart don náisiún bheith iontach buíoch díobh.</P>
    <P>Tá díomá orm nach bhfuil an tionscal cniotála ag dul ar aghaidh chomh maith is ba mhaith liom.  Tá súil agam nach fada go ndéanfar rudaí áirithe leis an tionscal seo a cur ar aghaidh níos fearr ná mar atá fé láthair.  Sé an dainséar atá ann, má dúntar síos tionscal ar bith acu, go n-imeoidh na cailíní go hAlbain agus go Sasana agus nach dtiocfaidh siad abhaile. <Col N="1186" /> Ansin, féadann an Roinn an tionscal sin a dhúnadh síos ar fad.</P>
    <P>Ar an ábhar san, ba mhaith liom go bhféachfadh an tAire úr isteach sa cheist sin agus an tionscal cniotála seo a choinneáil beo, chun na cailíní seo a choinneáil sa bhaile.  Beidh sé iontach deacair iad a thabhairt ar ais.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh an tAire úr achan chuidiú don Ghaeltacht sa dóigh go dtig linn sa chomhairle contae dul ar aghaidh le scéimeanna atá luaite againn&mdash;scéimeanna uisce do na bailte móra agus scéimeanna den tsórt san.  Má thig linn beatha na ndaoine a fheabhsú sa Ghaeltacht agus má thig linn obair a thabhairt don aos óg sa bhaile, níl dabht ar bith go n-éireoidh linn.  Mura ndéanaimid sin, sin deireadh leis an Ghaeilge sa tír seo.

    <P>Mar sin féin, ní ceart cur i leith an Rialtais ná dearnadh faic ar son na Gaeltachta leis na blianta atá imithe.  Tá neart oibre déanta ins gach Gaeltacht.  Tá súil agam gur féidir linn b'fhéidir níos mó a dhéanamh ná mar deineadh go nuige seo.  Sé sin, is dóigh liom, an fáth ar cuireadh an Roinn nua seo ar bun.  Níl sé cinnte go ndéanfaidh an Roinn nua obair níos fearr ná mar deineadh go dtí seo. Ar a laghad, beidh cumhacht agus údarás an Aire níos mó ná mar bhí nó a bhíodh ag Rúnaí Parlaiminte chun an Ghaeltacht a chur ar aghaidh <Col N="1187" /> agus chun níos mó daoine a caomhnadh sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Nuair a chuir an Teachta Mac Loingsigh tús leis an díospóireacht seo, dúirt sé nach raibh mórán nua anseo, sé sin, sa díospóireacht nó sa ráiteas a chuir mise fé bhráid an Tí.  Ní raibh mórán anseo, mórán nua, ón am a cuireadh Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng ar bun blianta ó shin. Bhí sé sin fíor.  Is trua go raibh sé fíor.  Nuair a cuireadh deireadh leis an Oifig sin, caithim a rá agus caithfidh gach éinne a rá gur beag a deineadh ar son na Gaeltachta ó shin.</P>
    <P>Nuair a tháinig Fianna Fáil i gcumhacht i 1951 cuireadh an Oifig sin, Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng, ar bun agus cuireadh Rúnaí Parlaiminte ina bun, chun chomhshnadhmadh a dhéanamh ar an obair i ngach Roinn ar son na Gaeltachta. Chomh maith leis sin, cuireadh coiste idir-rannach ar bun agus ceapadh ar an gcoiste sin oifigeach ó gach Roinn Stáit a raibh aon bhaint acu, beag nó mór, le hobair na Gaeltachta. Tháinig an coiste sin le chéile beagnach gach re seachtain.  Sa tslí sin, b'fhéidir leis an gcoiste agus leis an Rúnaí Parlaiminte an obair sin go léir a choimeád fé na bráid.  Aon áit ina raibh obair le déanamh, scéimeanna nua le cur ar bun nó rud éigin a bhí in easnamh, cuireadh an rud sin i bhfeidhm.  Is féidir linn a rá gur deineadh dea-obair ar son na Gaeltachta sa tréimhse sin.</P>
    <P>Ní gá dom ach tagairt a dhéanamh do roinnt de na rudaí a deineadh sa tréimhse sin.  Ar dtúis, leathnaíodh Achta na dTithe a bhí i bhfeidhm don Ghaeltacht agus tugadh deontaisí do na daoine sa Ghaeltacht chun uisce reatha agus séarachas a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tugadh deontaisí chun tithe a thógaint, agus thug na scéimeanna seo uile slí do na daoine sa Ghaeltacht fanúint sa bhaile.  Rud maith a bhí i scéim Tithe na Gaeltachta.  Rud maith leis a bhí sa scéim chun fo-stáisiúin leictreachais a chur ar bun sa Ghaeltacht ionas go mbeadh na daoine ansin i ndon a gcuid móna a dhíol chomh héasca agus a bhí siad i ndon í a dhíol in aimsir an Chogaidh. <Col N="1188" /> San aimsir sin ní raibh mórán deacrachta ag baint le díol móna ar fuaid na tíre.  Ach chomh luath agus d'imigh na laethe sin b'éigean don Rialtas margadh nua a chur ar bun.  Is ansin a cuireadh suas na fo-stáisiúin leictreachais.</P>
    <P>Rud eile de, bhí gearáin ag muintir na Gaeltachta, agus ag daoine eile san Iarthar leo, nach raibh caoi cheart ar na bóithre.  Ní ar an obair a chuirfeadh scéim leasú bóthar ar fáil amháin a bhíodar ag smaoineamh; bhíodar ag smaoineamh freisin ar na cuairteoirí a thiocfadh go dtí na ceantair sin dá mbeadh na bóithre níos fearr.  Chuir an Rialtas £400,000 ar fáil gach bliain ar feadh ocht mbliana chun feabhas a chur ar na bóithre sa Ghaeltacht agus, ag an am céanna, chun obair a sholáthar do na daoine.</P>
    <P>Nuair a toghadh an Rialtas nua i 1954, cuireadh críoch leis an Oifig a chuir na scéimeanna sin ar fáil do na daoine&mdash;Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng.  Ní raibh ach ocht gcruinniú den choiste sin ann ón am a tháinig an Rialtas nua isteach i 1954 go dtí an t-am a cuireadh an Aireacht nua ar bun.  I rith an dá bhliain sin ní dearnadh faic ar son na Gaeltachta. Cuireadh an Aireacht nua ar bun i mí Deireadh Fómhair, 1956.  Admhaím nach raibh mórán ama ag an Aire chun scéimeanna a chur ar bun.  Ach, ná déan dearmad, bhí an tAire in a Rúnaí Parlaiminte ar feadh tréimhse fada roimhe sin.  Ní fheicim aon fhianaise sa Roinn faoi aon obair a deineadh ar son na Gaeltachta le linn an tréimhse sin. Is trua nach raibh aon rud nua sa Vóta seo d'ullmhaigh sé agus atá anois os comhair an Tí.</P>
    <P>Bhí moladh ag an Teachta Mac Cuinneagáin gur ceart saghas ciste a chur ar bun ar son na Gaeltachta&mdash;rud éigin mar an gCiste Forbartha Náisiúnta. Níl fhios agam ar léigh sé an Leabhar Meastachán.  Má léigh, chonaic sé go bhfuil ciste fé leith bunaithe le haghaidh na hoibre seo.  Tá £77,000 sa chiste sin le scéimeanna a chur i gcrích, scéimeanna nach bhfuil ar chumas na gcomhairlí contae iad a dhéanamh leo féin gan cabhair ón Rialtas.  Bha mhaith liom, más féidir, an ciste fé leith sin <Col N="1189" /> a dhéanamh níos mó.  Ba mhaith liom a rá, áfach, go mbeidh níos mó airgid le fáil amach anso le haghaidh na hoibre sin.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Mac Cuinneagáin tagairt don deontas £5.  Dúirt sé go raibh gearán aige go raibh riaráiste mór gach blian in íoc an deontais&mdash; nach raibh sé íoctha roimh an Nollaig. Ach tá gearán eile agamsa: amanta nuair a théim thart ar fuaid na Gaeltachta cloisim na páistí ag caint i mBéarla.  Measaim uaireanta, agus táim cinnte dhe i gcúpla cás, go bhfuil an deontas £5 á fháil ag na páistí sin. Bhí an scéim sin dá riaradh ag an Aire Oideachais sarar cuireadh an Roinn nua seo ar bun agus ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil súil agam go bhfuil gach duine atá ag fáil an deontais sin ag labhairt na Gaeilge, ni hamháin ar scoil agus ar na bóithre ach sa tigh chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Aontaím go bhfuil gá le stiúrthóir i ngach Gaeltacht.  Do piocadh triúr stiúrthóirí ach níor fostaíodh ach beirt mar dhiúltaigh an tríú fear an post.  Tá stiúrthóir anois i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill agus in Iarthair na tíre, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh ceann eile fostaithe i gCúige Mumhan sar i bhfad.  Ní bheimid ag súil le rudaí móra ó obair na stiúrthóirí seo i mbliana.  Caithfimid seans a thabhairt dóibh dul thart agus aithne a chur ar na daoine agus eolas a fháil ar na deachrachtaí atá ag baint le saol na Gaeltachta.  Sa tslí sin beimid i ndon ceangal a chur ar bun idir an oifig i mBaile Átha Cliath, na hoifigí eile ar fuaid na gceantar sin agus na daoine sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Ó Bláthmhaic trácht ar fhoraoiseacht.  Is fíor gur an-obair í an ghoraoiseacht do na daoine sa Ghaeltacht má tá talamh le fáil ann.  Ach ní furast talamh a fháil sna ceantair sin.  Nuair a bhí mise i mo Rúnaí Parlaiminte dúradh liom go raibh a lán talún le fáil sa Ghaeltacht.  Cuireadh cigire go dtí na ceantair sin ach fuair seisean amach nach raibh talamh ar bith le spáráil ag na feirmeoirí ann.</P>
    <P>Sin deacracht fé leith atá ag baint le foraoiseacht sna ceantracha sin. Má bhíonn an talamh maith a dothain <Col N="1190" /> chun crainn a chur tá sí úsáideach i slí eigin eile do na feirmeóirí sna háiteacha sin.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Teachta Ó Bláthmhaic ceist orm mar gheall ar earraí mara. D'fiafraigh sé díom ead é an praghas a bhí á thabhairt ag an Roinn.  Sé an praghas sin ná £550 in aghaidh an tonna nuair a bhíonn na hearraí sin tirim agus tá deontas nó bónas breíse le fáil de 2/6 go 10/- an tonna ag na daoine a soláthraionn cúig tonna nó níos mó d'earraí mara.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Rúnaí Parlaiminte nach n-aontaíonn sé leis an Teachta Ó Domhnaill sa méid a dúirt sé i dtaobh Gaeilge éigeantach sa Ghaeltacht.  Aontaím leis an Rúnaí Parlaiminte.  Ní féidir é sin a rá le muintir na Gaeltachta. Má tá an Ghaeilge acu agus má thagann an t-am go mbeidh Gaeilge éigeantach sa Ghaeltacht tá sé in am deireadh a chur leis an Ghaeltacht.  Pé scéal é, ní dóigh liom go dtiocfaidh an t-am sin go deo. Tá fhios agam go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag cúngú in aghaidh na bliana ach tá neart Gaeilge á labhairt ag na daoine sa Gaeltacht agus tá níos mó Gaeilge á labhairt ar fud na tíre, nó, ar a laghad, tá níos mó daoine, go bhfuil eolas acu ar an nGaeilge ná mar a bhí fiche bliain ó shin, cé go bhfuil níos mó de mhuintir na Gaeltachta ag dul thar lear ná mar a chuaigh cheana.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom gur ceart an iomad a rá faoi pholasaí ginearálta don Ghaeltacht. Fé mar is eol do gach éinne beidh Aire nua ag teacht isteach san oifig seo i gceann tamaillín.  Beidh deireadh ag an údarás atá agamsa ag baint leis an oifig seo, b'fhéidir, ag deireadh na seachtaine seo.  Mar sin sílim gur ceart léiriú an pholasaí nua atá le chur i bhridhm a fhágaint don am i láthair.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist eile ann áfach.  Ní ceist mhór í ach rinne an Teachta Mac Loingsigh iarracht ar cheist mhór a dhéanamh di, sé sin, an cheist i dtaobh na lascainí agus an ceist a bhí á plé aige, ní hamháin inniu ach leis na seachtainí anuas nuair a bhí sé ag cur ceisteanna ar an gclár agus freagraí á dtabhairt agamsa.  Cuireadh im leith le linn na ceisteanna sin a bheith <Col N="1191" /> á gcur síos aige gur thugas an freagra dó i nGaeilge d'aon-ghnó chun dalladh mullóg do chur ar na daoine, chun an fhírinne do cheilt orthu.  Níl sé sin fíor, agus ós rud é go bhfuil seans ann go n-abhróidh sé é sin arís má leanaim leis an cuid eile den ráiteas seo i nGaeilge, caithfidh me iompó ar an mBéarla anois i dtreo nach mbeidh aon mhí-thuiscint ar éinne fén méid a bheidh le rá agam ar an gceist sin</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been very easy to have done that in answer to parliamentary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have just said, I regret that the occasion has now arisen, possibly on my last day acting as Minister for the Gaeltacht, that I should address the House in English on a matter appertaining to the Department of the Gaeltacht.  I am not one of those people against whom it could be alleged that he is a Gaelic snob.  I believe that at times it is just as well that anybody who knows Irish should speak English if there is the possibility that people listening to him might understand him better, or if by speaking English he could indicate to them that those who are interested in the revival of the language are reasonable people and that there is no desire on their part to speak Irish only in order to make those listening to him feel at a disadvantage. In this case I shall speak in English in order to make sure that no Deputy in the House will misunderstand what I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the questions put down by Deputy Lindsay on the matter of the dismissal and the reinstatement of an agent in Gaeltarra Éireann, let me say at the outset that in answering in Irish those questions which were put down in English I was doing no more than following a direction given by Deputy Lindsay himself when he was Minister.  The direction was to this effect&mdash;it is so stated in writing in one of the files which I have seen myself&mdash; that where Deputies who understood Irish put down questions in English for oral answer in the House, the answer was to be given to them in Irish unless in any particular instance <Col N="1192" /> a Deputy asked for it in English.  In any event, I agree entirely with the Minister's direction in that respect and I do not think it is right that any Deputy who specifically asks for a reply in English should be denied it.  In not one single instance did Deputy Lindsay ask me to repeat a reply in English.  Had he so requested, I would have done so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a precedent in the Minister's office where, on a matter of importance, I answered questions in the House in both Irish and English, where public moneys were involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it Deputy Lindsay is not trying to insult the intelligence of the Deputies by implying that they put down questions that are not important.  If a matter warrants the putting down of a question it is to be assumed that it is sufficiently important to the Deputy himself and to the public inasmuch as that it appears as a parliamentary question.  That was the ruling given by the Deputy when he was Minister and that is the ruling I followed in this case.</P>
      <P>First I want to assure Deputies that there was no attempt whatever made by me to conceal knowledge from the House.  Secondly, on every occasion that Deputy Lindsay asked these questions the answers were given to him as fully as I could possibly get the information from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree for a moment that in any respect there was an attempt made by any of the officers in the Department of the Gaeltacht or in the Gaeltacht Services Branch of the Department to withhold any information from me.  In respect of the questions submitted by Deputy Lindsay, I was given the entire information that I asked for and the Deputy, in turn, was given all the information he requested in his questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, before I go too deeply into the specific matters complained of by the Deputy, I should like to refer to some allegations he made in respect of the wages paid by Gaeltarra Éireann to knitwear workers and tweed workers.  As regards flat knitwear, the <Col N="1193" /> rates paid are based on those laid down for fourth year workers in the agreement made between the hosiery group of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  With regard to hand knitwear, the rates paid are in line with those paid by other manufacturers and their agents in Donegal and Connemara.  I think that will answer the Deputy's questions in that respect.</P>
    <P>With regard to tweed, those who are engaged in the tweed industry in Kilcar factory are paid on the basis of the agreement made through the agency of the Labour Court subscribed to by the Employers' Federation and the trade union concerned and those are the rates applicable to the entire country.  There is just a slight reservation but that is only from the point of view of time and it does not apply now.  Up to recently, as a result of a number of people being in the factory who were not fully trained, the full rates of wages had not been paid to them.  But it was agreed that a time limit would be put on the payment of the lesser wages to some of these workers.  That time limit has long since passed and, since it has passed, the full rate of wages is being paid to these workers.  Again, I think that fairly answers the allegation made by the Deputy in that respect.</P>
    <P>On the day the Deputy first spoke, last Wednesday, he began by making allegations in a general way against the integrity of the civil servants employed in the Gaeltacht Services branch of the Department of the Gaeltacht.  So far as I could ascertain, the Deputy's charges in that respect are completely groundless.  It is a pity that he should use his privileged position in that way to attack officials whose integrity, in my opinion, is beyound question, when these officials are not in a position to answer for themselves.  So far as it can be done, and so far as the injury can be rectified, I am doing so now in that I can assure the House and the country&mdash;as Deputy Lindsay has so often used that phrase in the course of his remarks&mdash; that there is no foundation whatever for the allegations made by him against the integrity of these officials.</P>
    <Col N="1194" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister will deal with specific items?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly shall.  In so far as an allegation has been made against my own personal integrity by the ex-Minister, I am afraid I can only leave the House and the country to judge for themselves.  If there was no personal allegation, perhaps I will accept that, judging by the look on the Deputy's face now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>On a matter of personal explanation, I want to make perfectly clear that what I said made no imputation against the Minister personally.  Anything I said was not meant to make, and did not in fact make, any imputation against the Minister personally.  I added that if he had a free hand in this matter, he would not have done what he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That in fact is an allegation against my competence to hold the office I have, even though temporarily, but I want to assure both Deputy Lindsay and the House that no influence was brought to bear on me in respect of the reinstatement of this agent.</P>
      <P>Let me start at the beginning. Deputy Lindsay said that long before he was put in charge of this Department, he knew that there were happenings in Gaeltarra Éireann that merited inquiry.  As far as I remember, the Deputy was made Parliamentary Secretary in July last year.  He was appointed Minister immediately on the resumption of the Dáil after the Summer Recess.  That was some time in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The 24th.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On 24th October.  But the ex-Minister did not stir a hand in respect of the happenings that he knew merited inquiry until the 8th January, 1957.  The ex-Minister has already made a reference to an incident, an &ldquo;effort&rdquo; he says, at Christmas, 1956, by some person to whom he did not refer but who, it is obvious, is this agent he has so often mentioned, to anticipate the likely consequences expected by a guilty conscience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> I do not know what happened.  We have no first knowledge of what happened at Christmas, 1956, and I am certainly not going to throw out here in this House what I have heard in respect of what happened.  At all events, whatever happened at Christmas, 1956, when Deputy Lindsay returned to his Department immediately after Christmas, he set about this inquisition, this inquiry into the discounts that were allowed and allowable in the Dublin area.  That inquisition continued on from 8th January until 19th March and on the forenoon of 19th March for the first time, this agent who was being accused of certain misconduct was brought before the Minister in his Department.  I should like to remark on the significance of the date, 19th March, 1957.  Deputies will remember that they took their places in this Dáil for the first time on the afternoon of 20th March.  On that morning, the agent concerned was summoned to the Minister's office&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like interrupting the Minister, but he is not accurate.  On 19th March, the agent failed to turn up, but he was there on the previous Friday or Saturday.  It would probably be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The 15th or 16th.  He was there that day, and there was another conference or inquisition summoned for 19th March.  On the night of 19th March, the Minister signed a letter, had it delivered by hand to the hotel in which this agent was staying, informing the agent that he was dismissed on certain grounds, and these grounds were stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Again&mdash;I did not sign it.  It was the Secretary of the Department who signed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  The Minister caused a letter to be sent by hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>He directed this letter to be written and caused it to be sent by hand dismissing the agent from his employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>With which dismissal <Col N="1196" /> both the Secretary and the Attorney-General agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In any inaccuracy of which I am guilty I shall accept the Deputy's correction without question. The three grounds on which the Minister decided to dismiss this agent were: (1) that he is now the sole director of a company&mdash;the company was named&mdash;and for that reason he is not in a position to give full-time attention to his position as agent; (2) that he sold goods in sales areas of another agent, and (3) that he arranged with certain shopkeepers without previous permission&mdash;I am translating as I go along&mdash;from the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann, and without informing him that he had so arranged, that they would receive a discount of 25 per cent. on certain knitted goods, matter which was damaging to a trade.</P>
      <P>I shall refer to specific instances later if the Deputy requires me to do so.  The first question was that the agent was a director of a company, a company that purchased goods from Gaeltarra Éireann.  He was an agent for linen and knitwear.  The goods he purchased from Garltarra Éireann through his company were tweeds.  I am satisfied, and any officer of the Department with whom I have discussed the matter is also satisfied, that the type of goods and lengths of tweed that this agent's company, his independent company, purchased from Gaeltarra Éireann were lengths for which Gaeltarra Éireann had not a sales service through the medium of which they could sell themselves.  This company had established on the Continent and in Britain certain contacts for the sale of short lengths of tweed, sales for which Gaeltarra Éireann sales organisation was not geared and in relation to which Gaeltarra Éireann, as a manufacturer of tweed, were very happy to have an outlet such as was provided by the company with which this agent was associated.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has made certain play on the fact that the agent was the sole owner.  The reason he was dismissed was because it was alleged that he was the sole director.  Whether he be sole owner or sole director, the fact is that there is another director.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>At 25 per cent. he should be top.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not get 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Giving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone does he work hard in the ordinary business of selling that knitwear in the district allotted to him but he goes beyond what might be expected of an agent in furthering the sales of Gaeltarra Éireann and in establishing display centres and paying for them out of his own pocket.  As well as that, he bears whatever extra expense is required for the pushing of these goods in the area allotted to him&mdash;that is, in Dublin and in what might be described as the home counties.</P>
      <P>With regard to his directorship of this company, when he purchased whatever interest he had in the company he immediately informed the Director of Gaeltacht Services and the Secretary of the Department of Lands, who is the accounting officer for the Gaeltacht Services Division.  No objection was raised.  In fact, I would be correct in saying that his action in that respect was welcomed inasmuch as it gave an outlet to Gaeltarra Éireann for these lengths of tweed which they would have found it difficult to sell otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Lindsay has said, he <Col N="1198" /> ultimately purchased the interest of the other director.  Again he informed the Director of Gaeltacht Services and, through him, the Secretary of the Department of Lands.  No objection whatever was raised in that respect either.  But, whether or not objection was raised, from the evidence before me I am satisfied by and large that this agent gave all the attention required to pushing the sales of knitwear manufactured by Gaeltarra Éireann and all the attention commensurate with the terms of his appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Wicklow and Louth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>And sub-standard stuff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with these later.  In so far as I am dealing with this allegation against him as one of the reasons for his dismissal, it should also be stated that each of the two main agents&mdash;the one for the South and the one for the West&mdash;had then and still have interests other than those for which they are employed by Gaeltarra Éireann.  It is, perhaps, unnecessary for me to go into the outside interests of each of these agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are not conflicting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Deputy has interjected that these interests are not conflicting, one of the agents happens to be a director of a woollen company; the other agent has purchased a very substantial farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have an inquiry into the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that is wrong.  On the contrary, it must be realised, as the Deputy pointed out, that these men are liable to three months' notice.  They are not permanent and, as far as I understand, they get no higher commission on their sales than those normally given despite what Deputy Lindsay says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>They do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be understood that these positions are not permanent.  Neither are they pensionable. <Col N="1199" /> The commission is not in any way out of the ordinary.  Deputy Lindsay suggests that 1 per cent. would be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Or, rather, that men in comparable positions get 1 per cent. from their companies.  If one applies that to the total remuneration earned by these men, the highest would have been £800 a year, ranging down to less than £400 a year, in the four years quoted by the Deputy.  When one realises that each of these agents has to finance all his own travelling, purchase his own car, buy his samples&mdash; in fact, from Gaeltarra Éireann&mdash; carry on whatever entertainment one has to do in these positions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not suggesting that the purchase of samples is costly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;one realises it is ludicrous to suggest that the commission given might be cut to the extent of one-fifth.  I am assured that in fact the commission, taking one year with another, a bad year with a good one, is by no means excessive, and in order to ensure that the best man is obtained for the purpose of pushing these sales, the commission given is about what would attract a good man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point on which the agent concerned was dismissed was that he sold goods in another agent's district. First of all, there was an allegation made by the southern agent, at one of the conferences held by Deputy Lindsay a few days before he went out, to the effect that Gaeltarra Éireann goods were found on sale at Shannon Airport and that these goods were not sold by the southern agent, even though Shannon Airport was within his district.  That was accepted as an act in breach of his conditions of appointment by the agent in the Dublin area.  But the fact is that those who run Shannon Airport&mdash;Aer Rianta or whoever it is&mdash;are responsible for the goods on sale there.  They have their own distributing centre in Dublin and all goods of that description sold in Shannon Airport are supplied <Col N="1200" /> by that centre.  Gaeltarra Éireann goods sold in Shannon Airport are not supplied by the southern agent.  As far as Gaeltarra Éireann agents are concerned, they are legitimately purchased in Dublin and put on sale in Shannon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a brand-new explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a suggestion of goods being put on sale in Cork.  That is the only other instance of goods being on sale in the southern area.  I do not know how long ago it happened; I think it is a matter of some couple of years.  At all events, there was no attempt to prove, nor has it been proved&mdash;and I do not know if it is capable of being proved&mdash;that these goods were in any way supplied by the agent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>A public inquiry will prove everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>These were the two allegations&mdash;they might be described as trivial allegations&mdash;on which it was sought to put the man out of his position. There were two other instances. One was a case of goods being sold in the western agent's district.  Again, this happened about three or four years ago.  They were sold to a shopkeeper in Donegal.  Again, the only item that could be alleged with any proof whatever against the company with which this agent was associated was that they sold tweed in Ireland when they were restricted to Europe and Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a very simple man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy; at least, I interrupted him only on one occasion in the course of the case he was making.  I wish he would allow me to make my case.  In fact, I am not making a case; I am just giving facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>So did I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The firm in Donegal were supplied with some lengths of tweed to the value of some £138&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>£189.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1201" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>£189&mdash;some years ago by this company.  So far as is known, that shopkeeper transferred some of the goods to another shopkeeper in Donegal.  There is no other knowledge as to how the other shopkeeper came by it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I could show you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only instance in which sales of tweed took place by this company to anybody in the country.  As I said, £189 was the sum involved.  It was brought to the attention of the agent immediately that his company was not permitted to sell in Ireland.  It was brought to his attention by the officers of Gaeltarra Éireann.  The agent was advised not to permit his company to do that again and it never has happened since.</P>
      <P>There was one other instance where a shopkeeper from the West of Ireland, I think, had possession of patterns. The patterns were supplied by the company with which the agent was associated as a result of a personal request, but no sale was effected in any way.  The Deputy is laughing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in sniggering or laughing.  The Deputy took exception to the Parliamentary Secretary's sniggering at something the Deputy said the other day.  He should let me make my case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Minister trying to tell a story which is in direct conflict with the document in front of me, with which he supplied me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the only two instances I could trace in respect of the sale of tweed, which was the second ground on which the dismissal of this agent was based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third ground was that he arranged with certain shopkeepers, without the prior permission of the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann and without telling them that he so made arrangements, that they would get 25 per cent. commission in respect of certain knitted goods.  I do not know what is the usual practice for travellers who travel for certain firms, but I am sure that the traveller who <Col N="1202" /> makes a suggestion about discounts to a shopkeeper, be he a retailer or a wholesaler, must know that he would have to have the authority of those who are employing him.  Similarly, as a practice of trade, those who buy these goods must know the same thing.</P>
    <P>I believe it happens&mdash;in fact, I know it happens&mdash;that travellers or agents say to shopkeepers who buy goods: &ldquo;I will try to get you a higher discount,&rdquo; in one case or another; but, at all events, whether the agent concerned did promise or make suggestions that certain shopkeepers, wholesalers or retailers would get discount in excess of the usual amount, the fact is that not in one single instance was a discount given in excess of the 13 per cent. allowed, without the specific permission of the management of Gaeltarra Éireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>In retrospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it be in retrospect or not does not matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>It does matter; that is the whole point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that not in one single instance&mdash;and remember this is the third ground on which the Deputy decided to sack the man&mdash; was an extra discount given without the permission of the management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is valid to inquire into the circumstances of the permission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>These were the broad facts which I had to investigate when I assumed office as Acting-Minister for the Gaeltacht.  It is pretty obvious from the manner in which the Deputy has conducted his campaign, despite what he said in regard to the use of the word &ldquo;vendetta&rdquo;, that he had spleen to exercise against this individual.</P>

If there was such a case, could he not have left it to the direction of the Minister who was following him? I suggest it was very significant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No attempt was made by me to influence them in any way. In regard to specific points made by the Deputy in the course of his remarks he suggested that the manager of Gaeltarra Éireann was given different functions to perform in respect of that office&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he alleges that it arose out of this transaction entirely.  First of all, as the Deputy knows, before he left office himself, the duties of the housing section of Gaeltacht Services were transferred to his Department and were put under the control of a principal officer of that Department.  Up to this time, the Assistant Director of Gaeltacht Services had been performing these functions in respect of Gaeltacht houses. When the duties of that branch of the services were taken from him, as a result of the setting up of the Department of the Gaeltacht and of the transfer of these duties to the principal officer in the Department, he had a certain lessening of his duties and as <Col N="1205" /> a result of his previous experience as manager of Gaeltarra Éireann, he was given certain duties in relation to the management of Gaeltarra Éireann with which he was familiar.  The assistant manager was put on special duties in relation to stocktaking and I think it is completely wrong to suggest that it was only because of the manager's complication in this respect that his duties were transferred.  It is entirely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not reduced; he still holds the position as manager. The Deputy also referred to the question of the sale of linen amounting to £109.  I think that was the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Roughly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently £109 worth of linen was sold by the agent's firm to Gaeltarra Éireann and the manager was, in fact, the person who effected the purchase.  He credited the firm with that £109 and, some time later, when the nature of the transaction became apparent to the Director of Gaeltarra Éireann, the manager was directed to return the linen to the company and to cancel the credit note that was given in favour of the company. Because there was a certain departure from procedure in that single respect, there was an increment held from the manager, but beyond that no punishment was imposed and there was nothing sinister, even though the Deputy appears to think so, in the whole transaction.  To-day was the first time I heard about it.  It all happened in the time when the Deputy was in office, but apparently it did not justify any action except that taken in regard to the manager.  I might say that the linen was apparently purchased for a purpose which later it was found it could not be put to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the company with which the agent was associated. Without being naïve about it, it was the agent himself who effected the sale, but actually the sale was not effected. A quantity of linen was delivered and, having regard to the manner in which it was effected, by credit note instead of purchase by a cheque having being made over, it was decided that the goods would have to be returned, and it was decided that certain action be taken in respect of the manager.</P>

      <P>There was another suggestion made by the Deputy in respect of an officer of the Department who was transferred from that Department because he raised certain questions about discount.  That officer was a staff officer and he passed the confined examination for junior executive officers.  He was assigned to another Department because there was no appropriate vacancy within his own Department for him.  There is nothing sinister in the transfer of that officer from Gaeltarra Éireann to another Department.  He passed the junior executive officer examination and took up the next appropriate appointment that was available for him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Another suggestion was made by the Deputy that goods made for this company were stored for it in Gaeltarra Éireann and were sold at a price below that charged to other companies.  The fact was that goods were ordered from time to time by the firm concerned, the firm with which the agent is connected.  As I have told the House, they were goods of a type that were not very readily disposed of. Markets had to be found for them abroad, but they were paid for at the price which was fixed at the time of the transactions between the company and Gaeltarra Éireann.  That follows the normal practice of trade and certainly the normal practice of Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
      <P>The current amount due by that company to Gaeltarra Éireann is, I understand, £9,370.  I am told that credit is allowed to companies and individuals who deal with Gaeltarra Éireann on the basis of reports from trade associations and banks.  That was done in this case just as in the cases of other customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of credit is greater than the actual capital of the company.  The Minister, I am sure, does not know whether that capital has been fully subscribed or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point raised by the Deputy was in relation to complaints received from shops throughout the country that they were not able to sell Gaeltarra Éireann goods because these goods were on supply in their areas at a cheaper price.  The first intimation to that effect from any shop <Col N="1208" /> came some couple of weeks before the Deputy raised a question in this respect and it came from a firm in Ballina.  One can only wonder what inspired the writing of that letter.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The question referred to asked the Minister whether he had received any complaints from any trader in this State within the past month that he could not give orders to Gaeltarra Éireann because Dublin traders were getting a higher percentage trading discount, thereby permiting them to sell knitwear in his area cheaper than he could buy it from Gaeltarra Éireann.  The letter concerned made no reference to Dublin traders and I can only conclude from that that there was somewhere a bad advice of proofs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a scandalous insinuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There was only one other letter from a firm in Galway and it raised the question about the delay in paying their own accounts.  It referred to price competition, due to their customers being offered Gaeltarra Éireann goods cheaper than they could offer them.  It said their stock was too high, due to defective merchandise received from Gaeltarra Éireann and unfair price-cutting.  That was the only other letter that could be remotely connected with the Deputy's question, and it certainly made no reference to Dublin traders.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general import of the Deputy's remarks when he referred to sub-standard goods, Deputies might be forgiven if they thought all Gaeltarra Éireann stuff was sold as sub-standard and that, only in the Dublin area.  The fact is that, in the year 1956, in respect of which the Deputy asked a question, only 8 per cent. of Gaeltarra Éireann goods were found to be sub-standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not present during the debate, but I will answer his questions simply.  The Department has agents in the United States and these agents get commission. First of all, 8 per cent. of Gaeltacht goods were found to be sub-standard and sold as such.  The entire of that amount was sold.  Lest it be suggested or believed that all of it was sold in the Dublin area, I want to say that, of that 8 per cent., 47 per cent. was sold in the West of Ireland, 12 per cent. in the South and 41 per cent. in the area of the agent concerned. When I say &ldquo;sub-standard&rdquo; I should really say &ldquo;unsatisfactory&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It does not always imply that the goods sold at a greater discount were sub-standard.  It has happened that some of these goods were not sold within a reasonable time by the shops because of the discrimination of purchasers. They probably objected to design in some respects and to the colour schemes in other respects. These were some of the goods sold in the Dublin area.  As the Deputy knows, the competition in that respect in the Dublin area would probably be higher than that in any other part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as an allegation might be made that the sales of Gaeltarra Éireann knitwear goods are not as high as they ought to be, I understand that all over the country a great number of people are producing knitwear goods and the competition is becoming keener and keener with the result that some <Col N="1210" /> of the smaller people have been put out of business.</P>
    <P>The Deputy alleged that I was permitting girls in the West of Ireland to emigrate because vacancies were not being filled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that the rates given are commensurate with the rates given elsewhere.  It was suggested that I, as Minister, was responsible for some of the girls in the West of Ireland emigrating because positions in Gaeltarra Éireann knitting centres were not being filled.  It was the Deputy himself, when he was Minister, who directed that vacancies were not to be filled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for that decision by the former Minister was that a goodly quantity of Gaeltarra Éireann knitwear was not disposed of when the Minister left office, and for some months before it.</P>

      <P>In particular, relating to the year we are dealing with.  The reason was because the market was glutted with knitwear goods.  As it was a manufacturing company, I think the Minister was quite right to treat them as a business organisation and not to allow production to increase unless sales commensurate with the production could be effected, which was not being done in any sales area.</P>

      <P>With regard to the discount and the special cases mentioned by the Deputy, I have here some cases in which the increased discount was sought by firms in the Dublin <Col N="1211" /> area.  The records of the Department indicate, in respect of one case, that the goods were sub-standard; ditto in respect of the second case; a sum of £7 5s. 9d. in the third case to maintain the goodwill of the company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope I have gone as far as is necessary to indicate that, having regard, first, to the three points made as the basis for the dismissal of this agent, they were not justified.  If there was another ground, it is a pity the Deputy, when he was Minister, did not state it on the minute which is the record of the basis for this man's dismissal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined the general background of the case in respect <Col N="1212" /> of which the Deputy suggests there ought to be a full public inquiry, suggesting scandalous imputations against the officers of Gaeltarra Éireann.  I have found there is no justification for the holding of such an inquiry, having regard to the weakness of the three grounds on which the dismissal was sustained, having regard to the time when the inquisition was commenced, the time the dismissal was effected and the manner in which it was done.  I suggest the matter is not entirely&mdash;I do not want to use the phrase &ldquo;above suspicion&rdquo; but at least it makes one think as to what the motives were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>My motive was in the interest of public expenditure.  Will the Minister not deal with the point of the three orders in March, 1955, on which a total of £332 8s. 4d. extra was given and explain it in detail to the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The record in the Department is that the reason why the request for discount was permitted by the management was that the goods were sub-standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister not evidence that the manager admitted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should deal with this.  I did not think it would be necessary for me to do so.  The Deputy referred to the fact that there was no production manager in Gaeltarra Éireann.  He suggested&mdash;in fact, I am glad now the Deputy did remind me&mdash; that the designer performed the functions of the production manager.  It is true, and the Deputy knows it well, that, for many years and on several occasions since the old production manager died, Gaeltarra Éireann have inserted advertisements and have sought far and wide to recruit a competent production manager but have so far failed.  For that reason, they required the designer to perform some of the functions of the production manager.  He was given an allowance in respect of the extra duties, not of £300 per annum as suggested by the Deputy but of £50 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to a staff officer getting commission from a tweed <Col N="1213" /> agent in Dublin who had nothing to do with this allegation.  The staff officer was getting a gratuity of £60 a year for extra work involved in the absence of a production manager.  The point I am coming to is this.  First of all, the loss of the production manager very much affected, naturally, the standard of goods, the supervision of the manufacture of goods.  Goods came into the depot in Dublin which were passed as sub-standard but when they found their way to the shops in some cases they were found to be defective in form or other respects, notably in many cases in the matter of design or colour formation.  For that reason some of the goods were unsatisfactory rather than sub-standard and were difficult to sell by these concerns.  For that reason demands were made in many cases for extra discount and it was given.</P>
    <P>I understand that these were the goods to which the £332 8s. 4d. mentioned by the Deputy referred, but at all events the Deputy himself appreciates the difficulty that Gaeltarra Éireann had in this respect&mdash;a difficulty which continues.  Until such time as a competent production manager is available these difficulties will arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no record of that and I have been unable to establish that the Deputy's allegation in that respect is right.  It is here in the official record that the goods were sub-standard. I tried to explain that some goods might have got out through the sales machine which were, in fact, sub-standard even though they got into the shops.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £6,064,600 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st <Col N="1214" /> day of March, 1958, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Árd-Chláraitheora), and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities and miscellaneous Grants.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should remind the House that the amount asked for under this motion is based on the Estimate for the Health Services which was prepared by my predecessor.  I am presenting it as drafted; the amount in respect of my Department which was included in the Vote on Account which the Dáil has granted was based upon it; it is the general administration of the Department in the last year of the Coalition which will be discussed upon it; and in these circumstances I have not thought it essential to amend the Estimate in any way.</P>
    <P>The Health Estimate is one of the largest with which Dáil Éireann is faced this year.  The £6,064,000-odd which is now being asked is in addition to the £2,050,000 which has already been granted under the Vote on Account of last March.  Thus, within the current financial year the net draw on the Exchequer under the Estimate is expected to be £8,114,000-odd. The gross figure, before deduction of Appropriations-in-Aid, is, in fact, £8,448,360, to which it is proper to add the sum of £39,350 which is provided in the Estimates for other Government Departments to cover expenditure which is likely to be incurred by them for the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The Appropriations-in-Aid for which credit was taken when preparing the Estimate are expected to provide £333,760.  The largest of them, amounting to £318,200, is from the Local Taxation Account, and represents, in fact, a direct contribution from the taxpayer, per specified item of tax revenue, to the costs of the service. Health authorities under various heads are expected to provide further Appropriations-in-Aid of the Vote, totalling £3,940.  Other sources are expected to yield £11,620, towards which it is anticipated that fees for searches and certified copies of entries of births, deaths and marriages will produce £10,300.  Summarising all this, we may <Col N="1215" /> say that this year the Department of Health and health services which it provides, or which are provided under its general supervision, will cost our citizens, <i>qua</i> taxpayers, in round figures and as a direct charge, £8,472,150.  £8,500,000 is a broader and more readily remembered, but not grossly inaccurate statement of the amount.</P>
    <P>The outstanding sub-head in the Estimate is sub-head H.&mdash;Grants to Health Authorities&mdash;for which no less than £8,150,000 will be required.  That sub-head does not reveal the actual cost of the health services which the community provides for its citizens. It may be taken broadly to represent half the actual cost of our present health services during the current year. It is in fact rather less than half, since some expenditures do not rank for recoupment.  I am sure, however, that we shall all agree that the figure of £8,150,000 for Exchequer contribution for health grant alone is quite enough in our present circumstances to be going on with.  It can be taken, I think, as a very close estimate of the amount which ratepayers will be called upon to find for their health authorities this year.</P>
    <P>The categories of ratepayer and taxpayer, as we all know, overlap very broadly.  In the main they comprise industrial and commercial undertakings, farmers, businessmen, and their employees.  However else all these interests may differ from each other, they have this in common: that as taxpayers they contribute out of one of their pockets towards the cost of health services, and as ratepayers they contribute out of the other.  In both cases it is, of course, an exacted contribution, which all told will amount this year to over £16,600,000.  A substantial sum, a very large sum indeed when regard is had to the slender resources, the modest producer income out of which it is taken.</P>
    <P>A question must naturally arise in the minds of all who think seriously and objectively on these matters, as to whether as a community we are getting adequate value for this expenditure, whether in fact our health services <Col N="1216" /> justify their cost.  I confess that, at this early stage of my responsibility for them, I am not in a position to give a decided answer to that question.  I am sure that I should not be able in any case to give one with which everybody would agree.  So much depends on the value which an individual places on the maintenance of health and the preservation of human life. But when we come, for instance, to relate this expenditure to our mortality rates for last year, as compared with earlier years, there is much evidence to show that the developments in our health services which have taken place in recent years are giving tangible and measurable returns.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, maternal mortality. Last year the number of births registered was 60,738, giving a birth rate of 21 per 1,000.  The number of maternal deaths due to pregnancy and child birth was 50, that is, at the rate of approximately one death per 1,215 births.  In 1955, the number of births was 61,622, the maternal mortality 70, which is equivalent approximately to one death per 880 births.  In 1947, however, when there were 68,978 births, the corresponding mortality rate was one death per 530 births; while in 1937, with 56,488 births, the figure was one death per 277 births.</P>
    <P>The mortality rate among infants under one year has shown the same trend.  Per 1,000 live births it was 36 in 1956 and 37 in 1955, as compared with 41, 68 and 73 in 1952, 1947 and 1937 respectively.  In all forms of tuberculosis the downward trend in mortality is even more marked.  From 889 in 1955, the number of deaths from this cause fell to 689 in 1956. Undeniably, the rate of tuberculosis mortality is still higher than in some other countries; but at 24 per 100,000 population it showed a marked improvement over previous years, when as for instance in 1955, 1953, 1950, 1947 and 1937, respectively, it was 31, 40, 80, 124 and 123 per 100,000.  Our overall death rate per 1,000 of population was 11.7 in 1956.  It was 12.6 in 1955, 11.9 in 1952, 14.8 in 1947 and 15.3 in 1937.</P>
    <P>All in all, taking the birth rate and the death rate in combination, it will <Col N="1217" /> be found that the rate of natural increase of population in this part of Ireland&mdash;and, indeed in the whole of Ireland&mdash;is higher than in England, Wales or Scotland.</P>
    <P>These facts carry a great measure of assurance that the nation is receiving an appreciable return for our expenditure on the health services, heavy and burdensome though some may feel that expenditure may be.  There is, I think, no need to stress that the marked decline in mortality which I have described is in itself an incontrovertible proof of a considerable and comprehensive improvement in the health of our people.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the rate of natural increase of our population is higher than it is with our neighbours. This is due mainly to the fact that the birth-rate here is higher than with them.  Thus, both in 1955 and 1956 it was 21 per 1,000 of population, whereas in England and Wales in 1956 it was 16 per 1,000 and in Scotland 18.  But the marriage rate of our people, on the other hand, still remains markedly lower than it is in Great Britain.  The annual rate for the past two years has been only 5.7 per 1,000 population; while in 1956 in Scotland it was 8.5 and in England and Wales 7.9.  In the light of these figures, it is clearly of the utmost importance, if we are to survive as a nation, that everything must be done that can within reason be done to maintain the general health of our people, using to this end all the means which scientific, medical and surgical research continues to make available to us in an ever more astonishing degree.</P>
    <P>In view of the low marriage rate, we must particularly concern ourselves to ensure that those diseases will be conquered which are especially deadly to children.  Diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, diarrhoea and enteritis are still prevalent and liable to infect others.  This year, we have initiated a new service of vaccination against poliomyelitis.  Now, in regard to this new service, we have been at pains to make it known that protection against infection cannot be guaranteed. On the other hand, polio-vaccination is now accepted generally as a valuable <Col N="1218" /> protective measure against this dangerous disease.  For a number of reasons, the service this year must be confined to children in the earlier age groups; but the limits will be enlarged as soon as this becomes practicable.</P>
    <P>Vaccination against poliomyelitis has been added to mass-radiography, B.C.G. vaccination, small-pox vaccination and diphtheria immunisation, all of which are available, free of charge, to everyone who desires to avail of them to help him in safeguarding his health and that of his children.  The statistics which I have already given show how effective those measures have been in combating disease and repelling death.  They should be much more generally availed of; and the cooperation of all who may be able to influence public opinion to that end will be welcomed very warmly indeed by the officers of my Department.</P>
    <P>A few minutes ago I gave figures for the striking decline in maternal mortality in childbirth or during pregnancy which had manifested itself particularly in recent years.  The proof which those figures afford, not only of the effectiveness, but of the need for our ante-natal services, is irrefutable. Under Section 16 of the Health Act of 1953, these services are available free of all charge to expectant mothers in the lower and middle income groups. If only they had been availed of early in pregnancy, some of the mothers who died last year and their babies might be alive to-day.  The important thing is for the expectant mother to go early to her doctor.  He will, I have no doubt, welcome her visit, and she herself will be easier in her mind and more secure as to the out-come.</P>
    <P>The changing pattern of the incidence of sickness and disease which I have outlined is producing its own peculiar problems.  The more notorious killers of past generations are being mastered, even rapidly mastered; but the fever hospitals and sanatoria which were designed specially to combat them still remain.  In some cases, it has been possible, at reasonable expense, to adapt such buildings to more general purposes and in this way they have eased the immediate pressure on existing hospital accommodation.  In a <Col N="1219" /> few cases, such adaptation has not been possible.  In every case, also, some redundancy in permanent staff has had to be left to solve itself by the effluxion of time&mdash;an expedient which does not always make for satisfactory and economical administration.  And economical and efficient administration of our health institutions and of our health services generally has become an imperative need.</P>
    <P>This is the tenth year since the Government in 1947 published a White Paper outlining proposals for the improvement of the health services.  It may be a salutary exercise to quote the following passages from pages 37 and 38 thereof:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With the gradual improvement and expansion of the health services, it is estimated that the gross annual expenditure on the scheme will amount to about £9,150,000 at the end of the first ten-year period.  The estimated net expenditure on the scheme would then be about £9,000,000 when credit is taken for receipts from sources other than rates and State grants in respect of expenditure on health services.  The estimated expenditure on the scheme includes provision for the expanded services authorised under the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Act, 1945, and the services provided for under the Health Act, 1947.</P>
    <P>The net cost of the services at the end of the first ten-year period, including free general practitioner, specialist, hospital (local and regional), mental treatment, infectious disease, tuberculosis, and domiciliary nursing services would be provided as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>This year, as the Estimate shows, the State grants to health authorities are expected to amount to £8,150,000 which is approximately nine times what they were in 1947-48.  The local authority share of the cost of those services will also be £8,150,000, or 1.72 <Col N="1220" /> times what it was ten years ago.  And the total amount to be expended under these two heads will be £16,300,000.</P>
    <P>It may be useful too, at this stage, to recall the amount which ten years ago it was thought would be required for hospital construction and reconstruction, if effect were to be given to the proposals then outlined for the expansion of our health services.  The matter is dealt with in the 1947 White Paper in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The full development of the scheme which has been outlined will involved the provision and equipment of a number of hospitals and health institutions under the control of voluntary agencies and health authorities.  For the most part, the institutions which will be comprised in the building programme are already in course of planning.  It may be assumed that the institutional programme will entail a capital expenditure of about £30,000,000. Furthermore, existing institutional accommodation for the aged and infirm, and persons suffering from chronic ailments, is far from being satisfactory.  Improved provision will have to be made in due course for this purpose.  Replacement would, however, mean an eventual additional capital outlay in the neighbourhood of £13,000,000.  The work cannot, therefore, be undertaken until the more pressing needs of the acutely ill have been met.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the position as forecast in 1947.  It is well, I think, that we should look at the position as it is to-day.  As a first step in the execution of the scheme outlined in 1947, in 1948 a priority programme of hospital works was drawn up on the direction of the then Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Browne.  It was to be completed within seven years and envisaged a gross provision of about 12,300 beds and 375 cots to give a net addition to existing accommodation of about 9,000 beds and 300 cots.  The present position in regard to this 1949 programme is that schemes have been completed which provide for about 9,100 beds and about 170 cots; while works are in progress to provide a further 550 beds and 30 cots.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> In addition, since 1949, nine nurses' homes and four staff homes have been erected, providing accommodation for about 830 persons.  Two other nurses' homes are in course of erection.  The balance of the programme still remaining for execution covers about 2,650 beds and about 175 cots, but due to changed circumstances, it may not now be necessary to provide some of the accommodation contemplated in 1948-1949.</P>
    <P>At the time the programme was drawn up, it was estimated that it could be completed for £17.5 million. To-day its cost is estimated at £41.75 million, after allowing for the fact that included in it originally were some projects which it is now virtually certain will not be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>Some minor changes were made from time to time in the 1949 programme prior to 1954, but early in that year a number of new projects were added to it.  These were to provide some 819 new beds, giving a net addition of 673, of which only some 114 remain to be provided.  The latest estimate for the total cost of this programme is £950,000.</P>
    <P>Since 1954, it would be true to say that the provision of hospital accommodation additional to the 1949 programme, as supplemented in 1954, has been under continuous review; but it was considered that with the resources available to the Department it would not be prudent or justifiable to undertake a further extensive programme until it became clear that already existing commitments could be fulfilled. It will be appreciated that the initiation of the 1949 programme was enormously facilitated in the first place by the enforced accumulation during the war of considerable balances in the Hospitals Trust Fund. From this source, which, let me emphasise, is now exhausted, and from the proceeds of current sweeps and Grants-in-Aid from the Exchequer, there was spent £22.25 millions within the eight financial years ended on the 31st March last.  It is estimated that over the same period hospital authorities spent about £3.2 millions on capital works.</P>
    <P>Included in this amount was about <Col N="1222" /> £500,000, which was in the possession of voluntary hospital authorities, and which had been derived mainly from funds which they held from the proceeds of the first six sweepstakes. Local authorities on their part expended about £2.7 millions, which was raised by way of loans from the Local Loans Fund.  Subventions from the Exchequer in aid of the Hospitals Trust Fund amounted to £6.78 millions, and these were utilised both for capital purposes and other purposes as the need arose. The total amount from all sources expended on hospitals and associated institutions within the eight-year period was £25.45 millions, of which no less than £21.9 millions was spent in the six years which ended on the 31st March, 1957.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, all the assets accumulated during the war in the Hospitals Trust Fund have now been exhausted.  It was decided last year that the Minister for Finance would no longer provide Grants-in-Aid of the construction programme.  He finds it difficult indeed to provide moneys for the Local Loans Fund.  Moreover a large part of the income of the Hospitals Trust Fund has now perforce to be devoted, not to building new hospitals, but to keeping existing voluntary hospitals open.  The sum total of all this is that so far as future hospital construction is concerned, we are now faced with an acute financial problem. In these circumstances a searching review of the remaining hospital programme, in its relation to actual needs and probable resources, is being undertaken. It is not a task which we approach with any confidence that an impeccable programme will result.  On the contrary, it is quite clearly indicated by the experience of the past seven or eight years, that it is very difficult to make an assessment of hospital requirements, in their several categories, which will be approximately applicable to conditions prevailing even a few years later.</P>
    <P>The rapid development of new drugs and new treatments may modify the persistence and prevalence of certain diseases so substantially, that the need for specialised institutions for particular <Col N="1223" /> types of cases is correspondingly diminished.  A striking example of this is furnished by the rapid decline in the incidence of tuberculosis over the past few years.  In 1949 the number of reported cases of tuberculosis was 7,552.  In 1955, the latest year for which final figures are available, the number of cases had fallen to 5,613&mdash;a reduction of over a quarter in the six year period.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that in consequence of this very desirable and gratifying change, some institutions which were in use as sanatoria are no longer required and have had to be closed or adapted to other uses.  This will be the case also with some others in the relatively near future.  Among these will be Ardkeen Sanatorium, which was opened as recently as July, 1952, and which cost about £1,050,000 to build.  The demand, I should emphasise also, for fever hospitals has been similarly reduced.</P>
    <P>It is easy to be wise after the event and hindsight is a much too common faculty; a layman, however, like myself, may be forgiven if he wonders whether it would not have been more rewarding to have spent more on other needs such as the provision of more accommodation for mental defectives and on the improvement and extension of mental hospitals.  I say this, conscious of the fact that three of the four regional sanatoria which have been built since 1947 were projected under my own aegis as Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>Not only has future hospital building to be related to our future needs, as we may be able to foresee them, but it has now to be strictly related to our probable resources.  And, in my opinion, these will be meagre indeed by comparison with the standards which have prevailed in recent years. I have already mentioned that all the accumulated assets of the Hospitals Trust Fund have been exhausted and that the Minister for Finance is no longer in a position to supplement expenditure from the fund.  The actual position, I may say, is even worse than these facts indicate, inasmuch as the sweepstake income for the current <Col N="1224" /> financial year has already been heavily drawn upon to meet payments due prior to the 31st March in respect of voluntary hospital deficits.  Consequently so much less is available for current expenditure on building.</P>
    <P>But even if this were not the case the financial position would still remain stringent.  So that if the extra accommodation which is essential is to be provided within any reasonable period, a drastic scaling-down in unnecessarily expensive standards must take place.  This is imperative, not merely to make our capital resources go further but to avoid unduly heavy expense in running and maintaining the institutions.  In regard to this, and all the other services under the Department of Health, I shall endeavour to ensure that the public will derive the maximum benefit from such moneys as are expended upon them.  It is in the light of this intention that I ask the Dáil to pass this Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in moving the Estimate for his Department, has stated it to be an Estimate prepared for submission to the Dáil by me as his predecessor.  He has given a very comprehensive and general account of some of the difficulties which any Minister for Health is faced with in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>This Estimate shows a significant reduction in the amount sought for this Department last year.  The reduction in the Estimate is largely concerned with the elimination of the Grant-in-Aid to the Hospitals Trust Fund from the Central Fund.  This year, for the first time since, I think, 1952, the Vote which the Minister seeks from this House contains, in relation to hospital building, no subvention from Central Funds: That is a significant departure and it represents a decision taken by me and my colleagues in the former Government.  It was a decision reached as a result of a careful review of the capital position of the State, balanced against present and future hospital requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is realised that since the initiation of the Hospitals Trust Fund in 1931 or so, a great deal of money has been expended on the construction and <Col N="1225" /> provision of hospitals.  Now, some 30 years later, it is possible to consider whether all that expenditure was wisely decided or not.  As the Minister said in his statement, hindsight is not often indicative of good judgment, and I think if one were to review the expenditure by the State on hospitals here over the past 20 or 30 years, one could only come to the clear judgment that it has been made less fruitful by reason of the local government system which we operate here and which we inherited from those who previously ruled our destinies.</P>
    <P>When there was a fund available in the early 1930's for hospital construction and provision, unfortunately it became the story that different counties competed for the provision of county hospitals and the result has been over the past 20 or 30 years that a great number of small and often badly equipped&mdash;due to no defect in the hospital&mdash;hospitals were built just because a county hospital was provided in the neighbouring county.  At the same time, it is now apparent that the provision of county hospitals was decided upon considerations which were regrettable and which have led to the exclusion of new hospitals in certain pivotal points throughout the country where in fact they should have been provided.</P>
    <P>Anyone looking at the Midlands will find, in part of my constituency, an excellent new hospital in Tullamore, another new hospital in Roscommon and still another in Mullingar, but the town of Athlone, which is an important centre of population in that area, had no new hospital provided for it.  That is only an example of the haphazard manner in which, over the years, we have embarked on the building up of our county hospitals.  The pattern was haphazard because of the system of local government which we have here and under which completely artificial local boundaries put a limit on the obligations and duties of different authorities responsible for health services.</P>
    <P>Again, without desiring to indulge in hindsight, it certainly seems regrettable now that in those early years the actual requirements of the country <Col N="1226" /> in relation to hospital services were not fully investigated on the grounds of density of population, irrespective of whether an area of dense population spilled over a county boundary or not, and that instead of building a great number of small county hospitals, some imaginative mind did not see the need for five or six regional, local hospitals throughout the country which could have served as medical centres and which could have been served by a number of small, cottage type district hospitals built on logical lines.</P>
    <P>That is what might have been.  The fact is that this vast expenditure over the years has been devoted to the provision of a great number of small country hospitals and I fear that that process must continue.  I fear that the Minister is faced with the necessity that it must continue, until the county hospital scheme is eventually satisfied. For instance, the Minister is faced, I know, with an impelling need for a new county hospital in Cavan.  I know certain suggestions in that regard were made last year to the Cavan health authorities, but if they are not found feasible on examination, there is a county where the existing facilities are very much sub-standard and that can only be remedied by an addition to the long list of some county hospitals, because unfortunately the Minister has no other way of meeting the difficulty if the suggestions that have been indicated are found on examination not to be feasible.</P>
    <P>In County Longford, there is urgent need for new county hospital facilities. I believe that need can be met only by the provision of a new county hospital and that in a county which has, in Mullingar, not far distant, a new hospital already provided and equipped and which has in Manorhamilton, not very far removed either, a new hospital, but one which can serve only a very limited portion of County Leitrim.  The dilemma with which the present Minister or any Minister for Health will find himself faced is that the needs of these isolated places not already provided for under the programmes over the years can be met only by the provision of more hospital beds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> In Waterford, there is, too, very grave need for better general hospital facilities.  Indeed, it was in relation to the situation in Waterford that the suggestion was made to the bodies concerned that the new sanatorium at Ardkeen might be used, with certain necessary adaptations, for general hospital purposes, and I am very glad to read into what the Minister has said that that suggestion looks like bearing fruit.  If it is possible to use Ardkeen for general hospital purposes, that will provide an example to the country of what can be done with a bit of common sense towards utilising worthwhile buildings for purposes other than those for which they were designed, while, at the same time, meeting a very grave public need.  I hope that, by the adaptation of Ardkeen, the people of Waterford will find themselves very quickly provided with the new general hospital they require so urgently.</P>
    <P>It was considerations along the line I have mentioned, added to the grave shortage of capital in recent years, which brought about a very careful consideration of the question as to how in future we should develop our hospital programme.  I had to consider that very fully indeed.  I was aware, on the one hand, that, by reason of the pattern over the years, certain hospital projects were needed and must proceed. I was aware also that the capital required for their construction would not be as readily available in the future as it had been in the past. Added to these difficulties was the fact&mdash;a fact to which the Minister has not referred in any detail&mdash;that in the past two or three years, the burden of maintaining the voluntary hospitals as going concerns became more and more acute.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are probably aware, it has been the practice of the Minister for Health, acting in the capacity of a trustee dispensing Hospital Trust Funds, to pay a large proportion of the deficits of the voluntary hospitals, those deficits being, of course, the shortfall between revenue and expenditure. The hospitals which benefit under the deficit scheme are for obvious reasons very largely the teaching <Col N="1228" /> hospitals in Dublin City and Cork, though there are some other voluntary hospitals throughout the country.  If my recollection is correct, in the financial year ending in 1954, the deficits of the voluntary hospitals ran roughly around the £500,000 mark.  I am not now speaking of the actual deficits.  I am referring rather to the sum which was regarded as being sufficient to meet in some reasonable way the claims of the hospital authorities.  At the end of that year, the claims of the voluntary hospital authorities for that portion of their deficits not met had become so serious that special sanction was required to increase the various payments in respect of such deficits by roughly another £250,000. By 1955 and early 1956, payments of that order were being made out of trust funds to meet the deficits of these voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the autumn of last year, coincidental with the review of our hospital requirements, it was found that the deficit requirements of the voluntary hospitals had risen by another £200,000 and that they then approached the £1,000,000 mark. Deputies should remember that the income of the Hospitals Trust Fund last year&mdash;it has risen slightly since, I am glad to say&mdash;upon which decisions can be made was an income of roughly £2,000,000.  From this income, the voluntary hospitals had to be kept in operation and, in addition, some form of rational programme had to be devised whereby future urgent hospital projects could be met.</P>
    <P>To devise a building programme circumscribed by these difficulties meant that a certain number of decisions had to be taken, decisions involving considerable elements of chance.  It was my duty to draw up a form of working programme in respect of which some possibility of its being financed over the years could be entertained. I felt that the correct approach to that problem was, first of all, to meet, not in full but in large measure, out of the yearly income of the Trust Fund, the deficits of the voluntary hospitals and then to decide what new hospital building could be financed with the balance of the yearly income of the Trust Fund.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> I do not know whether it will appeal to the Minister or not but, certainly, I left for his examination and consideration a limited programme which I feel he could and will be able to finance.  It will involve, and has involved this year, a certain amount of borrowing, if you like, from the income of the Trust Fund next year but that was a position which could not be avoided.  It is a programme which, if it is adhered to, will, I think, mean that over the next few years the urgent hospital projects can in fact be provided.</P>
    <P>It will mean that a number of people will be disappointed.  For instance, there are, as Deputies are aware, four major hospital projects which have been talked about for a number of years and in respect of which I suppose there have been very clear commitments by the State.  There is to be a new Coombe Hospital, a new St. Vincent's Hospital, a new St. Laurence's Hospital in the city.  There is also to be a new regional hospital for Cork.  I think it is clear&mdash;certainly it was clear to me&mdash;that all those four projects could not be financed simultaneously and, accordingly, in any building programme of any rational size, based on due regard for the financial capacity of the Trust Fund, it will be necessary to select out of those projects such of them as should have priority.</P>
    <P>It was my view, but the Minister may take a different view, that of those four projects priority should be given to the Coombe Hospital because, as Deputies are aware, there is an urgent need in this city, despite all the hospitalisation we have had over the years, for additional and better maternity accommodation.  The building of a new Coombe Hospital would be of considerable importance, particularly in Dublin, in view of the very fine record our maternity hospitals have obtained over the years.</P>
    <P>I felt that of these four projects priority should be given to the new Coombe Hospital and to St. Vincent's Hospital in view of its relation to the new university project and to the problem of medical teaching.  I do not know what view the Minister may have <Col N="1230" /> with regard to these matters but that is the manner in which my mind was running.</P>
    <P>Apart from the two major units which I felt could be financed over the years, I also made provision in the tentative programme which I drew up for other urgent needs throughout the country.  I was aware that in County Monaghan, for instance, there is an overcrowding problem in the local authority hospital and that provision had to be made to meet the very urgent claims in that regard of the people of Monaghan.</P>
    <P>In addition, in various parts of the country there were, and are, similar urgent needs in relation to general hospitals.  Apart from the requirements of the various health authorities for increased accommodation in their general hospitals and the need for further maternity accommodation throughout the country, there is also the very grave need that exists in many parts of the country in relation to the improvement and possible extension of mental hospital accommodation. That cannot be overlooked. I am glad that the Minister referred to that in his statement and I hope that, within the funds available to him, everything possible will be done to meet, either by adjustment or otherwise, the needs of mental hospital authorities.</P>
    <P>It was because of considerations such as I have mentioned that a new hospital programme was in process of being defined.  In fact, so far as I was concerned, the process had ended and definition was complete.  It is a matter entirely for the Minister now as to whether he will proceed along that line or, as he appears to have indicated, deal with the problem on some other lines, but I want to assure the House, so far as I and my colleagues are concerned, that we recognise very fully the problem which faces the Minister in relation to the hospital requirements of the country.  We recognise very fully that in that regard the Minister has a very serious financial problem on his hands.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I would express the hope that the size of the problem <Col N="1231" /> would not&mdash;and I am sure will not&mdash; drive the Minister into a decision which in fact will mean that any one of the urgent projects, not major projects but smaller projects, will be postponed. I think the urgent ones can be done. It is a question of opinion as to which are urgent and which are not, but I think there are quite a number of very urgent requirements which it is possible to fill over the next few years.</P>
    <P>May I express the hope&mdash;and I think that in this connection I am supporting the view the Minister seems to have expressed in his speech&mdash;that, in relation to the adaptation and use for other purposes of existing hospitals, there will be a more generous understanding of the financial problem facing both the Minister and the health authorities, and also of the duty owing by all to make sure that hospitals are used as hospitals?</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember some time ago that there was a sanatorium in this country which was created out of a hospital designed and intended for other purposes.  In fact, this sanatorium was intended to be used as a mental hospital.  By reason of the very grave need at the time for the provision of beds for tuberculosis sufferers, with the agreement of the local health authorities, it was decided to turn that hospital into a sanatorium.  When that decision was reached, the people in the town affected were enormously concerned. They did not mind having a mental hospital in their town but they strongly objected to the plague being brought to it.  They organised to some effect against the decision.  Fortunately, the local agitation did not lead to the alteration of the decision and the mental hospital became a sanatorium.</P>
    <P>About 12 or 18 months ago, happily it was possible to reach the stage whereby it could be decided that this building was no longer required for tuberculosis and accordingly it was decided that it should be handed back to the mental hospital authority.  But, lo and behold, there was another agitation.  The people of the town again got together.  They wanted to retain the sanatorium because, in the interval, apparently, the awful effects <Col N="1232" /> of the plague had not affected them, but the monetary return that came from patients' visitors going to the sanatorium did affect them.  The suggestion was solemnly made by public representatives that it should become the duty of the Minister for Health and the health authority concerned to retain this hospital as a sanatorium, although, in fact, happily, it was no longer required for that purpose because the incidence of tuberculosis had disappeared.  That is an example of the kind of unhelpful approach which can make more and more difficult the rational development of hospital services in this country.</P>
    <P>The switching of many other sanatoria throughout the country should now be possible.  There are quite a number of other buildings at present used for tuberculosis purposes which can now be used for other purposes, provided all sides of the House, others whom we can influence and health authorities realise the need for it.  Our mental hospitals, with some exceptions, are overcrowded.  We need more and more accommodation for mental defectives, as the Minister has mentioned. In some parts of the country, there is still a scarcity of accommodation for maternity cases.  In many parts of the country, due to the pattern of hospitalisation, the number of general hospital beds is not adequate.  In those circumstances, it appears wrong that we should not try to draw into the three regional sanatoria as many cases as possible in order to make free the smaller temporary tuberculosis sanatoria for other purposes.</P>
    <P>I see Deputy Mooney behind the Minister.  May I hope that he bears that in mind?  There is that problem&mdash; at least it was&mdash;in County Monaghan. In any event, I am glad to learn from the Minister's statement that the process of using existing hospital accommodation for other and more urgent needs is engaging his attention, and I hope that everybody who can help in that regard will help, both here and elsewhere throughout the country.</P>
    <P>May I pass from consideration of the hospital position and the building programme to other matters which are allied to some extent?  The Minister <Col N="1233" /> very properly referred to the size of the expenditure required for maintenance of our hospitals and for the provision of health services.  I feel, with the Minister, that the expenditure which has been incurred and which he seeks to-day from the House is fully justified.  Every penny spent wisely on the provision of amenities in relation to health services and on the services themselves is money well spent.  That of course does not mean that due regard should not always be paid to the elimination of expenditure which, through experience, has been found not to be fruitful.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the health authorities with whom I had experience, particularly in the last 12 months when I had occasion to ask them to examine their health expenditure with a view to seeing whether they could, without curtailing in any way the quality of health services, effect any economies.  I have not got the details with me but my general recollection is that the response of the health authorities to that appeal was extremely satisfactory and that the health authorities found, on a fresh examination of methods which perhaps had been in use for a long time, that quite a substantial saving could be achieved.  In particular an effort was made last year to have a full examination of the internal working and administration of certain large hospitals, particularly sanatoria, with a view to seeing if savings could be effected.  I think one working party, if not two, embarked on such a mission and again met full co-operation from the local authorities affected and were able to achieve considerable savings.</P>
    <P>Without suggesting that the Vote which the Minister seeks is in any way excessive I do hope that the effort at examining, where possible, the details of expenditure will continue and that it will continue to receive full co-operation from local bodies and from those who can influence them.  I notice that the Minister did not give us any of his views as to whether certain health authorities should be unified or not.  Perhaps it may not have been in order for the Minister to give any indications of policy on his Estimate <Col N="1234" /> but I just express the hope that the suggestions of a unified health authority in Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Dublin will be examined by him, I always regard that scheme as being one way of getting rid of the absurd local government divisions which unjustly make the administration of our health services so expensive.  I hope that the Minister will examine these schemes as sympathetically as possible. Last year I availed of the opportunity of discussing these proposals with the health authorities concerned and I hope my advocacy in that regard has won some support.</P>
    <P>May I make another suggestion to the Minister with reference to a matter completely removed from much of what I have been discussing?  It is a matter of administration.  It concerns the administration of an important service in the country, that is the provision of free medical service for those unable to provide such service for themselves, in other words, the present dispensary service.  I should like to remind Deputies that what we know as the dispensary medical service is quite an old service.  It was founded under the charitable legislation passed in Victorian England and it represented a provision made in accordance with British notions for urgent medical care for the poor of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The provision of such care here has developed and remained along lines quite different from the development in Britain.  We all know that it was a very common practice for the British Parliament, when it had the right to legislate for Ireland, to try experiments here but to develop along different lines in England itself.  As the provision of medical service for the poor has developed we have had the dispensary system made into something immutable, something which apparently many people regard as being incapable of change.  I think it should be changed.  I think the dispensary service in the country has outlived its use.</P>
    <P>Recognising as we all do the need for providing medical service for those who are unable to provide it for themselves, the only question then is how can such a service be provided.  One <Col N="1235" /> must recognise that there are parts of the country where, by reason of the poverty of the people and the scarcity of population, there may not be a practice for a medical practitioner.  In those areas, and because of those considerations, it may be necessary, and obviously it is necessary, for the State, or the health authority, to subsidise a doctor, to pay him a sufficient sum to enable him to remain in that locality and to provide there, as part of his duty, the needed medical care for poor people.  That, of course, is the justification for our present dispensary system and the only defence that can be adduced for its continued operation.</P>
    <P>When we leave such areas and have regard to our large centres of population, the City of Dublin, Cork and other cities where there is no shortage of doctors whatsoever, where there are available to the people the services of any number of doctors and where there is a living to be made by medical practitioners, as proven by the fact that doctors' door plates jostle one another in different parts of the city, in those circumstances the need for subsidising medical services in such centres of population is not apparent.  The only case for paying a doctor is to keep him in a certain district.  In our large centres of population, there is no shortage of medical practitioners.  That is one side of the case.</P>
    <P>There is the other and more important aspect, which is that if the State recognises a duty&mdash;and it is a very clear duty&mdash;to provide medical care for persons who cannot afford to provide such care for themselves, there is no reason why such a person should not be entitled to go to the doctor of his or her choice.  I think that a free choice of doctor for those entitled to free medical services is a provision which should be made.  I am sure Deputies appreciate that at the moment any person entitled to, or holding a medical card, who requires medical attention is entitled to go only to the dispensary doctor in his particular district.  If the dispensary doctor is not available he will have to go to whatever locum tenens is in his <Col N="1236" /> place, but he is not entitled to go to anyone else.  If, in fact, he does fail to get the dispensary doctor and no substitute arrangements have been made, then, and only then, may he go to somebody else, but he will have to pay whatever fee is asked.  It becomes a matter for machinery later on as to whether such a fee may be recovered from the doctor who should have attended him.</P>
    <P>There is no choice, and it does not matter in the slightest whether the patient has confidence in the doctor to whom he has to go.  That does not enter into it.  Only the particular dispensary medical officer for the district can provide the service which is required. If the person to whom I have referred happens to have a wife and she is expecting a baby, as an expectant mother she is entitled to go to any doctor she selects herself&mdash;any doctor who has made an agreement with the health authority concerned or any health authorities.  She has a free choice of doctor in relation to her condition of pregnancy.  Not only has she a free choice of doctor but, as appears from the Minister's statement, and as has been said on many occasions, she is encouraged to go as quickly as possible and seek the advice and counsel of her doctor, and it is not her health authority's doctor; it is not the State doctor; it is the doctor she selects herself, the man in whom she has confidence.</P>
    <P>That maternity service is working well with the full support of the medical profession and with the full support of persons who can advise and influence mothers to avail of it.  It is working well because it is based on the idea of a free choice and encouragement from the State to women to avail of it, but the operation of a free choice of doctor in maternity cases, placed side by side with our present dispensary conditions, leads to absurd anomalies.  Mrs. White may be attending Dr. Black because she is expecting a baby.  She may have the greatest confidence in Dr. Black but if, on her way out from Dr. Black's house, she slips and sprains her ankle she cannot go back to Dr. Black.  She must go to Dr. Green, the dispensary doctor, <Col N="1237" /> though he may be a man with whom she has had words because she originally went to Dr. Black instead of going to Dr. Green.  That is an absurd situation.</P>
    <P>I felt very strongly as Minister that the justification for the present dispensary system, unmodified, ceased once the operation of the maternity services became possible.  Once it became possible, in April of 1956, to provide in a practical way the general practitioner care for mothers, I felt that the present dispensary system no longer should be continued in the country.  Indeed, I made a statement some time before the last general election that my views were along that line and that I felt modification was necessary.  I know too, in that regard, like all things that are desirable, that there is the financial element.  I am well aware that if the Minister made an administrative decision to provide through health authorities free medical services, with a free choice of doctor, he would be faced with the need of superannuating a number of existing dispensary doctors.  I proposed an examination of what that cost might be.  I have not the figures before me now but I am certain they would be available to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the sum involved would be so enormous as to dispose of further consideration of this matter. It will be remembered&mdash;indeed, I think it was a decision of mine which certainly kept this aspect in mind&mdash;that for some years back no permanent dispensary appointments have in fact been made in Dublin City or, I think, in Cork.  The reason usually advanced is that, by reason of new building in the city, the limits of existing dispensaries cannot be regarded as permanent. One object was to facilitate the alteration of the present system, where possible.  I believe the financial element involved, if it were applied gradually over a number of years, could be considered if a start were made in Dublin in respect of a free choice of doctor to those entitled to medical services, even to start with a pilot scheme&mdash;if, for instance, the Crumlin and Kimmage and Drimnagh areas were taken.  So far as I can <Col N="1238" /> recollect, the appointments in that area are all temporary appointments.</P>
    <P>In one of the Crumlin dispensaries, two or three additional doctors are brought in to do relief work.  If a pilot scheme were embarked on there, I am quite certain many of the complaints about the operation of the services under Section 14 would begin to disappear and that those whom it should be our concern to provide with the best possible service, the poor, would realise that something worth while is being done for them.  In any event, I feel it is a worthwhile departure and I hope the Minister will not have a closed mind on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to certain public health services in operation in the city&mdash;the tubercular services and the various vaccination and immunisation services in relation to different diseases.  He made a passing reference to the new anti-polio vaccination scheme.  When he is replying, I hope the Minister will tell us how many children have come under that scheme &mdash;in other words, of the estimated figure upon which a scheme was based, what has been the response?  In addition, I should like to know whether steps were taken by health authorities adequately to acquaint parents of the desirability of availing of this scheme. I was myself at some disadvantage in knowing exactly the details in relation to what particular period it is necessary to apply to have children included in the scheme.  I did not observe any effort by health authorities to advertise in any large way.  I should like the Minister to deal with that.</P>
    <P>I was through the wards of St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork, last year in the middle of the epidemic.  It would be a tragedy if the general public did not avail fully of the present vaccination services made available by health authorities.  As the Minister said, it is not possible to say whether or not the vaccine will give an immunity or what immunity it will give, but the indications are that probably it will be a defence against this appalling disease. Nobody who was present in Cork City last summer and who had any experience of the ravages of such a disease <Col N="1239" /> amongst young children could have any hesitation in supporting in every possible way parents in availing of the scheme.</P>
    <P>While the Minister might not like to say it, perhaps I, having no responsibility, may say it.  It is well that people should realise that the incidence of polio in Dublin City at the end of last summer and right throughout the autumn gave very grave grounds for anxiety.  In the ordinary course of events, this year is the year when we could expect a polio epidemic&mdash;not last year but this year.  Were such an epidemic to come, with this vaccination service available, it would indeed be tragic if the public did not respond adequately.  I was glad to see that scientific advice on the subject in England indicates it is possible, even in the event of an epidemic, to continue vaccination.  Nevertheless, I hope the public will respond to the availability of these services.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter which I should like to raise.  If the Minister tells me he has no responsibility for it I must accept that, but I think it is a matter that should be discussed even in a slight respect.  I refer to the problem of medical education in this country. I do not desire to discuss the education aspect of it because that is the responsibility of the Minister for Education.  At the same time, Deputies should be aware there is a very grave danger that recognition by outside countries, particularly Great Britain, of our medical degrees may be withdrawn unless our medical schools conform to certain standards suggested outside.</P>
    <P>I know that there are difficulties in dealing with this problem but I do hope that the Minister, in any efforts he may make to deal with the problem of medical education, will get support because it would be a very serious problem for the country if the position of our medical schools were in any way endangered.  We have at the moment in Cork and Galway, outside Dublin, two important medical schools which in all probability would not be there if recognition of our medical schools were withdrawn in 12, 18 months or <Col N="1240" /> two years' time.  I hope that aspect of this danger will be recognised by all concerned.</P>
    <P>May I say to the House in conclusion that I think the statement which the Minister made to-night and the statistics which he gave us, afford evidence of the continued improvement in our health services in the country?  The developments in the past 18 months or two years in individual health services were welcomed, particularly the improvement in the mother and child service.  As the Minister has said, that is an important development because it deals with one of the black spots so far as the health of this country is concerned and that is the alarmingly high incidence of infant mortality over the years.  I am glad that service is now in operation for those in respect of whom it is felt that a financial need existed.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the improvement in the falling incidence of tuberculosis has continued and I hope that such a good story can always be told.  While I have no doubt that in the work of the Minister's Department matters of difference will arise from time to time, certainly such differences that may arise between us in this House will not be without regard to the problems which face the Minister or any Minister for Health.  I should like to say, if the Minister will permit me, that he has available an excellent Department. Certainly, I found, as Minister, that I was extremely well served.  I know the Minister will be too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement which the Minister read to the House is a very heartening one indeed.  It is clear that the bill must be met now for the advances which have been made in the health services over the years.  Even though the bill appears to be a substantial one, very few either inside or outside the House have the slightest regrets that this very considerable sum of money must now be found and continue to be found in the years ahead so that we will see an end to preventable disease and a position created in regard to unavoidable disease wherein the medical profession and the nursing profession will be provided with the best possible facilities to treat people <Col N="1241" /> when they become ill, which is, of course, the prime responsibility of the Minister and his Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins raised a number of very interesting points.  Probably the most interesting is that dealt with to some extent by the Minister.  That is the attitude to hospital building. The point at issue is whether over the past 20 or 30 years we have spent the moneys at our disposal as effectively or, as Deputy O'Higgins said, as fruitfully as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to that, we should bear in mind that the State and the community have been spared the expenditure over the years of millions of pounds from the Central Fund and from taxation as a result of the magnificent Hospitals Sweeps enterprise. All that money would have had to come either from taxation or the rates. We have got into the habit of forgetting the fact that a normal society accepts this problem of providing <Col N="1242" /> hospitals for the sick as a normal demand on the communal funds in the form of rates or taxation.</P>
    <P>We recognise that same fact ourselves. We must find money for the provision of schools, houses and the building of roads.  There are a number of social necessities for which we must provide the money from the Central Fund and for which we can expect no return in material wealth.  In trying to get the sizeable burden which the Minister must now face in the years ahead into proportion, it would be worth bearing in mind that this burden has been greatly eased in the past 20 or 30 years by virtue of the fact that we could draw on the Hospitals Sweep fund during all that time.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
