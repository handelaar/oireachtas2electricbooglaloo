      <P>I dealt with this matter in the statement which I made in the House on 20th November.  Railway workshop employees of the G.N.R. have not any right under legislation to compensation when redundancy occurs.  The position of the workers who are transferred to the Dundalk Engineering Works will, therefore, be no different in this respect than it is at present.</P>
      <P>To avoid misunderstanding, I should perhaps make it clear that this observation does not apply to retirement pensions for which workers have contributed. I have informed the Dáil that the position in regard to these retirement pensions will be safeguarded by legislation.</P>

Thirdly, would the Minister not agree that, in view of the fact that it is more than likely that certain officers in his Department could have been concerned in these very serious charges which amounted to allegations of bribery and corruption, it was unfair to expect that an impartial and objective examination of these charges has been carried out and, in view of these facts, would the Minister now consider calling a public inquiry into these charges so as to allay the considerable public disquiet about the matter?</P>

      <P>The question of establishing a free port in this country was considered by the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, 1930, and by an Inter-departmental Committee in 1945.</P>
      <P>It emerged from these investigations that the cost of providing and maintaining the facilities which would be necessary would be very substantial and inquiries made both at home and abroad suggested that the extent to which they might be utilised was highly problematical.  I do not think the position has since altered in any important respect.</P>
      <P>If a proposal in regard to Tarbert or any other centre were made involving any contribution from public funds I would require to be furnished with convincing evidence that commercial interests were willing to contract to use the free port facilities to an extent which would justify the expenditure.</P>

      <P>Discussions with a South African Trade Delegation were held in Dublin in October last to review the position of trade between the two countries, with particular reference to our exports of tweed and bloodstock.  These discussions show that official barriers to the importation of goods into South Africa are now only nominal and that the development of exports from Ireland will depend on the revival of interest by South African purchasers.  Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, who were represented at the discussions, have already taken steps to bring to the notice of exporters the potentialities of South Africa as a market for Irish goods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state (a) the date of receipt in his Department of a letter from the South Cork Board of Public Assistance, requesting sanction for the increase of the bed complement in the Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher, by some 20 beds, (b) the date on which the letter was replied to, (c) the date on which sanction was notified by his Department, and (d) the reason for the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The original bed complement of this hospital was 133 beds.  A proposal was received in the Department on 27th June, 1956, from the South Cork Board of Public Assistance that portion of a vacant ward block (No. 4) should be used as a 13-bed ward.  I understand that on 27th July, 1956, the previous Minister <Col N="1329" /> for Health orally authorised the manager to equip the ward for 20 patients and to obtain the necessary equipment locally.</P>
      <P>A letter was subsequently received in the Department on 30th August, 1956, to the effect that the board had decided to increase the bed complement of the hospital by 67 beds to 200 beds and in a letter dated 2nd October, 1956, the board requested formal sanction to this increase in accommodation (i.e. 47 beds for poliomyelitis patients and 20 others, including 13 in ward block No. 4).  The board also applied for a grant from the Hospitals Trust Fund towards the cost of extra furniture and equipment, some of which had already been ordered.  No reply issued at the time in response to this application, as it was necessary, in view of the stringent financial situation, to defer decisions on a number of projects for which grants had been sought.</P>
      <P>It transpired subsequently that the bed complement at this hospital had in fact only been increased by 47 beds, from 133 beds to 180 beds.  Accordingly, it was suggested in a letter from my Department dated 21st September, 1957, that the bed complement should be extended to 200 beds.  On 23rd October, 1957, the Board of Assistance requested sanction to a proposal to increase the bed complement by an additional 20 beds to 200 beds.  The proposal was regarded as already authorised by letters from the Department dated 21st September, 1957, and 23rd October, 1957.</P>
      <P>In a letter dated 25th November, 1957, to the board my Department requested that all possible steps be taken to ensure that the additonal beds be brought into use at the earliest possible moment.  It was also found possible to arrive at a decision on the question of grant and a further letter issued to the local authority on 25th November, 1957, indicating that, subject to certain conditions, a grant would be made available of 50 per cent. of the additional cost involved in purchasing the furniture and equipment required in connection with the raising of the bed complement to 200 beds.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that at that time there was a serious outbreak of polio in Cork City and County?  Is he aware that three letters were written to his Department, one on 28th August, 1956, one on 2nd October, 1956, and one on 19th December, 1956, and that not one of these three letters was replied to until we got a letter from him on 23rd November, 1957?  Does he consider that that is efficiency in his Department&mdash;three letters waiting for 14 months for a reply&mdash;particularly when one remembers that there was a severe polio outbreak which had to be dealt with immediately?</P>

      <P>Introduction of the legislation which would be necessary to give effect to the Deputy's suggestion is not contemplated. I should perhaps mention that unless an interval of more than 13 weeks has elapsed since unemployment or disability benefit was last obtained, payment is in general made as from the first day in respect of which benefit is claimed.  Further, in some cases in which waiting days are necessary on a claim for unemployment benefit, payment of unemployment assistance may be made for the waiting days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay was primarily due to the failure of the claimant's last employer to reply to the usual request for confirmation of and other particulars relating to the employment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to hold up unemployment benefit in respect of claimants stated to have had agricultural employment until the usual inquiry form had been returned showing the claimant as having been employed was necessary because of the serious increase in fraudulent claiming of such benefit by agricultural workers generally.  A reminder is sent to the employer on the fourth day after the original inquiry and, if that does not secure a reply, direct inquiries by an official of the Department are initiated forthwith.  Normally, these are completed with the minimum delay.  In this case the illness of the employer created a difficulty.</P>

In addition, inquiries are being made in respect of 16 estates comprising 1,295 acres.  The Land Commission <Col N="1345" /> have on hands about 700 acres of arable land in this county and there will be no avoidable delay in the disposal thereof.  An area of 402 acres has been divided in County Waterford to date this year, but it is not possible at present to indicate what further allotments will be made during the current financial year.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take together Questions Nos. 62 and 63 both of which are presumed to relate to the same incident.</P>
      <P>The exclusive fishery limits of the State are defined in the Sea Fisheries Protection Act, 1933, as that portion of the seas within which citizens of the State have by international law the exclusive right of fishing.  Most Deputies will be aware that in international law an exclusive right of fishing is recognised within what is called the three mile limit.  The exclusive right extends to three miles from any island forming part of the national territory as well as to three miles from the mainland.  The three mile limit is the minimum acknowledged under international law.  Wider claims are made by many countries.</P>
      <P>Within the three mile limit our exclusive right is not open to question and successful prosecutions have been frequently brought in order to protect that right.  Indeed, since the decision in the case at Bantry, another district justice has accepted the submissions made on behalf of the State on this point and has convicted.  I am informed by the Attorney-General that an appeal by way of case stated would have been taken in the Bantry case if the defendant were available within the jurisdiction for service of the necessary notices.</P>

      <P>A half-acre of the State forest lands at Dunamore was leased is February, 1954, to a private individual at a nominal rent.  The lease, which is for 99 years, was made because the lessee had acquired a disused corn mill from the county council and the half-acre was required by him to enable a head of water to be built up.  The Department was not concerned with the precise proposals the lessee had in mind for the development of the mill and the working of the mill was not made a condition of the lease.

The results of that survey have been examined in my Department and observations thereon have been conveyed to the corporation with a view to assisting them to determine the net programme of new dwellings requiring to be erected during the next five years.  I understand that a further review of the figures undertaken by officers of the corporation has not yet been completed. Pending completion of this review and consideration of its results by me, I am not in a position to give an authoritative estimate of the present requirements.</P>

Of these sites, 66, for 79 cottages, have already been the subject of confirmation orders, and decisions covering a further 18 sites, for 27 cottages (including a site on the Bagwell estate, Marlfield, Clonmel, for eight cottages) will issue within the next few days.  I hope to be in a position to decide on the remaining 25 sites for 28 cottages very shortly.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state the reason for the delay in advertising the proposed regional water supply from Fethard to Killenaule and Drangan, and if, in view of the grave necessity for water in the area, he will take immediate steps to expedite the matter.</P>

      <P>The county council have not yet acquired the water rights, for the taking of a supply of water for this scheme.</P>
      <P>A petition for a provisional Order authorising the county council to acquire compulsorily certain water rights was submitted on the 12th December, 1956.  By reason of a legal flaw in the petition, which became evident at the local inquiry held on the 20th March, 1957, the proposal was invalidated.  The petition was accordingly refused on the 30th August last. A new petition was submitted on the 5th September and the necessary inquiry will be held as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>(a)  The information requested is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>(b)  The total mileage of road involved is approximately ten.</P>
      <P>(c)  The total cost of works carried out in the year 1955-56 was £44,333 and in 1956-57 was £30,006.  Final figures are not yet available for 1957-58 but are estimated at £42,000.</P>
      <P>(d)  For the years 1955-56 and 1956-57 the full cost of works (excluding land acquisition) was borne by the Road Fund apart from a local contribution of £3,000 to the cost of a bridge work. Until final figures are available for 1957-58 it is not possible to say what the Road Fund and local contributions will be.  Generally, it may be taken that 100 per cent. of the cost of works, including the cost of rebuilding walls, out-offices, etc., will be borne by the Road Fund.</P>
      <P>(e)  The estimated cost of upkeep would be a matter for determination by the road authority.  I understand, however, that the amount estimated for this purpose is approximately £180 per mile per annum.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether, in view of the high rate of engagements by Radio Eireann as a result of Dublin auditions as compared with rural auditions, he will consider having a certain percentage of engagements allocated each year to applicants outside Dublin in order to give more encouragement to rural performers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must explain to the Deputy that engagements to broadcast are not offered solely as the immediate result of auditions.  Many of the programmes are of necessity planned in the first instance by the programme officers, who then commission the artistes best fitted by talent, training and experience to execute them.  Since the maintenance of standards sufficient for the satisfaction of the listeners is the overriding consideration in broadcasting it would not be wise to make a rigid and artificial division of engagements into those for Dublin artistes and those for artistes residing elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy, however, that every possible effort is made by Radio Eireann to find, train and reward talent in every corner of Ireland.  The vast quantity of material required to fill some 3,500 hours of broadcasting in the year would alone ensure such efforts, but the social desirability of employing rural talent is also fully realised.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1957, which I am asking the House to approve, is related with the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1956.  As Deputies are aware, that Act provided for increases in pensions to State servants who had retired prior to the 1st November, 1952.  When the provisions of the Act came to be applied to a particular ex-Superintendent of the Garda Síochána who had retired in 1951 and who was also in receipt of an Army pension, it was found that the aggregate of his dual pensions was held, under existing Pensions Orders, to a limit of two-thirds of his Garda retirement pay.  No provision was made in the 1956 Act to raise this limit to two-thirds of his notional pay on the 1st November, 1952, which would give him an increase of pension in conformity with that given to other State servants.  The purpose of the present Order is to repair that omission.</P>

    <Title>Rent Restrictions (Continuance and Amendment) Bill, 1957&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a short and, I think, non-controversial Bill, the object of which is to extend the Rent Restriction Acts for a further period of one year after the 31st December when they would otherwise expire.  In present circumstances these Acts could not be allowed to lapse without creating severe hardships to many tenants and for this reason I am sure that all sides of the House will be agreed as to the necessity for the Bill.</P>
      <P>Since the Government took office last March a fresh examination of the rent control problem has been initiated departmentally and when that examination has been completed I shall bring the matter before the Government. It has been necessary to approach the problem afresh in view of the economic and other relevant changes which have taken place since 1951-52, when the Conroy Report on Rent Control was prepared.  That report dealt comprehensively with all aspects of rent control and recommended not only that the existing controls should be retained but that they should be extended to all dwellings whenever built and whether let furnished or unfurnished.  It also recommended increases of rent for landlords who are liable for repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime the supply of new and reconditioned houses has improved but, of course, there is still a shortage of rented accommodation in the main urban areas, especially in Dublin and Cork where it will be some few years before full housing needs can be met.  In the meantime, too, more and more interests have been created under the rent restrictions code&mdash;a code which has now been over 40 years in existence&mdash;and these interests and the multitude of complicated legal relationships <Col N="1373" /> which are features of the system increase the difficulties in the way of arriving at a generally acceptable solution.</P>
    <P>In view of these considerations the Government will require to give careful study to the proposals which will be submitted to them and the drafting of any necessary legislation will take some time having regard to the complex character of this branch of the law. Accordingly, the period of one year for which it is proposed to extend the Acts cannot be regarded as excessive.  Extension for one year will not, in any event, preclude the introduction before then of the Government's legislative proposals on rent control, if available. Meanwhile, I shall adhere to the settled policy of not legislating &ldquo;piecemeal&rdquo; for particular recommendations of the commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill which is before the House provides for preserving the <i>status quo</i> for landlords and tenants during the period for which the Acts are being prolonged and, apart from the necessary changes in dates, it is identical with the Continuation Bills passed in recent years.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I think I should say that the Bill to give effect to the second report of the Conroy Commission&mdash;the Report on Reversionary Leases&mdash;has been passed by this House and is at present before the Seanad. I expect that it will become law early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>There can be no great objection to extending the Act for another year to enable the Minister to examine the legislation that he proposes to bring before this House, but I feel that, as the Minister has a legal colleague&mdash;the Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Moran&mdash;there should be no necessity for this extention. When I introduced these annual Bills I was told it was a simple matter to proceed with direct legislation and that there was no reason why any committee should be set up, or any inquiry made into the matter.  I was <Col N="1374" /> told that I was cowardly and ineffective, and I do not know what other ills I suffered from.  If the Minister now has the advice of his legal colleague in the Government, this extension for another year should be unnecessary.</P>
      <P>In any case, the Minister now has all the material required at his disposal. The County report is very elaborate and contains a fair amount of information to enable the Minister and the Government to make speedy decisions on right lines.  Rent restriction is a very difficult subject which has frequently been examined and in spite of that, the problems become more complex, but the Conroy report has gone a long way to clarify the matter and the Minister and the Government should avail of that report to bring this very serious and important matter to a speedy conclusion.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question.  The availability of housing is very relevant to the question of the renewal of the Rent Restriction Acts.  The ideal, of course, would be to create a situation in which there were more houses than tenants so that the ordinary operation of demand and supply would control rents.  When that stage was reached, if ever, an entirely new situation would arise.</P>
      <P>The Minister points out that the operation of Rent Restriction Acts is most effective in urban areas where demand for houses is most acute.  We asked his colleague to-day if he could give us any estimate of the Dublin Corporation view as to how many additional dwellings would be required in Dublin before outstanding demand was satisfied.  Could the Minister for Justice conveniently get for us in connection with this Bill any reliable estimate&mdash;not by any means a definitive declaration&mdash;of what local authorities or the appropriate division of the Department of Local Government believe is the likely figure of the number of dwellings still required, say, in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford to meet public demands and whether there is any estimate anywhere of how long it is likely to take to provide that number of dwellings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I am. I am asking what is the shortage of houses in the areas referred to by the Minister.  Housing in this country consists of three kinds, the small dwellings acquisition house in which the tenant becomes owner, the municipal house in which the tenant is the tenant of the municipality, and the rented house in which the tenant is the tenant of the landlord.  We are restricting rents in respect of landlords' houses because there is an overall shortage of accommodation. The ideal way to control landlords' rents would be to provide so many houses that the landlords would be looking for tenants instead of the tenants looking for landlords.  I should just like to know when is there a prospect of reaching that stage of balance?</P>
      <P>The operation of the Rent Restriction Acts over the last 40 years has virtually ended private building for letting.  The Rent Restriction Acts have operated to pass that burden on to local authorities.  Nobody now builds a row of houses to set because they anticipate that their rights to charge an economic rent will at some stage be controlled by law.  Therefore the old practice of investing money in bricks and mortar in preference to stocks and shares has virtually ended and we are driven to look elsewhere for the filling of this gap between demand and supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> It is highly relevant to the question of how long we should continue the operation of Rent Restriction Acts to find out when have we a prospect of closing the gap between total demand and total supply, because when that day comes I suggest our attitude towards rent restriction may be radically changed.  We are all prepared to agree that so long as there is a shortage of housing the operation of rent restrictions, whether desirable or undesirable, is unavoidable.  Therefore if the Minister could get that information in relation to the municipal housing requirements of the principal centres of population I would be much obliged to him.</P>

      <P>I do not think there can be any objection to this measure which simply continues existing legislation originally designed to ensure fair and equitable rents, and specifically designed I would say, to protect the tenant in a situation where the supply of houses is not sufficient to meet the needs of the people.</P>
      <P>I am wondering whether, recently or in the past, it has been considered that local authorities should be brought within the scope of rents restriction legislation.  I understand that originally local authorities were excluded because nobody could conceive a situation in which a local authority would charge what might be regarded as excessive rents.  If that is so, and if we are to have continuing legislation restricting rents, I think the Minister, or perhaps a successor, will have to look at the situation in the light as to whether or not it is advisable to include local authorities in such legislation.</P>
      <P>I have noticed from Press reports and from my own experience that the rents charged by certain local authorities appear to be excessive; the tenant has no appeal since it is a function of the manager.  I believe that a local authority tenant should have the same redress in law as any other tenant. Perhaps the Minister would indicate whether that aspect has been considered or whether he intends considering bringing local authorities within the scope of rents restriction legislation.</P>

      <P>So complex is permanent legislation, I do not think it would be possible to deal with it in this sort of discussion.  We would have to know first of all exactly what we were discussing.  At the moment we cannot say what we are discussing because the matter has not been brought to the attention of the Government. It is popular for Deputies on the Opposition Benches more or less to taunt the members on this side of the House with the fact that they neglected to do something they should have done, something they themselves did not do, and so on.  I could continue on that line, but I do not think it is desirable to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though I am hoping, it is not at all certain that a permanent measure will come before the House even in the next session because the matter has not been touched upon at all either by the last Government or the Government which preceded it.  At the moment I am almost submerged in legislation of a particularly complex legal type and it is not possible for me to say when I will be in a position to bring a permanent measure before the Government, much less bring it before the House.  When it is brought before the Government, it will take a considerable time to discuss it and come to decisions as to what recommendations of the Conroy Commission should or should not be accepted.  Certain matters will have to be decided before we can present the draft heads to the draftsman.  The question then will be how quickly the draftsman will be able to deal with the measure.  It would not be fair for me to suggest to the House that a permanent Bill will come before the House even in the next session, though I shall do my best to meet the demands which have been <Col N="1378" /> made in relation to the introduction of such a measure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked some questions about local authority houses.  It may be of some interest to know that the number of houses completed in Dublin since 1947 amounted to 16,463 and in other urban areas 15,468.  Since 1952 to date, 8,991 houses have been constructed in Dublin and 8,544 in other areas.  That will, of course, relieve the situation to which Deputy Dillon referred to some extent.  It may also be of interest to Deputies to know that it is estimated that 11,767 houses will be required in Dublin according to the estimate for local authority housing needs on 30th September last.  I suppose we could call that 12,000 houses. In Cork City 2,075 houses are estimated as being necessary to meet the needs of that area.  In other urban areas 3,433 houses and in rural areas 5,671 houses are estimated as being required.  That makes a grand total of 22,946 houses, or approximately 23,000 houses.  That is the number estimated to be required before one could in fact bring in the type of relief that Deputy Dillon was, I think, suggesting could be given if housing needs were met.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is merely a Continuation Bill.  If we were to discuss all the intricacies of this legislation we would need to have before us something in the nature of a permanent measure.  I am not in a position to bring such a measure before the House and I would be glad if the House would decide to give me all stages of this Bill now.</P>

    <Title>Gas Regulation Bill, 1957&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is the last of the Bills I have to produce to enable the Supplies and Services Act to lapse finally on 31st December, so that it represents the end of a process <Col N="1379" /> which most Deputies will be glad to see terminated.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been framed on the same principles as the Prices Bill which the Dáil recently passed.  Deputies may ask therefore why it was not incorporated with that Prices Bill.  The explanation is that there is in existence a highly complex code of legislation relating to gas charges and the question of gas charges is a rather specialised one.  It was considered desirable therefore that policy relating to gas charges should be made effective by means of a separate Bill which will form part of that code of legislation to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>The principal statute relating to the control of gas charges is the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, and the powers contained in that Act were used to control charges for gas until the outbreak of the war in 1939.  Gas charges were controlled by means of Orders made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  A number of these Orders fixed maximum prices for certain companies; others fixed standard charges which were tied to dividends by a sliding scale.  If the charge for gas exceeded the standard charge, then the dividends had to be reduced and if the charge was less than the standard charge, then the dividends had to be increased.</P>
      <P>There were ten gas companies controlled by means of Maximum Prices Orders and six companies were subject to the other kind of Order which related dividends to standard charges. There were six other companies, mostly very small concerns, which were not subject to any form of control at all.</P>
      <P>All that system of controlling charges for gas broke down when war-time conditions developed.  The difficulty of maintaining supplies, the deficiency in coal availability and the low quality of coal which was procurable all operated to affect production costs.  All these measures for controlling the charges for gas in normal times had to be dispensed with and from then until now gas charges have been controlled under emergency legislation including the Supply and Services Act to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Supply and Services Act were <Col N="1380" /> allowed to lapse on the 31st December without new legislation, then these pre-war Acts would come into operation. I am sure Deputies will recognise that the restoration of gas charges to the levels which they were in 1939 would be out of the question because production costs are much higher now than they were before the war.  Apart from that consideration, it is desirable that there should be a new approach to the question of controlling gas charges and that the system in use before the war should be abandoned as unsuitable and unnecessary in the circumstances of to-day.</P>
    <P>Gas companies do not now enjoy the monopolistic position which they held in pre-war years.  They are subject to vigorous competition from both electricity and oil.  That competition ensures that their charges will not be excessive. Therefore, I think we can dispense with the existing statutory control machinery or the pre-war limitations on gas charges and dividends, subject to the enactment of this legislation which will permit of control being reintroduced if circumstances should make that course necessary.</P>
    <P>The circumstances which I envisage are those which are provided for in the Prices Bill.  That is to say, when the advisory committee has reported that the charges of a particular gas company are too high or alternatively that because of temporary circumstances gas is in short supply.  I explained to the Dáil during the Second Reading of the Prices Bill the reasons which led to the decision that the procedure for price control which was set out in that Bill was the most suitable in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves.  The argument in favour of applying the procedure to the commodities and services covered by the Prices Bill applies with equal force in the case of gas charges.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that some of our gas companies have never been subject to control in relation to charges and I do not propose that they should be brought within the scope of the present measure.  Most of them are only maintaining themselves with difficulty at the present time.  Therefore it is <Col N="1381" /> only the larger and more important gas companies which will come within the scope of this Bill.  These are the gas companies operating in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Wexford, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Galway and Cobh.</P>
    <P>A number of other gas undertakings are in municipal ownership and, since they are being operated in the interests of the ratepayers, I do not think there is any need to bring them within the scope of this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that that protection can be given by way of control, judging from my information of the finances of these undertakings. Most of them are in difficult financial conditions.  Any attempt to deal with their charges by way of control would, I think, result in a decision to cease business, which would be generally regarded as undesirable.  A number of smaller companies have in fact ceased business because of their inability to cover rising costs with rising revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position will be that there will be power under this Bill to reimpose control where circumstances require <Col N="1382" /> it, either because of evidence of excessive charges due to circumstances outside the control of the operators or because temporary conditions produce temporary scarcities.  These are the same principles embodied in the Prices Bill and we are applying them to this Bill.  The only reason for a separate Bill is the existence of this code of legislation and the practice of dealing with gas charges as a separate matter for legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill I do not like at all.  In it the Minister has used a significant phrase.  If somebody does something there will always be power to reimpose controls. In other words: &ldquo;If you do not do what we say, then you are going to get it; we are going to give it to you in a way you will feel most.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the Minister made the case against the Bill when he said that gas is now in competition with the E.S.B. and everybody like that.  The authority the E.S.B. has to increase charges is that they want to earn sufficient to maintain their undertaking and to pay their charges and expenses.  I do not think any gas company is able to do more than that this minute.  Bearing in mind the increased cost of coal and everything else the time has come when, in my opinion, undertakings like these should be allowed to manage their own business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is going that far he should go the whole way.  The Minister is saying that he is keeping the power to reimpose controls.  In other words, if the company does not do what the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the time being wants it to do, then you can come down on it with a big stick.  You are keeping that power and you have that threat.  That is the kind of legislation that I dislike intensely. There is always someone in the background to hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no brief for the gas people but I think that these gas concerns are some of the concerns that ought to be entitled now, if it is not now too late, <Col N="1383" /> to manage their own business in their own way so that the law of supply and demand will operate as to what they will charge and as to what the price will be for their products.  The less interference we have with these concerns the better for everybody.  There is now no restrictive power in the Minister or the Government to control what charges may be made by concerns such as the E.S.B. because they have to charge sufficient to meet their capital commitments.  But when one of these gas companies proceeds to make some money you are ready to hit them.  They also find it necessary to defray their capital charges and running expenses.  I suppose there is nothing we can do about it but this is a type of legislation that I do not like.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in such complete agreement with the views expressed by Deputy MacEoin that my only need now is to show that this Bill is doing exactly what he desires it to do.  At the present time the price of gas is controlled under Orders made under the Supplies and Services Act and after the 31st December next the price will not be subject to any official control.  However, we are taking power to reimpose controls if there is an inquiry by an advisory committee which finds that the prices charged for gas are excessive due to causes within the control of the management or, alternatively, where some temporary crisis arises, perhaps because of some trade dispute in Britain which would make it difficult to obtain supplies of coal, in which case it would be necessary to keep the situation in hand until the temporary crisis had passed.</P>
      <P>I contemplate that, apart from any such temporary crisis that I have mentioned, controls will not, in fact, be exercised.  In the case of the smaller gas companies, many of which are having difficulty in continuing to carry on, there is no question of control.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 32, to delete &ldquo;general&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During the discussion on the Committee Stage the point was raised that the use of the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; might be a source of some confusion as between the director and the council. There was a fairly lengthy debate as to the meaning and effect of the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; and an undertaking was given at the time that this matter would be considered.  Consideration has been given to it and, while it does not appear that the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; would have the effect that was stated here, the advice was that it could be dispensed with.  The amendment, therefore, proposes to achieve this end.</P>

      <P>I think this is the amendment that covers the point that Deputy MacEoin was about to make.  The right of the council to delegate its authority to the director was also raised in the course of the debate here, and a similar undertaking was given that the matter would be examined.  On examination, it was felt that the council had the right to delegate its authority, and this amendment is being moved to ensure that there can be no possible ambiguity about the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A queer situation has arisen in connection with these three amendments.  The original scheme of this Bill, as introduced by me in December, 1956, envisaged that the chairman and the director would be the same person in very much the spirit in which the president of one of the constituent colleges of the National University presides over the governing body.  In those circumstances, it was thought obvious that the functions of the director would be carried on in general consultation with the council over which the director was, in fact, presiding, and there followed from that a series of consequential provisions.  As far as I can see, what has happened is that the present Government decided they would separate the office of chairman of the council from that of the director so that there would be two persons instead of one.  In the Bill as submitted on the Second Stage, in page 4, Section 7 provides:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" />&ldquo;The director shall be the chief officer of the institute and shall control and direct the activities and staff of the institute subject to the general direction of the council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That appeared to me to imply that while the council would control policy, it was only in respect of broad matters of policy that the council would take decisions, but that between meetings of the council and for minor matters of administration the control would be in the hands of the director.  Deputy Major de Valera took it into his head to propose that we should delete the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; because, he said, there seemed to be some inconsistency in allowing the director to function without the direct approbation of the council in respect of everything he did.</P>
    <P>I argued strongly on the Committee Stage that that was a mistaken view, that if you took out the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; you would severely circumscribe the powers of discretion of the director and you might create&mdash;and I think very probably would create&mdash;a situation under this Bill similar to that with which the present Minister for Agriculture will be familiar from his past experience on local authorities.  I can remember, before the County Management Bill was passed, that if you were a member of a board of health you would find the ridiculous situation that you were presented once a month with an agenda of 60 items, many of which were seeking authority for the head of the county home to buy a basin and ewer and that months might pass during which the agenda would be so long that we would never reach so trivial a matter, with immense consequential inconvenience for one of the institutions under the control of the local authority.  It was an intolerable situation and it was to remedy it that county managers were introduced. To them you gave the worry of all these detailed matters which should not be made the subject of debate by the governing authority and subjected to the intolerable delays that arise through the practical impossibility for the governing body of dealing with such matters.</P>
    <P>I instanced the case in connection with this institute that it seemed to <Col N="1390" /> me clear that the words &ldquo;that the director shall be the chief officer of the institute and shall control and direct the activities and staff of the institute subject to the general direction of the council&rdquo; implied that the director would be authorised to employ and discharge minor employees and to exercise a wide discretion dealing with minor administrative matters that would arise between meetings of the council.  As I read the Bill, if these amendments are adopted the director will not be able to do these trivial things without the direction of the council because he now is appointed &ldquo;to control and direct the activities and staff of the institute subject to the direction of the council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Oddly enough, this second amendment seems to move in precisely the opposite direction to that in which amendment No. 1 moves because amendment No. 1 desires to restrict the authority of the director and require prior approbation of the council while in amendment No. 2 it is proposed to authorise that the members of the staff of the institute shall be appointed or removed by or under the authority of the council.  Here we are creating a power in the council to delegate its authority in respect of certain matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were discussing the Second Reading the question was raised on sub-section (2) as to whether the director, in the ordinary run of his duties, could not hire or fire a very minor official, or even a charwoman, as Deputy Dillon put it.  The House agreed that he should have that right under the authority of the council.  This amendment has been introduced to make clear that the council of the institute, while keeping complete authority over the appointment and dismissal of staff, may in certain cases authorise the director to give employment to minor staff members or to release them.  I do not think that the Deputy, when he reads this, will object to it.  In sub-section (3) it is clearly set out that before making an appointment to the research staff of the institute the council itself has to go through a certain procedure to make certain that <Col N="1391" /> they are appointing a person who is suitable and competent.  They have to set up a board which will recommend a candidate back to the council for appointment.</P>
      <P>Under sub-section (4) of this same section the numbers, grade, remuneration, tenure of office and conditions of service of staff shall be determined from time to time by the council.  It is quite obvious therefore that what this amendment does is to leave employment, its terms and conditions, to the council of the institute while giving the council power, as Deputies recommended&mdash;including Deputy Dillon&mdash;to authorise the director to make minor appointments or to terminate them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as that is clear I think the amendment is an improvement. I think the deletion of the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; is a great mistake in the previous amendment.  I had intended to argue strenuously against that but it was reached before I could attend here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that in Section 17, sub-section (2), even as amended, the word &ldquo;minor&rdquo; nowhere appears.  It has not anything to do with minor members of the staff being appointed to hold office.  Any member of the staff can be appointed on that, as it stands.  I do not understand the reason for bringing in in this situation the change in sub-section (2) when the rest of the section is in terms of the council, the people who draw up the regulations governing the employment of staff.  Before an appointment is made to an office on the research staff a selection board has to be appointed by the council and it reports back to the council.  Yet, the preceding sub-section says that appointments of members of the staff shall be made by or under the authority of the council, which apparently means some sort of delegation.  But the delegation only goes under sub-section (2) and then everything else in the scheme so to speak, the whole system of selection has still to be done by the council.  The Minister for External Affairs says the provision he mentioned applied only to minor members of the staff but the section does not say so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It was advocated that some amendment should be introduced in this section in order to provide that the director should have power, or could be given power by the council, to employ, say, a charwoman as Deputy Dillon put it, or people of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested to hear from the Minister for External Affairs, who is an ex-Minister for Finance, that charwomen are considered to be minor members of the staff because charwomen and their appointment did occupy a considerable amount of the time of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember, as Minister for Finance, coming in on the appointment of charwomen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember quite an amount of time being wasted going through the endeavours of the selection board to determine the number of children and other circumstances of charwomen but possibly it was from the national service point of view. However, I think these two amendments have to be taken together, and if it is intended to loosen up, if it is an effort to give the director or somebody under the director power to make minor appointments it is all to the good.  But what about Section 7 which we have passed?  Section 7 was the only thing new, I think, with regard to this legislation in comparison with the legislation that Deputy Dillon left behind.  In Section 7 we had a whole section dealing with the director of the institute.  It provided for his appointment and the terms and conditions were set out in sub-section (2) under which the chief officer shall control and direct the activities of the staff of the institute, subject, as set out in the sub-section, &ldquo;to the general direction of the council&rdquo;.  The man &ldquo;who shall control and direct the activities of the staff of the institute&rdquo;, the director, in recommending a staff activity was subject to &ldquo;general direction&rdquo; by the council in the Bill as originally introduced. Now it is proposed to make him subject to the &ldquo;direction&rdquo; of the council.  Take it from the point of view of the director.  When it was under the &ldquo;general direction&rdquo; of the council he <Col N="1393" /> would know what that meant.  The council would lay down general policy of control under which he would operate but the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; is now removed and he is under the &ldquo;direction&rdquo; of the council in every move he makes and that may mean a very difficult situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; meant another thing.  It is quite possible for an individual to take the bit in his teeth and ignore the council and there is much more likelihood of something like that taking place than there would be of the council interfering in every detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach is departing from the line he took on the Committee Stage of this Bill where I found myself, surprisingly enough, in agreement with the Taoiseach.  I understood the Taoiseach to say on that occasion: &ldquo;You cannot provide against a situation of a running war between the director and the council.&rdquo; Such a situation has only one satisfactory way of resolving it, and that is that they should part company, because there must be mutual confidence.  Just before the Taoiseach came in I was calling to mind circumstances which I believe the present Minister for Agriculture will confirm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> One of the reasons for the Managerial Act in local government was that the directors of institutions operated under the boards of health, with which I was familiar, were required to act under the direction of the boards of health and that resulted in the most absurd situations arising, with intolerably long agenda cluttered up with insignificant items, even to the absurd extent, I recollect, of an item seeking to authorise the reverend mother of the county home to buy a basin and ewer and, until a resolution was passed by the board of health, she could not buy it.  Now, that was ridiculous enough, but it became an abuse when the agenda grew so long that month after month an item of that kind was never reached.  To tell that tale here sounds almost idiotic, but the exasperation and the frustration that the director or controller of an institute or institution undergoes when he is told month after month by the secretary:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Oh, they did not reach that; you will have to wait,&rdquo; is unbelievable.</P>
    <P>I understood that sub-section (2) of Section 7 was concerned to give the director just that kind of discretion between meetings of the council, a discretion which would enable him to do the minor administrative work and take the minor administrative decisions appropriate for the effective implementation of the general direction of the council and I think the Government will create endless difficulties if they do not make that provision now.  If I may say so, with respect, I fully appreciate that Deputy Vivion de Valera was trying to contribute to a helpful solution of the problem, but I think he allows his mind to get diverted by a queer kind of passion to realise in this connection the pure, austere theory of ultimate authority and sees ghosts walking in the possibility that there might be a clash between the council and the director as to where their scope of authority extends.  I think the Taoiseach gave the right reply: &ldquo;We cannot legislate against that and, if that kind of thing arises, then they ought to part and get a director and a council which will work together.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What troubles me about a thing like this is that, suppose these kind of difficulties arise, it is not the kind of thing <Col N="1395" /> in connection with which any Minister for Agriculture will want to come in here with a Bill to amend this Bill because this Bill is entangled with a series of agreements with the Government of the United States and understandings with a variety of other persons; and nobody will want to come in here with an amending Bill because it will be suggested that, having passed the principal Bill as the implementation of a more or less agreed scheme, they are now coming in here to do what lawyers call &ldquo;heel-tapping&rdquo; in trying to alter the basis of the original plan which reflected the agreement arrived at.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything the Government can do at this stage because the House has passed the first amendment before I had the opportunity of discussing it.  I put it to the Minister for Agriculture, to the Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs, who are all interested directly or indirectly in this measure according to their respective positions, that they should reconsider this.  I am trying to make no capital out of this and I fully appreciate the difficulty of the drafting of this measure.  I do most earnestly exhort the Government to look at this again and, if they share my anxiety, will they consider an amendment in the Seanad restoring this word &ldquo;general&rdquo;?  I give an undertaking in anticipation that I will make no adverse comment upon it.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to disguise that I spent a protracted time trying to make up my mind as to whether or not Section 7 should be in the Bill when I was in office.  I finally decided it should not be.  I had no great cause for complaint when the late Senator Moylan presented the Bill with Section 7 in it.  I think the Government is making a really serious mistake in deleting this word &ldquo;general&rdquo; and I do earnestly press upon the Government to reconsider this matter before the Bill goes to the Seanad and, if necessary, amend it.  If the Government does that, I will guarantee that every facility will be given here, when the Bill comes back, to expedite its enactment into law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Dillon is forgetting that not only have we Section 7 dealing with the director and his functions, but we have also Section 5 which deals with the functions of the council of the institute.  Sub-section (1) of Section 5 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be a council, to be known as the Council of An Foras Talúntais, to carry out the general government of the institute and the administration of its affairs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If there was not in that a fairly clear indication that it was the general government they were to carry out, and not the particular day-to-day government, I would be rather more anxious about the deletion of the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; in relation to the activities of the director.  Now, where has the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; been cut out? What is left subject to the direction of the council in the sub-section?  If the Deputy reads it again he will see that what is left subject to the direction of the council are the activities and staff of the institute: &ldquo;The director shall be the chief officer of the institute and shall control and direct the activities and staff of the institute subject&rdquo;&mdash;as it now reads&mdash;&ldquo;to the direction of the council.&rdquo;  And the council are empowered and directed to carry out the general government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  If the Deputy sees any difference in what I have said, that is all right.  We come then to Section 17 where the Minister for Agriculture proposes to put in an amendment.  Up to now it read: &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of the next following sub-section.&rdquo;  This section deals with staff&mdash;the employment of staff of <Col N="1397" /> various kinds&mdash;and Section 3 still leaves the appointment of higher staff, the research staff to the institute, a function of the council; and the council are directed by the Oireachtas that, when they are appointing a member of the research staff, they should set up a board to give everybody an opportunity.</P>
      <P>Now, we come back to Section 2.  It will now read, if this amendment is adopted: &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of the next following sub-section&rdquo;&mdash; that is excluding these appointments of higher staff&mdash;&ldquo;the members of the staff of the institute other than the higher staff as appointed under sub-section (3) shall be appointed and removed by or under the authority of the council.&rdquo;  I think it goes no further than providing for the case that Deputy Dillon and others were afraid of, namely, that the council would have to meet solemnly and appoint a charwoman or remove a charwoman.  It gives authority to the council to give authority to the director to control, employ and get rid of such staff.</P>

      <P>So long as that declaration in sub-section (1) of Section 5 was qualified by sub-section (2) of Section 7 I felt there was not much objection. With the amendment, I think there is. I think amendment No. 2 is an improvement on the Bill and I gladly accept it.  All I will ask is that you look on this again and if, on reflection, you think it expedient to delete it in the Seanad, I guarantee there will be <Col N="1398" /> no facetious comment on that development when it comes back to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall certainly look into it again but, of course, there is the sort of dilemma one is in all the time when one has two authorities working more or less concurrently.  To avoid that danger we do not put them exactly running concurrently.  We reserve the final power in any circumstances and in the determination of any crux that might arise.</P>
      <P>What we have done, therefore, is to give the ultimate power to the council. As far as the director is concerned, his duties are clear enough.  But there may be a clash and in that case the clash is resolved by the council.  If the council is wise it will delegate as much authority as it reasonably can to the director in order that the director may be in a position to do his work properly.</P>
      <P>I think that the general tendency in human nature is that a group of people are more likely to delegate authority than to seek to exercise it in detail.  I would have more anxiety about a director who might take up a line to which the council could not possibly agree, and stand on some statutory authority or right in doing that, than I would about the council exercising its right to an extraordinary extent.  I am depending on the common sense that will generally be found if a group of people get together.  You may have one of the group with strange ideas but, as a group, it is flattened out and the difficulties are generally surmounted in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think there is a serious danger.  I was told of a case which arose&mdash;I do not want to bring it in here&mdash;where a director of some institute or other stood on his statutory rights and insisted on doing things of which the council, which was there for general direction, would not approve at all.  The result was that the members of the council said: &ldquo;What is the use of going there at all; we will not be listened to.&rdquo;  I think, on the whole&mdash;we have come down on this side and I do not think we will be shaken on it&mdash;it is better to leave the ultimate power with the council.  Give them the power to <Col N="1399" /> delegate by regulations or something of that sort and the director, in exercise of his power and rights, will always have the feeling &ldquo;Well, I may have to account for this to someone.&rdquo; If he does something he thinks he can stand over, he ought to be able to defend any action he takes.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think the system for which we should provide in this Bill is that the council, being supreme and having common sense, will give to their chief officer the liberty necessary for him to do his work reasonably well. We shall look into it and I promise to see that that is implemented, as far as we can do so, without doing anything that would destroy the initiative of the director, which is necessary, and the powers he will need to have in order to get the co-operation of the rest of the staff and the various other individuals involved.  I do not think we can do anything better than that. We are coming down definitely on the side of giving the ultimate power to the council.</P>

      <P>Let us see what it is.  We are contemplating a situation in which a director has run wild or is against the proper demands of the council.  The first director can be removed by the Government for misconduct or incapacity and there is no question of a resolution being tabled <Col N="1400" /> about it in this House.  After the first director the council can shift the director at any time.  They have to get the consent of the Minister, but after the first three years the council can dispose of the director if they think he is guilty of misconduct or on the grounds of incapacity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Taoiseach talked about standing on statutory rights.  Statutes can be changed.  When the Taoiseach is reconsidering this let him consider the position of the director as being very much under the power of the council if he tries to run amok.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it is proper that we should give this Bill a good send-off and if I were Minister for Agriculture at the moment I would be glad to see it disposed of here and now.  The disposition of this Bill in Dáil Éireann should terminate on a note of joint endeavour on our part to make a success of the contribution we are called on to make in this scheme to which the Government of the United States has so intensively contributed under the Marshall Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that originally the idea of this institute got much of its vitality and enthusiasm through the zeal of Mr. Joseph Cadogan who was the head of the first mission to this country under the Marshall Plan.  If I had been the <Col N="1402" /> Minister responsible for putting this measure through the House, I should have sought the authority of the Government to ask Oireachtas Éireann to associate Mr. Cadogan's name with this institute.  I think that might very well be done and I think it would be a very suitable tribute to the work of a man which I was in a very special position to value.</P>
    <P>The arrival of a foreign head of mission under the Marshall Plan to Ireland was fraught with difficulties because one of the burdens humanity is least able to bear with dignity is the burden of gratitude.  It can be made more burdensome or less so by the attitude of the donor.  I like to recall that everything that human kindness and grace could do to make of this gift an effective bond of friendship between our two peoples rather than an obligation borne by one, and a gift conferred by another, was done by Mr. Cadogan and done with success.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, in wishing this enterprise God speed, as I do, I would ask the Government to consider whether and how Mr. Cadogan's name might be associated with the work he did.  I am aware that other institutes have statutory titles, as this one has, and I think it might be possible, if we do not wish to adopt a literal translation of the Irish title, that we might adopt an English title and call it the Cadogan Institute to perpetuate the memory of the preliminary work which went into the formulation of this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs, at an earlier stage, turned down a proposal that there should be employed in the title not only an Irish form but an English form as well, inasmuch as the Americans had contributed so greatly to the scheme.  As the Bill leaves the House there is only one title and that is in the Irish language. I suggest that the proposal made earlier might be equitably met by putting in an English title and using the title of the Cadogan Institute for this institute for which we all have high hopes and which, if properly availed of, has such vast potentiality for the economic life of the country and for the betterment of all the people who live and get their living on the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three salient points which emerge from the Minister's statement in relation to this Supplementary Estimate.  The first is that C.I.E. is in its usual bankrupt position, a position in which it has been since the Minister put his hands to the amelioration of transport in this country.  The second is the remedy to be taken.  This is in two parts.  For the time being we are to vote it further subventions until, through a lengthy process, some way is found to get C.I.E. to solvency.  These subventions are likely to be heavy.  At the moment £1,800,000 is needed.  It is only kept at this figure because of the fact that a sum of £400,000 is carried over to the <Col N="1406" /> next financial year.  Taking it all in all, nearly £2,400,000 is needed, reduced for the moment, by economies and postponements to the figure asked for in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>Whatever technical improvements may be under consideration, it did emerge from the Minister's statement that the C.I.E. Board feel there is considerable staff redundancy.  Of the 14,000 members of the staffs in the railway services, it is estimated that two-thirds are not required.  That deals with the railway services alone; it is not mentioned whether the staffs on the other services were more than adequate.  The conclusion to be drawn from this is that there are 4,200 people facing the prospect of unemployment.</P>
      <P>We are in peculiar circumstances in this matter.  The Minister has established a new body called the Dundalk Engineering Company and the chairman of that body wrote to the Dundalk Urban District Council a brutal letter in which he told them that certain work in connection with railway locomotives, rolling stock and bridges were no longer open to the engineering works.  The calculation made, on receipt of that letter, was that anything between 600 and 700 workers now employed would be thrown out of employment.  It is to be remembered that the chairman of that body is the individual whom the Minister appointed to another controlling position in recent years and that, in his first appointment, he indicated that a tremendous sum of money would be required to replace existing railway lines and to get rolling stock into good order.  He contended that there were far too many people employed in the transport service of this country.</P>
      <P>The letter of this gentleman came as a shock to the people of Dundalk. There have been protests in Dundalk against this onslaught.  Workers who made a walking protest said there had been meetings between their trade union representatives and Messrs. Lemass and Reynolds, the result of which was just more confusion.  It is not human to leave more than 4,000 people working on the railways of this country, plus 600 more in Dundalk, facing the prospect of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> I hope the Minister will be able to give more hope to these people than the Deputy for Louth, the Minister for External Affairs, did when speaking to his Fianna Fáil meeting in Dundalk the other evening.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs told his meeting the other night, according to a newspaper cutting I have got, that it would be impossible for anyone to foretell the steps that must be taken to improve the Dundalk Engineering Works or the exact type of equipment that would be needed. He spoke of the necessity for co-operation between management and workers and said that anyone viewing the position ten or 20 years hence would not look at it as the disaster it now appeared but as a great new industry which would grow and prosper.  He spoke of the Dundalk Engineering Works and of the skill and equipment it would employ which would make it, in ten or 20 years, a great engineering enterprise.</P>
    <P>That is great consolation to the people who walked in protest in Dundalk against the brutal letter sent to them by Mr. Reynolds the other day. It is the old slogan: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo;  The forecast of the Minister for External Affairs is that maybe it will not be so bad in ten or 20 years if you live the ten or 20 years in between.  I have here a comment made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1951 where he spoke of the Coalition's management of transport.  He said the Coalition's efforts in regard to transport were without aim and without object.  He asked how they had the audacity to ask to be put back in charge in view of their incredible shortsightedness and blundering interference in regard to transport.</P>
    <P>That was six years ago.  The best the Minister can do on the 27th of November, of this year is to say that the Government would have responsible proposals probably ready for discussion next year.  In this speech in Waterford in 1951 he said Coalition propagandists were whispering to railway workers that Fianna Fáil would take some action which would reduce <Col N="1408" /> transport employment and that, of course, was denied.</P>
    <P>I did not hear of those whispers at the time.  The Tánaiste apparently did, and he set out to restore the morale of railway workers by speaking in these terms, that there were whispers to railway workers that Fianna Fáil would take some action to reduce transport employment.</P>
    <P>The best we could be told&mdash;I at least hope it is the worst we could be told&mdash;on the last occasion when this was discussed, was that one-third of the 14,000 people employed on the railways could be regarded as redundant and might have to be taken off work. The Tánaiste did go on after that to speak of superannuation proposals.  I do not know whether in the course of this debate he will be more precise about these.</P>
    <P>At the time when my colleague, the then Deputy Morrissey, got the Milne Report, the author of that report asked both Deputy Morrissey, as he then was, and myself to see him and he outlined certain views he had with regard to redundancy on the railways.  He had not reported directly on that matter because he did not, apparently, feel it came within his terms of reference but, in the pursuit of his terms of reference, he had got enough information to lead to a certain conclusion and that was that there was redundancy in the railway world.  His proposal or suggestion then was that people should be enticed out of railway work.</P>
    <P>There was no question of compulsorily making people leave, giving them their papers and telling them to walk out, and there was no question of dismissals, particularly on a large scale, because he said he thought that in the conditions of railway workers that would be completely inhuman.  I think I know what he meant when he said that.  Railway work in the old days had a characteristic of permanency and was exempt from the impact of the unemployment insurance code.  They were not asked to contribute to that, because it was felt they would never have to draw on it.  That is a measure of the strength of that characteristic of permanency in regard to railway work in those days.  In no circumstances, <Col N="1409" /> could the author of the Milne Report have suggested putting into operation, in the case of work which had such a characteristic of permanency about it, a policy for mass dismissals which he thought would threaten if some of the proposals were put into practice.  The Tánaiste has now left the House, and not merely the House but the men concerned, under considerable doubt and anxiety in regard to what his proposals in regard to them are.</P>
    <P>The Milne proposal was that a scheme of pensions should be arranged at an earlier date than that at which pensions are usually given so as to provide for a person to retire, say, five years before the time at which he would have to go having earned a pension, so that an earlier retirement might be attractive for him.  It would be less than his pay, but more than the pension which he might receive if he stayed on until the pension was due to him.  Naturally, this would have the effect of increasing the bill for pensions but it would also have the effect of reducing the bill for salaries.  If there is something like that in the Tánaiste's mind I think it is time it was revealed because it is hardly fair to people concerned that they should learn in the course of the debate that one-third of them are regarded as redundant and that there is some question of pensions or compensation but that that will be attended to afterwards.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the anxiety at Dundalk arises.  Apparently they got a letter from the chairman of the Dundalk General Engineering Company on the 28th ult.  At least it was in the newspapers dated the 28th and presumably was written about that date.  The debate took place on the 27th and was reported on the 28th.  On the 29th November the Dundalk workers issued a special protest against what they described as the misinformation given by the Tánaiste with regard to their pensions and they put into inverted commas the statement that the Tánaiste had said that they had no pension rights or no rights to compensation.  That may be their reading of the debate on the 27th on this particular Estimate, or it may be <Col N="1410" /> that the chairman of the Dundalk Engineering Works, who apparently had some conference with these people made some statement to them that they were not entitled to any scheme of superannuation if they were to close down because there was insufficient work on which to engage them.  Where that springs from I do not know but they made that part of their protest. They are clearly in a state of anxiety in regard to their position.</P>
    <P>They have had these indications in the papers, and in the newspapers of December 2nd it was reported that after they had met Mr. Reynolds and the Tánaiste the result was &ldquo;just more confusion.&rdquo;  The main points in their protest are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Work must not leave Dundalk; this we will dispute and resist with everything in our power, and</P>
    <P>(2)  we demand that our compensation claims be settled and pension rights preserved before the new company takes over.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That has reference to what was in the newspapers.  As I say, whether that was a special statement made to them arising out of their special circumstances or whether it is the reading they had of what was said when the Dáil was considering this Estimate, reported on the 27th November or next day, I do not know but it would be well to have it cleared up.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that no proposal has any chance of getting through this Parliament unless there is provision made for the proper compensation of people who are to be regarded as redundant. Again, I think it is most unlikely that Deputies could withstand the storm of protest that would be aroused if any proposal came in to force people out of employment even if they were to be benefited by pensions at an earlier age.</P>
    <P>The Milne proposal, as put to the then Deputy Morrissey and myself, was made on the basis of something to tempt people to leave the railway service by bettering themselves and by entitlement to pensions.  But there was certainly nothing in the Milne proposal, in the spoken proposal, to indicate to both of us that he would have favoured &mdash;certainly we would not have done so <Col N="1411" />&mdash;any proposal to compel people to leave the railway service, but favourable consideration might have been given to a proposal to induce them to leave their employment for their own betterment.  For the remainder of the debate we shall have to wait until we see what the Minister will propose. Many commissions have been set up on this matter and many different proposals have been put forward but none accepted, in the main, in regard to the betterment of the railway position.</P>
    <P>In 1951 the Minister was so annoyed over the fact that years had passed without anything being done, in what was called &ldquo;a policy of blind drift, without aim or hope,&rdquo; that I am sure he will be more alert to bringing in adequate proposals at the earliest possible moment.  I presume they will be brought in with a better realisation of the circumstances and with more humility than accompanied the proposals that were brought in in 1944 when the Dublin people, who have borne the brunt of the heavy charges that had to be imposed in order to keep the rest of the system in some sort of operation, were told that the well-running bus and tram services in the city were being handed over to C.I.E.  They were told that we could count on more efficient running and cheaper services. Certainly the prospect that the railways under C.I.E. would puff or propel themselves into a position of prosperity and of giving cheaper service to the community was held out, but the passage of the years shows that we are now down to the point where very many thousands of railway employees may have to seek employment across the Channel.</P>
    <P>We are apparently back again at the same sort of proposal but this time with some humane background, namely, that of doing something for those who will be rendered redundant and those who are discovered to be redundant by way of providing them with some compensation. We have to give this money to keep C.I.E. going and, though it is not a pleasant thing, the money will have to be found again by the taxpayer. We hope that proposals will not be long delayed and, while they may be produced with less exhilaration <Col N="1412" /> than heretofore they may be more realistic and give us a chance of getting a full account of the transport muddle which started in 1944, if not earlier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose we shall be able to see the transport situation clearly until we have an opportunity of seeing the Bill the Minister proposes to introduce.  At the same time, the Minister has said sufficient on the subject of C.I.E. to merit some comment on our part at this stage, in the hope that the views so expressed may assist the Minister in his approach to this whole transport problem.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunately true that since the establishment of this State in 1922 this House has had transport before it as an ever-pressing problem and from time to time, over that long period of 35 years, the House has had to pass transport Bills and amending Bills of all kinds.  In fact, I imagine that if all the Bills and all the amending Bills were totalled they would probably equal the number of railway engines owned by C.I.E. to-day.  Despite all the Bills which we have had introduced over that period of 35 years we still have a transport problem and no one can say that the problem is any less serious to-day than it was on every occasion on which we introduced a Bill to remedy the situation then extant and for which we believed the Bill would provide a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is we have failed to solve our transport problems by legislation.  We have to recognise the fact, that if our transport problem could be solved by legislation, Bills and Acts of Parliament, the problem would have disappeared from the political arena many, many years ago.  In spite of all the Bills, in spite of all the speeches, in spite of all the hopes and all the beliefs, and in spite of all the certificates of a guarantee of success, we still have a transport problem presented to us to-day in a financial form, a problem in relation to which C.I.E. is losing at the rate of £2,000,000 per annum.  This problem is not one which can be solved by legislation and I do not believe this new Bill will solve the problem.  I believe that somebody sitting here ten or 20 <Col N="1413" /> years hence will be confronted with a similar problem so far as railway transport is concerned and will probably receive the same assurances as we are getting now, namely, that this new Bill will go a long distance towards remedying the difficulties of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>I think we must go back to the beginning, though I do not want to do so in any detail.  The fact is that railways were instituted when there were no motor-cars and no commercial vehicles and, so long as there were no motor-cars and no commercial vehicles, the railways had a virtual monopoly of transport, certainly of long-distance transport for passengers and long haul so far as freight was concerned. They had no competitors in the form of the private motor-car.  They had no competitor in the form of the licensed merchandise holder or of the private firm which transports its own goods. Of course, the railway companies of those days were buttressed, too, by the fact that they paid notoriously low rates of wages.  The railways, therefore, when they started, started off with three positive advantages, all of which have been stripped from them to-day.</P>
    <P>They started with the advantage of no motor-car competition, no lorry competition and a permanent subsidy in the form of Irish sweat which they got from the lowly paid workers whom they employed.  But those days have gone.  The motor car now abounds on our roads.  Commercial vehicles have grown in numbers each year and, thanks to trade union organisation on the railways, the workers employed there are getting a better standard of living than they ever got before, though many would say, and many will agree, that the financial position of the railways has been used to depress their standard of living to a lower level than that at which it should be, having regard to the responsible work which those engaged in transport perform.</P>
    <P>While one can punch holes, innumerable holes, in the case put up by C.I.E. to the Committee on internal transport there was at least one realistic understanding by C.I.E. as to the way in which the problem could be met.  C.I.E. takes the <Col N="1414" /> view that this country is too small to keep two parallel forms of transport and they say that, if we want the railways, then we must make sure that freight is carried by the railways; but you cannot economically run a railway whilst you allow a very large number of private hauliers to haul goods for reward or for their own use and a country with a population of less than 3,000,000 cannot support two entirely separate forms of transport.  That is true.  I do not think there is any answer to it.  You can keep the two forms of transport, if you like, but they will never be economically rewarding.  Railways can be kept forever so long as we are willing to pay the subsidy.  The other form of transport can be kept also so long as it is tagged on to a business which is otherwise progressive and which can subsidise the carrying portion of the business because of the facilities it gets from the carrying portion in order to operate its other commercial arms.</P>
    <P>I agree with the C.I.E. statement that you cannot operate two paying transport services in a country with a population of less than 3,000,000, where the use of the motor car and the lorry is daily increasing.  If we had wanted to stop the development of road transport we might have done so away back in 1938 when there were approximately, speaking from recollection, about 10,000 commercial vehicles in the country.  But it was not done then. There may have been good reasons for not doing it, and I will come to these in a moment.</P>
    <P>The fact is a situation has now been reached in which we now have 127,000 private motor cars on the road&mdash;that is for the year 1955, the latest figure I could get&mdash;and we have 40,000 commercial vehicles on the road as well. When one remembers that in 1952 there were 104,000 motor cars on the road, so that the figure for motor cars has increased by 23,000 in three years, and the number of commercial vehicles has increased from 28,000 in 1952 to 40,000 in 1955, one can get some picture of the intensity with which the elements competing with C.I.E. are entering into competition with C.I.E.</P>
    <P>So long as these continue to operate they will continue to carry goods <Col N="1415" /> which in other days were carried by C.I.E.  Every ton of merchandise carried on the roads every week of the year by the 40,000 lorries represents merchandise which at one stage or other was carried by C.I.E. and would be carried by C.I.E. if it were the sole freight transport authority in this coountry.  So long as you have motor transport in the form of commercial vehicles carrying traffic which would otherwise go to C.I.E., then C.I.E. will be impoverished for that traffic. It will have to carry overheads on a lesser volume of traffic, which continues to fall.  It is because of these considerations that the House is constantly troubled with Supplementary Estimates to stop a haemorrhage in the financial body of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister's decision to retain the railways as an integral part of our transport system is the only decision which could be taken in the circumstances.  To contemplate the abandonment of C.I.E. at this stage would be just economic lunacy.  If we had all just arrived on this island of ours yesterday and decided we wanted a transport service, well we might doubt the wisdom of starting a railway service.  We might say there are other methods of transporting people besides railways.  In those circumstances, perhaps it would be possible to consider some other method of transport besides railways.</P>
    <P>However, the fact is we now have a railway system into which considerable capital has been injected and, because of the substantial subsidies which C.I.E. has got in recent years, its rolling stock and equipment are now in a very good state of repair.  It has embarked upon a dieselisation programme on which millions have been spent. That programme is now almost complete but, of course, it has not yet had a fair opportunity of operating to demonstrate its improved efficiency over the older method of steam transport.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think that in present circumstances it would be unwise to contemplate any abandonment of C.I.E. or of our railway service, which is in fact the main bulwark of our transport organisation.  I think it is <Col N="1416" /> vain to hope that C.I.E. can make any great impression on privately hauled goods traffic or that it can induce merchants to abandon their own methods of transport and go back to the railways.  The fact is that the private lorry has immense advantages, from the point of view of its operator, over the public transport system.</P>
    <P>A man who owns a warehouse in the West of Ireland can send his lorry to the cities of Dublin, Cork or Belfast. It can drive into the factory from which he wants goods.  The goods can be loaded, handled by his own employees and brought back the same evening.  A few hours later, perhaps, they will arrive at the warehouse of the merchant who has ordered the goods. On the other hand, if the goods are sent to him by rail, he may feel they have to undergo loading at the factory, unloading at the railway terminal, transport by railway, unloading at the nearest railway station to the warehouse and then reloading again, with all the handling and all the possibility of breakages involved.</P>
    <P>So long as merchants can get door to door delivery and collection, I think C.I.E. will find it extremely difficult to woo back to the railways the traffic they have lost to the private lorries.  It might be possible, however, for C.I.E. to offer to provide merchants with an alternative service, such as a door-to-door service or a factory to warehouse service operated by C.I.E. on a contract basis, which would do for the private commercial owner what is done to-day by the operation of his own lorry.</P>
    <P>However, this will be a slow process. C.I.E. will have to be able to show that it was better for the firm concerned to permit C.I.E. to operate a lorry for it on a factory to warehouse basis, and to maintain the lorry in a state of efficiency, rather than that the private firm should maintain a fleet of lorries purchased by itself for use in a service of that kind.  I have reason to believe that C.I.E. did endeavour to do that in some instances but were not very successful in their approach to the firms concerned.  It is one way&mdash;possibly the only way&mdash;in which C.I.E. can hope to woo back to the railways <Col N="1417" /> traffic lost by the introduction and growing utilisation of the private lorry as a vehicle for transporting goods.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's statement indicating it was proposed to pay C.I.E. a subsidy for five years.  The Minister was not able to indicate what the amount of the subsidy would be, and I appreciate that to do so would involve much examination of many complicated accounts.  I think the Minister is optimistic if he imagines that, at the end of five years, C.I.E. will be a self-supporting proposition.  If I could see C.I.E. a self-supporting proposition in twenty years' time I would not be appalled at the consequences of bearing portion of the burden in the meantime, but it is unrealistic to think C.I.E. could get on a paying basis within five years.  It is losing £2,000,000 a year at present and all the indications are that it will not lose less, but very likely more, unless it can by reorganisation produce a situation which will relieve it of some of its heavier expenditure.</P>
    <P>We have got to recognise that C.I.E. will have to face up to growing competition from motor cars and commercial vehicles and that it will find no great consolation in any possibility of an increasing population within the foreseeable future.  The experiment which C.I.E. adopted last year to try to cut its losses by increasing freight rates to meet wage rises proved a disastrous experiment from the point of view of C.I.E.  Last year C.I.E. increased freight rates by 10 per cent. The result was that instead of getting 10 per cent. more income, their income was down and the traffic carried was down.</P>
    <P>I think that, in the face of the use of lorries at the present time, it is too much to imagine that C.I.E. will find any solution for its problems along the line of increasing freight or passenger rates.  Any further increase in these rates will intensify the competition of motor cars and commercial vehicles which C.I.E. has to face.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has decided to abolish the common carrier restrictions imposed on C.I.E.  I agree <Col N="1418" /> that these restrictions were understandable in the circumstances of the misty past but they have no place in transport operations of to-day.  As far as C.I.E. was concerned, these restrictions constituted another of the factors which prevented them from competing with their private haulier rivals.  I know of one case which came to my notice which showed that the common carrier service was operated not to the advantage of C.I.E. but eventually to its disadvantage.  I have in mind one carrier who sent out a fleet of lorries with a load of commodities which were delivered to large towns and substantial villages all over the country. Having done that, there was still a residue of these commodities to be delivered.  The instructions given to the drivers of those lorries was that when they had reached a stage when there were only three or four packets to be delivered they were to hand that remainder to C.I.E. for delivery.  That firm delivered its goods as cheaply as possible to places where there was the densest volume of population and then left the deliveries for three or four isolated places to C.I.E.  Each of these packets had to be sent out in four different directions from the nearest railway station.</P>
    <P>In this case C.I.E. was being compelled to quote that firm the minimum rate for carrying the residue of the goods to remote areas while it was quoting the same rates to a producer of similar goods who was giving C.I.E. all his transport.  I think it is good to get rid of the common carrier restrictions and that it would help C.I.E. to meet its competitors in a way in which it has never been able to meet them before.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the work of the committee.  I set the committee the job of producing their report within three months.  Let me say now that I never believed they could do that.  No one else believed that they could do it.  The officials did not believe they could do it but C.I.E. presented to me a document which, in my view, represented the confession by C.I.E. that, unless something was done urgently they had thrown in the sponge so far as their obligations to operate the transport service was concerned. <Col N="1419" /> If the Minister looks at that document he will find that it is one in which fear and grave anxiety was expressed by C.I.E. as to their ability to carry on.  That was C.I.E.'s side of the case.</P>
    <P>What were we to do?  Were we to accept C.I.E.'s view that the problem could be met only by pushing back the private lorries and limiting them to an area of 100 miles for the first year, 75 miles for the second year, 50 miles for the third year, and so on, until we had finally pushed them off the roads altogether, or were we to send the problem to a committee, not biased in one way or the other, but composed of persons who had distinguished themselves by their ability to analyse such problems? Consequently, the last Government decided to institute the Internal Transport Committee.  It was given three months in which to make a report.  It might have been possible to make an interim report in that time but the three months' limit was set to indicate the urgency of the problem and the necessity of doing something to stop the deterioration in the whole railway system which appeared to have shattered the nerves of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>I think the committee did a good job.  They have taken eight months to do it but I think the Tánaiste knows of committees and commissions set up by this House which took five and six years to draft their reports. This committee, it can be said to their credit, produced a report within the short period of eight months as compared with the five and six years which other bodies took to report and they have produced the most effective transport report that we have had. There has been a thorough investigation of the situation and the report has produced a wealth of material which must be of value.</P>
    <P>I know the committee has been criticised.  I have criticised it myself on some of its findings.  I have already expressed my views on the finding of the committee but that does not take from the value of the committee's work nor does it detract in any way from the excellent statistical material and the deductions which they draw <Col N="1420" /> from their examination of the whole problem.  If the report had not been as challenging as it is, it would probably have gone the way of other reports of committees which took five and six years to do the job.  It was the urgency of the problem and the challenging character of the report which earned my highest commendation.</P>
    <P>I do not stand over the committee's report.  It is their report, not mine. There are many points which I criticised and which will continue to be the subject of criticism but that does not detract from the excellent work which the committee performed on behalf of the whole community without any reward whatever.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that the Government proposes to wipe out the capital liability of C.I.E. to the extent of £11.6 million.  That is good but it is only good as a tidying-up operation.  It does not put another penny into the coffers of C.I.E.  I never expected that C.I.E. could ever repay any of that money but it was only there as an indication to them that they could not expect to dive into a bottomless pit and swim out every time with a substantial cheque in their mouths.  There never was a hope that C.I.E. could even pay £6 million much less £11.6 million.  Wiping out this transaction stops everybody from asking when they are going to pay the £11.6 million because if you mentioned that you received a look which indicated that you were unbalanced.  I think it is just as good to wipe it out but believe me it does no more than cut out a piece of dead timber from the complicated accounts of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some references on the last day to some matters affecting the staff of C.I.E. on which I should like to make an observation.  From my inquiries the Minister said that the Government would not object to a departure from the principle of last in, first out.  I did not understand at the time, and still do not understand, what the Minister's idea is in mentioning that proposal or on whom it is supposed to confer an advantage.  I agree it could confer an advantage on the Government.  There is only one way in <Col N="1421" /> which I could see that scheme being implemented and that is by giving the long service employees the right to retire voluntarily on payment of full compensation.  But I could see no likelihood of their being tempted merely by taking their accumulated pension rights.  I can tell the Minister that I think there would be strong objection to getting away from the last in, first out principle and I think it could only be worked in circumstances where long service employees who might desire to retire voluntarily would get their full compensation on such retirement from the company.</P>
    <P>In regard to this 30 per cent. redundancy which C.I.E. have indicated is their estimate of the situation, so far as I can understand this statement was received with astonishment by the railway organisations.  They cannot see the 30 per cent. redundancy; they can see less of the redundancy in view of the fact that in recent years C.I.E. have been recruiting additional staff while all the time, according to themselves, there was 30 per cent. redundancy in the service.  Where you get a situation where C.I.E. asserts that, on the one hand, and the trade unions have not got an opportunity of checking it on the other hand, you will always get some misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point to which the Minister made a passing reference.  It is the position of trade unions <i>vis-á-vis</i> the operations of C.I.E.  I have always said that they should try to develop a spirit of co-operation between themselves and the trade unions and should try to get the trade unions with them in order that both of them could make a contribution to the maintenance of C.I.E. as an efficient transport organisation.</P>
    <P>About a year ago I called the Secretary of my Department, then Industry and Commerce, to see the directors of C.I.E.  I think all the directors were brought along and told that I was most anxious that some kind of consultative machinery should be set up so that the unions and the directors of C.I.E., or some top level executives, could meet the unions with a view to ensuring that their joint experience and collective wisdom was pooled for the benefit of <Col N="1422" /> the transport undertaking.  They had previously met only at a point of friction where there was a claim for increased wages or reduced hours or some other improvements.  I wanted to get some joint consultative council meeting regularly where they could understand one another and one another's problems and jointly endeavour to find a solution to those problems.  Although that was done a year ago, and although I understand that C.I.E. promised to take the initiative in setting up consultative machinery, I understand no effort has since been made to establish that machinery.</P>
    <P>If C.I.E. want the co-operation of the unions they should go out and look for it.  I do not think it should be above their dignity to look for it.  In a national transport undertaking which belongs to the whole people the directors of C.I.E. should be told to work out with the unions, and the unions should be told to work out with C.I.E., some acceptable method of joint consultation which would ensure that the people's property, the C.I.E. undertaking, will be operated in a manner which will give the best returns and the best posisble service.  There is no use bleating for co-operation in times of difficulty and when the coffers are empty.  If co-operation is to be got, it has to be a fundamental principle, between the unions on the one hand and the transport undertaking on the other hand.</P>
    <P>I should like to get it into the heads of C.I.E. that they ought to substitute consultation for conflict and there will be no peace on the railways, or understanding between those who operate them and those who direct them, until such time as both bodies recognise that this is a joint undertaking, owned not by greedy capitalists seeking the biggest dividends they can get but that this is a public undertaking owned by the people, and the people have a right to expect both sides to co-operate in the operation of a service which will give the maximum satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, if he shares my view on the matter, will endeavour to get the unions and the directors together with a view to instituting regular machinery for consultation which I <Col N="1423" /> think can make a big contribution towards eliminating friction and conflict and which will substitute for these two vices co-operation and understanding. I welcome the statement made by the Minister as indicating that we are going to make another effort to deal with the ever-present and seemingly unending problems of C.I.E.  I think the problem is a much more serious one than the Minister's speech indicated. Railways are an important part of our transport organisation and it is, therefore, inevitable that the problem should be dealt with as expeditiously as the solution is called for.</P>
    <P>I think we have reached a stage with C.I.E., as I think we have reached on other matters as well, when we should try to get some national policy.  I do not think it is important now to quote something the Minister said ten or 20 years ago just as I do not think it important for him to quote what an opponent said five or six years ago. That now belongs to the past.  I do not think it has any interest to-day and I do not think it is likely to produce a solution to C.I.E.'s problem.</P>
    <P>I tender this advice: in the new Bill that is to be introduced I hope some effort will be made either by consultations beforehand or by the reference of the Bill to a committee to evolve some kind of common policy for which we should all be responsible in an effort to put C.I.E. back on its financial feet and so as to avoid the continuously recurring Bills which are apparently necessary to sustain it in the sickly state of half animation in which it has lived for too many years already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every member of this House will agree that the railways are essential.  I am one of those who consider that the first mistake was made when C.I.E. went into road transport.  I think it would have been far better for this country and C.I.E. if they had never touched it.  In plain language they are a common nuisance both to themselves and to everybody who has had the misfortune to employ them.  It is just as well to talk plainly in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every penny that could be collared <Col N="1424" /> in this country has been twisted into the C.I.E. coffers.  If you want an example you can take the subsidy that was given by the American Government for ground limestone production. Who got that subsidy?  Did the farmers get it?  Did the men who owned the ground limestone plants get it?  No. It was divided between two State-owned, State-controlled firms&mdash;the Irish Sugar Company who got the lesser portion and C.I.E.</P>
    <P>Why should a man who starts an industry in this country for the manufacture of ground limestone for the agricultural community, and who buys one, two or three lorries and maybe a spreader to deliver the ground limestone to the farmers concerned, have to pay hush money to C.I.E. for every ton of lime delivered?  That is one I should like to know.  That is where the money given by the American Government to subsidise the production and distribution of agricultural lime in this country went.</P>
    <P>The owners of ground limestone plants have to pay 7½ per cent. to C.I.E. on every ton of lime they load on their own lorries to spread on the farmers' land.  That is one instance of the unseen subsidies that are paid to C.I.E. in addition to the moneys voted by this House.  C.I.E. also control the number of lorries that a ground limestone producer may use. To the ground limestone producer who has two or three lorries they can say: &ldquo;You can have ten lorries but you may use only one.&rdquo;  That is the manner in which C.I.E. are using their control in that matter.</P>
    <P>I raised this before in the House and I gave instances of it.  The position has not improved since; indeed it has got worse.  If a public carrying concern must pay a man a couple of guineas a day to prowl around with his back up against the walls of rural Ireland in the vicinity of ground limestone plants to watch how many lorries of lime leave those plants, I suggest such a concern is not worthy of subsidy. That is happening.  We are told that commercial vehicles, privately owned, are taking the life blood from C.I.E.  Times have changed.  As a matter of fact it can be put this way: <Col N="1425" /> there are four beet factories in relation to which one Minister said the proper thing to do was to blow them up.  If they went up the spout in the morning, as the same Minister said he hoped they would, 70 per cent. of the freightage of C.I.E. would disappear immediately, because those four factories are responsible for 70 per cent of C.I.E. traffic.</P>

      <P>The people who own these private lorries have wives and children to support.  They have to earn their livelihood in this country and they are entitled to be considered as much as anybody else.  Take the C.I.E. lorry that goes to a farmer for a load of beet.  The gentleman driver will sit in his cab while the farmer and his men are out in the rain forking in over the sideboards.  But take the owner of the ordinary lorry.  He is not above taking his fork and helping the farmer and his men.  That is the difference that leaves C.I.E. without the work and gives it to the local owner.  The local lorry owner may also have a loader which he brings along to the farmer's rick of beet.  C.I.E. will not employ any mechanical equipment.  Those are the differences that account for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have thought this matter out as <Col N="1426" /> well as I could and I suggest the proper thing is to carry on the railways as they are until the country decides it can do without them.  I do not believe the country can do without them but I believe the country cannot afford two systems, and cannot throw millions into roads and a couple of million more into railways.  We have been brought to the point where that will have to stop.</P>
    <P>The service given by the ordinary private commercial vehicles is a service that cannot be given by any Government organisation.  A man with a private lorry back in West Cork will set out for a load of pigs and drive to four or five or six farms for that load. C.I.E. will not do that.  That is the difference between the service that is economic and one that is not.</P>
    <P>Take beet.  A lorry owner may not carry beet even to the local station unless he pays hush money to C.I.E. of 7½ per cent. on every ton of beet he draws.  When we talk of giving C.I.E. £2,000,000 to carry on, let us see how many more million pounds they are getting and from whom they are getting it.  The unfortunate man who, perhaps, got a couple of hundred pounds when leaving the Army and bought a lorry to make a livelihood finds that on everything he endeavours to carry he will have to pay hush money.  That is what it amounts to. Now that we are discussing a period of five years, I think something must be done which will bring us down to earth and let us know where we are. I do not want to be unfair to anybody but I have seen these things happen and I have seen the appeals that were made.  We are living in a mechanical age and you will no longer get a man for a flail.  An ordinary private vehicle coming out to take in beet from a farmer is equipped with a mechanical loader and avoids much of the slavery attached to that work, but you find the C.I.E. lorry, when it comes out, has no such equipment.  That is the difference. If C.I.E. is to continue in that line it should provide these facilities.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I cannot agree with other members of the House, but I am giving the facts as I know them.  I say it <Col N="1427" /> was false pretences to have a couple of million pounds provided by the American Government for the purpose of making ground limestone available to the farmers, switched into a subsidy for C.I.E.  That was wrong and should not have been done.  The same thing happens in other cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no doubt but that this Estimate must be passed. I think it is a real &ldquo;must&rdquo; in this particular year but, when one hears what Deputy Corry has said, and the allegations he has made, one becomes perturbed about what can happen in this House.  He uses such phrases as &ldquo;hush money&rdquo;.  It is not a good phrase unless it has its proper meaning, which is well-known.  Whether Deputy Corry means it in that sense or not I do not know, but from the way in which he said it, it seems that he does.  If there is a question of hush money in that sense it is a very serious matter.  I should like to suggest that not only should the rules of order prevent Deputies from insulting colleagues but they should ensure that that type of phraseology would not be used in the House.  However, I do not intend to lecture Deputy Corry.  I do not mind what he says, but at the same time perhaps we should keep this point in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry has not told us his solution to the railway problem.  He says, on the one hand, the railways must be kept and, on the other hand, that they are getting hush money and this, that and the other, and that instead of being £2,000,000 as in this year, the bill will be £3,000,000 next year.  I feel that both the Minister and Deputy Corry should be in sackcloth and ashes, because when they brought in the first Transport Bill in 1944 they said they <Col N="1428" /> wanted it passed immediately because it would mean more efficient and cheaper transport service, that it would save money for the country and would lead to great internal economic development. I remember the Minister, speaking with great emphasis, telling us what would happen the moment the Bill was passed.</P>

      <P>The war was still on.  The Minister went one better. The House was dissolved and the Minister came back and declared emphatically here that the people had enacted the Bill and that there was really no necessity for him to bring it before the House at all.  Would the people have enacted that Bill if they had understood that, instead of providing the efficient transport service the Minister outlined to assist us in our national development, it was going to cost us all the millions that it has cost since?</P>
      <P>The Minister gave an elaborate survey of the circumstances in which C.I.E. now finds itself.  He did not say: &ldquo;I have been disappointed.  It has not lived up to my expectations.&rdquo; Neither has he suggested any solution except to tell us that he proposes to bring in yet another Bill to deal with the matter.  He has a big responsibility. We can only wait and see what his proposals are but I ask him, when he does bring in his proposals, to approach the matter in a realistic way and not use the hyperbolic phrases that he used in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember, introducing the second Bill to deal with public transport, he said that it was common ground in the Dáil that we would have cheap and efficient transport facilities, facilities vital to our economic development. What part have they played in our economic development unless from the <Col N="1429" /> point of view of what Deputy Corry said, namely, that £2,000,000 of Marshall Aid were thrown into C.I.E.? That is the only step that C.I.E. took in our national development.  I do not know whether or not they got £2,000,000.  I do not know if other transport systems did not get portion of the Marshall Aid.  Deputy Corry should tell us something about the others who benefited.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  No solution has been suggested this evening.  Neither can I suggest a solution except to say that there should be greater co-ordination between the two systems.  It is rather odd to see a bus leaving Galway, as I saw it, and a train five minutes later, both bound for Dublin.  That does not make sense.  Admittedly, they were taking different routes.  If the time lag were greater, then they would not be running in competition with each other.</P>
      <P>It is important that we should have an efficient transport service.  It is equally important that we should have a cheap transport service.  We have dieselisation to-day and it should be easier for C.I.E. because of dieselisation to handle the railway system in the future, or at least more efficiently than they have handled it in the past. Let us hope it will be a success.  Let us hope that the proposals which the Minister will bring in will be brought in in a realistic way and with not any blatant shouting about a plan&mdash;the only plan that will solve the problem.  If he does that the House will meet him in a reasonable way, but we will not tolerate his giving us, for the fourth time, an efficient transport service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This transport undertaking is not short of doctors prepared to write prescriptions.  Every Deputy who has spoken here since the 1944 Act was passed has been able to write his special prescription for the management of C.I.E. The last speaker had practically six years' experience as a Cabinet Minister and, if he had <Col N="1430" /> any constructive proposals to rectify any shortcomings of the 1944 Act, he had ample time in which to have those proposals implemented.  Unfortunately, the inevitable commission was set up and duly reported.  When the findings were published we were just as wise at the end of the report as we were at the beginning.</P>
      <P>Certain suggestions were made.  The people on the commission were supposed to be experts.  But only for the 1944 Act we would have very little public transport to-day.  We must face facts.  Is it our intention to maintain public transport?  Is it essential to our economy, or will we let it go altogether?  Deputies often find themselves torn between pressure groups. People want private transport and they will tell you that Johnny Murphy down the road has a plate and they should have a plate because they had lorries before ever Johnny Murphy had them.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy has a responsibility in this matter.  He must examine his conscience and ask himself should we have a public transport system, paying its way, or a private transport system with cut-throat competition?  I listened to a colleague of mine speaking a few moments ago.  He dealt with something that concerns only himself and a few farmers.  We have to look at this from the national point of view and it is from that point of view that we must consider it if we intend to get anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>C.I.E. is the biggest employer in the State.  We have been faced here over the years with a good deal of unemployment and emigration.  The Minister has generously tried to do the best he can for these employees.  He has tried to meet a difficult position in a most efficient way.  I have given his statement serious consideration since I have been closely associated with the railway over a long number of years.  I have met some of the directors and some of the people concerned and I cannot speak too highly of them.  However, I met one gentleman, whose name I shall refrain from mentioning, and he should be sent to school to learn something about human relations before holding such a post.  I have no use for any man who is discourteous <Col N="1431" /> and not helpful to public men.  We have our responsibilities and we are entitled to co-operation.  When some people get into sheltered jobs they feel they have the cure for all ills and that they can get away with slighting people responsible for the well-being of all sections of the community.  On the other hand, I have nothing but the highest praise for the majority of the officers of C.I.E., from the chairman down, who gave us whole-hearted co-operation.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves if the railways are to go, what will take their place?  What happens if we have a national emergency?  What happens if we are short of fuel?  I blame a number of people in the small towns who are crying out when branch lines are closed down and are running up to the Minister.  They are the very people who have given no lead whatever to see that the lines are kept there.  The lack of general co-operation is responsible for the position facing the Minister.  I feel that every Deputy should try and help the Minister in dealing with the difficult task that faces him and the Board of C.I.E. The Tourist Board is very perturbed about the situation.  C.I.E. contributes much towards making our tourist industry a success.</P>
    <P>I admit that a number of branch lines are dead wood.  I admit that no Minister or no directors of C.I.E.  can do anything but scrap them.  But there should be greater co-operation between the management and employees of C.I.E.  The human touch and common understanding and goodwill should be encouraged between the management and the workers.  The friction that has existed there on occasion should be replaced by goodwill.</P>
    <P>A consultative committee, composed of workers and management, should be established and should be told that the people of the country cannot afford to keep subsidising C.I.E. year after year.  But any man, either in the workships or the offices, who has a constructive suggestion to contribute to the management should, through such a consultative committee, <Col N="1432" /> be given the opportunity of doing so.  Each employee, if he wants to save his employment, should give of his best and should understand that he is working not for a boss, but for himself and his own company.  Such a position cannot be brought about without discussing these problems.</P>
    <P>It is essential that C.I.E. should carry out a complete stocktaking.  I am not pleased with these commissions &mdash;these men who come over with a cure for all ills.  I am more concerned with the ordinary man working for the company day after day who has a suggestion to make.  His suggestion should be listened to.  Such co-operation between management and workers is essential if we are to save our transport system.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on his efforts to deal with this problem. Now we have the G.N.R. on our hands as well as C.I.E.  I hope the Minister will get intelligent co-operation and constructive criticism from the people who matter in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is asking for funds for C.I.E.  In the course of his remarks he foreshadowed legislation to deal with our transport problem.  I had not the opportunity of listening personally to the Minister's opening remarks but I read carefully his contribution in the Dáil Debates of that day.  I should like to say straight away that I welcome the Minister's statement.  It is not everything we could hope for, but at any rate it will relieve the minds of the public who up to the present have been rather perturbed at the various types of pressure brought to bear on this and previous Governments to do away with our railway system.</P>
      <P>The kernel of the Minister's speech was that he was prepared, for a limited period at any rate, to keep the railways for social and economic reasons and to preserve them from the tender mercies of private operators.  I cannot agree too strongly with that statement.  What I do not agree with, however, is the Minister's argument that the action he is likely to take in these new measures will ensure the preservation of the railways.  I should like to clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> In his remarks the Minister pointed out that those people who are in favour of a railway system must justify railways in view of the very many heavy losses involved in their maintenance. He stated that he had received suggestions from various bodies and parties and that he had received many protests against any proposal to curtail the railway system.  He went on to say that he also wanted assurances to be given of local effort to ensure that the particular freight or traffic would be available for the maintenance of any branch line in question.</P>
    <P>The Minister is putting the onus on the traders, and other people, who live adjacent to towns where there are branch lines to put up the support necessary to keep the branch lines open.  We know that in recent years there has been a great increase in the number of lorries, tractors and heavy vans in rural areas.  The ordinary trader, whether in the rural areas or in the towns will, human nature being what it is, take the easiest way out. He will employ somebody in a private capacity to carry his goods and it is only when he finds that there is a danger of his branch line closing down that a group will get together as a body to protest against it.  I believe that national transport should not be left to groups of individuals like that down the country.</P>
    <P>There is another point of great importance in this matter.  When considering the development of national transport in Ireland over the past number of years the one outstanding fact that emerges is that we have a surfeit of transport in the country.  To my mind the kernel of the whole problem is that we have too much transport for the population, for the goods, and for the industries we have.  It is a question of how we are going to get rid of this surplus transport and utilise the remainder in the most suitable manner from the point of view of the national economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and rightly so, wishes to give a further chance to the railways. I maintain that although he may wish that, and hope that it will happen due to the new legislation which he proposes, he should not leave the <Col N="1434" /> national transport in the hands of private individuals who will use only the method of transport that is most suited to themselves.  In a matter like that you cannot be in favour of the railways and at the same time give a free hand to private enterprise.  You must, at some stage, come down at one side or the other.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the difficulties of the Minister and his Government in regard to pressure groups.  The Minister has gone so far as to suggest in his statement at column 1052 No. 7, Volume 164:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... that existing losses from the operation of the C.I.E. railways are met from taxation and that taxation imposes burdens upon other economic activities and restricts their growth and employment.  The losses on the C.I.E. railways and the resulting tax burdens are helping to produce amongst important sections of our people what I could describe as an anti-railway mentality&mdash;an outlook which could very easily build up into a demand to end the railways.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify to the House which are the important sections of the community who may be in such a strong position as to dictate to this House, in five years time or whatever time it may be, that they no longer want the railways.  Who are these people who could say: &ldquo;Let us dig ourselves up to the elbows in the pocket of the community by letting private enterprise do its best.&rdquo;  I do not think we should ever reach the position where any vested interests should be able to dictate to whatever Government might be in power.  I would go further and suggest that there is a strong lobby at the present time composed of individuals, with only their own interests at heart, who wish to get rid of the railways and want to get back to the dog-eat-dog system of private enterprise in transport.  I am glad that that pressure has been resisted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to put one or two other points to the Minister.  I suggest to him that, having made the decision to give every possible opportunity to C.I.E. to conduct its business in the most efficient manner possible, he must take into consideration <Col N="1435" /> the interests of the people in rural Ireland.  We must not forget the fact that, as far as the postal services are concerned, whether a person lives at the tip of West Cork or in the centre of the City of Dublin, he is entitled to the daily delivery of his letters. The transport system should be a national service also.  People, because they have to live far away from the large centres of population, should not by reason of that fact be deprived of transport and of the communications that go with transport.  If we allowed the position to develop that the railways or the branch lines should be closed down and transport in the rural areas left to private individuals we know well that they would only go for the cream of the trade.</P>
    <P>Let me give an instance to the House.  When the land project scheme was in operation the Government decision was that it should be carried by Government Departments and Government engineers carried out the work themselves.  Some other Government decided to sell the machinery and the next thing we had was that private individuals were carrying out the land project on a contract basis.  The result has been, and I do not blame the contractors for it, that small farmers in remote areas are waiting for three and four years to get a contractor to go in and do the job. The same will apply if we give any extensive scope to private individuals as far as transport is concerned.</P>
    <P>Other State enterprises, such as Bord na Móna and the E.S.B., are under very little pressure from private interests.  Private interests see no chance of profit in these State enterprises but there is a chance of profit in the public transport service if these private groups could get their paws into it.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that what comes first is the national interest.  I am not afraid of any vested interest in this House and there are many in my constituency who would like to see me a long way from the remarks I am making about private interests.  Our main interest must be the people as a whole.  The last interest we should <Col N="1436" /> have in the matter of public transport is profits and allowing private interests to make profits at the expense of the community.  As I said the Minister has admitted, in the course of his remarks, that we have suffered from an excess of transport.  There are a number of ways by which that matter could be dealt with.  I would suggest that a forceful and sustained curb on national investments in lorries is essential. That can be achieved by the introduction of necessary legislation which would permit the importation of lorries and component parts.</P>

      <P>I shall deal with it this way.  The Minister has put it that there is an excess of transport and surely I am entitled on that basis to suggest how we can get rid of that excess.  The problem the Minister faces is to how to get a suitable transport service and to preserve the railway system.  I maintain that he cannot maintain the railways while he allows scope to the hauliers.  One of the methods he should adopt&mdash;and the <Col N="1437" /> necessary power may already be there and may not require legislation&mdash;is that vehicles, lorries and component parts, be imported under licence, and that those who engage in private haulage should conform to certain standards with regard to employment, wages and conditions of their drivers and staff generally.  Thirdly, these individuals who apply for the necessary licences to import the lorries should be able to show or give reasonable proof that they had the necessary business themselves to warrant the importation of these lorries.  I would go further and provide that if they wanted to operate outside a certain radius from their own localities, they should be allowed to do so and that they deliver to any part of the country, no matter how remote the address of the particular client might be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry mentioned the question of the Sugar Company.  I think the Minister will have to grasp another nettle here.  We have at the present time C.I.E. dealing with internal transport and the carriage of goods down the country and we have another State body with its own large fleet of trucks in competition with C.I.E.  That is something which creates an intolerable situation.  This should be of great interest to the members of this House who are members of local authorities as these heavy trucks pass across various counties&mdash; and we know the amount it takes to keep up roads at the present time&mdash; while in the vicinity we also have a rail service.  I see no reason why there should not be a dove-tailing of the two State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which I think the Minister should consider, and I think Deputy Norton made reference to it when he spoke about the employees of C.I.E., is that there seems to be a suggestion that C.I.E., by cutting 30 per cent.  of its personnel, could operate just as efficiently as it does to-day and at the same time save the public purse to the extent of the wages of the 30 per cent.  I am not in any position to argue or criticise that but I do feel, and I have discussed this with a number of people outside this House, that when the axe is to fall, if it is to fall, it should fall from the top to the bottom. <Col N="1438" /> I do not like to see little branches lopped off and the weaker sections of the railway hit.  If there is to be a pruning, some of the heavy branches on this big trunk will have to come off.</P>
    <P>Only a few months ago I had occasion to put down a question here in regard to C.I.E.  At a time when they were in debt up to their two eyes and when they were pointing out that they would like to get rid of a lot of employees, they actually advertised for a new manager.  How can the public have any trust when these &ldquo;top-notchers&rdquo; take action like that and at the same time suggest that they want to get rid of workers at the bottom? It means that the ordinary worker is suspicious of the people at the top and that the public have no confidence in C.I.E.  There is no good in the Minister telling C.I.E.  to go ahead and get rid of superfluous workers.  Is it not natural that if a man is in a position to do so he will get rid of two or three people who are junior to him?  He is not going to apply the axe to himself.  No man is going to be his own executioner.</P>
    <P>We had here in recent years a number of efficiency experts who I understand did a reasonable job in certain departments.  Having decided, as the Minister has, that he is going to give C.I.E. this further break, I am all with him and I want to see it successful.  I think he should take in consultants.  I do not care where he gets them but they should be first class consultants and he should let them have the free run of C.I.E.  The Minister will find that if the axe is to be applied here he will get a fair decision from the people to go ahead.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to conclude by saying that I hope the Minister, with a large majority in the House, will not be afraid, that he will bring in a measure that the people as a whole will support and that as a result of his efforts he will give the people an opportunity of regaining confidence in C.I.E. so that we will not be coming in here year after year listening to the wails of people, both in the House and outside, that C.I.E. is always looking for money.  All these wails have one <Col N="1439" /> significance&mdash;that we are preparing the ground all the time for reverting to private transport.  The longer we can put off that the better.  I do not think the Minister himself would be in favour of restoring that position.  I only hope that when the legislation he envisaged during his opening remarks comes before the House it will show strength sufficient to deal with the pressure groups.</P>

      <P>The speech the Minister delivered last week in the House was of great interest, indeed not only to the House itself but also to railway workers in general and the public throughout the Twenty-Six Counties. The most outstanding feature of that speech is the fact that a further respite has been given to C.I.E. as a result of Government decision.  The report of the Committee of Inquiry on Internal Transport has been examined by the Minister and I presume also by his colleagues.  I am glad that the recommendation made by the committee in reference to a drastic cut down in railway lines has not been accepted.</P>
      <P>I think it is right to say that the Government came to their decision to maintain the C.I.E. system at least for a trial period because they recognised the force and the value of the various views that were submitted by organisations and public bodies interested in the retention of the railways.  The Minister has now made his eagerly awaited statement on public transport policy in this country and while it gives a very welcome relief to C.I.E. employees, I regret to say it will not serve much to allay the fears of G.N.R.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, last week, referred to the termination of the agreement with the Northern Government, and he said that in the event of the agreement being terminated&mdash;and, as the House is aware, we have been told it is the intention in Belfast to terminate it&mdash; the part of the G.N.R.  system within this State will be amalgamated with C.I.E.  He spoke of working parties being set up to iron out and resolve the many intricate problems attached to that venture.  I want to take this <Col N="1440" /> opportunity of asking the Minister to ensure that this amalgamation with C.I.E.  will be effected with the minimum of hardship to G.N.R. employees. I fully appreciate his task in that regard is a difficult one.</P>
    <P>I admit that, but I also feel he has the interests of these men at heart. Proof of that interest is to be found in his recent guarantee of £500,000 to the new company.  The workers, I might say, are grateful for that but they feel their cause somehow will be lost if repair work which is being done at present in Dundalk is transferred to Inchicore.  I think it is intended to transfer it next September or October. As the Minister himself said, there are many intricate problems to be attended to, many difficulties to be overcome before amalgamation with C.I.E. can be finalised.  He said that working parties were attending to these problems.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on him the vital importance of this matter and to remind him that for over 100 years this work has been done in Dundalk by Dundalk tradesmen, men who are among the most skilled in the country. I feel sure the Minister will agree that these men have become specialists at their job.  We often hear a lot of talk about centralisation&mdash;that everything must come to Dublin.  Speakers on many occasions have condemned the practice of bringing all things to Dublin.  On the one hand, successive Governments down through the years have condemned this practice, while on the other hand, they have done very little to prevent it.</P>
    <P>Here now, in my opinion, is a golden opportunity for the Minister to help a place outside Dublin.  Here is a chance for him to prove that his concern for Dundalk is genuine.  I understand that the Minister is awaiting a report from the C.I.E.  Board in connection with the proposed amalgamation, and it is my firm hope that negotiations which are, I presume, going on at the moment between the working parties of C.I.E. and the new company in Dundalk will result in a continuance of repair work in that town.  Before that report is presented to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, by this time, got the gist of my remarks. The workers in Dundalk do not know where they stand at the moment because there is a spate of rumours freely in circulation among them.  Some say they are to be dismissed this month, others that there are not going to be any dismissals.  I do not say there is any foundation for these rumours and if the Minister can dispel these fears I shall be very grateful.  The position at the moment is far too vague to be encouraging.</P>
      <P>I agree there is bound be to a certain amount of redundancy because a change over from a railway workshop to a private engineering concern is of such great magnitude that dislocation of employment, to a certain extent, cannot be avoided and certain dismissals are bound to occur.  We all accept that unfortunate fact, but those workmen who are affected by this crisis desire naturally that this possible redundancy be kept at its lowest possible level and they consider that one sure method of achieving that is by allowing the work to which I have referred to be retained in Dundalk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not asking for something new.  They are anxious only to retain what they have and what they have had down through the years.  I hope the Minister will not take from my remarks that I or any G.N.R. employees in Dundalk begrudge C.I.E. <Col N="1442" /> the fixed subsidy every year for five years.  It is essential that a network of railway lines be maintained.  Special legislation is to be introduced to provide certain compensatory benefits for C.I.E. personnel and in addition to that certain capital liabilities incurred by the C.I.E.  Board since 1950 are to be reduced.  All these things are welcome but if these measures are to result in the elimination of Dundalk as a railway repair depot then I have to register a very emphatic protest.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the tendency to bring everything to Dublin and if the Minister allows the transfer of this work to Inchicore his action will be deplorable and indefensible.  It is bad enough to set up a new industry in Dublin at the expense of a provincial town but when it is proposed to transfer an existing one from a place like Dundalk, the strongest protest must be made and, as the representative of that town, I am making that protest here and now.  I trust the Minister will leave no stone unturned to save the Dundalk works.</P>
    <P>I am sure he will agree&mdash;because it is obvious&mdash;that the new company, if it is to attract new work and obtain new orders from commercial firms, will have a very stiff, uphill fight and in my opinion, to saddle it with the added handicap of withdrawing the railway work would be very unjust.  We must remember that since the closing down of three cross-Border lines within the past few months the volume of work now in Dundalk is comparatively small and when the agreement with the Northern Government terminates, as it appears will be the case next year, the existing volume of work will diminish still more because the northern authorities will not leave any Northern Ireland work in Dundalk.  Obviously it will be done in Belfast.  I hope the Minister will pay attention to the matters I have raised and that he will eventually solve this problem, but I must add that I sympathise with him in his efforts.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some reference to legislation in regard to compensation for G.N.R. employees and he also said that any G.N.R. employee who might be absorbed by C.I.E. when the amalgamation <Col N="1443" /> takes place would be entitled to similar scales of compensation.  I asked the Minister previously to state the position of the G.N.R. employees with regard to compensation and he informed me they had no statutory right to it and added that while he could not give any guarantee he thought it was the aim of all concerned to solve that problem so that it would leave no permanent grievance.  That is a very vague statement which I think requires some clarification and I take this opportunity of expressing the hope that in the new Bill which the Minister is to bring to the House early in the New Year he will make some provision for these workers.</P>
    <P>As I informed him earlier, they have been legally advised that they are entitled to compensation and if they are transferred to the Dundalk works in my opinion&mdash;and in their own, I would say&mdash;they will be suffering a worsening of conditions especially if no railway work is to be done there in future.  If they are not transferred to Dundalk and if not absorbed by C.I.E. what will be the position?  I assert that G.N.R. employees in Dundalk are as much entitled to compensation as C.I.E. employees in Inchicore and if the Minister contends he is legally debarred from paying such benefits I suggest that he should cover that point by inserting a clause to that effect in the new Bill.</P>
    <P>I suggest they have at least a moral right to that pension.  It is interesting to observe that the Minister is providing compensation for employees on the Sligo-Leitrim railway.  He will probably retort that the number there is very small and that the position bears no relation to that of the G.N.R. workshops at Dundalk.  One reason he gave for the payment of compensation in the Sligo-Leitrim case was that the workers were domiciled in the State and would not be absorbed by C.I.E. He thought they were entitled to compensation.  I would like to ask the Minister now&mdash;and if he could give me some definite information I would be very grateful&mdash;could he say how many G.N.R.  employees are to be absorbed by C.I.E.?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> With the permission of the Chair, I would like to digress briefly to refer to one of the cross-Border lines which was closed in recent months.  I believe it is relevant to this Estimate.  The reasons for the Government's decision to preserve the C.I.E. system relate to the ability of C.I.E. to pay its way contingent on the subsidy and the effects that a close-down would have on employment, on tourism, on peak periods of passenger and freight traffic and also the possible effects on provincial industries.  They also relate to the comparative costs of operating rail services as against road services.  The Minister gave the cost of operating the railway service as £8,000,000 as against £11,000,000 for the operation of a road service of similar capacity.  In view of the fact that the same reasons apply to the retention of the line from Dundalk to Bundoran&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall content myself by hoping that when the Minister organises the new C.I.E.  Board into which he will attempt to infuse new life, he will ask the new board to consider the possibility of reopening the Bundoran-Dundalk line for the very reasons that the Government gives for maintaining the C.I.E. system.</P>
      <P>Before concluding, I would like to refer to what appears to be a conflict of views between the Minister and the Chairman of the Dundalk Engineering Works.  There appears to be a definite conflict between the assessment of the Minister in relation to future repair work and that of the chairman.  Deputy McGilligan referred to a letter which the chairman wrote to the Dundalk Urban Council following a letter from that council to him.  In that letter he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am afraid, however, that when the G.N.R. Board is dissolved there will be no work for Dundalk on the maintenance and repair of locomotives, rolling stock and bridges as this work will be done in the Republic by C.I.E. and in the North by U.T.A.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I will stop there for a moment and concentrate on the phrase &ldquo;... in the Republic&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I submit that does not necessarily mean that the work will be done in Inchicore.  In my opinion there is a loophole there and I believe that work done for C.I.E. will be done in Dundalk actually by the Dundalk Engineering Company.  Further on he states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Maintenance and repair work for the G.N.R. Board will continue to be done at Dundalk until September next and it is hoped that as from mid-December it will be done for the railways by this company.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring to that particular matter here recently, the Minister said in relation to the time when amalgamation would be achieved that, by that time, Dundalk workshops will of course be a separate commercial enterprise and the arrangements that may be made <Col N="1446" /> between the management of that workshop and C.I.E. for the repair and maintenance of road vehicles is a matter for negotiation between them. There appears to me to be a conflict of views there and I would be very grateful if some clarification were forthcoming from the Minister in that regard.  I trust the Minister will clarify the points I have raised.  The most important one is that relating to Dundalk as regards railway work.  I suggest such work be retained in Dundalk until such time as the new company at least establishes itself and finds its feet.  If that is not done, there is one sure thing&mdash;untold misery will be caused to many families in the town of Dundalk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that no industrial undertaking or organisation since this State was set up has been subjected to the same type and volume of criticism as has C.I.E.  All down through the years, week in and week out, the searchlight of publicity has been beamed on C.I.E. from this House, from local councils, from newspapers and from practically every cross-roads and house in the country. Some of the criticism has been fair and just.  In so far as the criticism was constructive either to the Board of C.I.E. or the Minister in Office it was to be welcomed.  But the greater part of the criticism, however, levelled against C.I.E. has come from misinformed sources and, very often, biassed sources.  At times, one could understand that.  One can understand criticism based on misinformation.  On the other hand, it is difficult to remain calm in face of the unfounded and unfair criticism, such as that made by Deputy Corry this evening, levelled by people who ought to know better and who ought to make it their business to inform themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should endeavour here to get the whole matter of State subsidisation of C.I.E. in its proper perspective.  We have all read leading articles and we have all heard prominent people refer to this subsidisation as colossal subsidisation. If one takes the financial years 1951-1952 to 1955-1956 the average subsidy from State funds to C.I.E. was £2,000,000.  Over that same <Col N="1447" /> period the total average national expenditure was £500,000,000.  State subsidisation of national transport over that period works out at less than one-half of 1 per cent. of national expenditure. We freely condemn in principle subsidisation of national transport and, at the same time, close our eyes to the fact that industry in all its branches and agriculture in particular, either directly or indirectly, are being heavily subsidised by the State and by the community.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House by quoting the innumerable instances of subsidisation in our economy either by way of direct financial aid from the Exchequer or indirect subsidy from the consumer.  Quite recently here the Minister, when pressed as to the total amount of subsidies included in the Book of Estimates, said approximately 75 per cent.  Bearing that in mind I do not know how anybody can quibble at the extent to which the State has been called upon to finance our national transport undertaking.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks the Minister quite rightly stressed that there are very few railway undertakings in the world making a profit or even breaking even.  Those of us who have studied transport are quite aware of that.  We know that in the eight years from 1948 to 1954, in only one year of those eight did British Railways break even and over the whole eight years British Railways lost to the extent of £100,000,000, a loss which had to be made good by the Exchequer.  Similarly, the French railways, which are regarded as the fastest and most up to date in Europe, lost large sums annually which have to be made good.  The railways in Italy, Austria, Spain and Belgium are losing money.</P>
    <P>Why, then, if we regard railway transport as essential&mdash;and it appears from the evidence we have here and from the representations made to the committee inquiring into the problem that, by and large, the people regard the railway as necessary&mdash;must we make such a moan about the subsidy <Col N="1448" /> paid to C.I.E. which, in relation to our total national expenditure, is relatively small?  I am not to be taken as saying that, because of that, I or anybody else should subscribe to the view that no effort should be made by the Government to produce a policy whereby the losses on the railway would be reduced.  Any policy directed towards that target should be welcomed by the House and any Minister producing a policy on those lines should get the support of all sides of the House. Therefore, I must say straight away that in so far as the Minister's statement of policy is directed in that way, it must be welcomed here.</P>
    <P>Personally, I was very glad to hear some of the concessions and reliefs given to C.I.E.  For several years the national transport undertaking had been asking to be relieved of the common carrier obligation.  Without a doubt the obligation imposed on C.I.E. as common carrier had been working to their detriment and putting them at a very serious disadvantage in relation to their competition with other forms of transport.  It will come as a relief also to find that the deadweight of existing capital liability is being removed from their shoulders.  Quite obviously they were not able to bear it.</P>
    <P>The Minister was wise also in stating that he intends in his coming legislation to give powers to C.I.E. to exercise their own discretion in the elimination of branch lines which appear not to have any prospect of paying at all, not even now but in five or ten years' time.  They will not be burdened with the cumbersome procedure it had been subjected to previously before they could close any branch lines.</P>
    <P>One of the most welcome portions of the Minister's statement was that in which he indicated that compensation provision for employees will not have to be met out of C.I.E.'s own resources.  He stated that he intends to set up a State fund out of which this compensation will be paid.  He is to be congratulated on that.  It is most encouraging to the people bound to be affected and it is encouraging also to the Board of C.I.E. that they are being relieved of this large burden.</P>
    <P>I wish that we had more information <Col N="1449" /> regarding the annual Grant-in-Aid which the Minister intends to pay over a five-year period.  I appreciate it would not be easy at this stage to give any definite indication but, when the Minister is replying, perhaps he might give some picture of what he has in mind.  The merits of the Minister's proposals and of his impending legislation will largely depend on the amount of that Grant-in-Aid.  I hope that at the earliest possible date he will give some indication to the House as to what that is to be.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated also that C.I.E. had informed him that they estimated they could do with 30 per cent. less of their operative staff on the railway side of the undertaking.  I do not know whether C.I.E. conveyed that to the Minister in a bald statement or not or whether they gave any further details.  In view of the confusion, frustration and indignation it has caused amongst railway employees, if the Minister has any further information on the matter, it would be wise for him to give it to the House.  The trade unions are at a loss to know where the 30 per cent. redundant staff are; and the implication is, of course, that one railway employee in every three is kicking his heels around the country with no work to do.  In fairness to the workers concerned that statement should be substantiated.</P>
    <P>We cannot forget that already there has been a pruning in the staff of C.I.E.  Between 1950 and 1956, C.I.E. reduced its staff by over 1,200 people, or 10 per cent.  Passengers and freight over that same period actually increased. The only increase in wages and salaries paid during the period amounted to 7 per cent., which was offset by the reduction in staff to which I have referred.  It appears to me that there actually has been an increase in the productivity of the railway operating staff over that period.  I appeal to the Minister to clarify the statement he made because it may be that he or the board is being misunderstood.</P>
    <P>While the concessions and reliefs outlined by the Minister are welcomed, and must be welcomed by anybody sincerely interested in the transport <Col N="1450" /> undertaking and in the welfare of the people employed therein, nevertheless C.I.E. will still have to suffer continued disabilities of one kind or another.  One of the chief disabilities still with them is that they have to maintain completely out of their own resources their own railway highway &mdash;the permanent way.  That has been a very heavy charge on C.I.E. down through the years and may well drive them to the bottom again.</P>
    <P>As we know, road users get very much more preferential treatment. From figures I have seen, the average cost per mile in 1939 of maintaining roadways in Ireland was £66.  That has risen down through the years until in 1955 it cost £213 per mile of ordinary highway.  It is interesting to note how that expense is met.  Of the £213 per mile, £82.4 was met out of the Road Fund, £39.7 from central funds and about £91 out of local rates.  Of all the moneys raised by local authorities in that year one-third went to road maintenance.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. are also very large ratepayers. They have paid their contribution towards local rates and also the taxes and licences in respect of their road freight department vehicles.  In that way they have contributed towards the maintenance of roads largely occupied by people in competition with them. On the other hand, they have been obliged to maintain their own railway highway completely out of their own resources.</P>
    <P>In a recent year's trading, to earn on the railway side £6,750,000 the railway had to expend on the permanent way £1,000,000.  In that very same year they earned in their road freight department £7,000,000 and it cost them in road tax and licences £250,000.  It is significant that in that year their railway losses amounted to £750,000. If the cost of maintaining their permanent way had been in the same proportion as their payment to the Road Fund for the maintenance of roads, there would have been no deficit in railway operations in that year.</P>
    <P>Similarly, and even on a larger scale, the cost of canal maintenance, with which C.I.E. is also burdened, is <Col N="1451" /> disproportionately heavy.  Actually it usually runs to about one-third of the revenue from canal working to maintain the canal.  That means that one-third goes to maintenance as against 1/28th which is the contribution to road maintenance.  All this seems to me to suggest that there might be some means of relieving C.I.E. in a genuine and just way by making a contribution towards the cost of capital maintenance and rail maintenance. There have been different suggestions made regarding that matter in the past and even at present. In the Milne report a recommendation is made for the setting up of a central highway authority and that all means of transport such as road, canals and the railways should be maintained by the authority.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at that suggestion and to see whether or not, in the new legislation which he proposes to introduce, he can embody some section to diminish the burden which is imposed on railways of the maintenance cost.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said regarding the effectiveness of the Minister's proposals for cutting the losses of the railway operating side, I feel that the main problem of bringing traffic back to the railways and of attracting new traffic has not been adequately dealt with.  I feel, and other people in this House have indicated they feel, that if we confine ourselves to the measures already outlined we will not get the results we hope for.</P>
    <P>It is good to know that it is intended to give C.I.E. discrimination in the quotation of rates.  I hope that when that is embodied in legislation, and when they get the opportunity, they will not let the grass grow under their feet and that they will go out and quote competitive rates in order to attract new traffic and get back the traffic they have lost.  They got opportunities in the past and it has been suggested that they fell down on these opportunities.  Here they are getting the opportunity to fight for the traffic and I hope that they will avail of it.</P>
    <P>One of the things the Minister might further consider, and there is no doubt in my mind that he has already considered <Col N="1452" /> it, is the question of giving effect to the recommendations made by C.I.E. regarding the curtailment of private haulage.  The suggestion has been made that some restriction of a certain radius and on lorries over a certain tonnage might be made.  I think it is not in the national interest lorries should be plying on roads, many of them heavy lorries with trailers attached, between towns where there is a railway connection and a road freight service.  While I feel that the Minister has given this matter full consideration I also feel that, if there is not that limited restriction on private transport, the Minister's proposals will not do what he intends them to do.  In making that suggestion I am not suggesting that to-morrow morning we should say to the lorry owners: &ldquo;You are out.&rdquo;  What I am suggesting is that when any of these lorries, for any reason whatever, go into disuse they should not be replaced.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. should also be given the opportunity of operating transport in Government undertaking contracts.  It does appear to be Gilbertian that a Government Department, having the necessity to use transport, should not have in their contracts a clause that national transport should be used.  In regard to Local Government contracts very many of which contain an element of State subsidy, there should be some clause that only C.I.E. transport should be used.  If the Government and the local authority will not use the Government's own transport how do you expect private merchants to use it?  I would ask the Minister to consider that point and also the point already made regarding State and semi-State bodies such as Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann and the E.S.B.  It appears ridiculous that you should have one State company competing with another State company on the roads and everybody sitting back and no one doing anything about it.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made that Government trade loans should not be given to a concern unless some undertaking was given by that concern that the capital thus provided by the State would not be utilised for investment in large transport vehicles.  I also feel <Col N="1453" /> that in the present situation which we find ourselves, and with the present shortage of money, there is room for the introduction of some quota arrangement as far as the importation of large commercial vehicles is concerned. We have seen the large increase in lorries and private cars down through the years and we have now reached the stage where capital for investment in productive work is scarce and much needed.  I think that the Minister should say, for the time being at least, that he would impose a quota on the importation of the heavy type of road vehicles.</P>
    <P>There is one very important factor that I would like to mention in relation to the severe competition that C.I.E. had to face in the operation of its road freight service.  It is the fact that, particularly in the provincial towns there are people against whom C.I.E. has to compete who are employing workers at a rate of wages and with hours of duty and conditions of service far below those enjoyed by C.I.E. employees.  The Minister may say that that is a job for the trade unions, but you will appreciate that I am referring to places outside the larger areas of population where it is difficult to organise the workers.  I hope the Minister will again consider the suggestion that he should take some steps to ensure that C.I.E. will no longer be forced to face that type of unfair competition.  He might meet the case by setting up a joint labour committee for road freight transport under the Industrial Relations Act.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Dr. Browne on 20th November, 1957:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Eireann is of the opinion that Seanad Eireann as it is at present constituted should be abolished.</P>
    <P>Debate was resumed on the following amendment moved by Deputy O'Donnell on 27th November, 1957:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; and substitute: &ldquo;that the existing method of selecting the members of Seanad Eireann should be amended.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the greater part of this debate and to the long speech of Deputy Dr. Browne.  In the main, he recalled some of the arguments I had put, back in 1934, I think it was, when the question of a former Seanad was being considered and a motion for its abolition was before this House.  I think that most of the arguments which I put forward during that period were fundamentally sound. From a purely theoretical point of view, I think the arguments I put were difficult to controvert.  Later, when we were bringing in the Constitution, I was fully aware that, notwithstanding the arguments that had been put forward, nevertheless the people desired to have a bicameral, instead of a unicameral, system here.</P>
      <P>I had tried, when the Constitution was being considered, to find some form of Second House which would not be open to the objections I had put forward previously or would not be open to the objections which I was fully aware had been made to the existing Second Chambers in a number of States.  We were all aware, of course, that where you have a federal system there is a very good reason for having a Second Chamber&mdash;in the United States of America, for example &mdash;but in a number of other cases where it existed fault was consistently found with the various modes of constitution of the Second Chamber, and so on.  I looked around and I could not see how we could have a chamber here that would not be open to these objections. There was a line of approach, however, which had not been tried before, and that was to try to get in the Second Chamber something like a vocational House in which the various vocational groups of the community might be represented and that would have its powers carefully limited, to ensure that they did not clash with the fundamental rights of the directly representative Assembly.  That was the line that was aimed at in the Constitution as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My hope at the time was that, after <Col N="1455" /> a period, we would be sufficiently organised vocationally in the country, and that the panels which were indicated in the Constitution would be such, that the members for these panels could be elected directly by vocational bodies.  I still have a hope that that day may come, that it will be possible, after we are organised sufficiently, to allow the vocational bodies to elect members for these panels directly.  I thought that, in the mean-time&mdash;and there I have been completely disappointed&mdash;the method of nomination would so limit the number of persons who would be going up for election that, in fact, no matter what the electorate was, as the panels from which the electorate had to select would be definitely of a vocational character, the electorate would not matter very much.  In that I was disappointed, because the tendency has been for the bodies which have the right to nominate the panels to have regard to the electorate in selecting people to represent the vocational groups.  They look forward to having persons elected by the electing body, and since these electing bodies comprise members of the Dáil, the County Councils and so on, since the electorate is of a political character, the names are thought of rather from the political Party angle than the purely vocational one.  It is that that has prevented the aim I had in the Constitution from being achieved.  That is my view.</P>
    <P>A motion has been put forward to abolish the Seanad, and I think that motion will have to be resisted.  There is an amendment before the House that the present system should be amended. My view is that, if the House wishes to do it, we could have another try.  We could set up a committee, or a commission, to go into the whole situation.  I do not want to say that the system can be amended because, as a matter of fact, when we examine it we may not be able to get anything better.  Remember that what we have is the result of consideration after consideration.  A Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad went into the matter fairly thoroughly.  We had a previous committee, or commission, also which went <Col N="1456" /> into the matter fairly thoroughly, and we should not like to commit ourselves in advance to the view that we may be able to amend the system under the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to those who put down the amendment that if the amendment is withdrawn we should try to set up either a committee of the two Houses or a commission to reexamine the system of election, leaving the Constitution untouched, to see whether the method of election can be improved.  If there was a stronger view on that, we might have a mixed commission with members from the two Houses and members from outside as well, so that the matter might be examined as impartially as possible and the Government would have an opportunity of considering the report, taking up their attitude and bringing to the Dáil any proposals they might approve.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take up too much time in this debate or curtail the time of those who wish to reply.  Our position is that we will have to resist both the motion and the amendment in the form in which they are, because there is a suggestion that the system can be amended and we may not be sure of that.  If it is left open that the matter should be reconsidered and re-examined we are ready to accept that suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are sorry the Taoiseach finds it impossible to accept our motion.  We would have been very glad had he found it possible to accept the idea behind the motion.  He has made it clear in his few words that he has given a very great amount of thought over a long period to this whole question.  Before the Seanad was re-established, he said, he had exhausted every possible line of proposal to achieve the ideal Seanad.  It has not been possible to get the ideal Seanad.  One could ask why or how he could believe that any commission now established would be likely to achieve what it failed to do a few years ago.  However, we shall accept that position as making the best of a bad job and wish the committee to be established every success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, since modern developments have greatly modified the usefulness of present expenditure on defence and rendered it wasteful in large measure, Dáil Eireann is of the opinion that a Select Committee consisting of 14 members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, of whom six shall be a quorum, should be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records to inquire into, consider and report upon the whole question of national defence expenditure.</P>
      <P>I think the motion speaks for itself. However, I presume it is necessary for me to give to the House the various reasons why I and others outside the House believe that the time is ripe for an overhaul of our defence plans and our expenditure thereon.  It is necessary to go back a little into the history of the Defence Forces and of the Defence Plan that we have at the moment.  I propose to go back only a short period, to the end of the last war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who were members of this House in 1947 and 1948 will recollect that a great deal of discussion took place here on what a suitable Army for this country would be&mdash;the strength, and the type of Army that we should have in this country.  It was decided by the experts that the ideal system for this small nation would be <Col N="1458" /> a voluntary Defence Force, that this voluntary Defence Force would be based on a small but highly trained professional Army.  When I say &ldquo;small&rdquo; I mean small by international standards, an Army, taking into consideration our social and economic problems and our financial position, that would be pretty large for a country like this.</P>
    <P>The idea at that time was that if there was a danger of invasion or the likelihood of this country becoming embroiled in war we would have sufficient time to call out the Volunteers and that the regular personnel in the Army would have sufficient time to train these Volunteers.  This plan was based on events of the last war.  The first phase in France in the last war gave adequate time here to recruit and train an efficient emergency force.  The post-war decision taken here was to build our defence on this nucleus of a Regular Army, assisted by the Volunteers if and when an emergency was declared.</P>
    <P>The decision, as recorded in this House, was to recruit a regular standing Army with the strength of 12,500 persons.  It is very important at this stage that though the plan was for a personnel of 12,500, that figure was never reached in spite of successive energetic recruiting campaigns.  In other words, putting it very bluntly, the plan envisaged in the post-war period never materialised.  We never had the strength in manpower that was envisaged in those earlier years.  To-day we have less than 8,000 soldiers and at no period since then has the figure been exceeded.  At the same time we have had the officer and N.C.O. element in the Army almost at full strength and we have continued gaily turning out officers in great style from the Curragh Military College.</P>
    <P>Supposing the same position obtained to-day as did during the war period would it be unreasonable for me to suggest that it is demoralising for the officer personnel to be at full strength and not to have sufficient troops under their command for the purposes of training.  I believe it is most demoralising and also that no officer can be really efficiently trained unless he has practical experience in <Col N="1459" /> handling and controlling troops.  As I have pointed out, we have not enough troops for the officer personnel in our Army.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into any great detail, because on this occasion I am trying to draw as broad a picture as I can.  Our defence plan is based on the lessons of the last war and the last war and its plans are as outmoded as the bow and arrow.  The hydrogen bomb, the guided missile, the atomic submarine, have brought revolutionary changes in the conception of warfare but, in spite of the fearful and fantastic changes that have taken place all over the world, this little country has gone on gaily and unashamedly with its outmoded system of defence. The ill thought-out plan to which I have referred never materialised but it has cost this country in the last ten years £58,000,000.  In addition, we have spent another £3,000,000 on pensions for our retired Army personnel so that by next March we shall have spent approximately £61,000,000 in the last ten years on a defence plan that never materialised.</P>
    <P>It might appear that £1,000,000 or £60,000,000 would be small change to a nation such as the U.S.S.R. or the U.S.A. who might spend it on the launching of one particular missile, but that £60,000,000 is a lot of money for a nation like this.  I would be the last person in this House, even though I consider £60,000,000 is a large sum, to criticise that expenditure on defence if I knew or believed that it was being spent on a practical defence system.</P>
    <P>Have we yet seen the light?  What is the position?  In spite of the changes to which I have referred in the present year we are spending over £6,000,000 again on this outmoded defence system.  It may be worth while to give the House some information as to how the money is being spent.  Before we pay a soldier or clothe or feed him we pay to civilians and civil servants attached to the Army out of the £6,000,00 no less than £938,435.  That means we are spending this year almost £1,000,000 of the Defence Vote on civilians.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> In case the Minister suggests I am taking this opportunity to criticise some of the civilian personnel we can break down that still further.  Of the civilian personnel, 1,625 civilians are attached to the Army in various capacities as fitters, caretakers, carpenters and so on and they cost £650,000.  We have 522 civil servants and they cost £288,000 so that we have a total of 2,147 civilians costing this year almost £1,000,000 in the defence system.</P>
    <P>Now let us compare the proportion of Army personnel, men charged with the defence of the country, and the civilians.  For every civilian we have four privates, or it can be put the other way round.  For every four privates in the Army we have one civilian in some capacity attached to the Army and drawing out of the Army Vote.  I do not think it is unfair for me to suggest that on that proportion there is room and scope for a committee such as I have suggested to make a thorough examination as to the necessity or desirability of having that number of civilians attached to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the Army personnel. Speaking subject to correction in regard to changes that may have been made recently&mdash;because I am referring in all this debate to the Book of Estimates for the current year&mdash;we have 1,330 commissioned officers in the Army and that includes all officers in the Army and in the Naval service.  Their total pay packet is £1,080,000, that is to say another sixth of the total sum available for Defence.  Between N.C.Os. and corresponding ranks in the naval service the pay is £890,000 and the pay for the private soldiers and sailors is £1,288,000.  Putting it more briefly, the pay of the combined officer and N.C.O. element ranges within a few thousand pounds of the £2,000,000 figure.  In other words, almost £2,000,000 goes on their pay while the pay of the soldiers and the naval service is £1,288,000.  The pay of the officers and N.C.Os. combined exceeds that of the privates by £698,000.  It would be logical to conclude that we are top heavy with regard to our officer personnel or else we are not paying the bottom ranks enough in <Col N="1461" /> proportion.  I do not know which is the correct conclusion, but I suggest there is room for inquiry.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look now at the strength of the officer personnel versus the privates.  If we take officers and N.C.Os. together we get a proportion of one officer for every 1-3/5th private. If the House is not satisfied with my lumping together commissioned and non-ocommissioned, I shall give the figures separately.  We have a commissioned officer to less than seven privates, or a commissioned officer to a little over six privates.  Can it be seriously suggested in those circumstances that an officer can be trained efficiently in his duties?  Practical exercise in the field and elsewhere must be an absolute joke when one has only paper battalions to lead, guide and train.  I want to put it on record now that the officers and N.C.Os. are, in my opinion, first-class men despite the handicaps under which they labour. It is a tragic situation to have first-class officers and N.C.Os. sitting twiddling their thumbs for the last ten years waiting for the recruits that never turned up.</P>
    <P>With regard to pay, there is one point I want to clarify.  I omitted dealing with the amount of money that is being paid out in pensions to officer personnel.  It is something that needs serious examination.  In the Book of Estimates this year we have a figure for pensions for officers who retired before the Minister used the scythe on the top ranks recently.  We have one general, two lieutenant-generals, four major-generals, 17 colonels, 35 lieutenant-colonels and 119 commandants and the total sum paid in pensions this year is £124,655.  Mark you, that figure will increase because next year, due to the action taken by the Minister in retiring a number of old-timers from the Army there will be a bigger bill to meet for pensions.  I do not criticise the steps he has taken.  Possibly the idea was to give a chance to the younger men.  I believe, however, that he should have waited for a reorganisation before promoting the younger men.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that a number of these retired officers hold <Col N="1462" /> down other State jobs and thereby help to fill the emigrant ship.  As far as the State is concerned the principle should be &ldquo;one man one job.&rdquo;  In my opinion, one pay packet from the State is sufficient.  There is room for examination there of the Defence Plan.  Having waited ten years for recruits who never turned up, is it not time we were logical and cut our cloth as far as officer personnel is concerned? Quite apart from the evolution of weapons and the improvements that have taken place, is not the plan we have futile even in existing circumstances? The expenditure involved is both extravagant and wasteful.</P>
    <P>I shall turn now to the Air Corps. Any criticism I make is not of individuals. I have nothing but the greatest respect for them, and some of them, I am glad to say, are amongst my best friends.  But my regard for the Army will not prevent me criticising the defence plan.  A decision was taken here a few years ago to equip our Air Force with Vampire jet planes.  These were purchased to train our pilots in handling such planes.  Three planes were purchased at a cost of £147,000.  I read somewhere that the emphasis should be placed on the word &ldquo;vampire&rdquo;&mdash;the bloodsucker&mdash;because these Vampires fairly sucked the money out of the Exchequer.  A greater waste I do not know.  They were hardly off the assembly line in Britain when, as far as Britain was concerned, they were obsolete.  The runways at Baldonnel had to be extended.  In the course of the recommended reconstruction first-class arable land was acquired.  When the work of making the runways was finished the cost to the State was over £600,000.  And this was to allow three jets to land!</P>
    <P>Anybody will realise that three jets on their own are of no use to the Air Corps.  When the three were purchased they were the first of a proposed contract&mdash;which I agree had not been fully signed&mdash;for nine.  Every Air Corps likes to have a squadron, and in any squadron we have nine aircraft.  We first purchased three, and the hope of the Army personnel who advised the Government was that six more of these obsolete planes would be purchased. Luckily enough, public opinion and <Col N="1463" /> developments in the jet world saved us that expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I raised this matter here on a number of occasions the answer given by the particular Minister was that the big argument in favour of the jet planes and the runway was that it would enable us to train commercial pilots here in order to man Aer Lingus.  That may be a very desirable objective, but I do not believe it is essential or that it is the most practical or economic way of going about training pilots for a commercial airline.  I believe it would be cheaper and better to send our pilots to some other country where they have first class experience in the running and flying of the most modern jet planes and that the cost of doing this would be infinitesimal in comparison to what has taken place here.</P>
      <P>If we are to set up a runway of this nature and buy dubious obsolete planes for the purpose of prestige, then it is time we had another look. Mark you, this little venture in prestige has cost the taxpayer the sum of £1,000,100.  I think that such a committee as I have envisaged in this motion would have plenty of scope for a thorough and ruthless investigation of the why and the wherefore for the expenditure of that money.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the people in England from whom these planes were bought decided that these Vampires were only a passing phase.  The Vampire jet that we bought is as obsolete to-day as the Model T. Ford. The Vampire jet that we bought had a top speed of 600 m.p.h.  Within a month of the delivery of these planes, jet planes in Britain were doing double that speed.  I think it would be safe to say at the moment that jet planes are becoming obsolete even though they have a speed of 5,000 m.p.h.  If we want a jet to-morrow morning we can go to America and buy an American Starfire F.81 jet.  It will cost us £1,500,000.  We can go to Britain and buy a Hawker Hunter jet fighter off the assembly line at £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it suggested that the training <Col N="1464" /> being received in the Vampire jet we bought, with a maximum speed of 600 m.p.h., will be suitable training for men asked to man the faster type of plane?  If we go into the purchase of jets and buy those that can fly at 600 m.p.h., surely the logical step is to go on purchasing better and better jets? And all for prestige.  It is like keeping up with the Joneses.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is unfair to suggest to the House that we should have an inquiry into the purchase of these planes.  I do not think it is unfair to suggest that that £1,000,100 would have been far better spent on Shannon for commercial operations so that we could reap the benefit of any change taking place in regard to companies that fly over Shannon.</P>
    <P>Taking the defence position as a whole, I think it is impossible to justify the expenditure of £6,000,000 this year on a stone age defensive system while men are already preparing for a flight to the moon.  I do not personally suggest that the Army should be abolished.  I have no personal objection to the idea of a standing Army of a reasonable size.  It is quite possible such an army is necessary for internal security, but I challenge the idea of basing our defence on a standing Army of 12,500 men, armed with conventional weapons and with out-dated equipment.</P>
    <P>Last week, I asked the Minister on what did he propose to spend the sum of over £200,000 laid out for defensive equipment in the Estimate.  He told me it was intended to purchase small arms and ammunition and other defensive material which it would not be in the public interest to disclose. Imagine that for an answer at this stage of our lives.  We are going to spend a sum of £250,000 this year on small arms and ammunition for small arms for the purpose of giving training to a phantom army on the firing line.  Mark you, it is a pretty expensive type of training and, apart from that, where will it lead to?  Is it for the benefit of the State in the long run?</P>
    <P>I believe that if this motion is accepted it will give an opportunity for us to stand back and consider the whole problem in a calm manner.  It <Col N="1465" /> will give us an opportunity to put a halt to wasteful expenditure.  We live in an age when the hydrogen bomb can land here in a few minutes.  I hope that will never happen but we all know the development at the present time in submarines.  The construction of submarines is now such that two submarines off our coast could annihilate the entire population in the space of a few minutes.  And that is a development which we cannot counter by any defensive measures.  Our size and our manpower is too limited to counteract such a happening.</P>
    <P>A standing Army of 12,500 men is a waste of time if we ever have to face up to that type of attack.  If such a thing ever did occur the soldier and the civilian would be in the same boat. Defence is now the problem and the responsibility of every individual.  We can no longer look to the outmoded idea of a professional Army to lead us when an emergency is declared and all flock to the colours.  The longest warning that we might get now would be five minutes and that would hardly give time to the professional soldiers to put on their boots and get into the same underground as the civilians.</P>
    <P>I am not looking on myself as an expert in military matters but I shall quote a number of individuals for whom I have the greatest respect. Most Deputies will recollect the name of Captain Liddell Hart.  I think that in the past he has been uncanny in the correctness of his forecasts with regard to the use of weapons and he said in regard to these later developments that the only counter to them lies in new scientific discoveries and developments. This is the reference that should have a bearing for us when he says that &ldquo;it also turns on whether we have the courage to change our course and cut out much of our present expenditure on weapons and forms of force that cannot now safeguard us.&rdquo; That is the opinion of one of the best experts of the British Government with regard to the use of conventional weapons.  It is significant that the British Government have realised that the time for this type of armament is past and, despite the terrible pressure brought to bear on them, they took the decision to cut down their <Col N="1466" /> standing army.  They have, of course, to spend money on defence, but they have changed from expenditure on the army and are now expending on missiles, rockets and so forth and they have also decided to spend large sums of money on civilian defence.</P>
    <P>We cannot hope, and I am sure no Deputy in this House believes, that we could emulate the British with regard to the expenditure on missiles and other types of modern weapons but I see nothing wrong with our following their example with regard to expenditure, within our means, on civil defence.  I believe that we should alter our whole plan of military strategy to one for civil defence.  I would nearly go so far as to say that a large percentage of the money at present being expended on the Army, which is a waste of time, should be devoted to civilian defence and to the training of our people as a whole in civil defence.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into details with regard to civil defence, but it is necessary for us, if the time should ever come that missiles should be launched against this State, that the people would know, those of them who would escape, how to help themselves and to help others throughout the country after such a bombardment.  It would be a frightening thing to think that we would have no survivors, but the belief of all the experts is that if the population is sufficiently aware of the means of protection, that a large percentage of the civilian population will survive. If we are going to spend money on a Defence Estimate it would be far more logical to spend it on the civilian population in the hope that they would survive rather than to spend it on the present lines of the Army.</P>
    <P>The present Estimate calls for an Army of 12,500 men, but any Deputy who examines the position coolly will ask himself what difference it is going to make to us whether we have an Army of 4,000 men or 12,000 men.  So far as preventing an attack of any description from outside is concerned, an Army of 4,000 would be as useful as an Army of 12,000.  If we had to have a standing Army I believe that it would be better that we should halve the size of the present Army, especially in the <Col N="1467" /> officer corps.  That would reduce expenditure on equipment.  If you reduce the number of men you automatically reduce the amount of money expended on uniforms, equipment, on the food bill and other matters.  So that if there is a decision taken drastically to reduce you are going to cut down automatically on expenditure.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest to the House that 4,000 is the figure, but I do suggest that a committee of the type I have suggested would be entitled and should be entitled to sit and examine all the relevant aspects. The committee should have the power to send for all personnel, all papers and all documents in order to satisfy themselves that all possible information bearing on this would be put at their disposal.</P>
    <P>Mind you, you will find people in this country and in this House who will object to my suggestion.  There are a number of people in this House who have forgotten what the word democracy means.  The people as a whole send us to this House; the people through their representatives decide, or should decide, what they want and the majority of the people outside this House believe the time is ripe for a complete investigation into this expense.  In any democratic country the people's word should count and their views should be listened to.  Whatever wishes they express should be carried out.  I am sure you have people here who look upon themselves as experts on defence. Those responsible for advising on defence will resent that members of this House should tell them what money should be spent on defence.</P>
    <P>I think that some of the money that has been spent on the advice of these gentlemen has been wasted and that the people outside resent the fact that it was wasted.  There is only one way that you can prevent that type of thing happening again and that is to have this House, or a group of members of this House, as a watchdog over this expenditure.  I want the present Minister, Deputy Boland, to understand that my references are not to him.  He has only recently taken up <Col N="1468" /> this post and this state of affairs has been going on for years.  I want to make this clear, that the group which has been advising various Governments down the years on defence, and the purchase of defence equipment, have proved themselves in many ways to be out of touch with modern developments and, therefore, it is time a halt were called to their gallop. Such a committee as I have mentioned is the most democratic way of calling a halt.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks this is revolutionary and that it is the sort of thing that would be asked for only in this country, let me refer him to the great country across the Atlantic to which we are all invited to look and cast our eyes as an example of how things should be done.  I refer to America. You have Committees of the American Senate and Congress who regularly have discussions with the various chiefs of the Defence groups, the Naval Chief, the Air Force Chief and the Army Chief, and all their subordinates from top level are brought regularly before the committees and cross-examined as to expenditure already incurred, cross-examined thoroughly and ruthlessly on proposed expenditure in the various services.  It is the one saving grace that the Americans have, as far as that end is concerned, that the people, through their representatives, have a say and a control over the military brass-hats whether Naval, Air or Army.</P>
    <P>I think it is not unreasonable to suggest that a Committee of this House should have power, not perhaps to the same extent as in America, but reasonable power as suggested in this motion, to carry out an investigation.  I do not know what the Government view is on this motion but I do suggest, at any rate, that many members of the House, back-benchers like myself, are of the opinion that an investigation on the lines I have suggested is overdue.  At this stage all I will ask the Minister is that he gives it the most sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>There are many points and many other aspects of the defence position that I could go into deeply but I have no intention of doing so because I should like to have as full and general <Col N="1469" /> a discussion on the matter as possible. The Minister will find that as far as the mover, and the seconder, of this motion are concerned, we are not anxious, under any circumstances, to have a say or be included on, or associated with, any such committee.  We do feel it should embrace both the Government and the Opposition and that if the committee is on that basis you will get a united approach to the problem and the people will have confidence in the report issued by such a body.</P>
    <P>The unsatisfactory position with regard to recruiting in the Army, with regard to pay and so forth of various elements, is one that is causing intense dissatisfaction.  I believe that the Minister would be doing a lot to placate certain elements in the Army and at the same time taking a practical step to reduce expenditure on certain lines, if he allowed this motion to go through.  It has been suggested that Deputies have little knowledge of committee work due to the fact that committees of this House sit on very rare occasions.  The modern trend in democracy is to have committees to deal with certain specific matters and when the matter is dealt with by the committee it can then come before the Parliament itself.  There are Deputies here who are interested in various aspects of development&mdash;Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. programme and other types of development.  You also have Deputies who perhaps have a close interest and knowledge of Army matters, during years of association with it.</P>
    <P>We should set the ball rolling now by having a Select Committee set up to examine the matter and make recommendations.  If the House takes such a decision in relation to defence, later on similar committees can sit and examine other aspects of our economy and of our expenditure on the matters I have mentioned.  It is of very great importance that the Minister should not turn down the proposal to set up this committee.  If he objects to the wording of the motion, if he disagrees with the suggested size of the committee, that is a simple matter to remedy.  We will be most agreeable and willing to co-operate with him on <Col N="1470" /> a matter of this nature.  I urge upon him to leave it to the individual Deputies to say whether or not this committee should be set up.</P>

      <P>I do not consider that the terms of this motion make it necessary for me to cover all the old ground that has been traversed by Deputy McQuillan.  I propose to deal really with the terms of the motion as on the Order Paper.  The motion suggests in the first instance that modern developments have rendered our present expenditure on defence in this country wasteful in large measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been made by the mover of the motion of the decisions which are alleged to have been taken in other countries to cut down on expenditure on conventional defence and to reduce the size of their regular standing armies.  We have had some vague references to the implications contained in the White Paper on Defence issued last April in Great Britain.  Mainly on the basis of those references, we have been accused of neglecting to keep abreast of modern developments here and of failure to fall into line in the matter of our defensive measures and expenditure on defence.  It is not quite clear to me exactly what the proposer of this motion wants us to do.  Even <Col N="1471" /> after listening to Deputy McQuillan's speech, I am still not exactly clear as to what action he expects to be taken in regard to our defence policy or of how our expenditure on defence is wasteful in large measure, because during his speech it appeared to me that Deputy McQuillan was arguing on both sides at the same time.</P>
    <P>He argued on the one hand that the Army was too big and then, at another stage, he argued that what was wrong with the Army was that we had not succeeded in getting sufficient recruits into it.  I do not know whether the suggestion is that because we have not got these modern weapons of which he spoke, because we are not able to provide ourselves with these nuclear armaments, we should on that account abandon all efforts at providing any defence for the country whatever and, by doing so, leave a vacuum here so that anybody who liked could come in and take over the country.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite obvious that if a country does not provide for its own defence some other country will do it. In the present state of the world a vacum like that would be considered a danger and certainly I do not think it would be a desirable thing.  As I say, I am not quite clear as to whether that was the suggestion or whether it was suggested that, because of modern developments, we should embark on a programme of equipping ourselves with these weapons.  If that is the suggestion, I do not think the mover is consistent either, because in his criticism of the only one of these modern weapons we acquired, the jet airplanes, he pointed out that these were out of date immediately they had been purchased.</P>
    <P>With the present rapid progress in developing modern weapons, it is obvious it would be quite likely that any of these weapons with which we might equip ourselves would very rapidly be out of date.  In any case, the more we study these modern developments in warfare the clearer it becomes that conventional forces, armed with conventional weapons, following any nuclear attack will still be essential for the protection of the free world.  Indications anywhere do <Col N="1472" /> not side with the suggestion that ground forces should be abolished. Indeed the indications point to the desirability of integrating ground forces, armed with conventional weapons, with the new nuclear weapons.  The British White Paper to which references have been made, points out that nuclear air power alone was not, by itself, a great deterrent and that it would still be necessary that the frontiers of the free world should still be defended on the ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was on that White Paper mainly that the Deputy based his argument.  The same White Paper pointed out that, apart from commitments abroad, it was the intention still to maintain adequate forces for home defence.  So it certainly is not true that it has been decided in Great Britain to abolish conventional forces.  It is still maintained that it would be essential to have conventional ground forces even in the event of nuclear warfare.  It is abundantly clear that whatever adjustments have been made, or are in process of being made, by the Great Powers, it would be completely unrealistic to expect that similar large scale readjustments and re-organisations would be possible in our case. Adjustments have taken place in the defence plans of the Great Powers but there just is not any scope for similar adjustments here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Army is, and always has been, in every sense of the word, a Defence Force purely and simply.  It has been organised, as Deputy McQuillan himself stated, on a very modest basis and the peace time establishment that is provided is intended merely as a framework establishment which could be expanded in the event of an emergency.  There is no pretence that the Army as at present organised would be in a position to render effective opposition to an attack by nuclear weapons.  Therefore, we have not got the same scope for reduction in our defence forces as the Great Powers. Our forces have never been calculated for the role of taking part in a world war; they have merely been organised to defend our own territory from <Col N="1473" /> occupation as far as it is possible for us to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan said that other countries had cut their defence expenditure to the bone.  The position here is that our defence expenditure has been cut to the bone all the time and, in my opinion, there are simply no more reductions that can be made.  In replying to the same arguments made by the Deputy in the debate on the Estimates I pointed out that some of the reductions that had been made in Britain were not open to us here.  We have no troops stationed abroad that can be recalled.  We have no heavy battleships or bombers with the services of which we could dispense and, as I pointed out already, we have no compulsory military service which we could slow down or abandon.  Thus, the sources of saving on expenditure which were available in Britain and other places were not available to us.</P>
    <P>Since then I have had an opportunity of reading Deputy McQuillan's speech on the Estimates for Defence in 1955 and it appears to me that if we had taken his advice at that time we would now have an opportunity of saving on the last item I have mentioned, on compulsory military service, because so far as I can interpret his remarks at that time, he was advocating a form of compulsory military service.</P>
    <P>It has never been intended that our Defence Forces could effectively oppose attacks by nuclear weapons.  I may well be asked what would be the rôle of our Defence Forces in the light of modern conditions.  First of all, it would be the maintenance of internal security, the preservation of the State from possible civil disturbances.  Its second function would be the prevention, as far as possible, of hostile occupation of our territory in the event of war.  Thirdly, it would have the rôle of providing warning of attacks, whether with conventional or nuclear weapons, and of warning the population of the presence of radio-active fallout, which is a danger attendant on war conducted with these nuclear weapons.  A fourth function would be the rendering of assistance to Civil Defence when the Army was not actually employed in its primary rôle as a combatant force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> To deal with the first function, it is on the Defence Forces that the internal security in the State must ultimately depend and for this, it is necessary that a proportion of regular and disciplined troops free from sectional influences and armed with conventional weapons should be maintained in the State.  In the event of war there is always the possibility of civil disturbances which could only be kept in check by the existence of an Army organised as our Army is at the present time.</P>
    <P>As regards the second function, I think it must be readily appreciated that the likelihood of our being invaded or of having unacceptable demands made on us must increase in proportion to our neglect to take the most effective defensive measures it is possible to take.  Nuclear weapons may, of course, be used against us and we are not in a position effectively to oppose them or to retaliate with them but these weapons have not been used since the atomic bombs were exploded over Japanese cities at the conclusion of the last world war.  Although they have not been used, it is still a fact that a number of countries have since that time lost their liberty.  Therefore, it is possible for a country to succumb without these weapons being employed and there is some purpose in our maintaining an Army even if it is only possible to equip it with conventional weapons.</P>
    <P>During the years 1939 to 1945 I think there was ample evidence of the value to the nation of the Defence Forces as then organised, trained and equipped. The more force it will be necessary for an aggressor nation to employ in order to enforce its demands, the more likely it is that a policy of neutrality will be respected.  Therefore, for our resistance to the physical occupation of the country, even under non-nuclear conditions or even following attacks by nuclear weapons, it is necessary to have a force organised on the lines on which the present Army is organised.</P>
    <P>I do not think it can be asserted by anybody that the present depleted forces, which as Deputy McQuillan said, are many thousands below even the framework establishment provided <Col N="1475" /> for, are excessive for this country. Conventional forces do not provide defence against nuclear attack but they can be trained to operate in the face of nuclear attack by increasing dispersion, by digging excavations and other protective measures.  Sufficient is known of the effects of modern weapons to appreciate the conditions which would obtain in a war waged with such weapons and to realise that even though we might not be involved the civilian population might be subjected to great hazards and stresses and strains not hitherto experienced. In circumstances such as this, the presence of an army, well trained and disciplined, could have a tremendous effect on the morale of the people. Indeed, in those conditions, the existence of such an army could mean the difference between chaos and ordered survival.</P>
    <P>The army as at present organised could be very useful, under the conditions that might follow an attack by nuclear weapons.  We have some light aircraft here, we have mobile units in the army, and these would be very useful in the reconnaisance of damaged radioactive centres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question of the Minister for Health today as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Health if he will state (a) the date of receipt in his Department of a letter from the South Cork Board of Public Assistance, requesting sanction for the increase of the bed complement in the Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher, by some 20 beds, (b) the date on which the letter was replied to, (c) the date on which sanction was notified by his Department, and (d) the reason for the delay.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> In the reply the Minister said that the previous Minister for Health orally authorised the manager to equip the ward for 20 patients and to obtain the necessary equipment locally&mdash;and that that was on the 27th July, 1956.</P>
    <P>It is very extraordinary that we had this whisper over the phone to the manager and that the manager apparently forgot all about it.  On the 28th August, just a month after we were supposed to have received sanction, the Board of Public Assistance wrote saying it was desired, as a matter of urgency, to increase immediately the number of beds, including cots, in that hospital to 200, on account of the outbreak of polio.  It is extraordinary that, if the Minister had whispered over the phone to the manager, giving sanction, the manager would sit silent whilst his secretary, on the instructions of the committee, wrote back to the Minister's Department looking for sanction.  That was on the 28th August, 1956.</P>
    <P>A further letter was sent on the 2nd October, 1956, looking for an increase, and 20 beds were sanctioned.  This was looking for an increase, for the provision of 67 beds&mdash;47 for polio, 13 for Block 4 Ward and the balance seven, and appropriate equipment for the full bed complement up to 200.  That was sent on the 2nd October.  That was the second letter, reminding the Department of our application of the 28th August.</P>
    <P>A further letter was sent on the 19th December, 1956, again appealing for the necessary sanction to bring the bed complement up to 200.  It is extraordinary that the Minister should have given sanction, according to this, on the 27th July, 1956.  Following our letter of the 28th August, this is the excuse given here:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No reply issued at the time in response to this application, as it was necessary, in view of the stringent financial situation, to defer decisions on a number of projects for which grants had been sought.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what 67 beds are thought to cost, but I do know what the amount of the stake in the Dublin Sweepstakes was handed over.  The <Col N="1477" /> amount for 50 per cent. of the cost of 67 beds would be roughly about £300, at a period when the people of Cork and the hospital authorities of Cork were driven to their wit's ends to find beds for an epidemic of polio.  Of course, this did not trouble the gentlemen in Dublin, who had no money, despite the fact that they had collected over £1,500,000 out of the sweepstakes the previous year.  My objection is that when the local authority instructs its secretary to write to a Department, the least we might expect is an answer.  Three letters are written to the Department of Health here.  None of the three was answered and the first reply we got was on the 25th November, 1957, 14 months after the application was made&mdash;that is after we got sanction for the 20 beds. I do not know what Departments of State think, but I know what the people think about them.  Since we are supposed to have democratic rule, it is about time we had a little democratic rule and not be ruled by a kind of ring which has been formed up here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>During that period we had to put patients into the old Richmond Hill Fever Hospital, a large number of them; we also had to take over the fever hospital in St. Finbarr's and put patients in there and we had to go to the Cork County Sanatorium Committee and apply to them for beds under those circumstances.  At the same time, we had room in our own hospital for extra beds and the Minister and his Department were too busy to send down a letter of sanction. They were depending, apparently, on an oral message delivered, or supposed to be delivered, by a Minister on the 26th July, 1956.  If the message had been delivered, it is extraordinary that the manager forgot all about it when the matter was discussed a month afterwards, on the 28th August, 1956.  It is extraordinary that he should forget all about it when he instructed the secretary to write again on the 2nd October, 1956, looking for sanction for 67 beds.</P>

I do not want to read here the letters, copies of which I hold in my hand, that were sent to the Department on each occasion I have mentioned.  I have them here.  It is rather extraordinary that a manager would instruct his secretary in that way.  The first letter was on the 28th August and was written as a matter of urgency, to obtain sanction. In the second letter it was stated: &ldquo;The Minister's sanction is now applied for to the provision of 67 beds, 47 for polio, 13 for Block 4 Ward and the balance seven and appropriate equipment to cater for the full bed complement of 200.&rdquo;  It was on the 2nd October, 1956, that that letter was sent.  It is extraordinary that a manager who had got sanction from a Minister on the 27th July, 1956, would come along in August and October and write to the Minister looking for sanction again.

It is an extraordinary thing that on the 25th November he had to sanction something that his predecossor was supposed to have sanctioned on the 27th July, 1956.

With tuberculosis on the wane they found themselves with extra accommodation, and last July they gave us a small hospital containing some 40 odd beds.  It took from July to November to get sanction from the Minister's Department for that and, in the course of their reasons for not giving sanction they had the nerve to tell us that we had room for a further complement of 20 beds in the Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher, to bring the number up to 200.  They were telling us to do something for which they had refused sanction and for which we had written, asking to be allowed to do it, on the 28th August, 1956, in October, 1956, and in December, 1956.  If that is the manner in which Departments of State are to be worked, the sooner we get something else besides what is a mockery of democratic government, the better for everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave a very full answer to-day because I wanted to give the Deputy the background of the situation as I was able to ascertain it from the correspondence in my Department.  I could have given him a different answer.  I could have answered the precise question which he asked, that was: the date of receipt in the Department of Health of a letter from the South Cork Board of Assistance requesting sanction for the increase of the bed complement in the Orthopaedic Hospital, Gurranebraher, by some 20 beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truthful and literal answer to that question would be that the first letter from the local authority, which referred to an increase of 20 beds in the <Col N="1480" /> bed accommodation in St. Mary's Hospital, was received in my Department on the 24th October, 1957.  I do not want to ascribe any blame to the Cork Board of Assistance or the officers of that board.  I shall deal with them rather more fairly than the Deputy has been prepared to deal with the officers of my Department.</P>
    <P>This whole matter arose out of a very difficult situation in Cork.  The Deputy himself knows of it; he has referred to it&mdash;the polio outbreak of last year.  It did happen that the Cork Board of Assistance, on the 27th June, 1956, wrote to the Department proposing an increase of 13 in the bed complement at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, that is, to increase the number of beds there from 137 to 146.  It happened that my predecessor was in Cork a month after that request had been received.  He visited the polio unit and he then saw the county manager and told him that he gave him authority to proceed to equip not 13 extra beds but 20 extra beds at St. Mary's.</P>
    <P>On the 28th August a letter came from the South Cork Board stating that the board had decided to increase the bed complement in St. Mary's by 67 beds, from 133 to 200.  That was the origin of the proposal to increase the number of beds.  There was no request for sanction contained in that letter.  The letter merely indicated that the board had decided to increase the number of beds and the board is perfectly entitled to do that.  It did not involve any consideration but merely involved an increase in the number of beds.  Therefore, the sanction of the Minister was not necessary unless, at the same time, a grant from the Hospitals' Trust Fund or from such funds as the Minister might have at his disposal, was requested. Such a request did not accompany the letter of the 28th August.</P>
    <P>On the 17th September, almost three weeks later, the Department agreed to a suggestion by the county manager that 20 beds at Sarsfield Court sanatorium should be used by orthopaedic patients as a temporary measure.  So then, in a couple of months, there were 40 additional beds sanctioned and authorised as against <Col N="1481" /> the 67 which the South Cork Board of Assistance had decided they would provide.</P>
    <P>It happened that on 2nd October, 1956, we received a further letter from the South Cork Board requesting formal sanction to increase the accommodation in St. Mary's Hospital by 67 beds, 47 for post-polio patients, and 20 for other orthopaedic patients, and seeking grants for equipment much of which had been ordered.  That was the first letter seeking a grant.  Unfortunately, as Deputy Corry must be aware, it reached the Department at a time when it was not possible for the Minister to give any answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a case of finding £300.  He was not in a position at that time, having regard to the general financial situation, to give an answer and, if he had been compelled to give an answer, the answer would have been a refusal.  A little later a medical inspector from the Department visited Gurranebraher and found the bed accommodation there had already been increased from 133 to 171 beds, and they were gradually increasing the number of beds to 180.</P>
      <P>The 180 beds at Gurranebraher, plus the 20 beds in Sarsfield Court which had been placed at the disposal of the South Cork Board, totalled the actual number of 200 beds which had been the first proposal emanating from the board.</P>
      <P>Again, in November, it was not possible to decide whether a grant could be given by the Minister but the fact was that the 200 beds were there, 171 if you like in November, but it was proposed to increase that by a further 9 to 180, plus the 20 beds which had been placed at the disposal of the South Cork Board in Sarsfield Court. No patient in Cork was deprived of the use of these additional 67 beds, which was the original proposal, because the Minister was not able to say at that time that money would or would not be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree there was a long delay in dealing with the letter of 2nd <Col N="1482" /> October, 1956, which was the first letter in which any request, or any indication, had been given that a grant was being sought.  The matter then hung fire because I found myself with a situation, when we took over, that we were going to be hard put to meet our existing and pressing commitments. It arose again in a letter dated 21st September and, arising out of that letter, the question of a grant was considered. As I have already indicated, on the 25th November a letter was written to the South Cork Board of Assistance approving of the increase in bed accommodation in St. Mary's Hospital to 200 beds and making a grant to the hospital from the Hospitals' Trust Fund of 50 per cent., subject to certain conditions.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I do not say the Deputy was not entitled to raise this because, without the explanation I have given, it would be very difficult to believe the Department had not been remiss in replying to the letter of 2nd October.  The fact of the matter was that, with the general tightening up and restriction on expenditure, my predecessor was not in a position to give sanction to the request, and I was not in a position to do it until last month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if Deputy Corry, as Chairman of the South Cork Board, on any occasion asked the Minister to give him the information he has now received?  Could he not have done that, through his position as chairman, without taking this course, keeping the House here in what was blatantly a stunt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is not fair.  Deputy Corry is a zealous member of the House and if he, or any Deputy, thinks that any Department for which I am responsible is remiss in dealing with the public I shall welcome their raising the matter here.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5th December, 1957.</P>

      <P>The best available indicator of the general purchasing power of money is the Consumer Price Index.  Between mid-May, 1956, and mid-August, 1957 (the latest date for which figures are available) this index (base mid-August, 1947=100) increased by 6.7 per cent. from 134 to 143, and, by reference to this rise, the minimum weekly wage rates in question would need to be increased by 6.7 per cent. <Col N="1362" /> to restore their purchasing power in mid-August, 1957, to the purchasing power in mid-May, 1956.  The amounts of money required are shown in detail (to the nearest penny) in the following table which is based on the minimum weekly wage rates for males for a &ldquo;week in which 50 hours' work is done (exclusive of work on Sunday or weekly half-holiday)&rdquo; published in the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Order, 1956:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Under sub-section (3) of Section 17 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, the Agricultural Wages Board are empowered to define the benefits or advantages which may be reckoned as payment of wages in lieu of payment in cash, and the value at which they may be reckoned.  This provision covers the value of meals supplied to farm workers by their employers.  I am informed that since the board was established about 20 years ago the value of meals has been related to the prescribed minimum rates of wages, <Col N="1366" /> the practice having been to increase such values in proportion to increases made in the minimum rates from time to time.  The retail prices of food and the service rendered by the employers in providing meals have been reflected in the values for meals fixed in the board's orders.  I am not in a position to express any opinion as to the comparison between the Army dietary scale and farm workers' diet.  The method of arriving at the value of any benefits or advantages, including meals is, as laid down in the Act, entirely a matter for the Agricultural Wages Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, the Agricultural Wages Board is empowered from time to time, as they think proper, to fix minimum rates of wages for agricultural workers.  The considerations which must influence the board in prescribing minimum rates are matters which are entirely within the board's province.  Changes in the cost of living form one of the relevant factors that enter into this question.  I am informed that another relevant factor is the capacity of agricultural employers generally to pay at least any minimum rate of wages that may be proposed having regard to the current conditions in the industry.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 17 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, empowers the Agricultural Wages Board to fix minimum rates of wages for any special class of agricultural workers. It would appear to follow that the board is empowered to determine what constitutes a special class.  The same sub-section also empowers the board to apply any prescribed minimum rate to any special part of a wages district or to any special class in a special part of such district.  Generally the wages district is the same as the administrative county.</P>
