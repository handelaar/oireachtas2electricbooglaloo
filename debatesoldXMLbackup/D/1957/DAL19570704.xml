    <Col N="683" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Taoiseach last night to hear from him some cogent statement of what the policy of his Government was.  I think everybody has approached the individual Ministers and regarded their Estimates in a spirit of reasonableness, owing to the relatively short time they have had to familiarise themselves with their Departments.  The Government has been in office now for close on four months and it is reasonable to expect that the Taoiseach should be able to tell us what the general policy is.  I find myself in this difficulty, that I open the paper on June 24th and I read there a statement by the Minister for Lands that too much money&mdash;far too much&mdash;was being spent this year on non-productive services.  Thus declared the Minister for Lands, speaking at Kilbeggan.  He said that State policy up to 1956 had not been a success.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Childers went on to say that far too many people were asking the Government to spend money on social amenities as though this would make everyone content.  Far too much money was being spent this year on non-productive services and only in order to give a little employment while waiting for productive plans to come into operation.  Millions,&rdquo; said Mr. Childers, &ldquo;had been wasted in the vain hope that building houses and hospitals would keep people at home.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Taoiseach said that one of the principal concerns on taking office was to re-stimulate the building industry.  I find it somewhat hard to reconcile these two declarations.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, introducing his Estimate, says he viewed the future with dismay because he cannot see how live-stock exports are to be maintained.  Senator Moylan, the Minister for Agriculture comes in and says he looks forward with hope and confidence to the future of the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Health tell us that every conceivable trimming and luxury must be eliminated in order to make ends meet.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs delivers <Col N="684" /> himself of an oration somewhere down the country and says he regards television as a &ldquo;must&rdquo; for the Irish people.  Who is right?  Are we going in for television, the import of motorcars, the import of television sets, the import of radio sets and the erection of a television station in this country? Are we going to continue a building programme on the lines outlined by the Taoiseach or are we going to stop building, as suggested by the Minister for Lands, and reduce expenditure on non-essentials, as advocated by the Minister for Health?  Or are we going to continue to spend on these commodities off which the Government recently took the levies?</P>
    <P>I take the view&mdash;but I would like to hear what the Government's view is&mdash; that we have reason in this country, if sane policies are pursued, for reasonable optimism; but those sane policies boil down to this: a realisation on the part of all that the natural resources of this country consist of 12,000,000 acres of arable land and that if out of that arable land we get the full production which it is capable of yielding, we can secure for all our people in this country a decent standard of living. That will never make us rich in the sense that the people in the great industrial countries, such as America and even Great Britain, are rich, but it will provide security, a decent standard of living and, I think, a better way of life in their own country for our own people.  But if we do not concentrate on that fundamental fact and if we continue to chase irrelevancies while neglecting the main sources of this nation's wealth, then, as I said on a previous occasion, this country could easily go bust.</P>
    <P>Where does the Minister for Industry and Commerce get warrant for his declaration that the trade figures for the first four months of this year are not such as to give us any cause for satisfaction because it is impossible to contemplate that we shall be able to maintain the rate of live-stock exports that obtained in the first four months of this year?</P>
    <P>I see no diminution in the statistical returns of the cattle population, but what appals me is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes in here <Col N="685" /> to give us his views about the prospects of live-stock exports for the remainder of the year.  His view is that they cannot be maintaned at the same rate as that which obtained for the first four months.  Whoever thought they could?  Does the Minister for Industry and Commerce not realise that live-stock exports are subject to a normal seasonal rise and fall which everybody understands?  Does he not realise that it is a matter on which we have every reason to congratulate ourselves, that, instead of shipping all our cattle in the autumn, when prices are at their lowest, we have gradually, and I hope permanently, worked out a pattern in which a very high volume of cattle are going out in the early months when prices are at their highest?  I rejoice that we have succeeded in bringing the adverse balance of payments situation under control.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary in regard to all these matters to be prudent, but I think it is catastrophic for the spokesmen of the Government to go on wailing and weeping and groaning all over the country and endeavouring to encourage the people into the belief that immense disaster awaits around the corner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Gloom, gloom!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the facts?  In January of this year, the adverse balance of trade was £4.86 million, compared with £11,000,000 in January, 1956.  I think it is a fair calculation to say that our average invisible exports amount to about £60,000,000 a year. They do not, of course, accrue to us in even quantities each month, but for the purpose of balance of trade calculations, it is a useful idea simply to estimate these invisible exports at £5,000,000 per month.  If we do that, we are entitled to say that in the month of January, apparently, the balance of payments would be favourable. When we come to the month of February, we find that the adverse trade balance has declined from £10,000,000 last year to £5.18 million this year, giving us again, probably, an even balance for the month.  When we come to March, we find it has declined from £7.47 million to <Col N="686" /> £4.48 million this year, giving us probably a credit balance in that month.  Again, when you come to April, you find that the adverse trade balance declined from £6.78 million to £2.3 million this year.</P>
      <P>All that would be materially mitigated in its value if it were related exclusively to a reduction in imports, but if you look at the export figures you find that in these four months to which I have referred, in January, the exports rose from £6.8 million to £10.7 million; in February, from £7.6 million to £10,000,000; in March, from £8,000,000 to £11,000,000; and in April, from £7.5 million to £10.9 million. Those figures are encouraging, but I do not think they are sufficiently encouraging to justify the line of country which the Government is at present pursuing, that is, removing all restrictions on imports of a luxury character, because at the end of this year, if these imports are allowed to grow indefinitely we might find ourselves in difficulty again.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies seem to imagine that this procedure of limiting unnecessary imports is evidence of exceptional difficulty.  As far as I know, there are very few countries in Europe, or outside it, who are not doing exactly the same thing.  What is the alternative? The whole object of having foreign assets available is to preserve for ourselves the right to determine what categories of goods are to be restricted in imports, if our exports are not sufficient to finance the purchase of whatever our own people chose to want or buy.  If we do not take steps to place all the restrictions we think appropriate and where our external balance declines to the point that we can import only that which we can pay for, we may find ourselves in the position that we are not exercising the choice at all, but that somebody else is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach again does he think it sane to stimulate imports of motor cars, radio sets and television sets in a year in which he considers it right to recommend to this House that we should increase the price of butter to our own people by 7d. a lb. and increase the price of the 2-lb. loaf by 4d.?  It does not seem to <Col N="687" /> me that he can possibly reconcile these two procedures.  That is my principal difficulty on this Estimate on which general Government policy is discussed. I detect a dichotomy of mind in the Government which so far the Taoiseach seems to be unable to pull together, but the people are entitled to know which side of the dichotomy is to prevail.</P>
    <P>I want to turn again to the statement made by the Minister for Lands in regard to housing.  I think he is entirely wrong in his belief that the house building programme was embarked on primarily to give employment. The house building programme was embarked upon because those of us responsible for Government determined that it was a right and proper charge to put on the resources of the nation to take the people out of slums, urban and rural.  If we had to do it again, then I think we should do it.</P>
    <P>I remember a debate in this House 15 years ago when it was argued that you could not afford to do it.  I remember the late Deputy Alderman Tom Kelly speaking from somewhere on that side of the House and describing how in tenement houses bugs were falling from the ceilings into the babies' cradles and how muslin had to be stretched across the cradles to prevent the bugs falling onto the babies' faces.  I remember saying that whatever the cost and whatever the subsequent difficulties that would confront us we should remedy that situation in town and country.</P>
    <P>We did it, not for the purpose primarily of creating employment but for the purpose of securing for our people a minimum standard of comfort without which we thought our people should not be expected to do; but what we have got to face is that, so far as rural Ireland is concerned, the job is nearly done.  There are many towns in rural Ireland now in which we have all the houses we want.  The progress in our cities has been very substantial.  I remember when I was a child in this city the area down around Marlboro' Street and the area up in Meath Street and the area around the Coombe and <Col N="688" /> realise what is there now as compared with what was there 40 years ago. Deputies who did not know the position and who were not familiar with it do not realise the distance we have travelled in resolving the housing problem.</P>
    <P>I freely concede that in the City of Dublin, the City of Cork, the City of Limerick and other cities, work still remains to be done.  But here is a danger Deputies will overlook: you must have some regard (1) to the resources available to you and (2) to planning your programme so that you do not go forward at full speed, finish the job and then have to inform a vast army of working men that there is nothing more for them to do.  We have got to plan our programme therefore with both those issues in mind.</P>
    <P>Mark you, we had to take exactly the same decision in regard to rural electrification.  We could have finished rural electrification.  We could have completed and finished the job by the end of 1959, but we deliberately elected not to do that because if we had gone on blazing away straight ahead and finished the job by 1959, on 31st December, 1959, we would have had to tell the entire staff: &ldquo;You are out of a job. There is nothing more for you to do. The job is finished.&rdquo;  When one proceeds, therefore, towards the end of a capital undertaking of that kind, unless one is mad, one proceeds to taper off and plan and know where one is going.</P>
    <P>I cannot make out what scheme, or what plan, or what programme the present Government has in mind. Perhaps the Taoiseach will say he has not had time to formulate one so far, but, if he has not, I think in the interests of the country he would be well advised to tell his Ministers to keep quiet until they have arrived at some agreement, and not be racing around the country, one of them preaching woe, desolation and restriction, other charging around and announcing that we cannot live another hour without the installation of a television station, and yet another removing levies from motor cars, television and radio sets and urging everyone to resume, on an unrestricted scale, instalment <Col N="689" /> purchasing.  If we are to have unrestricted instalment purchasing, then everybody can buy anything he or she wants.  Anything on which they can put down a deposit, let them go out and get it.  But that means imports, and that implies unrestricted imports.  At the present time, that course is not prudent and what I am afraid of is that, if it is pursued, it will create an entirely false mentality in the country.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that if we proceed intensively to develop the agricultural industry on the lines on which we have been going, we can build up an export volume which will permit, in due course, any imports our people require and, in the interim, all the essential imports that our people can reasonably require in existing circumstances.  Now one of the remarkable new catchcries of Fianna Fáil is that they are going to develop markets.  I should like to know what do they mean by that?  It is a dangerous kind of talk for the reason that it creates in the minds of a lot of farmers a strong impression that, if they produce more, there is no market in which to dispose of it.  That is all cod.  We can double the output of cattle, sheep, pigs and butter and dispose of it all without the slightest difficulty, at a price.  But now we have got to make up our minds one way or the other.  Do we want increased production or do we not?  I have no doubt at all that the survival of this country depends on increased production and I have no doubt at all of our ability to market it all.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputies, however, of this fundamental economic fact because it is the key to what must seem my excessive optimism.  Agricultural production here is at present consumed roughly as to one-third on the farm, one-third in the country by people who do not live on farms and one-third by exports.  Now the truth is that up to the time the Government took the subsidy off butter and bread, our people were consuming about as much agricultural produce as they wanted to consume.  Therefore, if you could increase output practically the entire volume of that increase would <Col N="690" /> pour into our export market.  If you could increase output by 50 per cent. you would increase exports by nearly 150 per cent. because your increased production would go into the export market.  That is something a lot of people forget.  If only people would realise that in our economic circumstances our people are to-day the best fed people in the world, or certainly were, up to the removal of the subsidies. We had the distinction of appearing in international records as providing for our people a higher level of nutrition than even the United States of America, evaluated in terms of calories, which is the international standard.  In our circumstances then, increased output goes on to the export market.</P>
    <P>The question of getting markets abroad is a national question.  If we want to increase output, and I have long experience of this here and abroad, let us face this fact: you can talk till the cows come home, you can propagand till the cows come home, you can organise, you can exhort, you can persuade, you can even try to compel, but there is only one way effectively to get increased output from the land and that is to say to the farmer, who knows and works the land: &ldquo;If you produce the stuff, that is the price you will get for it,&rdquo; and there is not any other way to get increased output. Some people will say that that is all very well but what are we to do if the price the farmer demands is such that we cannot get it in any foreign market where we have to dispose of the surplus?</P>
    <P>I remember once asking a very prudent economist this question: Of what value to the national economy is a subsidised export?  He looked at me for a moment and said: &ldquo;Just about the same value as a protected industry.&rdquo;  Of course, the more you think of that aphorism the more profoundly true it is.  But there is a difference, and here is where it is difficult to make the farmer's case.  You give an industry a tariff.  Incidentally, I notice that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been distributing tariffs very liberally in the recent past. I see a tariff clapped on galvanised <Col N="691" /> iron that every farmer has to use to roof a shed or farm building.  I see another tariff clapped on forks that every farmer has to use in digging beet or anything else.  I see another tariff clapped on farm machinery.  All these tariffs do not appear in the Exchequer returns.  All these tariffs do not show any money coming in and money going out.  They short-circuit the normal procedure of taxation.  All these protected industries collect their subsidy without any reference to the Exchequer at all; they take it from the consumer by putting it on the price of the finished article.</P>
    <P>The farmer, if he produces butter and is paid at the rate of 1/7 a gallon for milk has to face and defend the appearance in the Book of Estimates of £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 export subsidy, so that he is confronted with the situation that the better he does, and the more he produces, the louder the row in the Dáil will be about the subsidy required to sell his product on the foreign market while at the same time he is paying a tariff on cans, on farm machinery, on galvanised iron, on his bucket, on his boots, on his clothes, on everything he uses, everything he buys, about which there is no talk at all because it is not measured; it is incorporated in the price of the product that the farmer has to buy.</P>
    <P>All the tariffs do relatively little to help the balance of trade.  Why?  Because 90 per cent. of the industries established by tariffs in this country are secondary industries, all the raw materials of which must be imported. In so far as the balance of trade is concerned, these secondary industries established here under tariff protection do nothing.  All the raw materials they use are brought in.  But, every cwt. of butter that is sent out helps the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>What I want to warn the Government of is this: There is only one way in which you can get the extra production without which this country goes bust, because the extra production we want is extra production that will operate on the balance of trade and provide us with the wherewithal to <Col N="692" /> pay for imports that we require, and that is to give the farmer a remunerative price for his output with primary emphasis on that part of his output which can be exported and for which there is a market and which is preeminently suited for production in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>What are our circumstances?  Our circumstances are these.  We have an equable climate with a variation of not 20 degrees Fahrenheit from one year's end to the other.  We have 42 inches of annual rainfall equally distributed over the 12 months of the year.  Do Deputies realise that there are only two other places in the world that have what we have here, a relatively small area in the centre of England and a small area in the State of Oregon in the United States of America?  They are the only two other areas in the whole world that have that temperature and that even distribution of 42 inches of rainfall spread over the whole year.  Instead of bucking the fact that we have that infinite benefit at our disposal, we should capitalise it and, if it indicates anything, it indicates live stock and live-stock products.</P>
    <P>Whether we all agreed with it or not, I do not think it will be denied that for the last nine years the agricultural policy of this country has been heavily orientated in the direction of increased live-stock production.  Is not that true?  What I am terrified of is that there will be some departure from that and it is for that reason that I want to direct the attention of Deputies to the results of it.</P>
    <P>In the first three months of this year we exported 285,162 cattle from this country, for which we received £15.164 million&mdash;in three months.  In the following month of April we exported well over 50,000 cattle and in the first fortnight of May we exported nearly 20,000.  The last date on which the census was taken was in June, 1956.  That is the last date of which we have information and on that date we had more cattle on the land of Ireland than we ever had in our history before.</P>
    <P>We had increased the sheep population from 2,000,000 to 3,500,000, and I expected that we would have a kind of catastrophic slump in the market for <Col N="693" /> lamb consequent upon the unilateral action of the French Government recently in stopping our exports of lamb, but I am happy to see that the British market seems to be taking up what we have to sell, which is a great blessing, and which is a very valuable indication of what that market means to us in comparison with the market in France which is liable to close at 24 hours.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, our efforts to expand the pig industry have received a check. It is a check which we will surmount and it is a problem which has confronted other countries.</P>
    <P>The heart of this matter probably is the butter industry.  I am not going to argue any more about the removal of the subsidy.  I think it is wrong but we have had that out before and there is no use arguing any more about it.  It is done and we cannot undo it, but you are going to face, I hope, and I should like the Taoiseach to say that he hopes, larger and larger exports of butter in future.  I should like to communicate to the farmers of this country &mdash;and here is one of the most precious keys to increased output from the land &mdash;the assurance that we regard exports of butter and all that they bring with them as something well worth maintaining and that we will see that the fluctuations of the foreign market are not allowed unrestrictedly to bear on them and that if the farmer continues to produce milk and improve his methods of production he is guaranteed against any slump in the price of the commodity he is producing.</P>
    <P>If we can do that I can see coming out of it an increasing number of live stock, an increasing number of pigs and increasing exports in both these cases.  On that I would hope to see, and I am perfectly convinced I will see, improvement steadily maintained in grass land.  On that improved grass land I would expect to see an increase in the number of cattle, cows and sheep with the consequential exports that would flow therefrom.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we have got to face the fact that the Government ought to make up its mind that there should be an end to the practice of raising the costs of the raw materials <Col N="694" /> of the agricultural industry.  I succeeded after great difficulty in having the tariff removed from superphosphates. I hope and pray it will never be put back again.  The Government ought to announce now, and I believe it is the only means by which we can hope to develop the economic life of this country, that it recognises agriculture as the main hope of expansion in the future; that it guarantees to the industry a remunerative price for agricultural produce, well and economically produced, and that as its contribution to the remunerative character of the price, it undertakes that there will be no further imposition on the raw materials of the industry.</P>
    <P>Let us remember this.  What the farmer is concerned with is not primarily the price; it is the profit, and the profit is the difference between what he gets for his product and what it costs him to produce.  We can contribute to his profit in two ways, by assuring him of a reasonable level of price and at the same time taking every precaution we can to reduce the cost of his raw material to the lowest possible figure.  If there is any departure or exception from that fundamental principle, that we charge ourselves to get for him his raw materials at the lowest possible figure, as certain as we are standing in this House that exception will be continually expanded in order to give to others the advantages which the farmer ought to enjoy.  Any time the farmer enjoys a passing phase of relative prosperity it will be said that he can afford to pay more so that others will have the benefits he ought to have and without which we will not get the extra production.</P>
    <P>I want to present this, not on the basis of a plea for the agricultural community, but on a cold, matter-of-fact basis&mdash;that we cannot survive if we do not get the extra production which providentially we know would go into exports and that there is no means available to us to get that increased production except by reassuring the agricultural community that it will be remunerative to them.  Unless we face that, accept it, and act upon it, I want to warn the Taoiseach that whatever <Col N="695" /> his Ministers are saying, and God knows they are saying enough, this country will go bust.</P>
    <P>I hope to make it clear that a great deal of the talk about marketing is illusory.  It is perfectly easy to market all the cattle, sheep, and pigs that we are capable of producing but it is true that is subject to the limitation of marketing them at a price.  Possibly marketing research methods might result in our realising in external markets a better price for those exports than we would otherwise get but, if we do, I think that must be in relief of whatever burden the community may otherwise be called upon to bear, in meeting the costs it has to bear in getting the external markets.  There is no use in telling farmers that £250,000 is being spent on getting new markets. They will not believe you.  They will not produce for that kind of amorphous, ruinous hope.  They will produce more if they know they will get paid for what they produce and nothing else will make them produce more.  We ought to realise that a subsidised export is just as good as a protected industry.</P>
    <P>We have more cattle on the land than we ever had.  We have as many, or more, sheep than we ever had.  I do not think anyone will deny that the quality of our grass land is steadily improving though there is still room for vast improvement.  I have every hope that if we can pursue consistently a sane policy the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be proved to be quite wrong.  In June, 1956, we had 4,534,000 cattle on the land of Ireland.  That is the greatest number of cattle we have had in our recorded history.  We had 1,187,000 cows and 107,800 heifers.  We had over 1,000,000 cattle of one year of age and under and we had 1,000,000 cattle over one year of age and under two years of age.</P>

      <P>So long as it is flouted at the cross-roads the Deputy is delighted, but that is the kind of Fianna Fáil codology that I am sick listening to.  I remember the time when it was Fianna Fáil patriotism to cut a calf's throat and throw it across a hedge. Every time it was done there was a demonstration that another blow had been struck to render us independent of the British market.  They cut the pigs' throats down at the North Wall. They fed the greyhounds with beef in <Col N="697" /> order to suggest that we were independent of the British market, and here is this pillar of the Fianna Fáil Party and he is scandalised because he knows the live-stock population is increasing, that every farmer has more live stock than he had a year ago.  Let us join issue on this.  I want to see every farmer able to carry more live stock than he ever carried before.</P>

      <P>I am trying to persuade this Government to realise the means requisite to preserve this nation and to provide for our people who want to stay here a decent standard of living. There is no other way of doing it than by getting from the land more than the land is at present producing.  I am not going to spell that out, a, b, c, d, e, f, g for the benefit of the Deputy. If he cannot see that himself he will have to get some of his colleagues to explain it to him, but most rational members of the Fianna Fáil Party understand it.</P>
      <P>We are increasing the numbers of our live stock.  What we want is an intensification of the policies which I think have been followed for the last nine years.  I am always afraid when I hear the Tánaiste speaking as I have heard him speak before on this question. In 1947, when the White Paper was introduced which led to most of our troubles, the then Government saw no prospect of any expansion in agricultural exports, and again in 1951 they returned to that theme.  We increased exports from about £30,000,000 to £100,000,000 in a period when the Fianna Fáil Government saw no hope of an increase in agricultural exports. I am terrified that exactly the same mentality is beginning to manifest itself to-day and that we are going to be told: &ldquo;The lines we have been following have produced no results. Let us drop them and go chasing something else.&rdquo;  The lines we have followed have produced this result, that we have more live stock in the land of Ireland than we ever had before, that in the first quarter of this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we sent out more live stock and got a higher price than we ever got before.  There is available a market which will absorb all and twice as much as we are at present producing and what we must say to the farmers is: &ldquo;You are guaranteed stability of price for your produce and we will accept responsibility for marketing it thereafter.&rdquo;  We must tell them that the level of price will be such as is certain to yield a reasonable profit to the farmer who produces efficiently.  Somebody will ask me, reasonably enough: &ldquo;What do you mean by putting in that caveat about efficiency?&rdquo;  We are entitled to say to the farmers that if we guarantee a price for pigs, having regard to the price of bacon, it is legitimate to estimate that price on the assumption that the farmer will grow on his own holding as much as he prudently should for the feeding of his own pigs.</P>
      <P>There is a practice growing up that barely should be grown in one corner of the country and consumed at the other end of the country.  That will not work.  All the pig feeding in this country ought to be grown in this country. With the exception of the man who goes in for pigs in a big way, pig keepers ought to grow their own pig feed on their own land.  If a farmer is growing pig feed on his own land in the shape of barely and skim milk and feeding his own pigs&mdash;though that may not be universally practicable it ought to be pretty nearly universally practicable&mdash;there ought to be a price which will ensure him a reasonable profit. The farmer cannot be assured of a reasonable profit if he goes out and pays too much for his bonhams, pays too much for the pig feed and then feeds the pigs on the wrong ration. There is no use trying to provide a guaranteed price if that is done.  However, we achieved something when we fixed the minimum price for Grade A pigs at 235/-.  We gave the farmer a price which guaranteed him a profit, with the additional guarantee that it did not matter what quantity of pigs he produced, that we would see they were sold and that his price never fell below a minimum figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we follow that line we have no reason for undue pessimism, but we <Col N="699" /> must face the fact that we will never be rich in the sense the Americans or the English are rich.  If some of our children say to us: &ldquo;If we have not that prospect here we will go to seek it elsewhere,&rdquo; I hope a day will never dawn when we will say to our children: &ldquo;You will not be let.&rdquo;  The most precious liberty our people have is, first of all, that they are free to go.  Another liberty they enjoy&mdash;and in this they are almost unique&mdash;is that wherever they want to go they are welcome. Sometimes perhaps we deplore that because it constitutes too great a draw upon our people.</P>
    <P>However, we can be proud of the fact that wherever our people have gone they have been made welcome thereafter.  It may be an embarrassing asset but it is something which every nation in Europe would give a great deal to have, the right to go to any part of the world with the certainty that they will be welcome when they get there.  We must face the fact that that does constitute a very powerful draw on our people and that no matter what we do, our resources being what they are, some of our people will tend always to go in search of that.  Nevertheless I am convinced there will always be a great number of our people who prefer the kind of life we have in Ireland, to maintain this country as she ought to be, a great mother country, a country with its own mode of life.</P>
    <P>I am often exasperated by some of the quasi-experts who are floating around here and who spend their lives comparing us with Denmark.  I wonder have they looked at Denmark's economic circumstances in the recent past?  I wonder would they consult some of their Danish friends as to how they are getting on in the egg market and the butter market?  I wonder would they consult some of their Danish friends and ask them if they had 250,000 cattle to export in the first three months of this year worth £15,000,000 would they have been glad to have them?</P>
    <P>I wonder would some of the boys who thought we should change over to Friesians and Jerseys ten or 15 years <Col N="700" /> ago ask themselves where would we be to-day if we had Friesians and Jerseys now and nothing else?  We would have about 1,000,000 cwt. of butter to export which would cost up to £8 per cwt. to send abroad, and we would have a number of cloven-hoofed horses of cattle, in respect of which we would have a real marketing problem. We would be entering them for greyhound derbys all over the world.</P>
    <P>It is because I am afraid that the &ldquo;dafties&rdquo; in this country who think it is wrong to have more cattle than people, the &ldquo;dafties&rdquo; who think we ought to have Jerseys instead of Shorthorns, Aberdeen Anguses and Herefords, the &ldquo;dafties&rdquo; who believe the farmers of Ireland are no good and that we should bring in the Dutch and the Danes to work on the land of Ireland, the &ldquo;dafties&rdquo; who believe that secondary industries in our cities are more important than the land on which the nation really depends, will get control and that, instead of confronting our difficulties steadily and overcoming them calmly and deliberately, they will go &ldquo;fluting off&rdquo; after some of the economic advisers who are knocking around this country, and that some lunatic like the Minister for Lands will have brought the country to a catastrophic state before we can bring him to a realisation of fundamental things, that I listen with consternation to the Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Government talking.  It causes me to wonder how strong the &ldquo;dafties&rdquo; will prove to be.  When I hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce prognosticating the future of agriculture, I want to put up the red flag and say to the Fianna Fáil Party: &ldquo;Mind your step.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Let the Minister for Industry and Commerce look after the secondary industries for which he is responsible.  Bear in mind, that in so far as they survive, they are a charge on agriculture which agriculture is prepared to carry, provided agriculture is given a fair deal.  But remember also that, if agriculture does not prosper, <Col N="701" /> none of the secondary industries which the Minister for Industry and Commerce desires to create will survive for six months.  In the last analysis, it all comes out of 12,000,000 acres of arable land.</P>
      <P>I hope the present Minister for Agriculture is, as I think he is, a man who will keep the &ldquo;dafties&rdquo; at bay and under control and who will have the courage and resolution to push forward vigorously with the policy which he has announced so far on behalf of his Department.  If that comes to pass, all may yet be well; but if the discordance to which I referred in my opening observations continues, God knows what will happen to this country. I have always regarded the Taoiseach as a pretty effective task master to his followers.  It is quite true that he holds 95 per cent. of them in the hollow of his hand or the tail of his coat, because 95 per cent. of them would not survive an hour if they were not sailing on the tail of his coat.  I would suggest to him that, if and when the discordance begins, he should give a twitch to the tail of his coat to remind some of the more extremely absurd followers he has gathered into his camp that he might twitch the tail of his coat away from under them if they went on talking out of turn.</P>

It goes like this: &ldquo;When the devil was sick, the devil a saint would be, but when the devil got well, the devil a saint was he.&rdquo;  If ever that applied to anybody in this House it applies to Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon devoted most of his speech on this Estimate to agriculture.  I wonder how many of the milch cows he spoke about we would have to-day if the policy propounded by him as Minister for Agriculture five or six years ago were adopted by the farmers.  He suggested that the farmers would enter into a contract to produce milk for five years at 1/- a gallon.  He now sees that the farmers are getting 1/7 a gallon for milk.  Last year, under the very good care of the Minister for Agriculture, the flight from the land was at its greatest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you continually increase a man's cost of production, it can have only <Col N="702" /> one result.  The first man to suffer will be either the farm labourer or the farmer's son.  Some one of the two must go.  When he came into office in 1954, Deputy Dillon put a tax of £4 a ton, 8/- a barrel, on feeding barely.  During the period in which the late Deputy Tom Walsh, God rest his soul, was in office, the minimum price of malting barely was 48/- per barrel.  It dropped by £4 a ton in 1954.  Accordingly, a farmer who grew ten acres of feeding barley dropped £80 at a time when the cost of production on the land had gone up by some 10/- an acre as proved in the case of beet which is costed and which is the only method we had of measuring production costs on the land.</P>
    <P>The cost of production went up at a time when prices down for the man who dared to employ labour.  A farmer who grew wheat had imposed on him by Deputy Dillon a penal tax of £5 a ton.  I am talking now of the worst paid section of the community. He said: &ldquo;Look, my income has gone down by £230.  Therefore you must go.&rdquo; The unfortunate worker is the first man to go in this country.  He gets the first knock.  Whenever costs are reduced or prices fall, he gets it.  That policy was continued during the whole period Deputy James Dillon was Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>You went abroad and you paid the foreigner for what the farmer here refused to produce at an uneconomic price.  You went abroad and you bought it and, as the Minister for Finance assured me here within the past fortnight when I asked him if it was paid for yet, we are not yet sure whether it is paid for or not.  That hundred-odd thousand tons of Canadian wheat was brought in here on three months' tick.  That is the policy. Deputy Dillon got up here to-day and told us about the new policy and advised the new Minister for Agriculture on the policy he was to carry on.  If he carried out the policy Deputy Dillon carried out let us see where we would find ourselves.  That was the policy that threw 9,000 workers off the land in 12 months.  That was the policy that sent us abroad to beg from the foreigner on tick for the wheat from which to produce the bread we eat. <Col N="703" /> Let us see where we were getting on that policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has the impertinence to attack the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in some remarks he made here on agriculture yesterday.  Deputy Dillon sat there as mute as a mouse whilst Deputy Norton, while he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, was putting a penal tariff on the pig producers of £6 10s. a ton on wheat offals.  The price of wheat offals during the full period that Deputy Thomas Walsh was Minister for Agriculture never went higher than £20 a ton.  Therefore, according to Deputy Norton, he deliberately increased them to £24 10s. in October, 1954, and to £26 10s. in January, 1955.</P>
    <P>In reply to questions in this House I was assured by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce that in 28 months a sum of £1,091,000 penal tariff was collected from the pig feeders on the raw material for the production of pigs.  That penal tariff went to relieve the flour subsidy.  Let us follow these things along.  That penal tariff, in turn, was responsible for a 20 per cent. reduction of the pig population in 12 months.  That penal tariff was responsible for a further reduction of 58,000 pigs last year&mdash;I am talking of a time before we had the misfortune of swine fever or anything like that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon says there should not be any tariff on the raw materials of the farmers' industry.  When I hear him talking with his tongue in his cheek and saying that there should not be any tariff or restriction or further burden on the raw material of the farmers' industry I think of the Minister for Agriculture who allowed Deputy Norton as Minister for Industry and Commerce to collect £1,091,000 from the pig feeders for his flour subsidy. I got a reply from Deputy Norton that he collected £617,000 in the first 12 months from the pig feeder.</P>
    <P>On one occasion the members of the Beet Growers' Association went on a deputation to Deputy Dillon, when he was Minister for Agriculture, to get him not to put a tariff of £4 a ton on our feeding barley.  Deputy Dillon told <Col N="704" /> us on that occasion that the small farmer in the West of Ireland with a wife and six children feeds pigs, that that is his industry.  He said: &ldquo;Am I going to increase the price of that small farmer's raw materials for the big farmer down in the Midlands with 100 acres and his two motor cars?  I am not.&rdquo;  That is the very self-same Minister who sat as mute as a mouse while Deputy Norton was extracting £1,000,000 from the unfortunate small farmer in the West with a wife and six children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said something here about Friesians.  About two years ago I took a ramble out to Clonakilty one day to see the agricultural station there.  At the time, Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture.  I saw two sets of store cattle there at 12 months old.  According as a Shorthorn bull calf was born at that agricultural station they went out to Mitchelstown and bought a Friesian bull calf.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon said here that the Friesian bullock could be used for racing.  I am giving him proof now&mdash;though I admit that the unfortunate man in charge of that station and carrying out that experiment was afraid of his life that Deputy Dillon would come down and that, on seeing the Friesians and the Shorthorn bullocks side by side, he would sack him for daring to carry out the experiment. But the experiment was carried out, at a cost to the State, and it showed that the Friesian bull, after 12 months, was one and a half cwt. heavier than the Shorthorn.  The proof is on the register in Clonakilty.  If you have a <Col N="705" /> cow that gives you one and a half times the quantity of milk as the mongrel known as the dairy Shorthorn will give you and whose stores, when reared, will give you a heavier bullock over a shorter period, what is the use in Deputy Dillon getting up and talking about the people who agitate for keeping Friesian cattle?</P>
      <P>It is time we had common sense in this country.  I am anxious about the future of our agriculture.  Nobody realises its difficulties more than I do. Here is a market we need not worry about.  When Deputy Dillon says that farmers should feed their animals with feed grown on their own land, I wonder why he is anxious about that particular point?  The farmer will know the cost of his feed if he has to buy it, but if he has to grow it himself on his own farm he does not know the exact cost of it.  You have grain belts in this country.  You also have a section of small farmers, industrious, hard-working men, who buy the produce of those grain belts and use it for their cattle.</P>
      <P>I am objecting to any artificial increase in the raw materials used by the small farmer.  There is no justification for it.  If we had a Minister for Agriculture here who was able to hold the price of wheaten offals at £20 per ton while wheat was 82/6, where is the justification to-day, when wheat is at 70/-, for a price for wheaten offals of from £25 10s. to £27 10s.?  The flour subsidy is gone now and we are entitled to know what is becoming of the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I heard Deputy Dillon speak about the price of cattle I had to smile to myself.  Exactly this month 12 months ago the bottom had fallen out of cattle prices here.  There was only one market for our cattle and that was behind the Iron Curtain, in Russia.  I wonder how many palms were greased from the hour the cattle left the unfortunate old farmer at the fair to the hour they arrived in Russia?  An amazing thing occurred which never occurred before here.  They were shipped to France, processed there and sold to Russia.  That is where your heavy beef cattle went this time 12 months ago.  Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture and he saw all <Col N="706" /> that.  Because of the peculiar tactics in regard to shipping in this country, you cannot ship them.  The ring will not give you a boat.</P>
    <P>I had to smile again when Deputy Dillon spoke about the large number of cattle we export.  I would like if somebody here, with a little more time than I have, would spend a few days at the Dublin cattle market.  They go from the Dublin cattle market up to Belfast, come down again and are sold again on the Dublin market.  So that every bullock becomes two bullocks, if not three bullocks.  That is doubling your exports without any trouble at all.  The joker above puts out his hand and draws a subsidy from John Bull.</P>

      <P>We have a problem here more grave than our agricultural problem.  We have the problem of finding employment in this country for our own people.  I would suggest to the Taoiseach that, if our present industries were expanded, we could provide greatly increased employment.  Some time ago I raised a question about the supply of raw materials to Irish Steel at Haulbowline.  I was assured by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the least number possible would be dismissed from this industry because of the shortage of raw materials.</P>
      <P>I have seen this industry from the day it was started.  I have seen it go bust twice.  On one occasion it was due to a crook; I do not know who was the crook the second time.  I have seen it built up into an industry where over 600 men are employed.  There is a picture in to-day's <i>Irish Press</i> of a 110-ton cannon being taken from within three miles of that industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about unemployment and I am suggesting to the <Col N="707" /> Taoiseach where employment can be given.  Probably I will receive a letter to-morrow, or the next day, like the one I received a fortnight ago, about the 250 tons of rails that were shipped out.  There is no justification for these things being shipped out of the country.  They are raw materials that are required for an essential industry here.  Neither is there any justification for the purchase of those raw materials within three miles of the job, having them shipped to Dublin and then shipped back again.  We are importing over £2,000,000 worth of tin plate each year.  There is a sheet metal works at Haulbowline and we have the ridiculous position that blank sheets are imported and corrugated at Haulbowline.  There is no reason why tin plate could not be manufactured here.  Here is an existing industry in which an extra couple of hundred men could find constant employment.  Those are things I want to see done in my constituency and which I know can be done in my constituency.</P>
      <P>In three or four months' time, when the oil refinery gets going, there will be plenty of employment in my constituency. I can see no justification for eight or nine men who were constantly employed at Haulbowline and Spike Island, under the Department of Defence, being sacked and being forced to take a ship to Britain next week. These are men who gave decent, honourable service to this nation and there is no justification for their dismissal.  A considerable sum of money has been passed here for the relief of unemployment and some of that money should go to filling that gap and keeping those men in employment for a few months, until we can put them in permanent employment in the oil refinery when it starts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are cutting down on defence and might I suggest that the barracks that should be vacated first are those that are owned by Her Majesty's Secretary of State for War who at present is the registered owner of Kildare Barracks, according to Folio 646 in the Land Registry Department.  It is 34 years now since we got rid of John Bull and a number of years since the Republic <Col N="708" /> was established, but still, to my amazement, in the short time I had at my disposal, I found three areas of land in County Kildare, the registered owner of which is Her Majesty's Secretary of State for War.</P>

I have not had time to go into the present ownership of Haulbowline. I would like to have those things fully investigated.  Now that the Dáil is going into Recess, there will be time for that and I hope that when I am asking questions in October in regard to these matters, I will be told that all those lands are now the property of the Irish Republican Government.</P>

      <P>I always knew Deputy Corry was interested, and I give him full credit for it, in the division of land. I realise now that he is also interested in the division of barracks and he will probably spend his summer working on that.</P>
      <P>Deputies of the Labour Party did not concentrate in very large degree on the discussion on the other Estimates because we realised that in every instance the Minister was in office only a short time but, on the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department, it is essential that we should consider the actual position.  Through his position as Taoiseach and Head of the Government, his Estimate has a direct relationship to the over-all policy of the Government.  That is why we believe it is essential for us now to be critical, if necessary, and at least to express our views on the departmental policy of the Taoiseach and on Government policy as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the last three months we have been hearing a great deal about &ldquo;Beat the Crisis&rdquo;.  In the daily papers and in the Sunday papers article after article has appeared bearing the caption: &ldquo;Beat the Crisis&rdquo;.  Even in one of this morning's papers there is a somewhat similar caption: &ldquo;Battle with the Economic Crisis.&rdquo;  The Taioseach should tell us whether he and his Government are sincere when they talk about this crisis.  Does a crisis exist?  According to the Taoiseach's statement yesterday, conditions have apparently changed in the last three months.  The Taoiseach is quite satisfied now that with a spirit of greater confidence abroad there is a good deal to be said in favour of present conditions. He finished with a plea that <Col N="710" /> if the people bent their will and threw their weight, as it were, into the battle the country would be all right.</P>
    <P>For the last 12 months we have been hearing a great deal about economic conditions and about the battle of the crisis.  I believe that some of the economic difficulties that confronted the Government over the last two years, and particularly during 1956, could have been avoided.  Whether or not some of the criticism levelled during 1956, criticism of Government policy, was meant to help or to hinder remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, speaking last night, referred to the problem of unemployment. I will give him and every member of the Government credit, just as I give credit to every member of the Opposition, for their efforts to try to achieve conditions here which would tend to solve, or at least help to solve, the problem of unemployment.  But we are legitimately entitled to make comparisons. In relation to all the promises made by the Fianna Fáil Party prior to the election we are still &ldquo;in the red&rdquo; so far as unemployment is concerned.  Far be it from me to say that unemployment should cease the moment a new Government takes office.  In spite of all the wishful thinking of the Taoiseach, I do not believe the policy of the present Government will help to solve unemployment.  Wishful thinking it would be were we merely to compare the figures in relation to unemployment in the month of June, 1957, with the figures for the month of June, 1956, quite calmly and quite coolly.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made reference to emigration in 1956.  He admitted, of course, that there are no records available but he made it quite clear that he believes 40,000 emigrated.  Perhaps they did, unfortunately; we do not know, but can anyone say that the trend of emigration is easing at the present time?  What is the policy of the present Government to try to stem emigration, on the one hand, and to try to provide employment on the other?  From the Taoiseach's statement it is quite obvious that, if we consider every aspect of Government policy, try as they may, the Government <Col N="711" /> cannot achieve what they told the people they would achieve during the election.  They probably believed they could achieve it but they cannot do it because the over-all policy of the Government, whether we like it or not, is similar to the policy which has been in operation here for years back under Fianna Fáil and similar to a great extent to the policy of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Very little anyhow. Perhaps we can discuss that later on. Coming to the present position, the Taoiseach tells us that for the last three months things have been improving. If that is true we are entitled to make a comparison between some of the figures given by the Taoiseach himself last night.  Let us consider for a moment the problem which has so often been trotted out here, perhaps rightly so, of our adverse trade gap. We were told in 1955 that the trade gap amounted to £35,500,000.  In 1956 that was closed and the sum was £14.4 million.</P>
      <P>Surely then, even allowing for all the misdeeds that we have been told about, the inter-Party Government during their term in office, irrespective of whether or not their policy was one which would tend to improve the position in relation to unemployment, at least succeeded in closing the trade gap and the difference between the gap in 1955 and that in 1956 justifies the claim of those now in Opposition that they achieved something concrete by closing the trade gap to that extent and handing over control three months ago to the present Government with that excellent achievement behind them.  Though 1956 was a bad year in relation to unemployment and a bad year in relation to over-all economic conditions, the present Government have no cause to complain when we remember that the adverse trade gap was reduced by the inter-Party Government from £35,500,000 to £14.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been admitted that, while the <Col N="712" /> introduction of the levies had some disadvantages, as many of us here explained at the time, coupled with that there was the introduction of a new system of private finance by way of Prize Bonds and the Taoiseach and his Government are to-day in a much happier position than was the inter-Party Government in 1956.  The policy of the inter-Party Government during 1956, a conservative policy in many respects, has at least enabled the present Government to come in here on the Taoiseach's Estimate and paint a rosy picture.</P>
    <P>When speaking of the adverse trade gap the Taoiseach conveniently avoided discussion on a much more important cardinal point.  He did not refer to the credit balance.  No consideration appears to have been given to what any businessman would of necessity regard as of vital importance to him in balancing his accounts, namely, stock in hands.  Deputy Dillon was quite right this morning when he drew attention to the worth of this country and particularly to the worth of agriculture and the value given to the agricultural community through the heavy export of cattle and the large volume of money coming in during the early months of this year.</P>
    <P>We all know that in the months of March and April, when Government accounts are being balanced, we are not in a position to get information regarding stock in hands.  Therefore, much of what we hear about economic crises is, conveniently or otherwise, drawn across the trail by sections outside the Dáil and by people inside the Dáil who, for political or other reasons, wish to paint a very black picture of the economic conditions of the country.</P>
    <P>In relation to what the Taoiseach told us and in relation to newspaper headlines about crises, I think I am entitled to ask what is the cause of the economic crises.  The Minister for Lands, as quoted in the <i>Irish Press</i> of Tuesday, January 29th, 1957, stated at a meeting:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Coalition Government had now to admit how much they were responsible for the crisis by encouraging a mad spending spree.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> Did the Coalition Government engage in squandermania?  Did the inter-Party Government squander?  The Taoiseach has not given us the answer to that question in his introductory speech.  It is essential that the country should be told whether or not the policy of the last Government was a policy of squandermania.</P>
    <P>It is quite right, as was mentioned by Deputy Dillon this morning, that many voices expressing the views of the present Government seem to be completely at variance.  The Minister for Lands was drawing attention to squandermania, including expenditure on housing.  The Taoiseach, last night, and I believe he meant what he said, drew particular attention to the necessity for providing money for housing.  It is inconsistent that there should be two policies expressed, one by the Taoiseach and the other by an important Minister.</P>
    <P>Every member of the Labour Party believes that in relation to the national expenditure, cognisance must be taken of the amount of money made available for housing.  We consider that anyone who believes in a progressive policy has not the right to suggest that the provision of large amounts of money for housing, whether in Dublin, Cork City, the other cities or the rural areas, is unproductive expenditure or squandermania on the part of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>One of the headaches of Government is the contrast between import and export prices.  Our difficulty is that we are at the mercy of other nations in relation to export prices.  Ministers may strive to strike the hardest possible bargains for export prices for cattle, but the difficulty in 1956, and it is a difficulty that may recur, was the impossibility of getting a true balance between export and import prices.  In this matter, we are not in any different position from the position of other Continental countries.</P>
    <P>We faced that problem in 1951 owing to the Korean War.  We may face it at any time.  I wish, therefore, to draw particular attention to the propaganda used, particularly during 1956, alleging the incompetence of the Government at that time and alleging that the overall <Col N="714" /> approach of that Government was leading the country towards financial disaster.  I did not agree with that propaganda then.  I do not agree now that that propaganda gave a clear picture of our position.</P>
    <P>One member of the Opposition at that time, who is now a Minister, said that the high wages structure was the cause of our economic difficulties and referred to what he considered the dangerous position of the commercial banks, who were suffering, as he termed it, from pernicious anaemia. He suggested that these two factors were a definite danger to the economic recovery of the country&mdash;the high wage structure and the position of the banks. Then we recall the statement by the same Minister that went so far as to suggest that he heard rumours that members of the 1956 Government were threatening the banks, that members of the Government at that time were going so far as to interfere with the savings of the people in the Post Office Savings Bank.  We all know that these wild, reckless statements tended to cause alarm, not only in Dublin, but throughout the country.  We knew that these reckless statements helped to cause an economic crisis more than anything that might be said here by the ordinary member of any Party.</P>
    <P>I do hope that during the lifetime of the present Government, no member of the Opposition, whatever Party he may support, will ever go so far as to try to cause scares in the country, try to cause trouble or to arouse the people against the Government to such an extent as to encourage them to withdraw their savings from the Post Office Savings Bank or from the banks, or to invest their money abroad, instead of in Ireland.  Even though investment in Ireland may not give as high a financial return, it will create employment and better conditions for the people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the activities of some of the Departments of State and mentioned what he considered the right line of approach for some of his Ministers.  He mentioned Industry and Commerce.  We have heard a great deal about Industry and Commerce and that is only proper because <Col N="715" /> it is one Department whose activities mean a great deal to the people.  Perhaps the Taoiseach did not realise the extraordinary change in approach by the Department of Industry and Commerce in the last three months from what it was during the lifetime of the former Government. I shall not go into the matter in detail as it involves broad policy.</P>
    <P>We see in this morning's <i>Irish Press</i> a notice that by paying 3/- people can get a certain document.  They are welcome to it, but the main news page of the same newspaper carries a very heavy headline that the document which costs 3/- to buy will not, according to the Minister for Finance be put into operation.  It contains the recommendations of a commission, or call it what you like, in relation to the prices of different commodities and in relation to trade rings and monopolies that have been prevalent in this country lately.  Compare those recommendations with the refusal of the Minister to make an Order, which in itself would help to control the prices of the commodities.</P>
    <P>We are told that there is leadership in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Is that the leadership which the Taoiseach wishes to offer us? Are we going back to the monopoly system that we have had during the last few years and which has been exposed in different inquiries which have been held?  Does the Taoiseach say, as Leader of the House and of the Government, that he has a good leader in the Department of Industry and Commerce and that he agrees with the policy of the Minister?</P>

      <P>If the Minister refuses to make an Order on these issues then the Taoiseach is welcome to praise him but, believe me, the people cannot be satisfied that a Minister considers trade rings and monopolies should flourish, rather than accept the facts provided by people who gave a great deal of their time and <Col N="716" /> energy in drawing attention to these particular aspects.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also spoke on agriculture. Deputy Dillon covered practically every point in agriculture in his speech this morning, and it is open to members of every Party to consider whether they agree with the various points presented by him.  On the other hand, we have an Estimate introduced here by a new Minister for Agriculture. In passing, may I wish him well in dealing with the problems that will confront him in that Department. Since he has just gone into the Department, I do not think there would be any point or advantage in discussing at length what we believe should be the policy on agriculture.  During the next 12 months the Minister may justify the claims that he made on the introduction of his Estimate and it will be fairer to deal with them at the end of that time.</P>
      <P>In that very important Estimate £250,000 is provided for marketing, to get our agricultural produce placed on the market in a better condition, but if agriculture is to prosper I am afraid we shall have to take a different line of approach to it.  Believing as I do that the present Minister is prepared to express his views as he has always done, in a very clear and determined fashion in this House, I shall leave the matter at that.  In 12 months' time we may be in a position to compare his line of approach with what we believe is the most suitable for agriculture and the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach also spoke about local government.  I confine myself to drawing attention to the problem of housing in relation to local government. One of the problems that confronted the Government during 1956 in relation to housing was the provision of finance.  We were not happy about it. I am not making any secret about that but we were told that with a change of Government the signal would be given for full steam ahead.  Unfortunately, I can tell the House that no advance whatsoever has been made in relation to housing, at least in the constituency to which I have of necessity to give paramount attention. <Col N="717" /> Sanction for housing schemes was held up and, unfortunately, is still being held up.  Perhaps the Taoiseach, even at this late stage, might inquire from the Minister for Local Government why the spectacular advance that was to be made following on the change of Government has not materialised yet. The Taoiseach cannot claim that the change of Government has, so far, brought about a policy of advancement in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, naturally enough, drew particular attention to one Minister, the Minister for Finance, whose policy we are entitled to assume is the agreed policy of the Government. It is admitted that no matter how well intentioned any Minister may be in any other Department he must work along the policy laid down by the Minister for Finance to secure finance for the advancement of different projects in relation to his own Department. I believe that the present policy of the Minister for Finance, supported by the Taoiseach in his statement here last night, is one which, if continued, will not give any advancement in relation to our over-all economic conditions.</P>
    <P>We have already seen the problem caused by the removal of food subsidies. Every one of us knows that one of the issues of the last general election was high prices.  Are prices any lower now than they were before the election?  Have prices of particular commodities, the essentials in food, come down in Dublin, Cork, any other city or anywhere in the rural areas? We explained at the time of the discussion on the Budget that we could not agree with the removal of the food subsidies.  The Taoiseach said they had to find money.  That may be so but the Labour Party have always claimed that one way money should not be found was by the removal of food subsidies.</P>
    <P>In spite of the fact that the Taoiseach would suggest that the compensation given to a small section, by increasing allowances under different headings, has meant a proper balance of payments in the domestic sphere in relation to the over-all cost of living, <Col N="718" /> we know that the balance is still against the individual householder. The Taoiseach and the members of the last Government have warned us of the deadly dangers of the State's not being able to balance its accounts.  Despite that the Minister for Finance, with the assured support of the Taoiseach, removed the food subsidies, a step which has resulted in a worsening of conditions for people in the cities, towns and rural areas.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we can see in various trade or professional journals great credit given to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance for adopting what they term this bold and forward policy of saving money on the food subsidies.  It seems we are moving into an era of sectionalism because the self-same professional people who had for years been clamouring for the removal of the food subsidies, by which of course the working people suffered most, never complained that industrialists, if they wish to establish an industry in any part of the country will be subsidised not alone by protective tariffs but by a financial grant towards the erection of a factory.</P>
    <P>We never objected to that because any inducements to the creation of greater employment are welcome, but nobody can have his loaf and eat it. If this professional section object, as they did and succeeded in getting the Minister for Finance to agree with their objection to food subsidies, they must understand that the source of supply of money for the erection of factories is the same source as that which provided money for food subsidies. Therefore, when we are considering the problem of subsidies we must examine it in a fair-minded manner. The poorer people are suffering as a result of the removal of the food subsidies and I would remind the Taoiseach that the policy of his Government in this important respect will not help the people.  It will not help those on small wages and it certainly will not help those on the unemployment register, whether in 1957 or 1958. One matter with which the Labour Party cannot agree&mdash;we did not agree with it when the last Government was in office either&mdash;is the policy of the <Col N="719" /> Government in tying almost completely the amount of productive employment to the amount of savings that can be made available.  That is the very great difference of approach between the Labour Party and this Government in relation to this problem.  It is fantastic to suggest that progress must be limited to the amount of money made available in savings. It is wise and essential to encourage people to be thrifty, but if Government activities are to be confined solely to the meagre amount of savings that can be made available from year to year, then progress, whether the year be 1957 or 1967, cannot be what we would hope it to be.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we should make a comparison between present money values as against pre-war values.  Even members of the last Government told us of the wonderful benefits bestowed on the community as a whole by the amount of money made available by way of loan through our present banking system.  Deputy Sweetman, as Minister for Finance, did elaborate on the amount of money made available. Nevertheless if we are to make a comparison in respect of money values and between the amount of advances now as against those in the '30s and in the '40s, we shall find that the present amount of advances is not a true reflection of the amount of money that could and should be made available in relation to solid securities.</P>
    <P>What is wrong, I believe, is that the Government is faced, as the last Government was faced for the last six months of its period of office, by a policy of hindrance by those who can control the pursestrings of the nation. I know many people will threaten us with dire results if we make any suggestion in this connection, but on this issue we are in good company.  A prominent member of the present Government, the Tánaiste, expressed his views, and rightly so&mdash;unfortunately they seemed to be individual views&mdash; in relation to the powers of the Central Bank.  We hear of the national income, of the national debt and the cost of running the Government and, throughout the Twenty-Six Counties, we hear <Col N="720" /> about the cost of running local authorities. Unfortunately, be it on a national or a local basis, comparison is never made between the volume of work done, the amount of money provided by advances to provide this work, and the rate of repayment for the money so borrowed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Government should realise that, while each and every one of us would wish to see every family living in a decent home and the necessary amenities provided in every village and town, whether it be rural electrification or water and sewerage schemes, there is a huge premium placed on the community as a whole by a small minority if such advantages are to be given.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the policy of the Government in continuing the old system.  It has been said on many occasions that the policy of the Labour Party was deadly dangerous to the community, that if the Labour Party had control they would rob the banks and rob the community of their lifetime savings.  Never did we make any such suggestion.  We believe that what is right and proper in Great Britain should be right and proper here.  The Bank of England is in a different position from the Central Bank here.  It would be better for us at times if the Act giving this country a Central Bank had never been passed because their powers are so limited.</P>
    <P>They are so limited that it means we are still faced with the same old problems in relation to finance as at the foundation of this State.  We are up against it now as we have been in the years past.  The same policy of usury, the policy of demanding the real pound of flesh, the system of demanding such a high percentage from production, of demanding such high payments from tenants in rural cottages, is still with us.  Do we all agree with that policy?  Apparently the present Government, as well as a majority of the Opposition, do agree with it.</P>
    <P>So long as that state of affairs exists we cannot hope for any real progress; we cannot hope for the move forward that is so essential for the provision of decent conditions in this country which, in turn, would help us to solve <Col N="721" /> the problems of emigration and unemployment and which would make life a little happier for our people.  As I said at the beginning, it is quite obvious there is a great difference of opinion, if we are to judge by statements made, between the Taoiseach and the members of his Cabinet.  That being so, I am afraid we cannot hope for the wonders we have been promised during the past few months.</P>
    <P>I consider, therefore, that if this country is to make any progress there must be a reorientation of policy and economic planning.  We have tried the old system for 35 years; each Government and each Party in the House have done their utmost to put into operation a policy which they thought would benefit the people.  They have failed. We all know that.  We seem to be too eager to grasp at every little straw, to travel with every wind that blows.  If any of us achieve something we continue proudly to point to that achievement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry mentioned the establishment of the oil refinery in Cork. Naturally, I am proud to be able to associate Deputy Norton, who was Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time, with such a project.  However, we are too eager to point to some advances made or to some industry established in our own constituencies, forgetting the overall picture, forgetting the general good of the community as a whole.  That is why I believe the policy of the past has been one of failure.  It is true that Governments in the past did a considerable amount of good work.  They helped to give a large number of decent homes to our people, to provide hospitals and to give some measure of assistance to those needing it.  Unfortunately, as every Deputy knows, it is only wishful thinking to believe that what we have done has been of overall benefit to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon devoted most of his time to a discussion on agriculture.  We all know the importance of agriculture, but we must realise that no matter how agriculture progresses we shall never again see as many men employed on the land as in the past, for the reason that mechanism has been introduced to <Col N="722" /> such a great extent into Irish farming. Whether it be in South Cork or elsewhere throughout the country, farmers in future will not employ as many men as they did heretofore.  Agriculture in general cannot provide employment opportunities as in the past.  While we know our economic fabric depends, to a great extent, on a prosperous agricultural industry, we cannot look to that industry to provide many of the numerous new jobs that become necessary each year.  Agriculture will not solve that problem.  In the area contiguous to Dublin we see districts which up to a few years ago were broad fields now the sites of large housing schemes and factories.  Dublin cannot live on the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>While agriculture is not providing the large measure of employment it hitherto provided, local authorities have been endeavouring to cut down on the amount of money they intend to spend on the provision of employment, thus making worse the prospect of large-scale emigration.  The building up of Dublin is a healthy sign for the capital city but not for the rest of the country.  In view of all these indications, I consider it rather important that the Taoiseach should come here prepared to admit that, in spite of all his endeavours, in spite of the endeavours of his Party and of every other Party who held Government office in the past 25 years, we have not made anything like the progress we had hoped for.  It is time we admitted the failures of the past and were prepared to adopt a policy of courage and determination, far removed from the views of such members as the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>That is the view of the Labour Party.  If we now make a comparison between what was said a few months ago and what has been achieved since the present Government took office, we will be reminded of the phrase: &ldquo;History repeats itself.&rdquo;  In January and February last we were told everything would be put right by a change of Government.  We were told that if there was a change of Government the crisis we were then facing would be surmounted.  As we have tried to explain, all that was needed was a <Col N="723" /> change of policy, not a change of Government. That was said long ago in this country when one faction were striving for power and the others were determined to hold on to it.  There was no difference at that time.  It was a policy of protection for some in this country at the expense of the majority.</P>
    <P>A famous Irishman marched into this city at a time, we are told in history, when he was almost dying.  Grattan pleaded for a continuation of Irish Government but all he wanted, I believe, was to keep Irish industrialists in a strong position.  I believe the policy of the present Government was to have a change of Government so that monopolies could continue, so that the Orders would not be signed by a Minister for Industry and Commerce, so that everything would continue as in the past.  That is a policy which cannot, under any circumstances, give benefits to our people or hopes of advances in the future.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's Estimate gives Deputies a chance of reviewing the whole plane of Government activity.  It is well that Deputies are <Col N="724" /> allowed that latitude, especially on the day the Dáil is about to rise.  We have had a new Government now for the past three and a half months but I see no radical change of policy whatever except in relation to the abolition of the food subsidies.  In view of what has been said here, I still feel there has never been a just appraisal of the difficulties that faced the last Government during 1956.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond spoke of headlines in the different papers of a crisis, of meeting the crisis and of fighting the crisis.  The crisis, if there is one, was never as great as that which faced us in 1956.  It will be to the eternal credit of the then Government that they faced their responsibilities with realism and determination and took very unpopular measures in order to rectify our balance of payments position.  Their action showed that they were prepared to consider the country before their own respective political futures.  We are not alone in our difficulties.  Consider Denmark, a highly developed nation of long-standing, and also Holland, where the Government are to-day trying to find markets for their exportable surpluses in various European countries.  Once, Denmark had an open market in Great Britain.  Now she is priced out of Great Britain with regard to eggs and poultry and has actually to go into competition with Great Britain herself in selling these commodities abroad.</P>
      <P>We are an exporting country.  We have to import almost all the raw materials that go to support our industries. Therefore we will always be subject to the fluctuations that occur in other nations.  During 1946, we faced the position that we were selling our exports on a falling market and had to pay more for our imports because of shipping costs and rising production costs.  At the same time, our savings were dwindling and revenue was shrinking.  These were the unpleasant facts which the then Government had to face.  There has been a change for the better in that situation. This Government will not be faced with similar difficulties.  That is my earnest hope and I am sure it is the hope of every Irishman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> At a Fianna Fáil meeting in the Ormond Hotel, Dublin, last March after the general election the Tánaiste said that the coming years will prove our ability to exist as a separate economic unit.  I believe the past ten years have brought forth that challenge more and more clearly.  We shall have to realise our limitations and be more cautious when we find long-standing nations in difficulties with regard to their production.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that our future depends on increased production. These words have been ringing in our ears over the past two years.  Every economist, every vocational group, every person with a worthwhile opinion, the Federation of Irish Manufacturers and the trade unions, all admit that dictum to be correct. But what are the facts?  To-day, we are at saturation point in the production of wheat.  We are over-produced in oats.  In the past, the horse was the great consumer of our oat crop. By the end of this cereal year&mdash;which, I believe, is at the end of this month &mdash;we shall have a big surplus of oats from last year.  Many farmers have been unable to market their oats during the past 12 months.  We shall be over-produced in barley after this year. We shall be over-produced in butter, eggs and poultry and our bacon position is a bit chaotic at the moment because of the prevalence of swine fever.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing, as Deputy Dillon said this morning, that we have produced to saturation point in these commodities. The obligation is on the Government to find a profitable market abroad for our surpluses if we are to maintain the increased production we have achieved in the past 12 months or two years.  We all realise that the poultry and egg industries are a great loss.  Our egg exports are down in value to £750,000 from £3,250,000 in 1952 and our dead poultry exports are down to £1,750,000 from the £4,250,000 they made in 1952.  That represents a drop in the combined commodities of £5,000,000 and is a great loss to Irish husbandry.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that we are over-produced in these commodities, <Col N="726" /> we have to fall back on our cattle exports.  They still hold pride of place. Cattle will remain the main plank of our economic fabric.  It was gratifying to note from the statistics issued last week by the Department of Agriculture when the Minister for Agriculture produced his Estimate that our cattle shipments to the Continent have increased by 850 per cent. since 1951, I think.  That opens up the hope that it is still possible to increase further our exports.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should like to say, in regard to nearly every agricultural commodity exported to the Continent last year, that there was an increase in value over the previous year.  Nevertheless, Great Britain remains our main intake for our cattle.  We shall have to be up and doing and have a combined effort by the farmers, the Department of Agriculture and the Minister for Agriculture in relation to tuberculosis eradication so that our cattle can go as tubercular tested cattle into Great Britain, if we want to hold our place there.  If our herds were tuberculosis free at the moment, I believe we would be able to push the sales of breeding cattle in various Continental countries.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the present Minister for Agriculture will continue the discussions with farming interests which have occurred during the past 12 months.  Heretofore, farmers spoke with scattered voices.  They were a body of scattered units.  The N.F.A. has filled a long-standing void.  Now the farmers can speak with a united voice in the councils of the nation when they are called into consultation with the Minister for Agriculture.  They will be able to put their point of view and that is vital if we are to survive as an agricultural country.  The directors and operators of our agricultural industry will have a say in the shaping of the policy that best suits the requirements of our agricultural community.  It was vital that the farmers should be organised. All the professional units of this country, trade unionists, manufacturers, industrialists and thousands of people in all categories are now organised. If the farming community want to help their own, it is very important <Col N="727" /> that they be organised as a solid body so as to put their point of view and make known their needs and requirements, as the occasion arises.</P>
    <P>This year the Government has provided a sum of £250,000 towards improved marketing conditions&mdash;perhaps in the survey of trying to secure new markets for our produce.  There is no indication as to how that money will be spent.  However, it is well that the money is being provided, although, at the moment, the step is purely experimental.  Who will go abroad?  Will State technicians and civil servants go abroad?  Where are they going?  What will be the technique? Are we to establish agents abroad to push our products in the various places where they are still unknown? What will be the plan for the allocation of these moneys?  These are things we would like to know and I think they should be stated in a Government White Paper.  They are very important from the farmers' point of view and also from the point of view of the general economy of the country.</P>
    <P>The Government has two very important problems facing it.  It will have to take a decision about the Free Trade Area and it will have to intensify the methods adopted towards the eradication of T.B. in our cattle.  It has other difficulties to face also.  I believe that the greatest handicap to progress in this country is the fact that we are taxed to the tune of £60,000,000. That certainly is a very great burden on a little country like ours, with its very limited resources.  It is obligatory on the Government to tackle that problem and cut down our costs, if we are to survive here as an economic unit.</P>
    <P>In the past, we moved rather too rapidly and embarked on industries that were not related to our potentialities. If we had confined ourselves to industries for which we could get the raw materials at home, I think we would have built a sounder economic fabric than we have at present.  The whole machinery of State is cumbersome and costly.</P>
    <P>A good deal of criticism has been offered here from time to time of the Civil Service.  Candidly, I must assert that we have the best Civil Service in <Col N="728" /> the world.  No greater proof of that is available than the fact that this Dáil met only on two occasions between mid-December and 24th April of this year.  It is true that the Government was there all the time, but it shows that the service was there to administer the affairs of this country, without having to convene the Parliament at all.</P>
    <P>That is a good thing.  I think that even if the Dáil closed down for 12 months, now that the Financial Resolutions have received legal sanction, the Government of the country would still go on.  It shows that this Parliament can be very superfluous on occasions.  I am not an advocate of any form of Government but democracy, but I still believe that our democracy needs an overhaul.  In the old Roman days, we had Government by triumvirate and decemvirate.  I do not want anything like that here, but in fact we have something akin to that.  The Cabinet will decide on legislation and expect the members of the Party from which the Cabinet is drawn to back that legislation in the House.</P>
    <P>Sufficient use is not made of Parliament. It could be effectively utilised for the examination of economic and domestic matters by Special Committees of the House.  A motion was moved here last evening by Deputy J.A. Costello which cleared up some misconceptions we had about the Free Trade Area.  A valid reason was put up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to why the motion should not be accepted.  I was impressed by it.  Nevertheless, the motion had a good effect.  But I think we still could have Special Committees to inquire into different aspects of legislation and different aspects of our economy.  They would serve a very useful purpose and help to make more use of the Parliament we have.</P>
    <P>My chief criticism of the Government from my experience here is the inordinately long delays that sometimes occur when Departments are making decisions.  I do not know whether that arises from overcaution, but at times it is agonising and tantalising to find Departments putting things off indefinitely and irritating the people <Col N="729" /> waiting for these decisions.  I think these matters could be speeded up. Unfortunately, the custom is growing up in this country of using Deputies for all sorts of things.  Most of our time here is spent acting as couriers between the people and the Departments. I do not think that is a good system.  The people should have direct approach and should be made to realise that that direct approach is there, if they utilise it; that the officials of the Departments will deal directly with them, so that the time of Deputies will be available for the functions they are called upon to perform, sitting here, contributing to and listening to the debates and taking their part in shaping the legislation of the country.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago, a question was asked here about the itinerants on our public highways all over the country. The people in my part of the country have come to me on two or three occasions and complained very forcibly about these people.  I know of one area, two miles from my own home, where they have been camped for six weeks on end with five or six caravans and about 20 horses.  These horses are on the roads at night.  They go into farmers' fields and have caused considerable trespass.  Surely, it is a challenge to our ability to deal with a small domestic problem like that?  It is no comfort to be told that the matter is being examined.  It should be examined expeditiously and some means devised of dealing with these people, who are becoming a public menace.</P>

      <P>I will pass from that. We are coming to the end of this session. It was a pleasant session.  That was largely attributable to the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, who, when taking over Leadership of the Opposition, declared that he and those with him in opposition would be constructive, helpful and critical and that they would give the Government every help they needed in any problems facing them.  I believe that the reasonableness shown by the Opposition during this session has been largely attributable to the assertions made by the ex-Taoiseach. I hope that will continue and that we will not have the political thrusts and parries we have been accustomed to here during the past three years.  We have a solemn duty here.

      <Col N="731" /> I have made no public statement because I have clung to the hope that good sense and decent neighbourly feeling would, of themselves, bring this business to an end.  I cannot say that I know every fact, but if, as Head of the Government, I must speak, I can only say, from what has appeared in public, that I regard this boycott as ill-conceived, ill considered and futile for the achievement of the purpose for which it seems to have been intended; that I regard it as unjust and cruel to confound the innocent with the guilty; that I repudiate any suggestion that this boycott is typical of the attitude or conduct of our people; that I am convinced that 90 per cent. of them look on this matter as I do; and that I beg of all who have regard for the fair name, good repute and well-being of our nation to use their influence to bring this deplorable affair to a speedy end.</P>

      <P>The provision of hotel accommodation is primarily a matter for private enterprise but I recognise that from the point of view of tourist development an improvement and increase of accommodation is a cardinal necessity.  As I indicated when speaking on the Estimate for Tourism in the Dáil on the 2nd July, a Bill is being introduced in the Dáil this week to extend for a further period the powers provided under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, to guarantee loans to hoteliers for the extension, modernisation or improvement of holiday accommodation.</P>
      <P>So far as the area mentioned by the Deputy is concerned I am aware that certain proposals for the provision of additional accommodation are under discussion between Board Fáilte Éireann and the private interests concerned.</P>
      <P>In view of the special potentialities for the development of tourism provided by the existence of Shannon Airport, I asked Bord Fáilte Éireann last month to examine urgently the possibility of developing holiday facilities in the region of the airport as a special promotional effort.

      <P>It is impossible to provide comparative figures of the kind requested by the Deputy.  So far as this country is concerned, the only information available is that contained in pages 30 to 33 of the Statement of Accounts and Statistics of C.I.E. for the year ended 31st March, 1956, which was presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the 24th January, 1957.</P>
      <P>The Annual Report of the British Transport Commission contains certain information in relation to rail and road receipts but the figures are not readily comparable with those for Ireland.  So far as the Continent of Europe is concerned, I am advised by the Central Statistics Office that, while the statistics published by the International Union of Railways give some particulars of average rail rates charged by European countries, these figures are not given in a way which would enable the comparative analysis the Deputy has requested to be made.

      <P>The introduction of proposals for legislation to control itinerants would not be my concern.

Such amendment as may be possible would however have only an incidental bearing on the various problems presented by itinerants and would form only part of an Amending Bill dealing with a number of other matters.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his question of 24th April last in which I outlined the position generally regarding the number of holdings reserved by the Land Commission each year for allotment to migrants and also the position affecting applications for migration from landowners in County Kerry.</P>
      <P>Land Commission records are not kept on the basis of constituency areas but I understand that, in the case of County Kerry as a whole, over 100 applications for migration to the midland and Eastern districts have been received during the past two years. These have been placed on record and will be considered on their merits by the Land Commission according as circumstances permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Final decisions regarding migration each year are based on a number of factors, including the circumstances of the various applicants, the suitability of their lands for use in effecting rearrangement, and the number of new <Col N="741" /> holdings available to the Land Commission for disposal.</P>

      <P>My Department has not discontinued the purchase of wooden chairs.  When chairs are required it is the policy to provide wooden chairs where practicable and, in fact, 800 wooden chairs were purchased for Army use last year.  In recent years tubular steel <Col N="743" /> stacking chairs have been purchased for men's dining halls, in replacement of forms which were becoming unserviceable. They were considered to be the only chairs which would be suitable for the particular purpose having regard to all the factors involved. They are cheaper than wooden chairs of a similar type.  Chairs had not previously been supplied to men's dining halls; I cannot see, therefore, how the action of my Department in purchasing steel chairs could, as alleged by the Deputy, have given rise to unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened this morning to the speeches of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Manley, and to portion of the speech of Deputy Desmond. There was not much new in any of those speeches, so far as I could see. Practically every argument I heard, I had heard earlier in the debates on the Estimates previously before us. Deputy Dillon, by again alleging that there were conflicting statements made by the Minister for Lands, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Health in recent times, pretended to be very upset because of these alleged conflicting statements. He did not tell us what statements he was referring to.</P>
      <P>I should like to assure him that the members of this Government, as far as I know, and certainly the members of our Party, work as a team and that the aim which Deputy Dillon announced this morning as the aim of an Irish Parliament&mdash;a better way of life for our people&mdash;is the aim both of the Government and of our Party.  I should like also to assure him that, during the years since the great organisation of Fianna Fáil was established, the aim of that Party has been, and will continue to be, to provide our people with a better way of life.</P>
      <P>I heard one rather peculiar statement from Deputy Desmond.  He stated that the Taoiseach would have to admit that we have not made any progress here over the years.  I think that is a fantastic statement from any Irish person who has been living in this country for the past 30 or 40 years.</P>

      <P>If anybody says the Deputy did not make that statement that is another question.  He did, however, say that the Taoiseach would have to admit that we made no progress here over the years.  I remember very well the time before this State was established and the conditions in which the people lived during that time.  I think the most marvellous change has taken place in this country since the State was established.  I can see the change in every aspect of our lives and it is shocking to hear a statement of that description, made in all seriousness, here this morning.  I think it is worth while reviewing just a few of the changes that have taken place, particularly the changes that have taken place since 1932.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke on housing.  He made another strange statement when he said improvements in the conditions of our people was a primary objective in the matter of house building.  I should like to advise him that he is wrong in that impression. I remember attending a meeting of the first Government in 1921 at the Mansion House.  Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy MacEoin were there on the same day when a review was given of the housing needs of this country.  At that time I regarded the statement made then of the programme of Sinn Féin on that as fantastic.</P>

      <P>I am just giving the background, Sir.  I am sure I may refer to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1932, when we did really start to house people.  Deputy Dillon states we have reached the end of house-building in this country.  I want to suggest we have some distance to travel before we do reach the end. I think we will not have reached the end of the rehousing of our people until there are more houses in the country than would fulfil the ordinary needs of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard, a Cheann Comhairle, to speak in view of all these interruptions but I will try to do the best I can.  I am entitled to say that we must continue house-building until there is a surplus of houses in our country.  There are people who think, as Deputy Dillon does, that the housing needs of the greater part of the country have already been satisfied. I am not so sure of that.  I know housing affects our people in a great number of ways that very often we do not consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I might refer at the present time to the low marriage rate, and the fact that in the countryside very often whole townlands, and even whole parishes, are without any children because the people living in farmhouses in rural areas have not alternative houses for younger people when they marry.  If there were houses for sons of farmers in the rural areas, we would have early marriages and we would not see our countryside depopulated as it <Col N="747" /> is at the present time.  I and many other Deputies have had experience of going amongst the people in towns recently, and we found the housing conditions were appalling in many towns.</P>
    <P>I have seen a house in which there was a husband, his wife and four children, the youngest of them 20 years of age, living in a slum clearance house in which one of these children was also living with his wife and four children.  That is an appalling state of affairs.  If there were sufficient houses two or three of the other children would marry, settle down, and not go abroad.  I feel the shortage of housing is responsible in a great measure for emigration and that if we want to keep our people at home, particularly our young people, we must give them the opportunity of founding a family.  Until we have a far greater number of houses than we are aiming at, we will not achieve that position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to our secondary industries as if they were in conflict with the interests of our farming community.  Again I remember that back in 1932, when there were not many of what he now calls secondary industries our farmers were in a more depressed condition than ever they were in the history of this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the economic war.  I am talking about the difficulties of the people in 1931 and 1932.  Our farming community were then in a more depressed condition than ever they were in the history of the State.  From 1934 onwards many of the industries that are giving employment to our young people in our towns at the present time were established, and since that time our farmers have become a prosperous community.  I was glad to hear Deputy Blowick a couple of weeks ago state that the farming community are the most independent people in this country and that came side by side with the improvement in the conditions of our people because of the secondary <Col N="748" /> industries at which Deputy Dillon seems to look down his nose.</P>
      <P>He was concerned particularly with a market for the products of our farmers.  Of course, every member of the House is concerned with providing our farming community with markets. Not only Fianna Fáil but, I am sure, Fine Gael and Labour as well, wish that the opportunities would be there for the marketing of everything which the farmers produce.  I think we can claim also that we were the first group to provide markets for our farmers at fixed prices.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Lynch interrupted I was trying to show that while Deputy Dillon is concerned with the provision of markets and of fixed prices for the products of our farming industry, Fianna Fáil set the headline in that regard.  It will be our aim in the future to see to it that the farmers will, so far as we can help them, be provided with a market for their produce and that the prices they will get will be remunerative and profitable to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> We know that there are occasions when it is impossible to provide the farmers with a market.  For instance, last year the farmers and the labourers in the labourers' cottages throughout the country produced an enormous quantity of turkeys and we all know what happened.  We were buying them in the towns for 1/3 a lb., at a price less than the cost of rearing them. Many of those farmers and labourers suffered heavy losses because of the fluctuation in the market.</P>
    <P>Our big difficulty has always been that we have been confined in the main to one market, the British market.  It was alleged by some of the speakers that we were against selling our goods in the British market.  We have never been against that.  What we have stood for is providing the best possible price by seeing to it that, if we could not get a price which was reasonable there, we would get it in an alternative market.  I have a distinct recollection of Deputy Dillon telling us here on one occasion that he would much prefer to sell our products in the British market at a price less than those products would secure in the continental markets which he called at the time &ldquo;fly-by-nights&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I hope it will increase still further.  I am well aware that Deputy Dillon said this morning that the abolition of food subsidies resulted in an increase in the price of butter and flour to our people.  I am also well aware that the people themselves, even before the removal of the subsidies, had been paying that price though they did not realise it.  Any <Col N="750" /> money that the Government spends must first come from the people by way of taxation generally.</P>

      <P>Having removed them, we wished to give to the people corresponding reliefs in taxation, but unfortunately because of the financial position it was not possible for us to do that.  The only possible way in which we could provide the moneys which would give us a balanced Budget was by the removal of the food subsidies, and Deputy Dillon's red herring in relation to motor cars, radios and television sets meant nothing.  We removed the food subsidies because we had to do it.  I have already stated that we had no intention whatsoever as a live political Party of inflicting hardship on the people if we could avoid it.  We had to remove the subsidies and Deputy Dillon knows that as well as I do and probably better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond said that we failed to find a programme that would benefit our people.  I was beginning to deal with that when I was interrupted.  We have a programme which has provided great benefits for our people over the years, and if anybody should admit that it is a representative of the Labour Party.  During the years in which Fianna Fáil have been in office if there was one section of the community who benefited by Government action it was the working people of the country.</P>

The Labour Party is in its present position, because they have no confidence in the Irish people, because they do not believe the Irish people capable of standing up to measures that a reasonable Government might think necessary in the interests of the Irish nation.  We brought in the Standstill Order because it was essential.  We also provided for the workers and for the people of Ireland generally during those grim days conditions that no other country in the world enjoyed.</P>

      <P>I shall deal with one more statement to which I listened this morning.  Deputy Desmond said that in February last Fianna Fáil pledged that everything would be good if there was a change of Government.  The people of Ireland knew last February that a change of Government was essential. They were aware of that this time 12 months.  If we did say that a change of Government was essential we did it in the belief that Government by Fianna Fáil would help to get the country out of the mess in which even Fine Gael will not deny the country was at the time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy was well aware of the tremendous task that a new Government would face.  I heard him, in a very reasonable speech at the close of the poll in Clonmel, asserting that that was so&mdash;that a new Government would be faced with a tremendous task.  When we did tell the people that, if the country were to be again put on the road towards reasonable prosperity it would be necessary to get the inter-Party Government out of office, we were telling the truth.  We asked the people to give us the absolute majority that would render us sufficiently strong to carry out our programme. I can assure Deputies opposite that that will be our aim while we are in Government, that all our efforts will be directed towards providing our people with a better way of life.  We shall, I hope, in the next few years, complete the housing programme, further develop our industries, maintain and improve the agricultural position and do everything which a united, strong Party can do to bring the country back again on the road to prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>As the last speaker said, Fianna Fáil were returned to power at <Col N="753" /> the last general election on their promises to deal effectively with the evils of unemployment and emigration.  They also promised that they would reduce the high cost of living.  If there was a state of gloom and almost of panic in the country at that time and preceding it, a good deal of the responsibility for that gloom and despondency can be laid at the doors of the <i>Irish Press.</i> On every occasion possible, whether it was true or not, or whether it was misleading or not, it was declared by that newspaper that this country was burst and bankrupt, that there was no future for it other than a change of Government, that the only hope was some Government other than that which was then struggling to meet an economic crisis that was hitting not only Europe but the world in general.</P>
      <P>I have very little sympathy for the leaders on the Government Benches who have now to appeal in order to restore the confidence of the people which they and their newspaper did so much to undermine during the past 12 months.  As Deputy Desmond has said, the Labour Party have been silent during the consideration of the Estimates. We believe that Fianna Fáil or any other Government were entitled to be given time and opportunity to bring into action their policy and their programme.  We also realised that the Estimates under discussion had been framed by inter-Party Ministers and that, beyond pruning here and there, there was very little the new Government could do.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out, however, that a period of three months has passed since the new Government took office.  That period is half the parliamentary life of the parliamentary year. There will not be between now and March any longer period than three months.  Is it not time, therefore, that there should be some indication as to what the Government intend to do, as to what their policy really is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two things happened for which we had no responsibility, but let me just take the Budget which was framed by a Fianna Fáil Minister.  By a deliberate act the Fianna Fáil Party, with the backing of all its members, increased the price of bread and gave <Col N="754" /> portion of the savings obtained through the removal of the subsidy on flour and bread&mdash;to whom?  To the master bakers.  They gave it to manufacturers and employers in the form of either grants or rebates.  They even declared that it was promised under the solemn word of the former Minister for Industry and Commerce to the master bakers, but luckily he was present to nail that statement as untrue.</P>
    <P>By deliberate act, the Fianna Fáil Government increased the price of butter and continued the subsidy to the Butter Marketing Board so that the people who are not Irish will now be able to enjoy butter at a cheaper rate than the Irish people themselves.  I believe the Government has created a problem for itself.  Let us be clear on what they did.  I challenge anyone on the Fianna Fáil side to state that any time during the election they indicated to the people that the price of saving the country would be to increase the prices of the essentials of life, bread and butter, at the expense of the working man.</P>
    <P>By deliberate choice under the same Budget, they increased hospitalisation charges on the working people and this will be effective at the same time that these people will be unemployed due to illness.  The daily rate of charge was increased by almost 50 per cent.  If it was just and fair in 1953, when Fianna Fáil passed the Health Act, that a charge of 6/- a day should apply with the cost of living as it then was, how can it be stated that with the present cost of living, which has considerably increased, the ordinary worker who is being appealed to not to seek further wage increases, may now reasonably be expected to find at least 50 per cent. more in times of illness and at times when he is refused any increase in his sickness benefit?</P>
    <P>By deliberate act, the Government refused to give, or decided not to give, to the sick or unemployed any compensation for the increased cost of living consequent on the Budget withdrawal of subsidies.  By deliberate act in the same Budget they increased distribution charges on foodstuffs and other consumer goods by increasing <Col N="755" /> petrol by 6d. a gallon causing further increases in the price of things that perhaps do not come within the cost-of-living index figure.  At the same time they gave a money grant to the Racing Board that could have been used in some way to reduce the pressure put on the workers.</P>
    <P>These are deliberate actions by the Government for which they cannot lay blame on the inter-Party Government and no amount of talk will convince us in the Labour Party that it is otherwise. No matter what Deputy Loughman or any other Deputy says about what was done in the past or what will be done in the future, it is what is being done at the present time that we have to examine.  The indications, if any, judging by the one deliberate action they have so far taken are that they intend to make the working man pay for whatever extravagance or wild ideas they have in mind.</P>
    <P>In the Taoiseach's speech as reported in to-day's <i>Irish Press</i>, in speaking of the causes of emigration and its attractions, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have certain ideas of my own on this subject, ideas which may not be shared by others.  One must take life as a whole and consider its satisfactions and the contentment it can give.  One must consider the happiness which the individual can have within himself.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the pressures and the pulls which are causing our people to seek different ways of life and different traditions, life here, if we were free to adopt our own standards, could be a very full life indeed, and we could carry a much greater population than we have at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is this not just a way of saying that we have, or expect to have, here a standard of living that in his opinion we are not entitled to?  He later said that &ldquo;hard work is its own reward&rdquo;, but we also have statements to the effect that all work and no play do not lead to a contented life.</P>
    <P>If we are not to expect the ordinary social amenities, not to speak of the amusements and luxuries, why should <Col N="756" /> we seek to produce more?  The animals in the field have a living.  We, as human beings, are entitled to share equally in the prosperity, enjoyment and social amenities available in our country in the same way as citizens of any other country and we are entitled to try to build up our standard of living as high as it is possible to go.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach appeals to the people's faith in the country, in his Party and in himself as leader of it.  He has indicated by a manipulation of figures, or by reading figures for this year as compared with last year that some degree of progress has been made in regard to the unemployment problem, but no matter how figures are juggled it is quite clear from the statistical return for the 22nd June, 1957&mdash;which is the latest available&mdash;that on that date, as compared with the same date in the previous year, we had seven thousand and some hundreds more unemployed. That is without taking into account the fact that many of those who were here 12 months ago have, we must assume, fled from the country to seek employment that is not available here.</P>
    <P>We are not laying any charges on the shoulders of Fianna Fáil for the unemployment situation.  I am not foolish enough to believe that any democratic Government would deliberately cause unemployment for its citizens. It is a fact, a fact for which they are not responsible, that in doing some things they may improve the employment position while, in doing other things, they may cause unemployment. But I do not believe that the latter is deliberate policy on the part of any Government.  It is quite clear that our unemployed have been expecting and hoping&mdash;and not alone the unemployed but the political Parties in opposition too&mdash;that the promises made by Fianna Fáil during the election would be implemented and that some solution would be found.</P>
    <P>Whatever is to be the future here, we hope there will be a steep drop in unemployment and we equally hope that that drop will not be caused by emigration.  When the cost-of-living index figure is published next August we will have demonstrable proof of <Col N="757" /> what the position is.  The figures will prove that all the talk about our having too high a standard of living and all the talk that the cost of living could be controlled is so much nonsense. Rather than being reduced, it will be shown that the cost of living has increased.  Where is the control? As I said earlier, it will be shown to have been increased deliberately by the action of the present Government.</P>
    <P>In his speech last evening, the Taoiseach drew attention to the fact that our balance of payments position has improved.  That is something about which we are all glad.  But, just as in my opening remarks I indicated that the present Government could not be held responsible for what was done by the previous Government and that they were entitled to a fair time to put their policy into operation, I still think that, when making that remark last evening, the Taoiseach should have indicated that that change has taken place as a direct result of the action of the last Government.  The recovery, or partial recovery, that has been made is the result of action taken by the inter-Party Government.  Remember, that Government was severely criticised by the members of the present Government when they were in opposition.</P>
    <P>There are a few points on which I should like to comment as indicative of what Government policy is likely to be in the future in as far as I could find such indications in either statements by Ministers or during discussions in this House.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs made a statement publicly: &ldquo;Television,&rdquo; he announced to the country, &ldquo;is a must.&rdquo;  We must have television irrespective, I presume, of cost.  Surely to goodness, in this time of retrenchment, at this period when workers are expected to do without butter or do with less butter or to pay more for it and pay more for their bread and are compelled to skimp, without seeking any improvement in wages, television is not a &ldquo;must&rdquo;?  If there is any money or any energy to be spent on anything surely it is not on the amusement side of life?  Surely television can <Col N="758" /> with very little exception be considered nothing but an amusement or a luxury?</P>
    <P>A change has been announced in road policy.  The grants that the inter-Party Government allocated to county roads are now, on instruction, to be switched to main roads.  Whether the Taoiseach is aware of it or not&mdash;and surely he must be aware of it through his advisers&mdash;every local authority in the country is displeased at that change.  They were glad in the rural areas to have the opportunity and the liberty to use the money where they saw it could best be used and where a greater improvement could be made in the unemployment position.  That improvement could be got by using the money on the county roads rather than on the main roads.  I am not one of those who believe that we should not have good main roads.  By all means let us have good main roads.  The motorist who pays the piper is entitled to a fair return but, at a time when the employment content of money spent on roads is of vital importance, the change is a bad change.</P>
    <P>The stopping of the Local Authorities (Works) Act grants which were used to improve roads and to improve land through the cleaning of rivers is a retrograde step.  The employment content in these grants was of vital importance.  These changes, instead of improving the employment position, will cause a deterioration and the effects of that deterioration will be seen in a very short time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry spoke here about his constituency.  He indicated that there would be plenty of employment in South Cork within the very near future.  To whom should the credit go? Who made the Whitegate scheme possible?  Was it not the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton?  Was it not the work carried out by Deputy Norton that made it possible to provide employment in South Cork for three years for a large number of employees, with permanent employment thereafter for quite a number?  Was it not Deputy Norton who, through his endeavours in America, when he was alleged to be gallivanting on State funds, came back having got certain parties interested, <Col N="759" /> Canadians in particular, and started in various counties and constituencies, my own included, mineral development which will, with the help of Providence, in the very near future give a profitable return and constant employment for able-bodied workers at a reasonable wage?</P>
    <P>There is just one other action by a Minister of this Government upon which I would like to comment before I conclude.  I refer to the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in granting to insurance interests a 20 per cent. increase in charges. People are aware that the ring of motor-car insurance groups here has deliberately, within the past month, refused under a full comprehensive policy to give any passenger coverage at all in certain cases.  Before these increases were granted to these people, the increases should have been made conditional on their serving Irish interests and the interests of the ordinary people here who keep these groups in business.</P>
    <P>The position of the Labour Party, as we see the Government <i>vis-a-vis</i> the people, is that the people get the Government they deserve.  We are not here to cash in on the miseries or misfortunes that may befall our people either now or in the immediate future, as some private Deputies are.  We shall not incite marches, parades or demonstrations to draw attention to unemployment.  We are not here to cause rebellion or upset.  We are here as a parliamentary Party to use our democratic right in this House to put forward constructive proposals and we have no intention of aiding, abetting or exploiting any particular circumstance. We shall support that which is in the national interest of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>If the Government promotes legislation which, in our opinion, serves the interests we represent, then they can be assured of our full co-operation.  If they promote legislation which is contrary to the interests we represent, then we shall expose, criticise and oppose in the belief that, in doing so, we are educating our people so that, when the day of reckoning comes again <Col N="760" /> and we have another general election, they will be able to differentiate between promise and performance.  They will be able to differentiate between the promises that were made and the actions that were taken subsequently.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Taoiseach that appeals to the people to have faith in the country are all very well.  As we learned from the Apostles, faith without good works is not enough.  We will have faith but we will depend on the Taoiseach's Party to produce the goods.  We want to see employment and normal social services available for the working class.  We want, in short, the Taoiseach and his Party to keep their election promise, to get cracking and do the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to keep the House only a few minutes to express a view which I think was misinterpreted recently by Deputies on the Opposition with regard to something I said on the value of housing development as a means of solving the emigration and employment problems.  It indicates that there has been a lack of reality in examining the whole question of how we will enable more people to secure permanent employment in this country.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, we have been through a period of ten years when the greater part of the savings accumulated during the war were liquidated and, in the words of the last Minister for Finance, to a very considerable extent on non-essential products.  We are also aware that during that period the savings of the people were inadequate to cover a period when we faced greater competition on foreign markets in agriculture and when we would have to examine our whole economy to see whether or not production was sufficient.</P>
      <P>The point I wish to make clear is that, naturally, we welcomed housing as a means of giving employment; naturally, we welcomed the continuance of the programme started by Fianna Fáil to provide houses for the people who were living under the appalling conditions which we found in 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty that has arisen in the <Col N="761" /> last ten years has been that, from questions asked in the Dáil and debates in the House, it became quite obvious that people seemed to think that the more persons were employed in public works over the whole of that period the more that was evidence of our ability to provide permanent employment for the people.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly evident from what has happened in the last ten years that expenditure on public works, however desirable, must depend upon the level of production and that, unless the level of production and trade rises, it is impossible to maintain employment on public works at the level we would like and the level that would be desirable. It is, I think, very important to realise in future that public works employment cannot by itself solve our problem and that if we build up our production potential then we shall have the savings; we shall have the profits; we shall have the money circulating, which will enable us to give still more employment in public works and to provide amenities of all kinds that are not strictly termed productive in character or in effect. Certainly, in future, now that capital is far less easy to obtain than it was, the level of the public works programme will have to depend more than in the past on the production level.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that for a good number of years since the war the people were led by Coalition speakers to believe that there was no need to give heed to the day when we would face the fiercest competition in our trade.  There were debates in this House carried out over that period in which hour after hour, day after day, the argument was that there were sufficient funds, that funds could be secured from abroad, that the money was available and, if there was the slightest degree of reduction in public works employment, even for a short period, the Fianna Fáil Government was criticised and the suggestion was made that we did not have the interests of the country at heart; whereas, in fact, this process was continuing and we failed to recognise the difficulties we would face when the standard of consumption here would increase <Col N="762" /> far beyond the production that was available to pay for the goods that were required to satisfy the people.</P>
    <P>I just wanted to make that clear because it has been suggested that I did not approve of housing whereas, of course, I, like other members of my Party, have worked to house the people for many, many years, but I must make the position clear that, as I have said, public works employment depends on production.  We in Fianna Fáil have proposed a number of schemes that I need not outline&mdash;they have been given by the Ministers in the various Estimates&mdash;for increasing production and I hope production will increase to a point where all the social amenities required by the people will be available to them.</P>

      <P>It is strange but it is true that the Fianna Fáil Party always have a policy, and a good one, before an election but they never seem to have a policy after an election.  Yesterday the Taoiseach made a speech introducing the Estimate at no point of which was there any declaration of policy.  There was no evidence for anybody listening to that speech or studying it that there would be any innovation, that there would be any departure from the policy of Fianna Fáil that we have known too long in this country.  We have known the Fianna Fáil policy too long, particularly in relation to emigration and unemployment, two ills which were rife when Fianna Fáil came into office and which are still rife after 20 years of Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the Fianna Fáil Party making a declaration of policy and then doing the opposite to that policy. May I quote, for instance, Point 17 of the declaration of policy of 1951, which said that it was the policy of Fianna Fáil to maintain food subsidies and to control prices?  We know what happened.  In less than 12 months from that date a positive policy of abolishing food subsidies was started. The second instalment of that policy was put into effect this year and we had the Tánaiste in recent times announcing a new policy in relation to <Col N="763" /> the control of prices.  It is not certain yet whether he is in favour of abolishing complete control of prices, which, indeed, he said, or whether it is a matter of expediency because only recently, and he expressed regret for doing so, he invoked certain powers in order to exercise price control in relation to the bread industry.  Then he comes along and says that he will bring in special legislation to alter the policy in relation to price control.</P>
    <P>First of all, I am complaining that we did not have any new statement of policy from the Taoiseach and we have seen the failure of the policy of his Party during their 20 years in office. On every occasion that Fianna Fáil handed over the Government of this country, we found it in a worse position than they had found it on taking office.  They have put into effect certain policies which were not balanced by policies in relation to other aspects of our economy which would even them out.  The Taoiseach and, indeed the Tánaiste, both sprang at an opportunity to take political advantage of recoveries which are becoming evident, particularly in relation to our trade balances.</P>
    <P>It was declared last year by the Minister for Finance, when he was reluctantly introducing the levies, that it would take time to restore a balance in our trade.  It was declared frequently, and well known, that we would be in a very favourable position relating to our trade balances by the autumn of 1957.  Already there has been a recovery in our trade balance as a result of a positive policy embarked upon, in spite of unpopularity, by the Minister for Finance in 1956.  It was well known that that positive policy was going to create hardships, and it did create hardships for many people, but we had to make a decision where we had to ask the nation to bear the hardships.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has frequently spoken about a balanced Budget.  He seems to consider that a balanced Budget is paramount, regardless of the advantages and amenities which a small percentage of unbalance might produce <Col N="764" /> nationally in the matter of progress, and in the matter of a better standard of living.  I would say to the Taoiseach that it is far more important to have a balanced economy than a balanced Budget.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has not announced any policy which would discourage, or cause a discontinuance of the emigration which is taking place.  We know that 500,000 people left the country during the 20 years when Fianna Fáil was in office.  The problem is there and the Taoiseach has not announced any policy, as far as I can see, that is going to stop emigration, or that is going to encourage our young people to stay at home.  We have had a Commission on Emigration which has issued its Report.  No action has been taken on its recommendations.  It was an extensive Report and it will take time to study it, but I do not think the Taoiseach even referred to that Report, or to any action which his Party proposes to take to relieve emigration.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there was great play prior to the general election, not alone on emigration, but on unemployment.  We had a situation last winter where we had a very high unemployment figure. Of course, it was very much better than the 146,000 unemployed who were registered at one time when the Fianna Fáil Party were in office.  The Taoiseach has mentioned that nearly 7,000 people more were on the register at this time last year than now.  Again, he made no reference to a policy which is going to bring about an improvement in unemployment. I think it is only fair to say that the unemployment problem next winter is going to be greater than it was last winter, when the Fianna Fáil Party took advantage of a very serious situation then existing.  What advantage do they expect to get out of the unemployment situation when it will be worse next winter?</P>
    <P>I may be asked why I say there is going to be more unemployment next winter than there was last winter.  I shall make it clear by referring back to 1952 when a drastic reduction in food subsidies took place.  Following that, a very substantial increase took place in the number of registered unemployed and, on this occasion, when <Col N="765" /> the remainder of the food subsidies have been abolished, we can take it that those engaged in trade, and providing employment, will be obliged to effect economies which will increase the number of persons who will be registered as unemployed.  Again, we have not heard from the Fianna Fáil Party any policy which is going to provide worthwhile employment, or give a week's wages to thousands of people who will be faced with this problem next winter.</P>
    <P>Before the general election Fianna Fáil had big headlines referring to what they were to do for the building industry.  They mentioned millions of pounds which they were to make available to it.  Again, apart from the alteration in relation to regulations covering the issue of small dwellings loans, no positive action has been taken by the Fianna Fáil Party which will stimulate the building industry.  Examine the figures of persons unemployed in the building industry, last year and the year before, compare them with the figures unemployed in the building industry now and it will be obvious that the Fianna Fáil Party have not made conditions favourable for the building industry, which might be regarded as an encouragement to it.  In fact, no stimulation has taken place in the building industry.</P>
    <P>The law of supply and demand exists in the building industry in addition to the financial problems which present themselves, not alone to the building contractor, but to the persons who will eventually occupy the dwellings which will be built.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Loughman speak about our markets on the Continent, particularly in relation to live stock. He quoted one Deputy as saying our exports of live stock to the Continent had increased by 800 per cent.  Anybody who examines the figures will find that 90 per cent. of our live stock exports are going to Great Britain.  What Deputy Loughman was referring to was the remaining 10 per cent., which was 800 per cent. higher than a certain year which was taken for comparison.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see there is a change of mind in the Fianna Fáil Party as far as the British market is concerned.  We <Col N="766" /> heard them before saying: &ldquo;Thank God the British market is gone and gone for ever.&rdquo;  We have heard a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party say that it took 100 years to build up the British market and it would not take 100 days to bring it down.  We remember the efforts that were made to destroy the live-stock trade of this country during the years of the economic war.</P>

      <P>At the request of the Chair, I intend to be as brief as I can. Deputy Childers referred to the house-building campaign started in 1932, as if there was no building done before that.  Deputy Childers is old enough to know the difficulties which confronted the Cumann na nGaedheal Government prior to the year 1932, when the country was reduced to a shambles.  It was necessary to build many houses after 1932 when the whole housing programme began.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Childers had an opportunity of making an explanation to the House in his speech it is strange that he did not take up the challenge which was put to him recently, to explain and to give details of the £200,000,000 which he said was wasted mainly during the years of the Coalition.  Apparently he was afraid to put all the responsibility on the Coalition for the wasting of the £200,000,000.  It is up to Deputy Childers, since he has got the challenge, to stand up and let us have the figures and let us know what expenditure he considers should not have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over £100,000,000 was spent on housing. That is a fair proportion of the £200,000,000 to which Deputy Childers has referred.  We can fairly ask him did he not approve of the housing campaign pursued in the post-war years.  He told us here&mdash;he did not <Col N="767" /> give the quotation&mdash;that prominent members of the inter-Party Government had said that it was not important to pay attention to the matters on which finance would be expended. Again he should have given us the quotation instead of throwing in an allegation of that kind without trying to substantiate it.  He does not expect any person seriously to accept a statement of that nature in relation to the finances of the State.  If we are to talk about irresponsible expenditure, let us remember that Deputy Childers and his Party spent £26,000,000 from July, 1951, to January, 1952.  That information was obtained by parliamentary question in the House.  We were given the facts, the figures and the dates. The figure amounted to £26,000,000 of the Marshall Aid money, which the inter-Party Government had not yet spent, Marshall Aid money which they had been spending at the rate of about £4,000,000 per year in connection with the land project.</P>
    <P>When the Budget of 1952 was introduced the nation was told that the subsidies were being withdrawn because of a trade deficit of £63,000,000. Anybody who looks up the records will see that £49,000,000 of that imbalance took place between June, 1951, when the Fianna Fáil Party took office and March of the following year.  Anybody who will analyse the figures from March, 1951, to March, 1952 will find that £49,000,000 of that was incurred during the period when the Fianna Fáil Party was in office.  I hope that is the last we will hear about the 1951-52 trade deficit of £63,000,000 so far as Fianna Fáil is concerned.  Not alone had we the £63,000,000 trade deficit during that year, but £26,000,000 disappeared into thin air from July to January of that year.</P>

They have had time to think it over and they know now that it would not have been a proper project to embark upon.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in relation to our public transport, we find the Fianna Fáil Party trying to change the policy in a very drastic way which will have very serious repercussions not alone on the services but on the economy in general.  I hope when the Taoiseach is replying that he will give us something different from what he has been giving us for the last 20 years which has left us with the problems with which we are trying to deal to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Dáil is now about to adjourn for a period of almost four months, it is not unfair that we should have a very clear statement from the Taoiseach when he is replying to the debate as to what the Government policy is on emigration and unemployment. There is an old saying: &ldquo;The more they change, the more they remain the same.&rdquo;  That saying has a great deal of truth in it when it is applied to the Irish political field over the past 35 or 37 years.  No matter what Government we had in power it made very little difference to the community and it took very little effect as <Col N="769" /> regards that section of our population which has to emigrate.</P>
      <P>In his remarks to-day, Deputy Desmond suggested that he saw very little difference between Fianna Fáil's approach and that of the inter-Party Government on the matter of curing the ills that beset the country.  I confess to full agreement with him in his remarks in that regard.  It was not in the last 12 months I made up my mind that it makes little difference at the present time whether we have an inter-Party Government or a Fianna Fáil Government in office.  I honestly tried to ascertain a fundamental difference in approach between the two groups to the major ills that beset the country. I have failed to ascertain any such difference.</P>
      <P>I believe that, in so far as democracy is concerned, it will never work successfully where the Parties involved show no fundamental difference in their approach to problems.  If there is not a fundamental difference, the only conclusion we can come to is that power is to be achieved by one or other group on the basis of which can bid the higher or which can suggest even a slightly different approach, thus swinging floating votes.  That see-saw arrangement has been in operation here for a number of years. I believe that the experiment in 1948 of an inter-Party Government was a desirable and necessary one.  It cleared up one important matter&mdash; that the country could at least be governed, perhaps not terribly efficiently, by people other than those in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say that in any sense of personal criticism of the members of that Party.  After 16 years of office, it had become apparent that the members of Fianna Fáil had begun to believe that they, and they alone, had the right, the gift and the necessary intelligence to run or guide the country. I believe that 1948 will be a significant year in that respect.  I had hoped that as a result of that three years' experiment the Irish people had reached such a stage of political maturity that we would have to-day a cleaner and a clearer division in this <Col N="770" /> House on major issues, that we would have a position where a man could come in here and say he believed the approach to certain problems should be on the basis of the State taking unto itself the responsibility and the charge of providing as far as is humanly possible, the means of livelihood within the State for those who wished to stay in it, that group to which he belonged would close ranks and issue a policy to the Irish people, that there would not be the <i>laissez-faire</i> policy that it was no duty of the State or Government to provide employment or even the necessary incentives that would lead to employment for the community.</P>
    <P>So far, that position has eluded the Irish people and I regard that as eliminating any chance there was that in the next few years a radical change would take place.  Inside the Government Party at the moment we seem to have very conflicting views with regard to what line of approach should be made.  That is why it is essential now, before the Dáil rises, that we know whether the Government have decided upon a definite policy or whether they are still at the stage of deciding among themselves whether they will adopt the approach as enunciated by the Minister for Lands, Deputy Childers.</P>
    <P>We want to know whether they are prepared, on the other hand, to accept the approach announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when opening his Estimate.  The Minister for Lands is a man of intelligence, a man who could not be accused of being unable to express clearly his views and thoughts.  When the Minister for Lands goes down the country, when he goes to the trouble of preparing the speech he hopes to deliver and handling to the Press a copy of it, surely he will stand over it and will not be pressurised within a week or ten days into coming into this House, as he did a few hours ago, and retracting it.</P>
    <P>I refer to the speech made by the Minister for Lands in Kilbeggan and reported in the <i>Westmeath Independent</i> on June 29th, 1957.  The <i>Westmeath Independent</i> is a weekly paper.  I do not think it can be criticised on the basis that it would be prejudiced <Col N="771" /> against the Minister for Lands.  The opening remarks of the Minister, as reported in that newspaper, were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government has set its course resolutely to kill the idea that a Government could end emigration by spending money to give employment. It could provide some with employment but never solve the problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All I want to know is whether that statement is an expression of the viewpoint and policy of the Government as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we now reached the position where this Government will not take responsibility for solving the problem of unemployment?  Can we take it that the speech of the Minister for Lands means that the solution of the unemployment problem is not the Government's responsibility?  If that is so, I want to know whose responsibility it is to solve this national ill that has beset this country since the State was established.  That is the reason I am asking for a statement from the Taoiseach as to whether it is a Government line of approach that the solution of emigration is not the Government's responsibility and that the Government, in the words of the Minister for Lands, &ldquo;could never solve the problem.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not for a moment suggest that the members of the Government are not entitled to their views, but I suggest they are not entitled to hold portfolios in any Cabinet in view of the fact that, prior to the election, they criticised the previous Government for the extraordinarily heavy stream of emigration that took place during its régime.  They were entitled to level that criticism at the inter-Party Government but in doing so I feel they had a responsibility to the public to ensure, if returned to office, they would not alone reduce the rate of emigration but would consider it as part of major Government policy to stop the stream of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands cannot be accused of being unable to express <Col N="772" /> himself clearly; either he was speaking on his own behalf in Westmeath or else he was speaking on behalf of the Government.  I think it is the duty of the Taoiseach to say one way or the other whether the Minister for Lands was speaking on behalf of the Government or on his own behalf as a Deputy. I would feel very perturbed if I thought the Government would accept his point of view.</P>
    <P>There are other quotations I could give from the Minister's speech but they have been dealt with by other Deputies and I do not propose to go into them except to say that when the Minister for Lands finds that far too much money, as he said, was being spent this year on non-productive services and that nearly as much was being spent as in 1953 as a proportion of Government expenditure on these non-productive services, may we take it that Government policy on the matters specifically mentioned by the Minister, housing and hospitalisation, is that these matters will receive the most careful scrutiny of the Government and that any future housing programme will be framed on the basis that far too much money has been spent on such social schemes in the past, and that drastic reductions will have to be made in the housing construction campaign?</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to ask the Taoiseach whether the Minister for Lands spoke on his own behalf or on behalf of the Government when he said millions have been wasted in the vain hope that the building of houses and hospitals would keep the people at home. Deputy Loughman to-day made an impassioned plea that it was absolutely essential to continue building houses and I think he said if necessary we should build more houses than there are people to occupy them.  He said it was absolutely essential to provide houses if people were to found families and settle down here.  That is Deputy Loughman's view as opposed to what the Minister for Lands said.  I want to know who expresses Government policy with regard to housing and other matters&mdash;Deputy Childers or the Taoiseach?  Will one or other of them come into the House before this debate <Col N="773" /> ends and explain what exactly their policy is?  For months to come we shall not have an opportunity of questioning the Government in this House. Four months is a long time and many things could happen in the meantime. Therefore, it is not unfair to request the information at this stage.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks the Taoiseach, in a skimpy way, dealt with the problems that face the Government, and said the Government believed that if the people faced up to the situation we would have happy homes for a much greater population.  He hoped, and the Government hoped, that the people would make up their minds through a combined effort to get rid of their present ills.  Can we take that as a statement of policy?  I have heard that for nine years since I came to the House and I am still waiting for any concrete, practical steps to be taken to give effect to what is expressed in that pious statement, or, I should say, repetition by the Taoiseach, of a statement he made years ago.  The Taoiseach may hope these things will happen but I suggest hope alone is not sufficient, that it is a poor substitute for policy and is little encouragement or solace to those on the unemployment register or on the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>Last year the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, opened the discussion on this Estimate with the statement: &ldquo;To-day, emigration is our greatest challenge.&rdquo;  At least Deputy Costello had been prodded into the position that he had to admit, due to the census returns, that emigration had reached such alarming figures that it was necessary for him to make it the key-point in his discussion here.  In spite of the fact that quite a considerable amount of time was spent discussing this evil of emigration, nothing really practical emerged and I say&mdash;and I think Deputies on all sides will have to agree&mdash;that the present Taoiseach could well have made it the theme of his introductory remarks on this Estimate because it is just as important and just as alarming to-day and just as saddening as it was 12 months ago.  We have received no plan, no concrete proposals, to end it and no term has been specified within which we will be <Col N="774" /> able to deal with it.  Instead, we have had to listen in this debate to crack-pot experts who tell us that many of our emigrants go because the Celt is restless and wants to adventure abroad, and that many more go who need not go.  That type of statement is made by crack-pot experts, both lay and clerical, inside the House so far as the lay ones are concerned, and outside in the case of the clerical ones.</P>
    <P>I think it a tragedy that such a statement should be made when we know that 95 per cent. of the people who leave this country do so for economic reasons.  For every individual who emigrates and leaves a job here and who need not leave, another nine go because they must go to get work.  Deputies here say that the rate of unemployment is decreasing at the moment.  Every year at this time, from February onwards, the number of unemployed decreases.  Is it suggested that is due to Government policy, or is it due to the fact that, from springtime on, there is occasional or periodic work available for a limited number?</P>
    <P>Are those who get this limited employment in the springtime, and perhaps in the summer or in the harvest expected to stay on loyally here for the couple of months' work they get in a year and found a family, as Deputy Loughman suggests?  Surely very few people who are leaving this country to-day have what is known as security. The man who is employed for three or four months in the year has no sense of security.  He has no sense of continuity of employment.  In my experience, I have always found that it is the most courageous and those who are most anxious for work who leave the country in order to achieve for themselves elsewhere that sense of security.</P>
    <P>So long as we base any employment system on this three months' work and nine months on the dole philosophy, so long are we refusing to deal with the problem as we should.  Not alone are we not dealing with it but we are helping to foment or develop a serious illness, a psychological illness if you like, in so far as our people are concerned because we are instilling into the minds of the young men, who are <Col N="775" /> reaching the time when they should have work, the idea: &ldquo;I will only get three months' work this year.  I will be knocked off then.  Why should I bother to work during that three months?  I will take it easy.&rdquo;  In other words, the feeling of moral responsibility is being undermined year after year.  The feeling of duty towards the nation is disappearing. Likewise, respect for work <i>qua</i> work is beginning to go.  I do not suggest that a remedy can be found or that a plan can be put into operation overnight, but I do suggest that this House should be presented with concrete proposals which will have the result of demonstrating that in five years' time the problem will not be one of such serious dimensions and will not present the same serious symptoms as it does to-day.</P>
    <P>It can hardly be regarded as a digression if I mention Westland Row when I talk of emigration.  Mention of Westland Row will, I think, bring home to this House where this problem of emigration stands in the minds of those who provide our transport system.  Deputies have only to go as far as Westland Row station and they will see there over the platform a huge, and significant, signboard: &ldquo;Departure for Holyhead and the West of Ireland.&rdquo; Once you cross the Shannon, it is obviously anticipated that the only place you are going is Holyhead: you are on your way out.  That is all an Irish Government has to offer to its people after 35 years.  I could talk at length about the Taoiseach's remarks anent our resuming the onward march of the nation, and so forth, but I shall refrain from indulging in that type of debate.</P>
    <P>The Budget has been discussed here. So, too, have its likely effects on unemployment and emigration been dealt with by other speakers.  There are one or two points I would like to make now.  Over the last couple of years the British Government have found it necessary to take steps to deal with a certain situation arising there. It was found that there were not enough workers available for certain lines of industrial development.  It was found that in certain lines there were <Col N="776" /> too many workers available.  In order to channel off workers into certain important industrial development the British Government put on a credit squeeze.  They restricted credit for expansion along certain lines which they felt were undesirable.  Britain was suffering from over-employment.  John Bull was suffering from obesity.  The necessary steps to tighten credit were taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, acting on behalf of the British Government.</P>
    <P>In the same period certain developments took place here, developments with which the Government had to deal.  A question arose as to our balance of payments and as to our importing too many luxury goods for which we were not able to pay.  What happened?  While we were dealing with the question of importing too many luxury goods we were also faced with the problem that we were exporting our people, that we had one of the highest rates of unemployment in any democratic country to-day and that our rate of emigration was fantastic.  This Government adopted exactly the same remedy to deal with the illness here as that adopted to deal with a particular illness in Britain, an illness with which this country had no comparison.</P>
    <P>A restriction of credit took place at a time when there should have been a freeing of credit so that essential works would be given the finance to expand and thereby increase employment. Instead of that, we had a restriction of credit here.  The remedy that was applied to deal with John Bull's obesity in Britain was applied here to cure Cathleen Ní Houlihan's malnutrition. But the situation is even worse than that.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions here I have put down questions in connection with our financial position.  I have asked time and again whether the Government proposes to take the necessary steps to ensure that the issue of credit and the control of interest rates will lie in the hands of the State.  I have been told that that is a matter for private enterprise and for the commercial banks.  In Britain a decision to curb expenditure, to control credit and rates of interest is <Col N="777" /> taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on behalf of his Government. If there is a change of interest rates in Britain that change is announced in the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and it is his sole function.  If there is a change here that change is made by the commercial banks and the Irish Government is politely informed that the banks have so decided.</P>
    <P>Is it unfair to suggest, faced as we are here with the task of trying to solve unemployment, emigration, and of securing an expansion in our industrial potential and increased agricultural output, that such control should not lie in the hands of the commercial banks?  Is it unfair to suggest that such control should lie solely in the hands of the Government? I do not blame the commercial banks. I am not suggesting they are doing something they should not do.  Their sole and main responsibility is to those who invest their money in them.  Their first duty is to ensure that those moneys are safely invested.  I think nevertheless that at this stage the Government has a responsibility to ensure that that money is invested for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>That brings me to what is one of the most important points of all&mdash;the question of how we are to get the necessary money for capital development.  I have heard it said by Deputies, by spokesmen of the Government and spokesmen of the Opposition, that to a great extent we must depend on savings in order to meet our capital development programme.  If Ireland, which is an undeveloped country, has to depend on the savings of its people to finance a capital development project that is so essential if we are to get rid of unemployment, we will have a long wait.  It is very difficult to expect a man who is suffering from a serious illness and who is not being fed to get up and do a hard day's work.  It is very difficult to expect an undeveloped country suffering from the ills from which Ireland is suffering to provide the necessary capital from savings in order that desirable expansion programmes may be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with the creation of credit or with a Government having <Col N="778" /> the necessary powers to ensure availability of credit that will enable them to embark on programmes that will bring wealth to the country in the future and will provide employment immediately.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Opposition have asked time and again through the Press, through publicity campaigns, through savings committees, for more savings.  People are exhorted to save and are told that every shilling they save will help to put other people into employment.  A savings programme would really mean something if the people felt that Irish money, which is at present being invested outside this country, would be brought home and invested here.  There is very little use in asking the ordinary man to save his £1 a month in order to help Irish industry or Irish agriculture if he finds that the Government agencies, the Central Bank and the commercial banks are the first to trot outside this country to invest Irish money in foreign securities.  It may be suggested that a certain amount of foreign investment is necessary to meet our requirements but I do not think we are facing realities at the present time, or have been over the years, with regard to the amount of Irish money that is invested abroad, especially by Government agencies and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I think I am entitled at this stage to advocate amending legislation in connection with the Central Bank.  If the Government are really serious in getting down to brass tacks in connection with the expansion of agriculture, forestry, fishing and other major matters, they must take the necessary steps to amend the Central Bank Act.</P>
    <P>In the last 35 years over 750,000 people left this country.  They left under Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Governments.  We all have that responsibility.  Emigration is still going on at as great a rate as ever.  It is tragic that there should be competition in the House to suggest that more emigrated under such and such a régime than under another régime.  Let us accept that the people left this country under all Irish Governments since freedom was achieved here 37 <Col N="779" /> years ago and that no real solution has been put into operation, that none of the Parties who had the responsibility of office produced a policy that stemmed the stream of emigration.</P>
    <P>While that stream of emigration was flowing, there was a stream coming into the country.  I have referred time and again to the stream of non-nationals who came in here, especially since 1946, and purchased property and land in this country at a time when an Irish Government should have been watching carefully and jealously guarding the interests of the Irish people who had to take the boat out while these gentlemen came in by plane. To-day we have monopolies and cartels, with their headquarters outside this State, controlling interests that should be the responsibility of the State. To-day we have outside interests controlling the very bread of every individual in this country.  To-day we have over 150,000 acres of the finest land in Ireland in the hands of non-nationals.</P>
    <P>Only last week the Taoiseach appointed a new Minister for the Gaeltacht to preserve the Irish language.  There is one part of the Gaeltacht I know and I challenge any Deputy who thinks he knows it better than I do, that is, the Connemara Gaeltacht.  In that district every first-class property, the best shooting rights and the best fishing rights are to-day in the hands of non-nationals.  That is the place where the Taoiseach wants to preserve the Irish language.  Perhaps it is necessary to have a nation of gillies and maids to attend to the needs of these imported gentry who have taken over the land and property from which they fled 35 or 37 years ago.  They are back again and, while they are re-establishing themselves, the Taoiseach hopes to save the Irish language.  Possibly they may become more Irish than the Irish themselves.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House with my views on profits, on the incentives that should be provided for expansion.  I leave that with the hope that the Taoiseach will give the Government's views and policy on how they propose to deal with emigration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> The only other important matter I want to deal with is the question of Partition.  On a number of occasions I have implored the Taoiseach&mdash;Deputy Costello, when he was Taoiseach, and Deputy de Valera who is now Taoiseach&mdash;to adopt some practical constitutional means towards solving Partition.  I have challenged both of them in this House, time and again, to produce even one suggestion that they might pursue relentlessly in the hope that it would help.  I have failed in that regard.  I have failed to extract from either a policy, or even the germ of a policy, that would give us all hope that, within a specified period, five, ten or 15 years, we could hope that both parts of Ireland would be reunited. It may be that the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition have to admit that they have no policy.  If that is the case surely it is their duty not to sneer at or belittle proposals that are put before them, which in the humble opinion of those who put the proposals, would definitely in a period of years help to solve the Border question.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in this House that Dáil Éireann should be opened to the elected representatives from the Six-County area.  That matter has been discussed on a number of occasions and it was turned down by the Taoiseach himself.  The reasons put forward why the Dáil should be open to these representatives were strong ones.  The arguments were good.  They were so good that even the former Minister for Defence, Deputy MacEoin, suggested that the motion at the time should be agreed to.</P>
    <P>What I do not like, what the public do not like, and what the youth resent to-day, is the fact that when the motion was turned down no concrete reasons were given by the Taoiseach as to why it was turned down.  We had an airy statement that this had been thought of before but it was felt it would be unwise to open the Dáil.  We were never given the reasons, in this House or outside it, why it was felt to be unwise. It is not unfair for me to suggest at this stage that we should have the reasons now as to why it was felt to be unwise to open Dáil Éireann to <Col N="781" /> elected representatives from the Six-County area.  The only point that was reiterated, time and time again, by the spokesmen in this House who objected to allowing the Six-County representatives to sit here, was that it would cause jealousy in the House amongst the political Parties, that representatives from the Six-County area would have representation without responsibility, that they might vote on a Budget or a financial measure and thus be in a position to impose taxation on the residents of the Twenty-Six County area, while at the same time they would have no responsibility to face the public afterwards.</P>
    <P>Is that not a flimsy argument to put up against opening the Dáil to them? Surely the people of the Six-County area, and surely the Deputies of this House have a bigger outlook than that, that they would be prepared to condone and help to keep the Border there on the basis that, if these people were allowed in, they would cause jealously amongst the political Parties, and help to sway the political fortunes of one Party or another?  I ask the Government now to reconsider the decision taken in that regard, and to think over it in the next few months.  Let one of the steps to be considered and brought before this House be the possibility of opening Dáil Éireann to the elected representatives from occupied Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential, at the present time, that a lead on constitutional lines be given by the Government on the question of Partition.  The sands of time are running out.  Personally I do not think it is too late yet for the Government to control, to lead and guide the public spirit which is growing up daily on this problem of putting an end to the injustice of Partition in the shortest possible time. It would be much more desirable for the Government to give the lead, and for this matter to be dealt with on a constitutional basis, rather than have other steps taken which the Minister and the members of this House know are likely to be taken in the not so distant future.</P>
    <P>The Government must remember that four Deputies were selected by the people of this country on the basis <Col N="782" /> that they would not take their seats here in Dáil Éireann.  It takes a lot of organisation and a lot of votes to elect four Deputies.  In my opinion the election of those four Deputies was meant as a warning to this institution. In my opinion their being elected on that basis was a direct criticism of the lack of action on constitutional lines by the members of this House towards solving Partition.</P>
    <P>I, for one, believe that everyone who goes before the people of Ireland to be elected should accept and take his seat in this House.  I hope the day is not far off when the four Deputies will take their seats.  I want to bring it home clearly that if the candidates for that particular political Party were to go forward, on the basis of taking their seats in this House, it is not four Deputies who would be elected but every candidate that went forward.  I do not blame the youth of to-day for being disillusioned or being cynical in connection with this House.  The young men of to-day who have been reared on the history of Irish heroism in the battles won by Irishmen from the time they used the pike up to 1922, when they used more modern weapons, believe that no inch of freedom was squeezed out of Britain for Ireland except through force.  The men who occupy the front benches to-day in both political Parties played a most important part through use of force, and through their belief in the use of force, in achieving the measure of freedom which we have here to-day.</P>
    <P>Is it suggested by the occupants of the front benches, both Government and Opposition, that the young men&mdash; some of whom are sons of the men who occupy these benches, or relations of them&mdash;is it suggested by the men who occupy these benches, who have the admiration of the public in their physical capacity as ex-soldiers, that these young men are criminals if they adopt the line of approach that their fathers and older generations took towards achieving the freedom of this country?  The position has to be brought home forcibly in this House and it is no good for men who 30 years ago resorted to the gun and who felt the gun was the only way to achieve <Col N="783" /> Irish freedom, to tell the youth to-day that it is a crime to use the gun.  I say to Deputies here and to the young men outside that the question of Partition can be solved by constitutional means and that if the generations who are on the front benches of this House who used force 35 or 40 years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out the first step that could be taken, namely, the reopening of Dáil Éireann to the elected representatives of occupied Ireland.  That is a step that should be taken.  There is no use in saying that the difficulties are insurmountable. If we do not take that step we in this House are leaving ourselves wide open to the construction on the international plane that we do not really believe the Six Counties could come back with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> Ireland is a member to-day of the United Nations Assembly.  We have an excellent permanent representative there to bring our various points before that assembly.  When Deputy Costello, as Taoiseach, announced here that we were members of the United Nations I specifically pointed out in the House that the main functions of our representative should be to bring home to the members of the United Nations the problem of Partition and that no opportunity should be lost by our representative in ensuring that Partition was argued and brought home fully to all those who would be sympathetic towards solving the problem.</P>
    <P>The then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, stated that we had no intention of becoming a sore thumb in the United Nations.  The only interpretation I could take from that statement was that our representative would be very diplomatic in all his dealings with the various nations who are members of that assembly and it was only when it would not be embarrassing to certain nations that this question might be raised.  I reiterate that we must become a sore thumb, that we must become a pain in the neck in the United Nations, as far as Britain is concerned, until we bring home forcibly that we are serious about ending Partition.</P>
    <P>I had intended on the debate yesterday, only I had not an opportunity of doing so, putting another point on a constitutional basis to the Minister for External Affairs but it applies with greater force when I mention it on the Taoiseach's Estimate.  For some time past in connection with a small State, Kashmir in India, and to-day as far as Germany is concerned, we have pleas that there should be a plebiscite as to whether reunification of those territories should take place.  I note with pleasure that the Minister for External Affairs remarked yesterday in connection with the scheme for the reunification of Germany, namely by a plebiscite, that he hoped the time would not be far distant when similar steps would be taken in regard to Ireland.  In speaking about Germany he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope that will come about and I hope that it will also apply to <Col N="785" /> Ireland.  The German nation as a unit was only established 100 years ago.  Our nation was very much older than that as a single unit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again we must get out of the realms of hope in this connection.  We had the word &ldquo;hope&rdquo; used by the Taoiseach in connection with the economic conditions of the country, a hope expressed that things would improve and that people would come together and work in the interests of the nation.  We will have to do more than hope in regard to getting a plebiscite for all Ireland in connection with reunification.  It was in that connection, and leading up to that suggestion of a plebiscite, that I raised the question with the Taoiseach some weeks ago as to whether he would earnestly consider attending the United Nations meeting himself in order to put Ireland's case on Partition.  I now appeal to the Taoiseach to go himself to that assembly to put Ireland's case before its members and to use his own prestige and his own knowledge of other countries and their representatives in order to get backing for a plebiscite for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not, as I have said before, criticise in the slightest degree the actions or statements made by our permanent representative to the United Nations.  I do not want to belittle in any way the work he has done, but I do suggest the problem of Partition is of such paramount importance that it is not unfair to urge that the leader of the State should be the prime mover in getting the co-operation that would be essential if we are to succeed in having a plebiscite for the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is a practical suggestion, and if Deputy Haughey is interested in practical suggestions I hope he will back it and urge at his Party meetings that the Taoiseach attend the next meeting of the United Nations and do his utmost to rally with him the support of all freedom-loving nations to ensure that Ireland will get the very same treatment as Germany in respect of reunification.  I think the sands of time are running out.  This <Col N="786" /> may be the last chance this country will get of solving this problem.  There certainly will be no other chance for the inter-Party Government in so far as Partition is concerned.</P>
    <P>There were other points, mainly connected with the Offences Against the State Act, on which I had intended to speak but from which I shall now pass in favour of my main suggestion that an all-out effort be made to solve the Partition problem by constitutional means.  I feel sure the Government are as anxious as anybody else in the country to ensure that nothing will happen in the next two years to embitter still further Irishmen who are not at present very friendly towards the Government we have in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to have clarified is our position in connection with the recent legislation introduced in Belfast&mdash;the Parliamentary Election (Procedure) Bill.  The aim of that legislation is to preclude men with a national outlook from occupying seats in Stormont.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the Taoiseach has no responsibility for that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach told me in reply to a question on May 1st last that, under the Constitution of 1937, the national territory consisted of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and territorial seas.  The Taoiseach, therefore, must have responsibility for what is happening in that area.  I am going by the Taoiseach's reply to a parliamentary question.  I simply want to bring to the notice of the House that goodwill and friendliness are wearing pretty thin as far as the Border is concerned. The young people down here are losing patience.  They seem to be prepared to resort to the use of physical force.  They are gaining support from others because the political Parties are offering no alternative means of solving the problem of Partition. If we do not want this matter to come to a head, the Government must take steps within the next six months to obtain a constitutional solution. <Col N="787" /> While the Taoiseach enjoys such an overwhelming majority, it is only right that he should take the last step necessary during his term of office to achieve the reunification of Ireland. This is the last opportunity he will get of doing that and I hope he takes full advantage of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been in the House very many months, but I must say that what has struck me very forcibly is that 75 per cent. of the time I have spent here has been occupied in listening to the same speeches by more or less the same Deputies.  I wonder what they hope to achieve by these speeches?  If I direct my remarks to what I have heard from the Opposition Benches in a general way, the impression I get is that they really believe the people of this country were deluded by false promises into returning Fianna Fáil as a Government and that if they had the chance now the decision would be reversed.</P>
      <P>Rightly or wrongly, I do not subscribe to that view.  In my constituency the election was fought, in the main, on the issue of whether we should have a one-Party or an inter-Party Government. I think it is fair to assume that the people favoured the one-Party Government idea and accordingly elected Fianna Fáil.  It cannot be said that this is a new Party of which the people had no past experience.  What happened was that the people were dissatisfied with the form of Government they had and reverted to Government by a Party whose form of administration they understood tolerably well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any reasonable person believes that the people would change their decision if given the opportunity now.  They would at least give the Party they elected a chance of putting their policy into operation. We hear a lot about false promises. Surely promises made at an election are given in good faith?  The people who make them must wait until they get in to see what resources are at their disposal, what money is there, before they proceed to implement those promises.  When you make an election <Col N="788" /> promise you do not intend that the promise can be fulfilled within a month, two months or perhaps even a year. Maybe that seems a strange remark, but I cannot see how a complete reversal, a complete change, can be wrought in the course of a month or two or even a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in five years' time I might find it harder to defend the Fianna Fáil Government if things have not changed a bit for the better by then.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to Deputy McQuillan's reference to the youth of the country.  I cannot possibly allow him to get away with the idea that all the youth of the country are in one political Party.  All Parties have a percentage of the youth of the country.  In the main, the youth of the country, particularly those who belong to political Parties, are anxious to see the problem of Partition solved.  They know there is no easy solution.  The suggestions made by the previous speaker as to what he thought could be done constitutionally are worth inquiring into but to suggest that there is any analogy between the position now and what it was 37 years ago or thereabouts, while the guns were being used, is completely false.  To my mind these statements do much more harm than good and retard the solution of the Partition problem considerably.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Taoiseach, his Department and the Government to a tendency which I think has been growing here for a number of years in the attitude of the central authority to local authorities.  I think there has been a taking away of the rights of the local authorities and their responsibility for administration and a tendency to use local authorities more and more as tax gatherers.  If I may illustrate the point by a few examples, in Cork City, which is my constituency, when we want permission to build working class dwellings we must send the schemes before the Department in spite of the fact that we have already built some thousands of such houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> When the schemes go up there is a certain delay, sometimes months, but it has been known to be years.  The plans are sent back with very small alterations and they must be redrafted and sent again to the Department notwithstanding the fact that we employ a very competent staff of architects, engineers and town planners.  They should be competent, considering the salaries they command, to build such houses and they have already built from 2,000 to 3,000 houses in the area.  I cannot understand why the houses should not be classified into A, B and C groups, according to the number of rooms, so that we could send up for permission to build say, 100 No. 3 Class houses as we did before, and they could say: &ldquo;All right, go ahead and do it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A few years ago, the then Minister for Local Government came down and met the members of the Cork Council and assured them that he wanted to restore as much authority to the council as possible.  I think he was sincere, but I am sure it was not three months afterwards when we had occasion to request permission to erect traffic lights at a certain very bad crossing in Cork City.  We had to ask permission and I wonder why. Permission was refused and we were given a variety of reasons by the Department why it was not advisable to have traffic lights there.  We were not satisfied, and sent a further request and after a delay of some 18 months or two years we eventually got permission but were told that we could not expect the usual grant.  In the meantime, the delay of two years meant that the cost of the lights had increased considerably.  What did anyone gain by that procedure?  The lights are now erected and working very satisfactorily and I cannot see why the central authority tried to impose its will on the local authority.</P>
    <P>I now come to another very contentious point in Cork at the moment&mdash;Cork Airport.  I think the necessity for Cork Airport is accepted by both the present and the former Governments, but why can we not be told exactly why it is not possible to get on with the erection of the airport?  I feel that the central Government regards local authorities <Col N="790" /> as small boys and puts them off with any kind of an excuse.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to change that tendency by every means in his power so that local authorities will at least be treated as adults.  If the reason for delay is shortage of money, that is something that most of us respect and suspect.  If that is so, why not say so?  Is it any crime to be short of money when you want to get something done?  It is certainly not as frustrating to local authorities as being held up, wondering, writing letters and getting no reply.  That is not the kind of administration that invites any decent intelligent young person to enter public life, and it certainly does not help local officials, engineers and architects to do their best for the community.</P>
    <P>That is a trend which I find from my own experience countries in Europe outside the Iron Curtain have been making every endeavour to reverse for the last six or seven years.  They want more autonomy for local authorities but here we seem to be going in the other direction with the central Government taking more and more power.  We know that when the local authority strikes a rate nowadays one-third of it is absolutely mandatory.  We have to collect taxes for the State.  It may be impossible to eradicate that position entirely, but the wrong tendency is growing and I would appeal to the Taoiseach to see if it can be arrested and the position reversed so as to give more power to local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to express my appreciation of the fact that the Taoiseach continued the practice initiated some years ago of making a survey on the Estimate for his Department of the economic and financial position of the country and the relationship between general Government policy and the results achieved.  I appreciate his action all the more because I know the difficulty of doing so and also because of the fact that it was, of course, quite impossible for very many reasons to give any clear indication of what general Government policy is or as to what its results may be in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> Towards the close of his remarks the Taoiseach made some few observations and to them I hope to devote the greater part of the speech I have to make on this Estimate to-day.  The Taoiseach said he hoped that the people would make up their minds to a continued national effort so that we might overcome our present difficulties. He said these difficulties are by no means insuperable and that if we can get our people back to that intense love of country so evident here some years ago it would help us in that national effort.</P>
    <P>It is some satisfaction to us to know that the Taoiseach, and his colleagues I presume, realise that there are difficulties, economic and financial, not to speak of political difficulties, confronting this Government as they confronted the last Government, difficulties that will confront any Government faced with the task of carrying on the Government of a nation in the present modern, complex and difficult conditions.  We are human enough to remember the kind of propaganda that was carried on by members of the Party now forming the Government. We remember the effects that had, not so much on the political fortunes of the inter-Party Government or the Parties included in that Government, but on the economic and financial fabric of the nation.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that when this present Government do realise that the difficulties which confront them, and which have been lessened and eased by the work done by the inter-Party Government, are difficulties that would confront any Government they will be generous enough to pay tribute to the work done by their predecessors and they will then have done a good day's work for democracy and for the respect that is due to the democratic institutions of this country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made reference, as I have said, to an endeavour, which he hoped would be secured, to get our people back to that intense love of country which was so evident some years ago.  I rather thought that that statement of the Taoiseach carried the implication that our people now, <Col N="792" /> and particularly our young people, did not possess that intense love of their country, that outstanding patriotism, for which the Irish nation has been noted throughout the centuries in the same degree as was evident, to use his own expression, in the generations, I suppose, that preceded the establishment of this State.</P>
    <P>I think that the present generation of our people have as intense a love for their country and as deep a patriotism as any of the generations of young Irish men and women who worked, suffered and died to secure the freedom of the nation.  But the quality of that patriotism is different. Their aims and objectives are, as they ought to be, different from those of their predecessors.  I do think that one of the paramount problems facing us here to-day is to ensure that our young people are properly directed and guided and that their intense love of their country is channelled into proper courses to secure the well-being of the nation.</P>
    <P>If we have not reached the end of a chapter in Irish history, at least we are nearing the end.  You have only to look around you in this House and see that those people who bore the brunt of the effort to create the State, and subsequently to maintain it, are passing on. Those who are in touch with the young people to-day know that there does exist a kind of note of interrogation, nearly a spirit of disillusionment, and the future of this country will be determined by the way in which their efforts will be fashioned and the idealism that is latent in them will be brought into practical effect.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Healy that the young people to-day are not confined to any political Party, although I am glad to say that many of the young people are supporting my own Party. But I certainly repudiate the suggestion made by Deputy McQuillan, or implicit in his remarks to-day, that the entire of the patriotic effort of the country, all the idealism and all the patriotism, rests in a handful of people who are bringing national disaster upon the country by the use of arms. We have a duty.  We have a heavy task and a heavy responsibility to hand on the torch to the younger people who <Col N="793" /> must sit in the front and back benches of this Assembly in the future.  We have had perhaps too much politics, if I may put it that way, in the Dáil and too little outside it.  If there is disillusionment among the young people at the present moment, if they are searching for something to which to harness their patriotism and their enthusiastic effort, then the fault lies with us and the responsibility lies with us to ensure that they are given sufficient light and sufficient guidance to bring them away from paths which will lead to national catastrophe and put them to the hard and heavy tasks which true patriotism at the present moment requires.</P>
    <P>In this context I shall repeat a phrase that I have used on numerous occasions both in this House and outside it: What the country requires at the present time is not people to die for it but people to live and work for it. There is perhaps greater sacrifice sometimes involved in doing hard work and in making the necessary personal sacrifice to do the task that the national interest requires than there is, as there was in the past, in dying for Ireland.  It is our task to bring a realisation of that fact home to our young people, to make them appreciate that they have as high an ideal to aim for as ever our patriotic young people had in the past, in working and living for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach last night made a plea for harder work.  There is not, I suppose, much drama or glamour in hard work but there are greater results to be got from enthusiastic patriotic endeavour expressed through hard work in various directions and in different strata of society than there are by the efforts of those who cross the Border into the North, injure the national interest here and offend the moral law.  We have had unfortunately a spirit of pessimism in the country for some time past.</P>
    <P>I wish, so far as I can, to avoid topics of heated controversy and political dissension, but I think it is beyond controversy to say that in their endeavour to secure what they now have secured, namely, Government of this country, the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="794" /> damaged the economic fabric and the reputation of the country both at home and abroad.  Go back to the first period of our inter-Party Government when there were three brass balls, the insignia of the pawnbroker's trade, posted around the city and elsewhere, suggesting to the public that the inter-Party Government had pawned the finances and the resources of the country.  We had every effort made during the period of the last inter-Party Government to suggest that there was a crisis and that the country was burst and in bankruptcy.  That had such an effect that it did indeed lead Fianna Fáil back to Government, but it also had the deplorable effect of damaging the prestige and the credit of the country both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>This Government has undoubtedly to face many difficulties.  I indicated the policy which will be pursued by the Party to which I belong during the period of office of this Government on the occasion of their election.  I said that we would regard ourselves as a responsible Opposition, that it would be our task to seek always the national interest, and that we would endeavour to give constructive criticism and help to the present Government, realising always that it was essential to undo the damage that had been done, even though it had brought in its train our own political downfall.</P>
    <P>The present Government has difficulties. They are difficulties that any Government would have to face, but they are softened and rendered rather easier by the efforts which were made by the last Government, not caring for their own political future but realising that what had to be done had to be done and that, whatever political unpopularity might ensue, it had to be done in the national interest.  It is some gratification to us to know that people are beginning to realise now that what was done at that time was necessarily done and the present Government are reaping the benefit of it.</P>
    <P>I think it would be desirable that the young people should realise that every country in the world has its difficulties and that those difficulties, in the complex conditions of the modern world, <Col N="795" /> are changing every day and that, if there be, as I believe there is, a feeling in the country against our democratic institutions because of the fact that we as an inter-Party Government ran into those difficulties and had our setbacks, that there is something wrong with democratic institutions and something wrong with political Parties, it is the task of all Parties in the House and all leaders of opinion to bring a realisation of the facts and the difficulties of Government to the young people, to dissipate their disillusionment and to harness their patriotic endeavour away from the gun and into hard work and the real job that must be done for Ireland.</P>
    <P>We had the unfortunate experience which has been referred to by several speakers to-day&mdash;Deputy Desmond referred to it&mdash;that every little doubt, every little difficulty and every little setback, even minor difficulties and minor setbacks, that confronted the inter-Party Government before the real difficulties that emerged in 1956, were publicised and propagandised by the three newspapers supporting the Fianna Fáil Party and, indeed, suggestions that it was the inefficiency, the incompetence or the incapacity of the inter-Party Government to govern that was responsible for those difficulties. Headlines brought to the public notice every minor problem that arose.</P>
    <P>Of course, the only motive was to make political capital out of the then inter-Party Government's difficulties. This was done with complete disregard of the national interest and matters of the gravest danger were treated with the same irresponsibility as minor problems.  I think we can promise the present Government that they will not be subjected to the same treatment by us.  I endeavoured, so far as I could, inside and outside the Dáil, to bring home to our people the realisation of what had been achieved over the years, in spite of difficulties, since the establishment of this State and to try to dissipate the pessimism which was being engendered to the great detriment of the national interest.  What is required now it to replace that pessimism, which, as I say, has been <Col N="796" /> largely engendered for political purposes, by a confidence soberly based on an appreciation of realities.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words more, before I get on to more general topics, on the task that lies before us to lead and guide and stimulate the young people who are coming along and who are suffering from disillusionment.  We have had, perhaps, a reaction to the politics of the last two or three decades but, while we find that these young people outside are groping for some enthusiastic headline to which to harness their endeavours, it is desirable that they should be reminded, as the country as a whole should be reminded, of what has been achieved in the last 35 years and what is being achieved at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is much quiet work going on outside, work that has certainly given me confidence in the future of the country, work that has given me hope that the young people who are coming along do appreciate what has to be done and are not, as Deputy McQuillan would have the House believe, merely giving this Government or any other democratic Government in this State the last chance and then it will be the gun.</P>
    <P>Associations such as Macra na Feirme, the National Farmers' Association, the Country Women's Association, social study groups of various workers, colleges, cultural groups interested in music and drama and the arts &mdash;they are all doing quiet, effective, necessary and good national work and contributing at all levels to improve various aspects of Irish life.</P>
    <P>One of the matters that frequently depressed me was the official attitude towards cultural organisations and culture generally in the country.  Any expenditure on culture is officially regarded as non-essential expenditure. Cultural activity is as useful, indeed, as essential, as economic and financial activity for the well-being of the nation.  What we have to engender is the spreading of a true patriotic spirit of endeavour and sacrifice, forgetting the controversies of the past, looking to the future, realising that government of the country can be achieved in this country effectively by democratic <Col N="797" /> institutions and that there will be setbacks and difficulties facing any Government and that because each Government as it came along in this country added a quota to the well-being of the nation and had a record of at least some achievements to its credit, that because each year something was added by some Government to the well-being of the nation, it does not follow that the people have a right to expect that benefits must inevitably accrue from a change of Government.</P>
    <P>If we can bring to our young people the realisation that true patriotism now lies in working for Ireland, that democracy has in fact proved itself in this country and been a success, that we have a pretty good reputation abroad, that our name stands high and that it is an enthusiasm that should operate and act within them, then they will have something to rally around, something to dissipate their disillusionment and to encourage them to give effective service to the nation in future.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the remarks that Deputy McQuillan made to-day.  I doubt if they are worth giving him the credit of dealing with them or wasting time referring to them.  I do want to repudiate the suggestion that those people who are inflicting national injury on the country and moral damage to themselves by the use of force represent the young people of the country.  As I said before, I take encouragement from those groups of people whom I have been meeting, who are interested in social affairs, in social studies, who are interested in our international affairs and all those other people, at various levels, who are giving service, unselfish, unpaid service, to the State.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of meeting some young people at an interesting debate recently.  It was a great source of satisfaction to me to see these young people, men and women of the younger generation, able to debate amongst themselves upon the question as to whether or not we should join the Atlantic Pact.  There is hardly a Deputy in this House who would not be afraid to say what his precise opinion is on that question.  That, of <Col N="798" /> course, is pretty irrelevant but it was heartening to see these young people well informed, giving logical reasons for and against, in a debate on a matter of national importance in the affairs of this country, and coming to a conclusion adverse to that which the Government had arrived at before.</P>
    <P>Similarly there were other groups of young people whose meetings I have attended, who were showing interest in the science of Government and in the art of administration.  If we can direct their efforts into the proper channels, towards the proper objectives, then I think the future of the country is safe.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan passed some scathing remarks upon what I said in New York about the function of Ireland as a member of the United Nations&mdash; that as far as Partition is concerned we did not intend to be a sore thumb. That was the policy which I intended to carry out if I continued as Taoiseach. It was the policy which I believe was my colleagues' policy and that is the policy of my Party at the present time because it is realistic.  It is easy for Deputy McQuillan to get up, to rant and to talk about Partition and ask: &ldquo;What are you doing about Partition?&rdquo; Anybody who has experience of attending international conferences, as I have had over the years, will know that the surest way for any nation to make absolutely certain that the point it wants brought home, or the grievance it wants remedied does not get attention, is to become a sore thumb.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in asserting that if we were to adopt the suggestion made by Deputy McQuillan, not merely to be a sore thumb but to be a pain in the neck, there would be much shrugging of international shoulders and many sneers when we licked our wounds in the face of the public at international conferences, particularly when other nations are suffering far more seriously in their liberty, in their religion and in their lives.  I stand over the statement I deliberately made to a meeting of representatives of newspapers attached to the United Nations that it would be the worst of policies for Ireland to be a sore thumb in the United Nations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> I have seen at Geneva when I attended meetings there countries with legitimate grievances being regarded just as nuisances.  I have the greatest belief and faith that if we use our membership of the United Nations in the proper way and take the effective steps which we had laid down when we were in office then we have in that way the only hope of securing the end of Partion.</P>
    <P>It is futile for anybody in this House, or outside it, to think that the United States will take a hand directly, or as a matter of diplomacy, in the controversy we have with Great Britain in reference to the unjust partition of our country.  International affairs are conducted on a basis of stern realism.  We, as a Christian country, a full member of the International Society of Nations, have taken our place with considerable pride in the United Nations.  We have a duty to fulfil as a member of the U.N.O. As a Christian country, we have ideals which we try to put into practical effect in our day-to-day affairs and in Government.  At least we are recognised by the members of the International Society of Nations as a country that has an influence far in excess of that which its size, its stature, or its natural resources would justify.  There is no doubt that we are regarded with respect and a considerable degree of admiration by the other nations.</P>
    <P>If we continue as we have started, to offer our services as a country interested in bringing into operation in international affairs Christian principles which form the basis of our own lives here in this country, and if we can contribute materially and unselfishly to the many serious problems that confront international organisations and peoples to-day, then we will gain for ourselves and for our country a position of prestige and influence which will enable us quietly, not by virtue of being a sore thumb or a pain in the neck, but because of our moral influence and our effective contributions to the problems inflicting the world at the present moment, to get a degree of sympathy and help from the big nations of the world that will be of <Col N="800" /> material assistance to the problem of ending Partition.</P>
    <P>That is my solemn and sincere conviction, that we have a chance in the United Nations, if we take our part and play our part in international affairs, play a full part in international affairs, casting away from us the blight of isolationism that has afflicted us so long.  By building up for ourselves that degree of respect and dignity, and by creating through our efforts respect and prestige, the very fact of our influence will, in my very firm conviction, lead to such a position where more effective results towards the ending of Partition will be achieved.</P>
    <P>Again I repeat that the surest way to prevent this country from using the organisations of the United Nations in ending Partition is through the licking of our wounds in public, making nuisances of ourselves, talking at every time and hand's turn on Partition.  That is the surest way of preventing our having the slightest effect in securing any international support for the ending of Partition. That ought to be brought home to the House and to the people.</P>
    <P>I believe, and it has always been my conviction, that this country has a great rôle to play in international affairs.  I deplore the criticism that has frequently been made in the House and outside it, that we are spending too much on our Department of External Affairs.  It ought to be the policy of the present Government, as it was the policy of the last Government, &mdash;both the Governments which I had the privilege to lead&mdash;to put an end to our policy of isolationism, to put a finish to that sort of national introspection which spells danger to our people.  Otherwise this county will be nothing but a cabbage patch, as George Bernard Shaw referred to it some years ago.  We have got opportunities.  We have duties as well as rights and our duties, if properly carried out, will enable us to see that our rights are better respected and will produce satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege at the time of the establishment of this State to assist in building up the Department of External Affairs.  According as <Col N="801" /> I became aware of the working of that Department I had the experience of attending international conferences of one type or another in various countries, and the more I saw that Ireland's interests, not merely from the point of view of prestige but of our material interests, were necessarily involved in playing our full part and taking our proper share in international affairs.</P>
    <P>I have heard in this House and outside sneering references to our representatives abroad.  It was said sometimes sneeringly that they were engaged in cultural activities, as if that were something to be ashamed of, or that they were doing nothing but attending cocktail parties.  I do not regard the work of our Department of External Affairs or the necessity for this country playing its full part in international affairs, as something whereby to get more prestige. Looking at it from the narrow point of view of our material interests, it is absolutely necessary that we should play the fullest part in international affairs and put aside the policy of isolationism.</P>
    <P>It is not for nothing that every country in the world has its diplomats spread throughout the world.  They do not do that just to enable them to attend cocktail parties. It is not for nothing that the biggest nations in the world spend millions of pounds in endeavouring to promote cultural activities and to have other nations understand their cultural affairs.  There is a very material basis at the root of all that.  I heard my colleague, Deputy Mulcahy, quoting an Irish proverb on one occasion which I now repeat, the advice of a father to his daughter on getting married: &ldquo;You can do without your father and you can do without your mother, but you cannot do without your neighbour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We cannot sit here and devise means by which our export trade can be developed, by which our economy can be strengthened, by which our balance of payments difficulties can be overcome unless we make friends amongst the nations to whom we hope to sell our goods.  International trade is a highly competitive business.  It is <Col N="802" /> motivated by stark realism and, in my own experience, I have seen that when a country wants a benefit from another country, that benefit will be secured on the basis of a <i>quid pro quo</i> or of some good turn having been done for it at an international conference on some previous occasion.  We require therefore, in my view, that the Government should work out in detail a proper foreign policy for the benefit not merely of the prestige of the State but for the benefit of its economic well-being.  I should like to commend that policy to those young people who are groping and searching for some light towards which they can make their enthusiastic endeavours.  They can work for Ireland through working for other afflicted countries and playing the fullest part in international affairs.</P>
    <P>Coming back to our own problems, I would hope that we are coming, if we have not already come, to an end of a chapter in Irish political history when the mistakes which have been made in the past and which have endangered our democratic institutions will be rectified.  Let me take an illustration without, I hope, being too controversial. Milk, wheat, Irish industry, health and even religion have been made use of in the past as pawns in the political game.  People have been asked to vote for this or that Party and many of them, I am sorry to say, have made up their minds to vote for a particular Party on the basis that they would make more money out of that Party if it formed a Government than they would out of some other Party.  There are many people who have this deplorable outlook.  They are not interested in politics.  There is nothing in it for them, and why should they bother?</P>
    <P>It ought to be recognised that there is a duty on every person, and particularly on educated and responsible people in the community, to play their full part in public life, and many of them are not doing that.  Many of them shrug their shoulders at politicians. Many people and many newspapers sneer at our politicians and institutions.  If we are to have respect for our institutions, if our young people are to be imbued with the enthusiasm which is essential as a motive <Col N="803" /> force for patriotic endeavour in future, the Press, politicians and responsible people in the country must realise that they must safeguard our political institutions and our democratic machinery.</P>
    <P>In bringing the remarks I have to make to a conclusion, I shall come down to a slightly lower level, namely, general Government policy.  I did some time ago say that one of the best guarded secrets in modern political history was the policy of Fianna Fáil during the last general election.  I have endeavoured during the last few months to watch the progress of the Government in their policy to see where it was leading.  Pondering on what remarks I should make to-day on general Government policy, I formed the conclusion that, with two exceptions, the general Government policy of this Government has faithfully followed the policy of the inter-Party Government.  Those two exceptions are the abolition of the food subsidies and the relaxation of the conditions on hire purchase agreements and some of the levies.  On the matter of the subsidies, I do not intend to speak beyond saying that if Fianna Fáil policy during the progress of the general election campaign was a well guarded secret, certainly their intention to abolish the food subsidies was even more closely guarded.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Faith without good works is dead&rdquo;.  People are judged by what they do, but it is some source of satisfaction and a measure of gratification for us to know that even the present Government realises that the difficulties we had to meet in 1956 were not of our making or due to the former Government which had to meet them.  The Government are now reaping the advantages, at least to some extent, of the political sacrifices we had to make in the interests of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most remarkable features of the past three months is the singular lack of elation of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="804" /> Party, inside and outside the House, as a result of their triumph.  You would not think they had won the election at all.  There is no sign of the dynamic policy that was to be put into operation, of the dramatic results that were going to be achieved merely by the change of Government&mdash;the end of all difficulties and the cessation of all emergencies.  They have continued past policy and they have shown no dynamic policy for the ending of unemployment and the securing of full employment.</P>

      <P>For 16 solid years we had that industry as the cinderella of Fianna Fáil policy.  We in the Fine Gael Party and our predecessors in Cumann na nGaedheal, from the late Paddy Hogan onwards, had always the conviction, and acted upon it, that you could not have good Irish industries without a prosperous agricultural industry.  We are still suffering from the effects of the lack of appreciation of that fundamental fact in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am glad to know they have at least&mdash;may I borrow the Taoiseach's expression&mdash; the intention of doing something for agriculture.  We await with considerable interest the spectacle or the experience, whichever you like to call it, of the Taoiseach's intention being put into practice and the results being achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion I shall not say what the Taoiseach said last year from those benches that I hate the present Government.  I dislike the Fianna Fáil Party and its policy and all the injury it has done to the country.  However, it is the Irish Government.  I wish it <Col N="805" /> well and I hope prosperity will come in conditions better than we had to face.  I hope the Taoiseach will reap the benefit of our sacrifices for the benefit of the nation.  If he does that I have no doubt that the Party of which I have the honour to be a member will succeed the Government in conditions that will inure to the prosperity of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that first of all I have to make a slight correction in the short statement made by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle when calling upon Deputy J.A. Costello to speak. If I recollect properly, he called upon the Leader of the Opposition.  I feel sure the House, and you, Sir, will realise and accept that I have a great regard for Deputy Costello's work as Taoiseach and leader of the Fine Gael Party.  However, he is not my leader, he is not the leader of the Labour Party.  If there was any doubt about that fact the position must have been demonstrated quite clearly when the Labour Party decided, at the recent annual delegate conference, its policy in the future.  It stated quite clearly that it was and would continue to be an independent political Party.</P>
      <P>Reverting to the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department and to general Government policy, I find something in common between the position of the Taoiseach and his predecessor. It is said that good intentions pave the way to hell.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach and every Deputy supporting him all have good intentions.  Neither do I cast any reflections on the good intentions of the Taoiseach's predecessor or of the members of the various Parties who supported him.  The trouble is that they had not the effective power to put these good intentions into operation to the benefit of the country and for the good of the citizens.  During the 12 or 18 months prior to the general election, some of the newspapers in this country continuously clamoured for a change of Government because the then Government, they said, were not carrying out the policy they had proclaimed before the previous election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> Why?  Because that Government did not have control of the nation's finances, and were not able to control the price at which money would be issued for essential capital works. Similarly, while the Taoiseach and his Ministers may to-day have the best intentions in the world, unless they have the power to translate those intentions into action, we shall have just a continuation of the evils of emigration and substantial unemployment.  I would therefore ask the Taoiseach, a man who has given long, honourable and exceptional service to this country, to consider whether the time has not come when he must seriously consider this whole position.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to young men leaving this country, and taking other action.  I do not think they are wise or right, but as long as a single individual in this country or outside it can point to the elected Government and say: &ldquo;The power does not lie there; the effective power lies with a group of individuals not elected by the citizens and not responsible to them&rdquo;, it is understandable, that as long as that condition exists&mdash;and it has existed for too many years&mdash;young people will wonder whether there is much sense in supporting democratic institutions in the State.</P>
    <P>There is another analogy that might be said to exist between the Taoiseach and his predecessor.  It is true, I think, that the Taoiseach frequently referred to the inter-Party Government and used the words &ldquo;mixum gatherum&rdquo;, indicating that there were differences of opinion, and ideas, and conflicting policies in that Government.  Those are facts that are so obvious that nobody should attempt to deny them because if political groups having different philosophies join together obviously they cannot, if they have any political honesty or firm convictions, entirely sink their political convictions.</P>
    <P>There is an analogy on the other side at present which has given me some cause for concern in the past and has given serious cause for concern to the people and I am afraid may give them even more concern in the future.  I think it is true to say that in 1952 very <Col N="807" /> strong conflicting views were held by two sections of the then Fianna Fáil Cabinet.  We had the views of the then Tánaiste on the desirability of assisting the development of Irish industry in the interests of our people and we had the Minister for Finance taking a completely opposite line.</P>
    <P>To-day history appears to be repeating itself because one of the queries facing Deputies and facing the people generally and which apparently can only be answered by events is: What is the policy of the Taoiseach and his Cabinet?  In the general election campaign we were informed that they had two main concerns and these matters, I think, were causing concern to everybody&mdash;the level of unemployment and the continued emigration.</P>
    <P>Has the Government any definite policy on how this chronic problem of unemployment can be dealt with?  Up to the moment we do not appear to have any indication of a solution beyond the hope that circumstances may change and that the appeal for cooperation from all citizens will result in some amelioration of the position in which well over 60,000 people are unemployed in the month of July.  July is known as the month which normally shows the highest employment figure and the lowest number out of work.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to have got any definite guidance, and unemployed men and women and their families may well be asking: &ldquo;What will be the position when the glorious summer weather is over and we have to face the winter again?&rdquo;  I would ask the Taoiseach even at this stage whether he can hold out any definite hope to them, because between now and October Deputies will have no opportunity of raising the matter in the House?</P>
    <P>I mentioned an analogy earlier and it appears to repeat itself.  The present Ministers for Health and Finance seem to be treading very closely on the heels of the Minister for Finance in 1952. The first effort of the Government, of a Government which could not be described as a mixum-gatherum Government but rather as a Government <Col N="808" /> apparently united with one voice, with one mind and a single determination, was to remove the food subsidies thereby attacking the standard of living of our ordinary citizens.  The next effort was to throw a further burden on the average citizen by increasing health charges and recently the Minister for Lands indicated in public that, in his view, expenditure over the years on the provision of houses, etc., was to say the least of it, ill-advised.  I understand that the Taoiseach clearly indicated yesterday his positive view on that matter was that expenditure in the provision of houses for our people and the provision of hospital and other services was expenditure which was fully justified.</P>
    <P>Again, is the impact of the dissension within the Cabinet going to result in a policy which will not benefit the Irish people?  If in three months or six months' time, through circumstances outside the control of the Government, the financial powers of this country decree once more the imposition of a credit squeeze, what will be the reaction of the present Cabinet?</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear one Fianna Fáil Deputy state this afternoon that, in his view, promises to cure the heavy unemployment and deal with the problem of emigration were not necessarily binding on him as a member of the Fianna Fáil party.  He did state, however, that possibly in five years' time, or thereabouts, he and his colleagues in the Party would have to go before the electorate and would then have to report on whether those promises had been redeemed or whether they had been broken.  I do not think there was any question of five years being held out as the period in which this problem of unemployment would be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in my constituency, and in the City of Dublin as a whole, the support and the return of Fianna Fáil were based on the acceptance and the belief among ordinary citizens that immediate and effective steps would be taken to deal with a problem which is both serious and almost catastrophic in this capital city of ours.  I have no doubt that <Col N="809" /> Fianna Fáil would not have received the support it did if the ordinary workers had for one moment believed there was any possibility of their standard of living being driven downwards by the removal of the food subsidies and by the increase in hospital charges.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the Government was formed, at a time when a proposal to remove the food subsidies was under discussion here, a deputation of working class women was received in this House by a number of Deputies. The Minister for Justice, one or two of his colleagues and I myself were present.  These working class women posed two questions.  One was in relation to the increase in the price of bread and butter and the second was in relation to unemployment.  This morning one of the ladies who was on that deputation called on me and said: &ldquo;Deputy Larkin, what is going to be done about this question of unemployment? What is going to be done about these prices?&rdquo;  The only answer I could give her was the answer I had given her earlier: &ldquo;The responsibility for dealing with these matters is now the responsibility of the present Taoiseach and his Cabinet and, if they do not deal with them, there is nothing more that I can do other than bring them to their attention again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think it desirable that I should traverse the same ground traversed by so many speakers since the debates on the Estimates began but there are one or two points I would like to raise before concluding.  One is a matter that affects a relatively small number of people, but the approach to the problem by the Government can be indicative of Government policy as a whole in relation to unemployment. Last week I put down a question as to whether civilians employed in the barracks in the Dublin area had been laid off and whether it was proposed to lay off other employees.  I put down another question regarding civilian employees as to whether, in giving employment in the barracks, regard was had to the national service of the applicants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of departmental administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="810" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The question arises on the general question of employment and the Government's attitude to unemployment because the reply I received was that some of these employees had been laid off and that it was proposed to lay off more.  The Government, within two or three months of entering office, lays off its own employees, over whom they have direct control and in whose appointment the question of national service arose, and then gives that cynical reply to a question in the Dáil on the matter that some of these employees have been laid off and that more will be laid off because plans have not been prepared, as if plans for employment in these grades could not be prepared at very short notice.  It was also indicated, of course, that provision had not been made in the Estimates.</P>
      <P>This Government was to tackle the problem of unemployment.  We were told, in the language of Deputy Costello, that they would take dynamic steps to cure unemployment.  Dynamic steps to cure unemployment or to create unemployment is the question I want answered.  Can any Government seriously contend that they have plans for dealing with unemployment in the country if almost the first thing they do is to lay off employees of one of their own Departments?</P>
      <P>I raised this matter specifically because I recollect that last year, when suggestions were made that a number of men in the same barracks were reduntant, the welkin rang and there was hardly a Fianna Fáil Deputy, a Fianna Fáil councillor or a Fianna Fáil representative in the City of Dublin who was not making holes in the carpet raising objections to the laying off of those men.  I put it to the Taoiseach that if it was good enough for the members of his Party to protest strenuously about this matter a few months ago, it is good enough for him and his Cabinet to take some action when the power lies in their own hands. Their intentions to deal with the problem of unemployment may very well be judged by the manner in which they deal with people who are at their mercy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, with your permission, <Col N="811" /> to remark on an anomaly which has existed for a long time.  I may be out of order in raising this matter because it may possibly require legislation but the problem exists now and may continue during the recess.  In Dublin, there is a city manager who is Dublin City Manager, Dublin County Manager, Dún Laoghaire Manager and the final authority for mental hospitals, etc.  In view of the fact that the Corporation of Dublin, Dublin County Council and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire have adopted resolutions asking that the authority might be separated, in view of the fact that the city alone contains almost 600,000 citizens and that there is a large population in the county and in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and in view of the almost impossible and utterly ridiculous methods of administration which have to be evolved in order to meet that situation, would the Taoiseach consult with his Minister for Local Government with a view to removing this anomaly?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will leave it at that because that is all the latitude I can allow him. I really should not allow that much. The Taoiseach is not responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling in this matter, as is usual.  I hope the matter will be borne in mind.  I would ask that the Taoiseach, when replying to the debate, will indicate clearly and definitely to the House, and through the House to the people, whether there are any positive and definite plans for dealing with the question of unemployment and resultant emigration because I have no doubt that, if there are plans, he and his Government will get the full support of all Deputies in dealing with that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is correct to say that the Taoiseach mentioned, in the course of his introduction of the Estimate, the question of the standard of living.  The suggestion was that the people of this country appeared to be expecting too high a standard of living, to enjoy a standard of living comparable with that in Great Britain, France, Germany <Col N="812" /> and so forth.  I am wondering whether this connotes the suggestion that we should have a double standard of living in this country because there are many people in very comfortable circumstances.  Many people have good fat bank balances.  Hardly a day passes without some correspondent in the newspapers, or some representative of commercial concerns, advising and advertising the introduction of such things as television on a large scale.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to the introduction of television, but television is a service which would require a certain expenditure on the part of those desiring to purchase a cabinet.  If our people are to be encouraged, and there is no doubt they are being encouraged officially, to purchase television apparatus, to purchase electrical apparatus, it is obvious it is an encouragement of a higher standard of living.  I am in agreement with the encouragement of a higher standard of living but what family, in what part of the nation, is to accept a lower standard of living?  Is there some section of our people to whom the minor luxuries of motor cars, motor cycles, television sets, and electrical apparatus are to be denied?  Is it proposed that in the rural areas they are to return to a very low standard of living?</P>
    <P>It is rather confusing because emigration appears to stem from two reasons, the basic economic reason, either actual unemployment or the acceptance by the persons concerned that there is no future for them in their own little area, or from another reason, the lack of modern amenities.  We cannot enjoy a good standard of living without modern amenities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If our standard of living is to be lower are these amenities to be removed from the people, and if they are to be removed, from what section of the people are they to be removed? I have no doubt that those engaged in the control of industry and commerce, <Col N="813" /> those in a position to invest in industry and commerce, have no intention of accepting a lower standard of living, not of their own volition. The only other section that appears to be affected by this is the section whose standard of living is far too low already, that section of the community who in this year, 1957, are able only to exist from week to week and who must rely for even their ordinary household necessities on doing what is evidently criminal in the country as a whole, that is borrowing against their future estimated earnings.</P>
      <P>I trust that the Taoiseach's remarks on that matter are not directed at the ordinary worker in the city and country. One of the main factors, if not the chief factor, in emigration, is the inability of the average citizen to provide for his family, and the future of his family, on his normal wage or salary.  I trust that not only in the reply to this debate, but in the months that lie between the Dáil rising for the summer recess and its reassembly, the people of the country, the people of my city here, will have had some demonstration of the dynamic programme which the present Government were going to embark upon in dealing with what was described as the main problem, the unemployment of Irish men, boys and girls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Deputies were somewhat disappointed with the Taoiseach's statement to-day.  I wish to know if it is in accordance with Government policy, in a very poor impoverished area in County Wicklow, that the Minister for Lands has instructed that the services of 16 men, some of them who had over 17 years practical experience working in forest nurseries, should be dispensed with until next October.  The county council passed a unanimous resolution requesting the Minister to reconsider his decision on the grounds that there was no other alternative work in that particular area.  They pointed out that from their own experience practical work could be available for these men in the thinning out of plantations, which would keep them in useful employment until next October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> That resolution was passed unanimously by all parties in the county council and the Minister refused to receive the resolution.  A public meeting was then called by the Secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party in one town and he appealed to the Minister to reconsider his decision or provide some alternative employment.  Deputies in the area made representations to the Minister without any effect except another notice of his intention to cause further unemployment in the area. Where we had nurseries up to 10 acres it was his idea to have an area of 50 acres in a district where we had afforestation proceeding for the past 22 or 23 years.  I hope that is not the Government's policy but if it is, I hope they will accede to the request of the public bodies for the provision of alternative work for these men in the area.</P>
    <P>When the Budget was introduced I pointed out that the abolition of the food subsidies gave the right to the workers and the trade unions to seek the sixth round of wage increases.  In a speech I made in Bray I emphasised that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power, their first action would be to remove the food subsidies.  The Minister then used the argument that I was giving notice of the then Government's intention to abolish the food subsidies and that that Government must have considered their abolition.  Great play was made of the fact that I pointed out that the trade unions would look for the sixth round of wage increases, not because I was speaking as a Deputy but because I was speaking as a member of the largest trade union in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I said in my statement that I was interpreting the wishes and the mind of the trade unions in the country.  Within the next three or four days the official statement made by the general president of that union on behalf of the executive and on behalf of their members was published.  He pointed out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The abolition of all the food subsidies and the increased prices of cigarettes and the workman's drink represent a direct attack on the workers' standard of living and this attack is all the more pronounced in <Col N="815" /> that it is again the workers who are to bear the brunt of the sacrifices necessitated by the Budget.</P>
    <P>In defence of their standards, the workers must seek the restoration of their purchasing power for whatever hope there is of a prosperous Ireland it is directly related to the prosperity of the workers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Budget presented to the Dáil on the 8th May last by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Government was, in the circumstances, one of extreme severity for the wage earner and our other needy people. The complete abolition of the food subsidies was as unnecessary as it was unjust.  The £6,000,000 or so extra revenue required could as easily and much more justly have been obtained by savings on such expensive things as Seanad Éireann, jet bombers, palatial foreign embassies and by substantial reduction in our expensive national and local administrative machinery.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, I was not alone when I made that statement on the Budget.</P>
    <P>In the general election campaign when we were unable to guarantee the provision of free medical cards, other candidates promised them.  We see now that the free cards are not available and that the hospital charges are to be increased to the workers.  Deputy Brennan may laugh but he did not laugh when he was promising the people he would have the price of food reduced and that employment would be provided for all our people.  Unfortunately the people accepted the promises that were made in respect of employment. We all know it would be impossible for any Government to provide a solution for unemployment overnight. However, I do suggest the Department of Lands and Forestry should set a good example and not attack the weakest section of the community in an area where no alternative employment is available.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over the ground that has been covered already but merely to vindicate the action of the trade union movement.  We are determined, <Col N="816" /> come what may, to see that the standard of living of the worker will not be reduced by deliberate Government action.  I want to ask the Government if it is their policy, instead of providing employment, to put men out of work who have no alternative work in their own area?  These are skilled men and I would ask the Taoiseach to reconsider their position and give some assurance to the public body or to the unemployed men that they will have four or five months' work in the plantations until the planting season takes place in October.  If the Government does that we will know that they are sincere in their efforts to carry out some of the promises they made during the election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say I have any serious complaint in regard to the general approach by those who are in Opposition to this Estimate.  There is no doubt whatever that unemployment is our most serious problem.  The members of the previous Government are looking for credit for having brought about a situation in which there is a balance in our international payments. At the moment, it would seem that there is a balance and that the deficit does not exist for the time being. When we had a similar problem in relation to the balance of payments we were told by the members of the previous Government, then in Opposition, that certain consequences would flow from the steps we had to take in order to remedy that situation.</P>
      <P>Everybody here&mdash;certainly every Deputy who participated in a Government&mdash;will have to admit that we could not carry on as a State, as a community, if our bill for imports, visible and invisible, continued to exceed what we were able to get for our exports. Our reserves would not enable us to continue for any length of time if there was a serious deficit.  The deficit problem with which we had to deal, and with which the previous Government had to deal, still remained, to a very large extent, at the end of the last calendar year.  If these deficits exist, steps must be taken by the Government to remedy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The steps we took in 1952 had certain <Col N="817" /> consequences.  We believed these consequences were far less serious than the consequences that followed the steps taken by the Coalition Government. Certain serious results followed. The measures taken by the Government which has just gone out of office, the restrictions of various kinds which were imposed brought about unemployment and, at the present time, our main concern is how we can loosen the restrictions in such a way that we will stimulate employment without bringing about other consequences such as a further deficit in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>That is a difficult problem, and when people ask us what our policy is, what the policy of the Government is, we say that the policy of the Government at the moment is to get out of the slough of despond in which we found ourselves and try to get back into a situation in which there will be increasing employment, increasing activity, increasing production.  The policy of any Government in this country should be to try to bring about increased production because it is by that production the standard of consumption will be raised and that the level of our exports, and consequently our general standards, will be raised.</P>
    <P>The whole problem then is to increase production.  Some Deputies have been talking about people being let go out of Government service. Surely they must realise that if we were to carry on having people in the service for whom there was no productive employment we would not succeed in providing a remedy to the situation. We would only worsen it.  We have, therefore, to bend all our energies towards trying to secure opportunities for employment in productive industry. There is no other way out of it.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies seemed to suggest that there was some fairy godmother who would give us the means, the finances, to raise the standard of living. There is no fairy godmother.  The only way in which we can secure a higher standard of living is by working for it, and the amount of work and energy <Col N="818" /> we have to devote to that is all the greater because of the relative smallness, if I may put it that way, of our resources.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, pointed out, quite truly, that we have certain advantages and that we have to use these to the full.  If we were able to get increased employment in agriculture directly, that would be the best cure, in my opinion, for unemployment as far as the rural areas are concerned.  However, with the introduction of machinery and the need for increased productivity per individual, that will not be easy.  We may be able to get greater production from the 12,000,000 acres of arable land we have, but we cannot be too sure that we will give a greater degree of employment, that we can employ more individuals on these 12,000,000 acres.  It certainly should be the first and primary aim to try to do that, but again that means increased production from the land. Deputy Dillon seemed to think there was some conflict between our idea of getting after the markets and the idea of trying to increase production.  I think the two will have to go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>At the moment I do not propose to go into the agricultural question too closely.  On the question of employment then, what we have been trying to do since we got into office is to stimulate activity.  The Minister for Local Government, who is sitting beside me, is engaged, as Deputies in the House will know, in trying to stimulate activity in building houses, in road building and in other local authority services.  Here again we have got to look out.  That is not precisely the sort of activity that will get us out of our difficulties.  The employment given by stimulating activity in building and ancillary services is not the type that will get us safely out of our difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am tempted, naturally, to follow matters that were raised in the debate but I am afraid that if I followed them in any detail it would take far too long. The mere question of the building industry would, in itself, provide material for a speech&mdash;how far we have <Col N="819" /> got, the value of building to the nation, how far we should continue.  I shall not follow that line because, as I have said, it would provide the subject for a speech in itself.  As I said in my remarks when introducing the Estimate, and as I have just said now, for the moment we are stimulating activity in that industry.  We fully realise that a great deal of the work in the building of houses has been done and that a time will inevitably come, if we go on rapidly enough, when opportunities for employment in that industry will be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>If we devoted all our energies at the present time to completing our programme in that industry in the shortest possible time, we would soon arrive at a period of famine in so far as the workers in that industry are concerned. Therefore we must try gradually to turn the people from that particular industry on to activities of a more productive type.  Our hope then, as far as the more important industries are concerned, lies in the activities of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Our chief aim at the present moment is to try, through the activities of that Department and the encouragement and inspiration it gives and through the encouragement given through financial and taxation arrangements, to get manufacturing industries going as rapidly as we can.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that the greatest progress that can be made towards restoring the fortunes of this country is through the development of agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>But we must be careful in regard to what we produce. Deputy Dillon spoke of butter.  Of course, he is quite right in saying that if we export butter, whatever price we get for it represents so much help towards securing an equivalent amount in imports of a type that we want, but I feel sure he would not dream of disputing the proposition that if there were other direction in which we could promote agricultural activity and obtain agricultural produce for export, <Col N="820" /> it would be better to have these products which would secure remunerative prices in the foreign market rather than to rely upon products which have to be subsidised.  I do not think for a moment Deputy Dillon will dispute that proposition.  He simply pointed out that although we have to subsidise a surplus, we should not regard it as complete waste.</P>
      <P>But that is not the most satisfactory way of using our agricultural produce. It seems to me that the principal task for the Minister for Agriculture now will be to decide how agricultural production can be directed into channels that will give the greatest general value.  Cattle have been mentioned. I do not remember the exact terms Deputy Dillon used, but his phrasing seemed to puzzle some Deputies.  There was a question of whether, instead of sending milk to the creameries, some of the calves could not be put on to the cows and reared in that way.  To determine the best way to arrange our agricultural production so as to get maximum results is one of our most difficult tasks.</P>
      <P>Regarding the possibility of increasing exports of cattle for the remainder of the year, Deputy Dillon pointed out that one of the aims which he had was to get cattle sent out in the early part of the year, but surely he will admit that if they were sent out in the early part of the year we would not have them for export in the later part of the year?  And if that be so, if we have high cattle exports due to sending more cattle out early in the year, we cannot have high cattle exports in the later part of the year.  That is why I said that, while our international payments are in balance at the moment, we must be careful, because there are certain factors now operating which may not operate in our favour during the remainder of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Careful handling will be required if we are to get out of the present difficulties. If we spend £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 extra, as is being done, in paying out arrears that have been allowed to accumulate in regard to local government finances and so on; if we must provide for increased borrowing so as to finance the extra couple <Col N="821" /> of million pounds required, we must remember, at the same time, that we are coming to the very limit of our borrowing capacity and, therefore, we must make every move with the greatest care.  It is not a time in which we can say: &ldquo;All right, you can carry on and the money will be available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I remember standing in this very spot and speaking to some members of the Labour Party about housing and I was able to state very definitely that there would be no difficulty in finding money for any project that was worth while in itself and that promised to be of advantage to the nation.  That day has passed.  There are many things I would like to see done at present and which could be done if we had the money.  But money at the moment is scarce.  We have reached the stage at which the money to be used for further development has to come in the main from the production of the day.  I wish that representatives of the Labour Party and other representatives here would face these facts and realise that if we spend money in one direction that is not immediately productive or not productive at an early stage, we may not have enough money to finance schemes for reducing unemployment in other directions.  The task is to discover what measures will have the overall effect of increasing total productive employment.</P>
    <P>There is evidence at the moment that unemployment is diminishing compared with what it was the year before.  That is a good sign.  We hope the measures that will be taken will continue to have that result.  There can be nothing spectacular about the results in the present year, and I would say it is far better national policy to look for a steady increase month by month and year by year than to have a feast to-day and a famine to-morrow.  I am afraid that the adoption of the suggestions I have heard during the debate would lead to the situation in which we might have recovery for the moment but we would inevitably have also adverse consequences, resulting in further depression at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies seemed to regret the fact that there are not big differences <Col N="822" /> of opinion between this side of the House and the Opposition.  Is that a disadvantage?  Is it not something we should be glad about that we should be able to get such a degree of national unity in regard to any particular project that we would be able to say: &ldquo;All right, we differ in certain respects but on the main national issues, we agree&rdquo;?  I can say with truth that I am very happy to see the amount of agreement at which we have arrived. It is a great pleasure to me to see, for instance, that we are agreed on the idea of growing our own cereals for our own live stock and growing our own cereals for human consumption, too. It is a great pleasure to me to see the amount of agreement on the building up of our industries.  It has been suggested that there is, of course, no real conflict between the building up of industries in our towns and helping our farming community.  The building up of industries provides a very valuable home market for the consumption of our agricultural produce and, at the same time, provides opportunities whereby the sons of our small farmers and others can find employment at home instead of going abroad.  The building up of industry and the development of agriculture are, indeed, complementary.  They are not in any way antagonistic.</P>
    <P>It is a great pleasure, too, to see that there is agreement about the building up of tourism and that there is agreement about the building up of our air services.  There is agreement in relation to the development of our bogs and utilising them for power, etc. It is a great pleasure to me to realise now that these are accepted things by practically everybody.</P>
    <P>The question now is: In what other directions can we develop and go ahead, with support from every side?  I would like to be able to see other directions in which we could expand and develop in just the same way as we expanded and developed our bogs, our industries and so on.  A good many people have talked about afforestation.  We have been doing our best at all times to expand afforestation to the point at which it will really serve the national <Col N="823" /> interest.  It was not easy at one time to get land.  It is, I think, somewhat easier now.</P>
    <P>It was we who started land reclamation and the farm improvements scheme.  Other Governments brought about other developments.  It has never been any part of our policy, when we succeed another Government, to undo any good work that has been done or to abolish any project which our predecessors have initiated, provided we thought that project was of value. When Deputy Costello says that we are only continuing certain things initiated by the previous Government, surely, instead of that being a cause of complaint against us, it should be a cause for congratulation and Deputy Costello should have congratulated us on the fact that we were not disposed, simply because another Government had initiated a project, to put that project on one side but, rather, that we were prepared to continue the project with greater speed, having satisfied ourselves that it was a right and proper line to pursue.</P>
    <P>I have had the difficulty over many years that, whenever I come to reply in this debate, so many topics are introduced that each one of them would require a speech to itself if I were to deal with it adequately.  That is even more true this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Costello's point about the young people and their patriotism, I am in complete agreement. I believe that young people to-day would respond in time of need, in the same way as their predecessors responded in the years that are gone. I agree with him also that the tasks that confront our young people to-day and the directions in which their enthusiasms should be guided are different from those of the past.</P>
    <P>There is one direction in which I would like to see their enthusiasms guided, but it would require a steady application, coupled perhaps with a certain amount of humdrum work not associated with military activity.  I believe that the restoration of our language should be one of the principal objectives of our young people to-day. <Col N="824" /> They can restore the language if they want to, and it is the generation which is now growing up that is the generation that will be blamed if our language should disappear.  Our language can be restored.  The groundwork has been well laid.  The books are available.  All the other essentials are available and all that is necessary for them is the diligence to practise it and the desire to speak it.  If they begin in a small way then, with practice, they will get the facility to use Irish in the same way as they use English at the moment. If I were a young man to-day I think I would love to devote myself to that national task.  It would be a cultural task.  Deputy Costello talked about the value of culture generally.  There would be a cultural activity of the highest value, and I would like to see our young people applying themselves to the development of that particular culture with the object of securing that particular national ambition.</P>
    <P>We are now on the point of adjourning and, in the time which will elapse between now and the reassembly of the Dáil, the members of the Government will devote themselves to the task of doing everything possible in their Departments to promote greater activity and to enable more production to be secured from industry and from agriculture, with consequential greater employment.  We have not had many months so far to deal with the task of correcting the position as a whole and trying to bring the State out of the position in which it was when we took office.  The steps that have been taken so far have already produced results.  We believe that the steps that will be taken between now and the reassembly of the Dáil will have the result of reducing unemployment, reducing the economic pressure which makes for emigration and will in general bring the nation back into the position in which the old confidence will reassert itself.  These steps must, of necessity, be administrative.</P>
    <P>There is no reason whatsoever why we should have any doubt that we can have a reasonably high standard of living here, and that for a population greater than the present population. I certainly have no doubt about that. <Col N="825" /> But we must work for it.  We must plan for it.  We must earnestly desire it. There is no use in a person wishing for a higher standard of living if he is not prepared to work for it and if he does not try to secure it for himself. It has been said, and it is of course true, that a person who has no opportunity of working cannot work.  Therefore, one of the things that must be done is to try to find work for such people.  I have a friend whose constant phrase is: &ldquo;Work makes work&rdquo; and I am confident and satisfied that if <Col N="826" /> everybody who is in work, works to the utmost of his ability, that will provide work for others.  Any idea to the contrary is false.</P>
    <P>In the months remaining, before the House meets again, we shall devote ourselves to the task which lies ahead. We shall devote ourselves to it in the hope that we will get out of our present position and find ourselves ultimately, once more, in the position in which there will be steady progress.</P>

      <P>A new Arts Council has been recently established with a new director.  I personally hope that fruitful results will follow from the operations of the Arts Council. They have very little money.  Twenty thousand pounds is a very small sum for the work done by the Arts Council, and I would hope that, when the financial affairs of the country permit, at the earliest possible moment a greater sum will be made available to the Arts Council.</P>
      <P>I believe the work the council has been doing, and is capable of doing, and the functions it should perform, would be better appreciated by the country if in matters affecting art, and the application of art to industry in particular, the organisations and industrialists involved would take advantage of the facilities that are available to them through the medium of the Arts Council.  I had great hopes for the operations of that Council.  I still have great hopes that it will do considerable good.</P>
      <P>It is right that the House and the country should know that the Council have been quietly but otherwise effectively operating to secure the return of the Lane bequest to this country.  That is only one of its many activities.  I hope the remarks made to-day will not prevail in reference to the Arts Council, that it will not be dealt with as a non-essential service.</P>

      <P>There has been general agreement by successive Ministers for Finance that the Exchequer will have to come to the rescue in the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre and in December, 1954, the former Government announced that, subject to the approval of the Dáil, they would supplement whatever funds the directors of the Abbey had or might have themselves to rebuild it in accordance with plans to be approved of on certain general lines.  Such plans have been in course of preparation for several years past but could not be submitted in final form because protracted negotiations were taking place for the acquisition of a certain adjoining property.  It was considered desirable to acquire it so that the plans for the new theatre could be drawn in conformity with modern standards.  Arrangements have now been made for the purchase of the premises concerned by the Abbey directors&mdash;the agreement for sale has been signed&mdash;and this Supplementary Estimate is required solely to recoup them the price and the accompanying legal expenses, including stamp duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required for the purpose of making a grant towards the cost of carrying out a survey and experimental works at Rosslare Strand.</P>
      <P>I indicated to the House recently that the question of reintroducing the Coast Protection Bill would have to be considered by the Government but that I could not anticipate what the Government's decision might be.  The position in regard to Rosslare Strand, however, appeared to the Government to be so urgent that it was decided that it should be dealt with exceptionally. It has been a matter of anxiety to the local people concerned for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements were recently made for a joint preliminary examination at Rosslare by the Wexford county engineer and engineers from the Office of Public Works.  They have now recommended the following immediate measures which are, of course, exploratory and experimental.  First, a survey including float tests, to determine the currents and extent of littoral drift; secondly, the erection of a small number of experimental groynes at test positions along the beach; and thirdly, some direct protection works along the portion of coast where the threat of erosion is most serious and also in other places <Col N="831" /> where such works would yield useful information.</P>
    <P>The estimated expenditure during the current financial year on the survey and the works is £9,000.  The Wexford County Council have agreed to pay one-third of the actual cost involved up to a maximum local contribution of £3,000 in the current year. The remainder of the cost will be met from this sub-head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this decision by the Government to make this grant towards the correction of coast erosion. I would only like to know how and when the Government decided that they were responsible for coast erosion, because I think those of us from County Wexford who raised the question as Deputies in this House were told in effect that the Government had no responsibility or at least that no particular Department was prepared to take on the responsibility for the correction of coast erosion.</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask whether or not coast erosion will be given somewhat similar treatment in other areas. I appreciate that the correction of coast erosion in certain circumstances could run into millions of pounds.  I do not think any of us expects that the Government would be able to provide that amount of money, but I assume that now this question with regard to coast erosion will be directed to the Minister for Finance and that there will be some sort of provision, whether token or otherwise, in the Department of Finance for coast erosion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the last Government there was a Bill called, I think, the Coast Protection Bill, which was intended to regularise the position as far as coast erosion was concerned, so that the Government would accept responsibility but, at the same time, make local authorities responsible in some way for doing the job of coast protection. I think that was the better method and a more generous method and that, in the long run, the Government would have done far better by it. While this happens to be my constituency I still believe the local authority has a greater amount of responsibility <Col N="832" /> for the correction of coast erosion.  I am in a maritime county but I can appreciate the attitude in those inland counties where they are contributing moneys and possibly may be in the future contributing vast sums of money for expenditure on work devoted entirely to maritime counties.  However, I hope that if the experiments are successful the Government will be generous in providing moneys for this work and especially in regard to Rosslare Strand where the sea has eaten very far into the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I heard the Parliamentary Secretary correctly but I thought he said that the effect of the proposal that was being fulfilled under this Supplementary Estimate was that the county council would put up not more than £3,000 to make, with this £6,000, £9,000.  During the last Dáil I was kept here for hours and hours and days and days by Deputy Corry and Deputy Allen in particular, and I think Deputy Beegan added his quota to the continued repetition that, under no circumstances whatever, should local authorities be asked to contribute one penny piece towards coast protection. We were kept here for days and days with that theme from Fianna Fáil.  This Estimate makes it clear that they have now swallowed it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister, but I cannot understand that although we in Wicklow made a similar application for a small grant for coast erosion, the public body was informed they would have to wait until the Bill came before the House.  Why should this special treatment be given to County Wexford?  I am not objecting to the benefits they will receive in this respect, but may I express the hope that if the Wicklow County Council sends in a further resolution they will receive the same favourable consideration as has been given to Wexford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently a contribution of 33? per cent. has been accepted from the Wexford County Council as against the minimum of 50 per cent. inflicted under the proposed Coast Erosion Bill <Col N="833" /> introduced by Deputy Sweetman.  I hold that State responsibility in this matter is very great.  All along the coastline you had estates being taken over under the Compulsory Purchase Act.  The landlord was paid by the State on the advice of the officials of the Land Commission, but no attempt whatever was made to hold any proportion of that loot that the landlord was getting to help the unfortunate tenant to keep up the embankments that were there for protection against the sea. That was our case against Deputy Sweetman when he was introducing that Bill.  That is the case with which the agricultural community in that area are faced.  If we had public officials who were so lax in their duty that they handed over this money to foreign Imperialists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What Deputies do not realise is the very serious position that exists in Rosslare Strand where almost £1,000,000 worth of property is in imminent danger.  It has been said that this is a survey.  To my mind it is not really a survey.  What is being undertaken in Rosslare Strand during the coming week is something <Col N="835" /> in the form of a protective measure, in the form of trial groynes.  The amount of money provided by the Wexford County Council was decided in a Bill brought before this House.  As far back as three years ago Wexford County Council decided that they were prepared to provide from £2,500 to £3,000 towards any protective measures of this nature which would be undertaken at Rosslare Strand.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at a new Deputy referring to this matter, considering the vigorous opposition that was offered to the Coast Protection Bill when it was introduced by the previous Government, and considering, too, the vigorous opposition to the proposals contained in that Bill that there should be any contribution from the ratepayers through the local authority concerned.  Now we have Deputy Corry trying to mend his hand, trying to pretend that the ratepayers had agreed to a small contribution.  He stood up in the House during the debate on the Bill and said that the ratepayers would not agree to pay a 1/2d. towards this proposal.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that this has nothing whatever to do with the Coast Protection Bill.  This is an Estimate to supplement the sum <Col N="836" /> of money the Wexford County Council offered three years ago towards the prevention of erosion at Rosslare.  The county council asked the Government to put up a grant to supplement a sum of £3,000 a year for three years as a token of their goodwill and to show the urgency of the problem.  Wexford County Council were not asked for that sum.  They regarded it as a good investment.  The sum now being sought in this Supplementary Estimate is needed in order to put down trial groynes at danger points to prevent further erosion.  That is actually what is happening.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish asked would the Government accept responsibility for the Vote.  I think it was the very forceful case made by public representatives from County Wexford, including Deputy Corish, that, perhaps, helped the Government to realise that this was a very urgent matter, and as a result they have made provision for the survey it is proposed to carry out.  I do not think there can be any objection to it because it is experimental and the amount of money involved is not very considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman said that when his Bill was before the House I was one of those who opposed it.  To a certain extent that is true, but it was the financial provisions of that Bill that I opposed and I asked him would he insert an amendment whereby he would give himself as Minister for Finance, or any subsequent Minister for Finance, power in special cases to give more than 50 per cent. by way of grant from the Central Fund.  Everybody knows from the case that has been put forward for a number of years that the Rosslare Strand erosion is the worst of its type occurring anywhere on our coast and it is to meet that situation that the Government has taken this action.  I shall not make <Col N="837" /> any promises as to what the Government will do as regards the Coast Erosion Bill&mdash;in fact, I could not do so unless I was trying to put it across the Deputies here, and that is something I am not prepared to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £44,800 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>As forecast by the Minister for Finance in his financial statement on 8th May last and in my opening address on the Fisheries Estimate on 4th June last it is proposed to provide an additional sum of over £50,000 in the current financial year for Fisheries Services.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate now before Dáil Éireann is for a net sum of £44,800.  Its object is to provide for certain new services and an expansion of existing ones.</P>
      <P>The new services proposed are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>I am making provision this year for a sum of £7,500 under new sub-head E (6) to cover the initial or preliminary cost of providing one exploratory vessel, which it is hoped to build in an Irish boat-yard.  As I mentioned in my Estimate speech, the need for exploratory fishing work is long overdue and its lack is a great handicap to successful fishing operations in any but the merest fringe of our coastal waters.  This need has become acute in recent years now that the development of the fishing fleet has entered on the phase where the catching power available can be regarded as adequate for the exploitation of immediately inshore fishing grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted in all countries that exploratory work of the kind I have in mind cannot be regarded as within the scope of working fishermen, who have heavy commitments to meet and <Col N="838" /> cannot be expected to devote potential fishing time to the pursuit of problematic catches in untested waters.  It is the common practice in other countries to provide at state expense for systematic testing of fishing grounds and for development of new types of fishing by the operation of exploratory fishing vessels.  As an earnest, therefore, of my determination and the Government's desire to make better use of our fishing resources I intend making a start this year with this important new work.</P>
    <P>A sum of £4,100 is provided under new sub-head E (7) for a training scheme for fishermen.  This scheme was also forecast by me in the course of the debate on the Fisheries Estimate last month.  As Deputies may well know, we have a good fishing tradition but unfortunately we lack educational facilities necessary to make fishing a vocation and worthwhile livelihood. We are, in fact, one of the few maritime nations in the world without such facilities.  Certain measures of a limited nature have been taken for the training of skippers for boats issued under the Gaeltacht boat scheme and my Department has thereby gained valuable experience.</P>
    <P>My intention now is to provide in permanent form a training scheme for fishermen in seamanship, navigation, and modern fishing techniques, etc. The task will not be an easy one but I am hopeful that, as the Government is prepared to provide these facilities, there will be an encouraging response and that we will have young men coming forward who are anxious and enthusiastic to become first-class trained fishermen and skippers.  In the current year I propose to take steps towards the provision of a suitable training vessel and I also intend to initiate shore-based courses of instruction.  A sum of £2,000 is being provided towards the cost of training vessel and a similar sum towards the expenses of trainees. With a sum of £100 to meet incidental expenses, this brings the provision under sub-head E (7) up to the total of £4,100 which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that I am providing an additional sum of £30,000 by way of Grant-in-Aid to An Bord Iascaigh <Col N="839" /> Mhara under sub-head G.  This sum is made up of £25,000 for the provision of two extra fishing boats and £5,000 towards the cost of erecting an ice plant at Dunmore East, County Waterford.</P>
    <P>Moneys for the provision of boats and gear are normally made available to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara by way of repayable advances from the Central Fund but, as Deputies will note, this provision of £25,000 is an innovation. My intention is that at least two boats of 50'-56' type will be constructed and commissioned this year.  I want to be in a position to use them to promote development of the fishing industry at such points on the coast as may prove necessary from time to time, to direct that the boats should be operated in a particular way and land their catch in accordance with certain directions.  The boats will, in effect, constitute a form of reserve of catching power which could be deployed as may be found necessary to promote fishing activity at selected points to meet various needs, e.g., processing establishments, reduction plants, etc.</P>
    <P>An ice plant at Dunmore East is badly needed and it is intended that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will start work this year to make good the lack. Dunmore East has re-developed into an important fishing port of recent years, particularly for herring, and ice is an absolute necessity if the large catches are to be handled and transported in an efficient manner.  The cost of erecting and equipping such an ice plant is estimated at £10,000.  I am including a free grant of £5,000 towards same in this Supplementary Estimate and I also intend with authority of the Minister for Finance to have, additionally, a sum of £3,000 for this purpose issued to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara this year by way of a repayable advance from the Central Fund.  In all, a sum of £8,000 will be made available this year for the ice plant leaving the balance necessary to complete the work to be found next year.</P>
    <P>Of the additional £5,000 to be allocated to the Inland Fisheries Trust £3,000 is being made available from the National Development Fund for the <Col N="840" /> completion of work on the fish farm which is being established by the trust at Fanure, Roscrea.  The balance of £2,000 is required for the purposes of general development work for the improvement of brown trout fisheries being carried out by the Trust and it is proposed to allocate this sum by way of an increase in the Grant-in-Aid of the Trust from sub-head F (6) of the Fisheries Vote.</P>
    <P>Financial provision is also being made for a technical assistance service which has not hitherto been provided for in the Vote for Fisheries.  Prior to the transfer of the Fisheries Administration to my Department in April last, fisheries technical assistance projects were financed from the Vote for Agriculture.  A number of projects are likely to be undertaken in the current financial year and are expected to cost £2,000.  Some of these come within the scope of the technical assistance sub-agreement recently concluded with the United States Government providing for the use by the Government of £350,000 of the Grant Counterpart Fund.  The cost of such fishery projects, estimated at £800, will accordingly fall to be recouped out of Grant Counterpart and an Appropriation-in-Aid of this amount has been provided for.  The remainder of the cost of the technical assistance projects, estimated at £1,200, will be borne entirely on the Fisheries Vote.</P>
    <P>Summing up, I may remark that the gross amount sought by me in this Supplementary Estimate is a sum of £45,600.  Deducting the Appropriations-in-Aid, estimated at £800, the net sum required is £44,800.</P>
    <P>I may remind Deputies that a sum of £3,000 is being made available from the National Development Fund to the Inland Fisheries Trust for their fish farm at Roscrea and that £3,000 will be issued to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara as a repayable advance from the Central Fund in respect of the Dunmore East ice plant.</P>
    <P>The total amount required in the current financial year for sea and inland fisheries, inclusive of the original net Estimate, is £177,000 by way of supply services.</P>

      <P>This Estimate is of some interest in my constituency, more especially because of the fact that in the Budget statement the Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I propose to make available for the benefit of the sea and inland fisheries an additional sum of approximately £50,000.  Of this sum, £45,000 will be used to erect an ice plant at Dunmore East.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When the Estimate for Fisheries came before the House, the Minister never mentioned anything about that.  I asked him about it when I spoke and he did not mention it in his reply.  I was forced, therefore, to ask him about it at the end of his reply and he said that the £45,000 for Dunmore was due to a misprint. That is a rather serious position. I do not agree with the Minister that it was due to a misprint.  The Minister has just said that the fishing port of Dunmore has developed.  There is no question about that.  It has developed under its own steam.  Not one penny piece has it ever got from any Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They got two boats out of a total of 80 boats.  I have all the data here.  I do not come in here <Col N="842" /> to speak without first looking up all the data on the subject on which I propose to speak.  At column 2197 of Volume 160 of the Official Report, in answer to a question I asked on December 12th, 1956, as to the amounts provided and expended from State funds on the provision of plant, machinery and buildings by the Sea Fisheries Association and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, I got the following information:&mdash;Killybegs, £76,000; Galway, £30,000; Dingle, £18,000; Schull, £5,000; Baltimore, £10,000, and Dunmore East, nothing.</P>
      <P>There were 80 boats given to fishermen by the Minister's Department. Dunmore East got two.  I have the figures here.  The questions I asked the Minister from time to time on this matter caused some merriment on the Fianna Fáil benches.  In 1953, a total of 6,000 cwts. of fish was landed at Dunmore East. In 1954, 17,000 cwts. were landed and in 1955, 23,000 cwts. were landed.  That is not a bad record.</P>
      <P>On the 1st May I put down a question asking for the landings at the various fishing ports in Ireland over a period of ten years.  The Minister was not in the House and the question was answered by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who replied that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available from the records of my Department.  The extraction of all the requisite figures would involve examination of particulars relating to some 165 fishing centres, and in my opinion the expenditure of time and effort entailed could not be justified.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will readily find information in the Annual Reports on Sea and Inland Fisheries on fish landings by areas.  If the resources of my Department permit, I will, on request, endeavour to supply him with supplementary information on any particular area which he has in mind.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 18th June, the day on which I spoke on the Fisheries Estimate, the Minister, in reply to a question by another Deputy, said that this information was in a tabular statement and <Col N="843" /> would be published in the Official Report.  I got the Official Report.  The information that I could not get on 1st May was supplied to another Deputy on 18th June.  I was without that information when I was speaking here on fisheries, and it would have been some argument for me.  Here in this tabular statement we have all the fishing ports, from Killybegs right around to Buncrana.  The quantity of wet fish landed at Killybegs was 60,000 cwts.  The quantity of wet fish landed in Dunmore East was 62,000 cwts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If there had been attentive Deputies from Wexford, perhaps fishing in Wexford would have been better developed.  I do not think the Minister or any Deputy should take it amiss that I should speak about this port in my constituency that has developed itself.  I do not think the Minister will take it amiss that I should put it to him that Dunmore should have better treatment.  Dunmore is a port properly developed, with suitable buildings, with deep freeze plant, with proximity to continental markets, and large ships can enter the port and be based there by continental buyers.  There are very few ports on <Col N="844" /> the south coast which can accommodate ships of the large tonnages that can come into Dunmore.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that, when the Budget statement was read here, the intention was to spend the £45,000 in Dunmore.  Now there is to be a scattering of the money and the Minister might be inclined to take the view that Dunmore got along all right down through the years and can get along for another little while.  There is more than an ice plant needed in Dunmore. The room is there; the fishermen are there; the buyers are in the habit of coming there&mdash;Irish buyers, English buyers and continental buyers.  Not only can Dunmore be regarded as a great base for fishing vessels, but it is also a good market for fish and a distributing centre for the South-East.</P>
      <P>I shall deal now with the matter of boats.  I kept storming the Minister's predecessor, the Parliamentary Secretary to the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Oliver Flanagan, in regard to boats and a boat was allotted to the Gaeltacht port of Helvic in my constituency.  That boat is practically finished.  She is even named the Ardmore. Some Helvic fishermen are being trained at present in Galway.  The confusion that seems to surround the giving of Government grants seems to affect this matter and the people concerned are now under the impression that this boat is not coming to Ring. I would like an assurance from the Minister that the boat is coming to Ring.  It is only our due.</P>
      <P>I do not come to this House to belittle any other fishing port.  I come in here to sing the praises of the fishing port in my constituency, to indicate the position of the fishermen at Ring who were promised a boat and for whom a boat was earmarked and two men sent to Galway for training, and to urge that there should be no disappointment about that.  I am sure nobody will blame me for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The British; it was a pity they did not build more of them. It was a pity they had to leave it after them.  Deputy Allen knows the history of Wexford and Waterford.  That port was built by the British administrators for British battleships.  They had to go away and leave it behind them.  The Irish moved in and are using it as a fishing port.  It would have been a fine thing if they had built more of them around the country.  Then we would not have Deputies coming in asking the Minister to spend £2,000, £3,000 or £5,000 on putting up fishing piers.</P>
      <P>I think my argument is reasonable. Here is a fishing port which lands an immense quantity of fish, that has the men and the boats but it has not modern equipment.  It looks as if you are getting the £5,000 from this Vote for the ice plant out of the £45,000 granted.  Dunmore East is being &ldquo;docked&rdquo; £45,000.  There is a good dock in Dunmore East but they did not think they would be in for a &ldquo;dock&rdquo; of £45,000.  I would say to the Minister that he should examine the position concerning the erection of this ice plant for £10,000, £5,000 from one Vote and £5,000 from the previous one. Based on the amount of fish that it landed at Dunmore East it should rate a bigger plant and bigger storage.  It is the storage that would be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister, as <Col N="848" /> Deputy Brennan has given me the opportunity, even though we landed more fish at Dunmore East last year than they did at Killybegs, that our fish was not worth as much as the Killybegs fish because we had not the means of processing the fish, of icing them down, and holding them for a future market.  Therefore, it is all the more necessary that the Minister should reconsider this amount for Dunmore East and supply us some of the other things as they had intended to do at the start on Budget day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much to say on this Estimate except to compliment the Minister on making an effort in a new direction, if you like to put it that way, by providing something that has been lacking for years, namely, the exploratory boat which is urgently required to carry out a job for fishermen which they have not the time nor the facilities to carry out themselves.  I think every fisherman will welcome it and every port, irrespective of where it is situated.  The provision of an exploratory boat is an innovation and will evidently contribute very much to improved landings of fish.</P>
      <P>None of the Deputies in the House should envy any other area where progress has been made, nor should we try to extol the merits of any particular place over and above another place. I think development has taken place in proportion to the effort that has been put into it.  I am not being unkind to Dunmore East, or anywhere else, when I say Killybegs is the premier fishing port in Ireland.  It has become such mainly due to one thing, the hard work, intelligence and endeavour of the fishermen who, with centuries of tradition behind them, have worked hard to make the port what it is to-day.  Any facilities we have got became so obviously urgent, because of the efforts of our fishermen, that they were overdue when we did succeed in getting them.  There was no specialised or privileged treatment meted out to Killybegs port that was not overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to thank the previous Fianna Fáil Government and a previous Minister, who was not Minister for Fisheries, for giving us one of <Col N="849" /> the best piers in the country.  I am glad to say that the rate of progress has now left that pier in a position where we are anxiously seeking an extension to accommodate the great number of boats that are berthed there nightly.  If Dunmore East secures only two boats it is probably because it did not seek them.  These boats cost approximately £12,000 or £13,000 each when equipped and put to sea.  It is a courageous undertaking for a small crew of fishermen to take over one of these boats, put down the 10 per cent. and cover the capital and interest repayment over a short period afterwards.  I think the record in that respect in the fishing port of Killybegs has more than justified any assistance they have got.</P>
    <P>I want to make an appeal to the Minister on behalf of Killybegs.  He has mentioned the question of training, of establishing classes for training fishermen.  I should like to remind him that Donegal Vocational Education Committee have already established the nucleus of a training school at Killybegs out of the limited resources available to them.  We have got itinerant teachers to undertake vocational classes for the benefit of young fishermen who are prepared to apply their skill to the industry in the future.  I hope the Minister will regard that as the nucleus of a maritime training school for young people who are prepared in increasing numbers to take part in the work that is being carried out.</P>
    <P>As the premier fishing port in Ireland we have first call on the Minister for any funds that may be available for the establishment of such a school.  I do not claim that the school should be for the use of the fishermen of Killybegs, or of Donegal alone.  We would welcome fishermen from Dunmore East, Kinsale and anywhere else. It is only natural that we should claim that school.  I do not think any other Deputy will gainsay that claim.  The establishment of such a school will be of great advantage in helping to develop the fishing industry to the stage that we all hope it will reach.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us some more information with regard to the two free-lance boats which he proposes <Col N="850" /> to purchase.  From what he has said it is obvious they will not be based at any particular port, but may be deployed, to use the Minister's own word, to effect and improve landings in such towns and places as may be decided upon.  A little more information on the use of these two boats would be welcomed by those of us who are interested in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I do not want to cast any reflection on Dunmore East or any harbour on the coast; I hope every one of them will prove their worth as time goes on. However, the figure of £415,000 or £416,000 in respect of landings at Killybegs over the past year is not by any means insignificant.  That figure is not due to any modern methods of processing or facilities that have been provided at Killybegs.  It is mainly due to the fact that the fish landed were of a better quality than those landed at Dunmore East.  They were of a different class, if you like.  They were prime fish and were marketable at a higher price.  That is no reflection on Dunmore but it is to the credit of those conducting the fishing operations at Killybegs that they are capable of bringing into the market when it is much needed the best type of prime fish that is available.</P>
    <P>Our landings in Killybegs, in value, if not in volume, are more than double those of any other port along our coast.  For that reason I think we can lay just claim to a certain priority in treatment.  It is not correct to say we have reached a peak of development where we should not seek any further facilities.  We have not reached any such stage.  We are not selfish.  We do not want to take from any other port what they are entitled to but Deputies will appreciate that as a fishing port develops&mdash;over 30 boats are operating at Killybegs at the moment, sometimes many more&mdash;further facilities become necessary.</P>
    <P>In Killybegs we can point to a number of things of which the Minister is well aware since his recent visit there; certainly An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are well aware of them.  In the first place certain facilities are indispensable to a good fishing port.  It would be wrong to say to Killybegs: &ldquo;You have now <Col N="851" /> got what you want.  We are moving to other areas.&rdquo;  Any port feeling that they are entitled to get special treatment from the Department should first manifest that need by their own hard work.  If Dunmore East is doing that I say they are establishing their claim in the proper way.  Killybegs has done and is doing that.</P>
    <P>We have fishermen in increasing numbers seeking boats.  The number of applications has been so great at all times that the board has had difficulty in deciding to whom they should give the boats as they became ready for launching.  That has created further problems for the port, and I hope the Minister for Lands will not follow the line of Deputy Lynch's argument here, that once a port has reached a certain stage of development we should move into pastures new and start to make improvements there.  Those ports should, firstly, be in a position to justify their claim to what they are seeking and then they would find they would get their due share of anything that was available out of the limited resources in the Fisheries Branch.</P>
    <P>We could use millions of pounds in developing fisheries but unfortunately the money is not readily available for that any more than for any other Department. However, as time goes on and as the fishing industry proves itself to be the great industry it can be we will find the Department of Finance more prepared to put into Fisheries the necessary moneys to develop the industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's innovation in providing for this exploratory boat, and also his decision in relation to the two boats which he hopes to use as free-lance boats.  I am not aware as to where they may be docked or where they may be used, but I think the intention is to send them around to supplement the fleet where necessary at different places.  The Minister probably will elaborate on that when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the establishment of a training ship.  Finally I make an appeal to the Minister to make available as soon as possible funds for the <Col N="852" /> provision of a proper training school for fishermen along our coasts.  I would remind him that we have established the nucleus of such a school in Killybegs and the vocational committee would be most anxious to cooperate with any effort he will make to have that school established at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan makes it quite clear that around Killybegs they are not selfish; yet it seems he is most anxious to get a slice of the financial loaf whenever it may be going.  I wish to ask the Minister to clarify a few points.  Firstly, in relation to the training ship, the provision of which we support, I should like some information as regards the appointment of the personnel to that training ship.  What qualifications will be necessary for the members who may be considered as teachers for the new recruits?  How will the appointments be made?  Will the appointments be made by open competition?  If so, I am convinced that applications from many areas may be of such a high standard that such an arrangement would be a great advantage.  Or is it to be confined to the old system against which there is much to be said?  We cannot forget the fact that when introducing the main Estimate the Minister made it quite clear that his intention, with which we agree, was to adopt a system whereby those going into the industry in the future would have the advantage of being educated in handling the most up-to-date equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to get information on the question of trainees.  How will they be appointed?  Will the selection of trainees be confined to zonal areas such as Dunmore East and Killybegs, or have boys from the coastal areas of the West and South-West chances of being selected as trainees?  Many young lads from places other than the two I have mentioned are keenly interested in entering the fishing industry. I believe they should have as good a chance as those in Dunmore East and Killybegs.  I should like to get information on that question when the Minister is replying.  Deputy J. Brennan has drawn attention to the advances <Col N="853" /> that have been made at Killybegs. Nevertheless, the Minister must consider the other ports on the coast in this matter of trainees.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Estimate. I am glad to see that at last a large sum of money is being provided to improve the fishing facilities.  When I see a sum like £50,000 being provided, I recall the previous policy of the Fisheries Branch.  In the Minister's Department for the past two and a half years are lying plans and specifications for an extension of the pier at Ballycotton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion is that some of the £50,000 provided now should be devoted to the proposed extension of Ballycotton pier, the plans and specifications for which have been with the Department for over two years.  Because of the lack of space and shelter for their boats at Ballycotton, many young lads have left the area, some of them going into Irish Shipping Limited.  These young lads were all ready and willing to participate in the fishing industry.  Not so long ago Deputy Bartley, the Parliamentary Secretary, assured us that Ballycotton would be recognised as one of the deep sea fishing ports.  The Cork County Council went to the trouble of employing a consultative engineer to prepare plans for the extension of the pier.  I raised the matter about seven or eight months ago, although it was pretty useless doing so then because the bottom had been torn off the bucket and there were only a few coppers left.  Now that money is available, we are entitled to know what is being done about these plans <Col N="854" /> and specifications.  Have the Department abandoned the policy followed by Deputy Bartley and partly followed by Deputy Oliver Flanagan when he was Parliamentary Secretary?  It seems that if you have not a Donegal accent or a Waterford accent you will not get anything done as regards fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with Deputy T. Lynch's pessimistic observations on the future of Dunmore East, I should like to say to Deputy Lynch, and for the benefit of the people of Dunmore East, that I hope I shall be understood and that my word will be accepted, as Minister's words are generally accepted, when I say there never was a project issued by the Department for an ice plant costing £45,000 for Dunmore East.  That was a genuine mistake in the Budget statement.  If the Deputy accepts that, from the very start, we reckoned for the purposes of Dunmore East's present development, that an ice plant costing £10,000 would be sufficient&mdash; it could be extended later on&mdash;I think it will relieve him of his embarrassment. Deputy Kenneally also approached me because he felt anxious about the matter, and I explained the position to him.  It is quite true that Dunmore East has shown considerable development in recent years and I hope that will continue.  There is room for development in a great many ports, but the difficulty is to devise a policy which will satisfy everyone and at the same time be to the economic advantage of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch referred to the Gaeltacht training scheme and to the possibility that someone training from Helvic might get a boat.  That scheme is in progress but the allocation of boats depends entirely on those who are successful as a result of the tests in <Col N="855" /> the examination imposed, and it is impossible for me to state at the present juncture what the results will be. Naturally everything will be done to satisfy the wishes of all Gaeltacht areas as far as possible as all of them were asked to send people for training. I hope there will be a general all-round success, but it is impossible at this stage to see how it will work out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan spoke about Killybegs.  I am very glad to know that Donegal County Council is showing initiative in desiring to afford educational facilities and I trust in other areas where fishermen require training they will receive similar cooperation.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for me to answer Deputy Desmond in regard to the exact nature of the training.  It depends on the number of people who are offering themselves but I can assure Deputy Desmond and the House in general that the award of training will be on merit and also that the persons appointed to train will be chosen on merit.  That is very essential if we are to get the right kind of people who are prepared to fish and also to fish in deeper waters than hitherto.</P>
    <P>The only other point was that made by Deputy Corry in connection with Ballycotton.  Deputy Corry is correct in stating that a considerable effort was made by Deputy Bartley as Parliamentary Secretary to convene an inter-departmental committee in an effort to shorten the tedious process of seeking agreement between the Department of Finance, the Board of Works, the Fisheries Branch and the local authority concerned in improving harbour facilities.  A certain amount of work was done and then when the financial crisis arose the committee no longer sat and there were quite considerable delays in securing consent from the Board of Works in regard to the development of these harbours.  The plans for Ballycotton are lying with the Board of Works at the moment, not in the Department of Fisheries, but consultation between my Department and the Board of Works on certain points must be completed before firm engineering advice can be expected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> If we are to have any progress in fishing development we must have the same kind of organisation as that established by Deputy Bartley when he was Parliamentary Secretary both for considering minor marine works, where the fishing is not of a very advanced order, and also for planning large-scale harbour development in the future.  We must make up our minds regarding the selection of seven or eight ports on which to concentrate all the aid we can with the view that they might become major fishing ports.  That has been found necessary in a great many other countries where concentration is part of the problem that must be solved.  We shall be in touch with the Board of Works in regard to greater co-ordination and we hope to revive in a more up-to-date form the co-ordination arrangements that were made before so that there will be less delays.</P>
    <P>I might add that it is not easy to get the consent of county councils on many occasions for harbour development works, to have their contributions agreed and also have their agreement to maintenance of harbour improvements when effected, but in view of the emphasis on production which is accepted by everyone now, we may be able to succeed better in that regard than was the case in the past.</P>

It authorises the issue from the Central Fund of the balance of the amount granted for the supply services for the current year.

I take it, if I am correct in that, that the change is purely a change in format and there is no new provision in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to make one or two small comments in relation to a matter to which I intended to refer yesterday on the Estimate for the Department of Finance but which I overlooked.  The Minister for Finance in his Budget statement made it clear that he was proposing to save £250,000 in connection with the Civil Service.  There is one way in which real progress can be made in the cutting down of administrative costs.  Indeed, it is the main way in which such progress can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had started certain investigations and certain work along certain lines and I sincerely hope the present Minister will continue them.  I refer to the <Col N="859" /> delegation of control by the Department of Finance, in relation to certain details of administrative payments, to outside Departments.  There has been, in my opinion, over the years a growth of too much detail referred to the Department of Finance in relation to small matters which come within the ambit of the sub-head of the Estimate already approved by the Department of Finance.  We had prepared a substantial list which was in process of negotiation between the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance in relation to the possibility of delegation in that respect.  I had found that very frequently there was a good deal of administrative time and trouble and, of course, expenditure incurred in the submission for Finance sanction of trifling details, details which were contemplated at the time the Estimate was being framed and which were clearly within the scope of the Estimate.  Progress along those lines will, I believe, in course of time produce some substantial economy in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The other way in which some progress can be made is in relation to the system of accounting.  The business and efficiency firms who examined the Civil Service practices in certain Departments were all quite clear that, if we were to achieve substantial economies on our administrative accounts, we should have to strike out on a new line in certain respects.  It might mean legislation.  It might mean alteration in the system by which the Dáil deals, through the Committee of Public Accounts, with certain details and it might mean the assistance of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest that the transference to a new system is an easy matter or that the way is perfectly clear.  It is however a matter that should be examined, and examined home, and I hope that the Minister will examine the matter home as part of the economy in Civil Service administration, which he adumbrated in the Budget.  For this Party, I want to say that if that examination shows that any new system in relation to accounting is required the Minister for <Col N="860" /> Finance and the Government will get any co-operation we can give them towards making Civil Service administration in regard to payments more streamlined and more efficient.</P>
    <P>The real way in which substantial progress can be made in cutting down the administrative machine is by placing more responsibility on outside Departments.  Because of the necessity for referring every detail to the Department of Finance outside Departments had got into the habit of saying: &ldquo;We will put this up to Finance&rdquo; and the outside Department rarely turned anything down, preferring to let the Department of Finance be the &ldquo;dirty boy&rdquo; in saying &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  That is not the way to have administrative economy. Neither is it the way to achieve efficient administration.</P>
    <P>If the gross amount were settled on the policy decision at the time the Estimate is framed with the Department of Finance, and outside Departments were then left to operate within that framework, that would be more satisfactory and would cost less.  It must carry with it, however, the absolute responsibility that if that delegation is abused and if there is an excess, or, if in relation to any year, the delegated power is utilised to commit the State in future years, such abrogation of responsibility will be taken very seriously by the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>I was trying to get some forecast in relation to Estimates for Departments in future years with a view to ensuring that, when a particular service was introduced, we could say that a Department would have so much this year, so much next year and so much the year afterwards and could plan within that framework.  Having laid down that general line of policy, the detailed administration would be dealt with by the outside Departments themselves without the necessity of coming back to the Department of Finance for sanction for details, sometimes details which involve only a trifling expenditure of £2 or £3.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice knows that there was altogether too much necessity for coming to the Department of Finance for sanction for all sorts of <Col N="861" /> petty details related to the Department of Defence, of which he was Minister, with all manner of cumbersome administrative loss.  If the responsibility is put on the Department of Defence and that Department is told to operate within a certain limit, without sanction, a great deal of the coming and going to and fro could be saved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of the Minister for Defence, who is slightly indisposed, I have been asked to act on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill, as Deputies will see, is mainly concerned with the grant of increases in disablement pensions and wound gratuities, and in certain allowances and gratuities to dependents of deceased persons, payable under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1953.  The increases are effective from 1st August, 1956, and in fact are being paid since that date on the authority of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions passed in this House on the 25th July, 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should perhaps explain that under two previous Acts&mdash;the Army Pensions (Increase) Act of 1949 and the Army Pensions Act of 1953&mdash;disablement pensions and allowances under the Army <Col N="865" /> Pensions Acts were increased generally in accordance with the scale of increases which was applied to other classes of State pensions under the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950.</P>
    <P>The Pensions (Increase) Act, 1956, has in the meantime authorised further increases in these classes of pensions with effect from the 1st August, 1956, and Part II of the Bill now before the House authorises increases&mdash;on the same basis and with effect from the same date&mdash;in the pensions and allowances mentioned in the various sections of the Bill.  The scale of increases &mdash;which extends from 15 per cent. on pensions under £100 to 6 per cent. on pensions of £450 or over&mdash;is set out in Sections 3 and 29 of the Bill.  These percentage increases apply to the original rates as later increased by the Army Pensions (Increase) Act of 1949 and the Army Pensions Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>The Pensions (Increase) Act of 1950 &mdash;that is the one dealing with civil pensions&mdash;applied the principle that no pensioner whose pension was directly related to his pay could receive an increase which would bring his pension above what it would be if his services terminated on the 31st October, 1946, and his rank and service in that rank were the same as on the actual date of his retirement.</P>
    <P>That principle was followed in the Army Pensions (Increase) Act of 1949 and in the Act of 1953 in the cases&mdash; and they arise only for officers&mdash;where pension is computed as a percentage of pay.  The same principle has been embodied in the Pensions (Increase) Act of 1956&mdash;that is the Act dealing with increases in civil pensions&mdash; except that the critical date is the 1st November, 1952, which was the date of a general pay increase both for civil and Army personnel.  Consequently the same principle with the new date has been embodied in this Bill in relation to any pensions of the type concerned. Pensions which are expressed as fixed rates are increased as set out in the tables and Schedules in the Bill and they apply irrespective of the date of termination of service.</P>
    <P>Another general matter to which I should refer deals with the increases of pensions of £450 or over.  Up to <Col N="866" /> this no increases were given where a pension or aggregate of pensions amounted to £450 or more.  Moreover in the case of a pension so near to £450 that the grant of the appropriate increase would bring it above that figure, the increase was limited to such amount as would bring the pension to £450 and no more.  That restriction, or ceiling as it became known, is not repeated in this measure with the result that pensions of £450 or more will receive an increase of 6 per cent.  However, the increases&mdash; as I mentioned earlier&mdash;apply to the pensions as payable under the previous Acts so that the effect of the previous ceiling must be taken into account before the rates of increases now authorised are applied.  This position is achieved by Sections 27, 28 and 29 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Married pensions, that is pensions payable to married men in addition to basic disablement pension, are being increased by a flat 35 per cent. instead of the 25 per cent. authorised in the Army Pensions Act of 1953.  These married pensions vary in such a way that it is not practicable without creating anomalies to include them in the scale of increases which apply to the basic pensions.</P>
    <P>Gratuities payable to wound pensioners, and gratuities to widows and other dependents of deceased persons to whom the Acts apply, are being increased by approximately 75 per cent. These gratuities have not been increased hitherto and the percentage increases now being authorised are therefore higher than those applicable to the pensions and allowances.  Certain educational allowances which were not previously increased are now being increased as well.</P>
    <P>The estimated total annual cost of the increases provided for is £23,330 and the necessary provision has been made in the Army Pensions Estimate for the current year which has already been approved by this House.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill consists of miscellaneous amendments and I shall deal with these now.</P>
    <P>Sections 31 and 39 amend the Acts by relieving the Minister for Finance <Col N="867" /> of certain functions which he exercises in relation to the making of grants of pension, etc.  At present the consent of the Minister for Finance must be obtained before a grant of pension, allowance or gratuity is made under the terms of the Acts.  The amendments embodied in Sections 31 and 39 will remove the necessity for such consent and in future grants will be made solely by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the Minister for Defence introduced a similar measure recently in respect of awards of service pension under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts to former members of the Permanent Defence Force. That measure and these amendments now are part of a general development between the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance aimed at improving administration by removing requirements which are not really essential from an Exchequer point of view but which involve time and administrative procedures which would not otherwise be necessary.  The Minister for Defence is, of course, bound by the terms of the Acts and the interests of the Exchequer will in no way be adversely affected.  On the contrary, official time will be saved and more expeditious clearance of cases as they arise will be possible.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides a new scale of percentages of pay for calculation of pension in the case of an officer of the Permanent Defence Force who retires on or after the date of the passing of the Bill and who may qualify for a pension under the 1923 Act, i.e., in respect of a wound received before 1st October, 1923.  This arises from the introduction of consolidated pay for officers and follows what was done in the 1953 Act in relation to other pensions.</P>
    <P>The next matter dealt with is that of special allowances and various aspects of these are covered in Sections 33,36 and 38.  I shall begin by referring to the fact that the latest date at present laid down for an application for a service medal which, if granted, renders a person qualified to apply for a special allowance, is 5th August, 1954, i e, 12 months after the date of the <Col N="868" /> passing of the Army Pensions Act, 1953. This latest date has been extended from time to time in the past in response to pleas that deserving cases were ruled out by the operation of the previous time limits.</P>
    <P>Section 36 moves forward the date to one not later than 12 months after the date of the passing of this Bill. The prescribing of latest dates for applications generally gives rise to criticism and views are put forward that there should be no closing dates at all.  These views do not take cognisance of the fact that over 35 years have now elapsed since the Truce in 1921 and that as time passes it is more difficult to get satisfactory evidence one way or another on the claims made for service medals.  I feel, therefore, that in the interests of proper verification a closing date must be specified and that the new one now provided for goes as far as can reasonably be expected.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has not yet applied and who considers he is entitled to and wishes to apply for a service medal in respect of continuous membership during the period of three months which ended on the date of the Truce, i.e., 11th July, 1921, should make his application without delay, but in any case within 12 months from the date of the passing of the Bill.  Since the last closing date, i.e., 5th August, 1954, over 3,000 applications for such medals have been received in the Department and these will be validated by this section in so far as the time limit for applications is concerned and no renewal of such applications will be necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 33 deals with the position which arises when, in the case of a person already in receipt of a special allowance, his entitlement to the medal on which his eligibility for the special allowance is based, is impugned by later evidence.  If in such a case the Minister ceases to be satisfied that the medal was duly awarded, then the special allowance is of course stopped.  This section gives the Minister clear cut legal power for that step and it also enables him to restore the special allowance if further later evidence should substantiate the original claim to the medal.  The section <Col N="869" /> operates as from the date of the passing of the 1946 Army Pensions Act which introduced the service medal as a qualification for special allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 38 also deals with special allowances and makes two changes in the existing position.  It removes the obligation placed by Section 43 of the Army Pensions Act of 1953 on a special allowance holder to notify any improvement in his means since they were last investigated on the Minister's behalf.  Experience of the operation of that section since it was introduced has shown that for legal and practical reasons it has been largely inoperative so that its removal is desirable.  In future reliance will be placed on the normal departmental investigation to bring any improvement in means to notice as the most practical way to meet the situation. The other change effected by Section 38 of the Bill is to apply in effect the terms of Section 50 of the Army Pensions Act, 1937, to prosecutions. This provides that a prosecution for an offence under the section may be brought within six months after the date when the evidence to sustain the prosecution came to the notice of the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>Sections 34 and 35 relate to allowances payable under Part II of the 1953 Act in respect of certain deceased persons who had pre-Truce service. Section 34 gives power to the Minister for Finance to review and alter an opinion reached by him in certain cases and to grant an allowance if he should be of opinion that the applicant should be treated as a dependent of the deceased.  Section 35 extends the time limit laid down in Section 6 of the Act of 1953 for applications where an applicant died before a decision was reached on his claim and where another relative then wished to apply.  The position in this respect at present is that the second relative might be ruled out under the existing time limit before in fact he would be aware of his eligibility to apply.</P>
    <P>Section 37 arises primarily as a consequence of the amendments in Sections 31 and 39 which do away with the necessity for the consent of the <Col N="870" /> Minister for Finance to the grant of, among other things, a gratuity to a relative of a person who dies in certain circumstances before an award of a pension, allowance or gratuity is made to him.  This involves the repeal of Section 12 of the Act of 1949 and Section 44 of the Act of 1953.  The section adapts the provisions of those repealed sections to the new circumstances and also extends the benefit of the earlier provisions to the case of a disablement pensioner who dies after the expiry of one award and before a further award has been made.  In such a case a gratuity equal to the amount of the pension which would have been due to the date of death will, as a result of this new section, be payable to any of the relatives mentioned in the section.  The section becomes effective as from the 1st November, 1955.</P>
    <P>The foregoing is an outline of what is contained in this measure and I trust that it will have proved helpful to Deputies in their understanding of it.  If there are any further points on which information or explanation is required I shall endeavour to deal with them when I am concluding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated, the purpose of this Bill is to give effect to what is already in operation, and we have no objection to that.  The Bill is an improvement upon the existing position.  It is not all that I desire but I take it as an instalment and hope for better at some future date.  It will not be the last Bill although I should like to see the last Bill.  It is rather difficult, even with the Minister's speech and explanation, to get down to hard facts as to the sort of cases it will affect.  Generally speaking, I am satisfied with the measure, and I am anxious that it should go into operation as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points upon which I should like to express my appreciation. One is the new departure by the Department of Finance whereby the Department of Defence has not to go back to Finance to get financial sanction for the provisions of the Bill.  It is a tribute to the high standard Defence has been able to establish, that they have been able to secure the <Col N="871" /> confidence of the Department of Finance in relation to this try-out.  Let us hope it will be a real success.</P>
    <P>The extension date for application for the medal is restricted to one year. Goodness knows it is, in a sense, long enough but it is rather hard at the same time that, if for any reason a person did not apply, as a result of this sort of legislation he is prevented from applying.  However, the members of the force have had ample time to apply if they wanted to and the fact that the Minister is now accepting that the 3,000 applicants who were late need not apply again is a very forward step and a very great advantage to the people involved.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to all old committees and similar bodies who are in touch with the Old I.R.A. to make this effort to wind up this matter once and for all. The difficulty of certification is becoming greater every day.  As the Minister very properly pointed out, nearly 40 years have gone by and it is becoming rather difficult to remember everything. It is a problem but I would suggest that, if a company captain and the officers are not available, the battalion officers, or any person who has already certified service in the company area, should swear an affidavit, and that that would be taken as sufficient verification&mdash;that is, where the company captain and the first and second lieutenant are dead, gone away or not traceable.</P>
    <P>There are Old I.R.A. men in the district who hold a military service certificate and if they are prepared to make sworn affidavits in respect of members of that company between 1st April and the 11th July, 1921, the Minister should accept that.  If it were possible to get battalion or brigade officers to certify service it would be all to the good, but it is rather hard with the time lag that has taken place between the time the award was questioned and the granting of it afterwards. I would remind the Minister of the old saying: &ldquo;A thing that comes quickly comes twice&rdquo;, and I would err on the side of the applicant.</P>
    <P>Of course, as the Minister is aware, and as I am aware, there were and <Col N="872" /> there are such grave abuses that it is very hard to rectify the matter.  I am glad the Minister is dealing with the problem and although I do not say that this is the best way to do it, it is better than no development at all.  The difficulty of attestation is very severe. It is my view that the Minister should have also taken power, where a certificate of service was withdrawn and that evidence becomes available that it should not have been withdrawn, to refer the case back to the referee, or to review the case himself.  Where a certificate of service was withdrawn and where it is not possible to come before a referee, but when evidence becomes available that the person was entitled to the certificate, I think the Minister should have taken the power to restore it.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill has been introduced. I regret this was done at the last moment.  However, I felt to-day that it would be a pity to leave it over until we sit again in October.  Therefore, I felt we should deal with it to-day, and I ask the Minister and the House to give it a speedy passage.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as I would welcome any Bill introduced to improve the lot of Army pensioners and to alleviate the circumstances of the Old I.R.A.  I think it should be emphasised to people outside that this is not a Bill to increase pensions but to legalise pensions that have been paid during the past 12 months.  I think the time that has elapsed since these pensions became due would justify a little more generous treatment than it is proposed to give the pensioners in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in Section 36 which extends the time limit for applications for medals.  I also am glad to see the provision made in that section for the payment of allowances to the holders of medals.  This provision will affect many hundreds of Old I.R.A. men.  I regret that in all of the pension Acts so far introduced no provision has been made for the dependent children of Old I.R.A. men killed in action.  Speaking in the Seanad in December last, it was alleged by the then Minister for Defence that some such provision was <Col N="873" /> taken out of the legislation in 1932.  I would ask the Minister if, to his knowledge, any such provision ever existed. At this late hour, I do not wish to delay the House, but I would ask the Minister to give an assurance that in the very near future such provision as has been made for Army personnel would be made for Old I.R.A. pensioners. I would ask if it is the Minister's intention to introduce any such legislation during the coming session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill.  While I shall not discuss what is not in the Bill, I do hope another time will come when provisions we would desire to see enshrined here will be forthcoming.  The question which has perplexed every member of the House over the years is that of the awarding of special allowances to the holders of duly awarded medals.  I do not know what the experience of other Deputies is, but I know that the delays in most cases were exasperating.  In many cases the applicants had died before their cases were finally considered.</P>
      <P>It is a sort of reflection on holders of medals that at one stage it was agreed medals were not, in the terms of the Acts, duly awarded.  I think it is a pity that all medals awarded were not regarded as having been duly awarded.  If we can do anything now to expedite decisions on cases where decisions are pending, in spite of the difficulties that may arise with regard to certification, we would be doing a good job.  Some people wonder why medals were not applied for at the time when the first piece of legislation awarding them was enacted, but when one reflects on what the position was at that time, one can more easily understand why applications were not submitted earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my knowledge, many people who applied for military service pensions and for certificates, and who were refused, became disgruntled and were hesitant about applying for medals. Many of them refused to apply, considering that it was an insult that some emolument had not been awarded by way of military service pension.  It later transpired that the medal carried <Col N="874" /> with it a special allowance award to persons qualifying under the means test.  Then applications were submitted, but it was found that this question of the duly awarded medal created another vexed question which annoyed many holders of medals.</P>
    <P>Between one thing and another, these Acts have proved to be the most controversial pieces of legislation ever introduced here.  The result was that many did not bother applying for medals until they found themselves compelled by circumstances to seek whatever benefits they might derive from one or other of these Acts.  There were, consequently, a big number of applications submitted after the appropriate date.  That is easily understandable when one considers the controversial matters surrounding these Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That, too, was probably a reason for their refusal to apply.  However, they should have realised later on that that was not the case.  Applications were accordingly withheld in many cases.  At the time people were not too pleased with the manner in which their original applications were treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to certification, my experience is that the Department have now become so difficult that very many cases are waiting to be cleared up. Certification is being sought from persons whose whereabouts are unknown and some of whom are dead and gone. So far as I am aware, and I can speak with an open mind on this because I do not have the privilege of being a member of the Old I.R.A.&mdash; through no fault of my own but because I was not born soon enough &mdash;they are not accepting certification from junior officers who are available where the senior battalion or brigade officers are no longer available. I still think that in view of all the cases that have been heard by the board to date we should now be in a position to compile certain authentic information on all major <Col N="875" /> operations that took place in the country during that time.  Having that done in proper form, in a manner which would satisfy those who were in charge at the time, they would have compiled for themselves a good reference work which would make it easy to go into the various cases that might be presented to them now.</P>
    <P>I believe that the board have found much conflicting and contradictory evidence in the course of their duties and perhaps that has made them sceptical in dealing with a good deal of the information that has been placed at their disposal, but I think they should be able to arrive at acceptable information, authentic information if you like, some form of definite information with regard to the different operations in which people claim to have taken part.  The same applies in every county and every battalion area. Applications for medals cover these different operations and I thought it would be possible in the Department at this stage to have had that information compiled in a manner that would at least be a good guide and enable officials to expedite the proceedings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as duly awarded medals are concerned, the board probes and seeks certification from the various officers whether company, battalion or brigade.  I speak subject to correction, but that is my experience.  In fact, at the moment, I find it is most difficult to secure the necessary verification that would satisfy the board in considering cases that have been undergoing investigation for months and months without any hope of a decision yet being reached.  That is possibly due to the board awaiting a return of the forms which are sent out to certify the membership of the applicant.  These forms may not be delivered at all; the persons to whom they are addressed may not be available; they may be dead. I have known that to apply in certain cases where it was most difficult to find any of the people who could verify in regard to the applicant.  Consequently, <Col N="876" /> cases drag on indefinitely without a decision being reached.</P>
      <P>I think a good deal of the blame lies, perhaps, with the surviving officers themselves.  If they got together with the courage of their convictions and made a definite ruling on who was and who was not a member of any organisations which qualified for the award of medals during that period, it would help considerably.  It is well known that abuses have crept in and naturally that has put the board on guard.  They are wary of statements reaching them with the result that it has now become rather difficult to get a decision.  That might be overcome with proper co-operation between the board and the surviving officers and we would at last have reached the stage where these difficulties can be smoothed out.  I think it would be much more serious if one man were left without a special allowance which was due to him than that two doubtful cases should be given allowances that possibly were not due to them.</P>
      <P>The means test is too rigidly enforced.  It is rather difficult to see why pensions have been refused in some cases.  We know of people who have been practically destitute and when they secured a pension or some little allowance and were able, say, to put on their small farm a few head of cattle that they could not previously afford, their means were reviewed and the ownership of the cattle was held against them because of the means test.  I read the letter from the Coláiste Caoimhin here, about a man whose special allowance was drastically reduced and who was made pay back money which was held to have been overpaid because he did not make known his improved circumstances, and his improved circumstances were that he had a premium bull from the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Petty things of that sort are ridiculous and a sensible investigating officer would not take cognisance of them at all in reviewing a case.  I think the Minister would be meeting the wishes of the House if he made it clear to those responsible for reviewing or investigating cases that they should <Col N="877" /> not go into such details as finding out the number of eggs produced by a few hens or whether the man had two cows instead of the one he had when his original application went in.  I do not think such things really reflect an improved position in that man's means in such cases, especially among the small uneconomic farmers.</P>
    <P>It is quite easy to understand that if a Government sets out to operate a squeeze or a so-called economy drive it may become a popular thing for those who are responsible for investigating cases where social welfare or other payments are being made, to attempt to popularise themselves by showing the savings they can effect but it would, I think, be a greater economy if these men were dispensed with altogether thus saving the salaries paid to them and allowing the men drawing a few pounds for their remaining years, which are shortened by the service they gave to the State, to continue to enjoy the few pounds they get after all the difficulty they had in securing it.</P>
    <P>The moneys paid to ex-members of the old I.R.A. are definitely not being paid to any other section of the community and are payments which are diminishing year by year.  They are entirely different from Army pensions which will continue so long as the Army exists.  These pensions are diminishing year by year as the last volleys ring out over the graves of the Old I.R.A. men.  If we are accorded our allotted span, within our lifetime the day will dawn when we shall have them with us no longer and no longer will it be necessary to make an appeal here on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy, irrespective of whether he himself was or was not an active member, should always be ready to support anything which will bring any amelioration in living to those who made the sacrifice in the past, by improving existing legislation and providing them with better benefits.  I hope I am not being presumptuous when I say that I trust we shall have further legislation at a later date to make provision for some of the things for which I would like to see provision <Col N="878" /> made and which are not covered in this Bill,</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill and, like Deputy MacEoin, I am sorry that it is being introduced so close to midnight because there is so little time to discuss it properly.  At the same time, it is better that it should be enacted now rather than that we should wait until the autumn because the benefits it confers will be available earlier to those who seek them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, especially in relation to Section 36.  It is now practically two years since I drew the attention of the former Minister to the need for this provision and, even at this late hour, I am glad that the Minister is bringing in this measure. <Col N="879" /> Like Deputy MacEoin, I would like more time to discuss the Bill but, as he said, &ldquo;he gives twice who gives quickly and with a goodwill&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 36 confers the right on anyone in possession of a medal to apply for a special allowance.  I am sorry the Minister cannot see his way to giving the same increases to the Old I.R.A. pensioners as are given to other sections but in these stringent times I suppose the Government and the Minister could not see their way to making more provision.  Or do they think that these special allowances will offer compensation?</P>
      <P>It is now thirty-five years since these activities took place and the majority of those concerned will be automatically entitled to the special allowance before very long.  I expect that was in the Minister's mind and, for that reason, he did not think it worth while giving any further increases to that particular class.  For that reason, I hope that he will be more generous in the award of this special allowance.</P>
      <P>On the special allowance, I should like to point out that certification is very difficult in a great many cases. The rules of the Department and their implementation appear to be rather strange.  I came across a case a short time ago where an individual applied for a medal and gave the names of the officers in the area who knew him and could, therefore, certify.  Notwithstanding that, a person 40 miles away got a circular asking for certification, a person whose name had not been given and who knew practically nothing about the applicant.  I regard that action as being a way out for the Department to say: &ldquo;We made inquiries and the people did not reply.&rdquo; Such people cannot reply because they know nothing about the individual concerned.  The Minister should look into that.  The people in the immediate vicinity are those who know and they would be the proper people to certify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came across the case of a man who was awarded a special allowance of £126.  His wife was in receipt of an old age pension.  When the husband reached 70, the two pensions were <Col N="880" /> immediately taken into calculation and he now finds himself reduced from £126 to £31 odd.  That is very unfair.  It is unfair that at one fell swoop a man should find his pension reduced by close on £96.  I appeal to the Minister to look into that.  I think it could be remedied by the Joint Directions.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill.  Unlike another speaker, I cannot see that there will be further legislation along these lines because, at this time of day, we should be coming to the end of legislation as far as the Old I.R.A. are concerned.  I am sorry the Minister could not see his way to giving the same increases to the Old I.R.A. as he is giving to other classes.  I take it we shall have to live in hope.</P>

      <P>I have not had time to digest the contents of this Bill completely.  I understand, in connection with certain other parts of the Military Service Pensions Code, there have been cases of failure to apply within the time.  Legislation was brought in in 1953 in respect of widows and dependents of soldiers who died under circumstances of service and the people immediately involved who had recently been the victims of bereavement directly through service.  I understand there were other people who would have come under that category but for the time limit that was prescribed. They are not very numerous but I have one case in mind particularly. It can hardly be done here tonight but I should like that that point would be considered and I can make the case more specifically to the Minister afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to bring about the authorisation of increases which were provided, I think, last August.  Another purpose is to extend the date for the application for medals, which would provide for those who were in need of special allowances an opportunity to apply by reason of the fact that they were holders of a military service medal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the discussion which has taken place on this Bill a number of statements have been made which <Col N="881" /> I do not think could be described as accurate.  First of all, I should say that, as far as the question of verification of these applications is concerned, the delay is attributed, apparently, more to the Department than to the people who have been given as vouching authorities.  In fact, the failure rests mainly with them.  I have experience of Old I.R.A. officers who were written to to verify the service of particular individuals and I know that the persons were alive and well and capable of replying to the communications addressed to them.  Nevertheless, they failed to reply.  The Department must await verification by the persons whose names are given as vouching authorities.</P>
    <P>A period of perhaps a month is allowed to elapse before the vouching authority is again communicated with and, if he again fails to reply, I do not think it is fair to ascribe the delay in dealing with the application to the Department or its officials.  It is due, in the main, to the failure of the persons written to to reply.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that that does not happen generally, but such delays do occur.  While many replies are received only after continuous reminders from the Department, they are received but the delay is usually ascribed to the Department when, in fact, it rests at another source.</P>
    <P>The question of the examination of an applicant's means does not rest with any of the officials of the Department of Defence.  The examination of the means of a person who is in receipt of a special allowance rests with a special officer, not an official of the Department of Defence, and he makes his report and it is on his report that the decision of the Department is made.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that Deputies who think that the special allowance is something to which people are automatically entitled, irrespective of their means, should read the terms upon which a person can secure a special allowance and they will see that the special allowance was originally introduced to prevent what a number of Deputies described as destitution. Any Old I.R.A. man who was <Col N="882" /> described as being in that situation was aided by the introduction of the special allowance and that is all it was originally intended to do.  It appears now, as a result of usage, to have gone much further than that and now we are being asked to take a more lenient view in respect to the means of the individual and to hand out special allowances <i>ad lib.</i></P>
    <P>The officers who have to examine these claims are public servants.  Their responsibility is to the State and they cannot recommend that special allowances be given to people who are not entitled to them.  They are acting in a public spirited manner in this matter. When Deputy MacEoin in the course of his speech referred to the tribute which the Department of Finance was paying to the Department of Defence by eliminating the necessity of the Department of Defence referring matters to the Department of Finance, that was due to the very fair but, nevertheless, strict examination which these officials were giving to claims made by individuals.  In other words, these public servants were ensuring that public funds would not be paid to people who were not entitled to receive them.  The special allowances have gone very much further than it was originally intended that they should go.  They have been improved, both from the point of view of their value as money, and from the point of view that a number of strictures which originally obtained have now been removed.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to members of the House that the following items are now disregarded in the calculation of means: (1) Free maintenance in a hospital, sanatorium or county home, (2) free maintenance by a relative or friend where the provision of such maintenance represents a hardship on the provider.  Every Deputy interested in this matter knows that, at one time, if a relative sustained a member of his family in receipt of a special allowance, that sustenance was taken into account as being valued at so much.  For example, the keep of a man would be valued at 25/- a week and, where he was entitled to receive 30/-, he was only getting 5/-.  That maintenance by <Col N="883" /> a relative or friend is now being disregarded.</P>
    <P>Other items being disregarded are: (3) home assistance, (4) gifts of a <i>bona fide</i> charitable nature, (5) one-half of the amount received by way of national health insurance or sickness benefit, (6) children's allowances.  I think these matters have brought an extra value to the special allowances which, in some cases, are very much higher than service pensions payable to Old I.R.A. men who were awarded pensions for active service.  Also disregarded is (7) any payment made on or after the 17/7/51 in respect of pension under the Old Age Pension Acts, except in the case where the applicant and his spouse are in receipt of such pension, when the amount of the pension payable to the spouse is taken into account.  That, I take it, was the point to which Deputy Gilbride referred. Another item disregarded is (8) the first £30 of a military service pension or disability pension or combination of both where the applicant is under 70 years of age and (9) the profit from transferred property where the Minister is satisfied that the property was not transferred merely for the purpose of qualifying for special allowances.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the points that make a special allowance of very much greater value than it was originally intended it should be.  Special allowances have increased now to such an extent that they provide what might be described as a reasonable provision for men who, through infirmity or other reasons, have reached the stage where they must apply for special allowances. I must point out that people who are in receipt of special allowances, and who did not prove to the Referee that they were entitled to a service certificate, are in receipt of sums very much in excess of that received by members of the Old I.R.A. who were awarded active service certificates for their services in the field.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gogan asked whether any Act prevented a child from being eligible for a pre-truce allowance. There is no Act, as far as I know, which prevents a child from receiving that particular allowance to which he <Col N="884" /> was referring.  We all know that when a child of an Old I.R.A. man who was entitled to that allowance, reaches the age of 16, the allowance granted to the child ceases on its attaining that age. There is no Act which prevents an eligible child from receiving that allowance before it reaches the age of 16.</P>
    <P>With regard to verification for medals, verification will be accepted from any officer who is in a position to give that verification.  It is not necessarily confined to any one, two or three individuals.  It will be accepted from junior officers.  Some of the speakers referred to the fact that there were junior officers who could verify.  If they are in a position to verify, their verification would be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I think that the discussion has been a very reasonable one.  Somebody suggested that perhaps other things could be done at another stage.  Deputy MacEoin himself said there would be other days when a matter of this kind could be discussed again.  If the necessity should arise for further improvements of one kind or another, it can always be brought forward here by an amendment of the Act.  I have no doubt that if such a necessity should arise the Minister concerned would be prepared to bring in legislation dealing with it.</P>

      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill provides that service pensions and disability pensions payable under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Acts, 1936 to 1953, shall be increased by 15 per cent. which is the percentage appropriate to pensions not exceeding £100 under the scale of increases generally applicable in respect of other classes of State pensions.  In no case do pensions affected by this Bill exceed £100 so that the setting out of a scale of increases is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The increases become effective from 1st August, 1956, and are in fact being paid since that date on the authority of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions passed in this House on the 25th July, 1956.  The estimated annual cost is £194 and provision for this expenditure has been made in the Army Pensions Estimate for the current year which has already been approved by the House.  The Bill is, of course, necessary in order to give statutory authority for the increases.</P>
      <P>There is nothing else I think for me to say on the matter unless any Deputy wishes to raise a point.</P>

      <P>While I welcome this Bill, I would make a special appeal to the Minister to reconsider that handful of Connaught Rangers who are outside the scope of this measure, a handful who have suffered for their part in the Indian Mutiny, who have suffered loss of pension rights and gaol and some of whom were sentenced to death.  We know the history of that <Col N="886" /> and we should give recognition to that small group, who are worthy of it.  It is not to the credit of this country that some of those heroes have ended their days in the county home.  I feel they have a good case for the Minister to reconsider.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot promise to do anything arising out of this Bill.  When this Bill was originally introduced every person who was believed to be entitled to a pension under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Bill appeared to apply.  I think they had an organisation at that time which verified the service of the people who are now in receipt of these pensions. I am not aware myself of individuals outside the scope of the Bill to whom the Deputy is referring.</P>

      <P>I shall inform the Minister, but I feel as there has been an extension in the case of the Old I.R.A. these people should be entitled to an extension, too.</P>
