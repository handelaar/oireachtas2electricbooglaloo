      <P>Last night, I was in the process of examining this Budget so far as its provisions affect the twin problems of emigration and unemployment. It is very disturbing to find prominent people in the political field to-day who, when they are in office, seek to suggest that the problem of emigration is not as serious as many people say that it is and who, when they are out of office, talk a great deal about the terrible evils of emigration and unemployment and, then, when they resume office, tell us that some steps will be taken to deal with the abnormal unemployment and abnormal emigration.  These problems become abnormal only when these people take office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That criticism is not directed alone towards the present Government.  It <Col N="1822" /> applies to and is directed towards all past Governments here.  It is very depressing to have to speak here at all on the problem of emigration.  People are fed up listening to all the talk about it.  There is talk from all of us here and there is no practical step whatever taken to solve or even to ease the problem.</P>
    <P>This Budget gives absolutely no hope to those who are preparing to embark on the emigrant ship, no hope whatever that they will have an opportunity of living here and of having security or being employed at home. I heard a prominent Minister seriously suggesting that we would want a new movement here, a crusade, to deal with the problem of emigration.  I do not know whether or not his words have been taken seriously by a new group who describe themselves as the Anti-Emigration Movement.  This country is full of well-meaning people who are ready to start all sorts of silly organisations to deal with major problems and, with all due respect to the people in this movement, I can describe it as nothing but a silly organisation, diverting people's minds from the fundamental methods by which this problem must be tackled.  This movement has been started outside this House in the past week or fortnight and it was only last week that a Minister of State suggested that there should be a crusade amongst the young people here in Ireland urging them to stay at home. I want to ask that Minister very bluntly: stay at home for what and live on what?</P>
    <P>Is it suggested that the young men and women of the present generation have so little spirit left in them that, having no responsibility such as a family, they are prepared to live on the dole or on unemployment benefit for perhaps the next six or 12 months in the hope that they will get temporary employment then?  Is that the suggestion?  Is that what the crusade is for?  I do not know whether or not that Minister thinks he is back in his boy scout days again, but it would appear that he is, or that he is dreaming. As Minister of State, he will have to do something concrete about the problem of emigration rather than <Col N="1823" /> talk about a crusade among the younger generation and suggest that that can solve it.</P>
    <P>The problem of emigration can be solved only by State action, Government action.  In the process of solving the problem, many people will be hurt. The trouble with Governments here is that they are prepared to tread on the toes of the weaker sections of the community and bow and scrape to those in the vested interest group. Until some Government is prepared to take the necessary action and to deal with the vested interests that obtain here and that have strangled the country for the past 30 years&mdash;and I hope that will be in the near future&mdash; we shall not see the necessary steps taken to put into operation the remedies that may in time end emigration.</P>
    <P>I never suggested in this House that emigration could be ended overnight. One just cannot do it by turning on a new policy, but if we are to see an end to emigration we will have to see the outlines of a policy that will at some stage reduce emigration.  We have not seen any sign of such a policy.  We have not seen any sign of it in this Budget or any Budget since I came into this House and I think Deputies will agree with me that there was little sign of it in previous Budgets.  We have two different views about this matter of emigration.  One group of people say: &ldquo;Do not go away, there is work for you at home.  Start a crusade, encourage young people to stay at home.  Put your hands in your pockets, hold up the unemployment exchanges and draw your unemployment benefit.&rdquo; That is the mentality on one side.  On the other side you have the people who say it is a good thing that people emigrate and say: &ldquo;Look at the wonderful spiritual empire which we have abroad.&rdquo; It is a free country, I hope, and everyone is entitled to his views.  I for one do not subscribe to that view.  I think it is a tragic illusion if these people really believe that.</P>
    <P>We have not got a spiritual empire abroad any more than we have any consultation with the man in the moon. The majority of our Irish emigrants, <Col N="1824" /> whether in America or Britain, got the menial jobs and became labourers and maids in those countries.  The majority of our emigrants were sent out of this country with a very, very low standard of education which was a disgrace in a so-called Christian country.  It is a disgrace to have to say that the majority of the unfortunate people who had to emigrate were handicapped by a poor standard of education.  The greatest tribute that can be paid to them is that in spite of the handicap of a low standard of education many of them succeeded in reaching high positions.  The fact is, however, that for every one that was able to reach the top a thousand stayed at the bottom.  It was not their fault; it was the fault of all the Irish Governments since we achieved the measure of independence which we have to-day. It is pitiful to suggest that we should keep up this huge stream of emigrants in order to change the outlook of the peoples of the world.</P>
    <P>It was only recently that a number of representatives of tourist agencies on the Continent were brought to this country and they admitted, quite frankly, although it was not a diplomatic thing to do, that the majority of their countrymen did not know where Ireland was.  They knew that there was such a place but they never heard of this spiritual empire.  I am not the only person talking about this claptrap about letting our people go abroad so that we will have a place of glory amongst the nations.  St. Patrick's Day is a great day all over the world so far as Irish people are concerned but the fact is that there are more Irish people celebrating St. Patrick's Day outside the country than inside it.  Dr. Lucey, the Bishop of Cork, said that it was a disgrace that there are more people celebrating St. Patrick's Day outside Ireland than were celebrating it in Ireland.  He said that it was no credit to any Government that that position obtained.  I agree thoroughly with Dr. Lucey's remarks in that regard.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he said that the ills which exist in this country are deep-rooted.  They will not be <Col N="1825" /> solved by day to day measures.  They will not be solved in this House by the Taoiseach getting up and stating that during the inter-Party régime more people were unemployed and more people left the country than during the Fianna Fáil régime.  That is claptrap.  The tragic position is that since 1922 more people have left this country due to economic circumstances than ever left it during any comparable period under an alien Government, that is, with the exception of the famine years.  That position reflects no great credit on Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or on the inter-Party Government.  The serious pouring out of the best blood of the country is something that can be laid at the door of all political Parties.  I cannot be accused here of being prejudiced in favour of the inter-Party Government. To be fair let all Parties carry the blame for this run of emigration and the high rate of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I think it deplorable to have men who are looked upon with such great respect by the people as is the Taoiseach, coming in here and suggesting that the country was on the right road, that the forward march of the nation was halted by the inter-Party Government and then to find his own Minister for Finance and his own Cabinet Ministers contradicting him within two hours by stating that policies on economic matters have proved unsuccessful.  The Taoiseach cannot have it both ways.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that we will have to embark on a new line if we are to solve our difficulties.  It is tragic to have a man with such a responsible position in the country trying to suggest that the evils of unemployment and emigration are the result only of the lackadaisical policy of the former inter-Party Government. The former inter-Party Government carried out the policy of Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil in turn went on with the policy carried out by the inter-Party Government.  The very same type of framework is in the Budget statements; they all run on the same lines.</P>
    <P>In 1952 the then Taoiseach said that the Budget had to be balanced in order <Col N="1826" /> to help us to maintain our political and economic independence.  The very same thing was trotted out by him this day week.  It would appear that everything in the garden was rosy from 1952.  In 1953 things were better and in 1954 things were better still.  Then he disappears out of office and everything begins to lag.  Is that what people are asked to swallow?  According to Deputy Childers, in 1952 the people were spending too much.  It became necessary to put hair shirts on them to keep them from thinking in terms of luxuries.  The people were drinking too much, smoking too much.  Deputy Childers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Lands said there was too much drink consumed, too many cigarettes smoked, and the suggestion was that the drink was all consumed by Irishmen.  What he did not take into consideration was that visitors from abroad play a big part in the consumption of liquor, especially in the consumption of what I would call luxury drink&mdash;spirits. Whenever we have an increase in the consumption of liquor, we also have a Minister for Finance to tell us that the consumption of liquor has increased and could bear another tax.  That is said despite the well-known fact that consumption of liquor goes up because of the quantity tourists drink.</P>
      <P>If we are to encourage these people to come we must give them something that other nations do not.  The least we can do is try to keep down as much as possible the cost of some commodities. As I have said, we cannot say that our people are drinking too much, because we must take into account the fact that a big proportion of our liquor consumption is due to the presence of visitors from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened very carefully to the contribution of the Taoiseach.  I think somebody will have to explain to him, burst the bubble, in relation to the comparison he made between the running of the State and the running of an ordinary household.  Deputy Dr. Browne and other Deputies explained how misleading the over-simplification <Col N="1827" /> of Deputy de Valera is.  There is no doubt that when you listen to him making a comparison, if you do not look into his suggestions very carefully you begin to believe them.  The trouble is that a large proportion of the people just listen to him casually and take his comparisons as the ordinary newspaper reader does his headlines without bothering to read the small print. Deputy de Valera&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <P>The Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach makes a simple case as to how the country should be run, saying it should be run on the same lines as a household is run.  He is famous for that kind of comparison.  Sometimes it goes down well and convinces a large proportion of the electorate.  Briefly his explanation is this: the housewife and the family work on the same basis in regard to their finances as does the State.  We all accept that the duty of the head of the family is to arrange that expenditure is kept within the means of the family.  If, on examination of the family financial account, the husband and wife find that things are not going too well and that they will be in a serious position the following year if they do not prune, they must take steps to curb their expenditure. Naturally they cannot keep on living on the Kathleen Mavoureen system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach says the same thing applies to the State&mdash;that the Government is in the same position in relation to the country as the housewife is to the family.  I suggest that when the housewife finds that at her present standard of living she cannot make ends meet, whether she lives in the upper stratum or the lower, she makes her cuts on luxury articles.  Let us take the wealthy family first.  When they find they are not able to keep up their former standard of expenditure, they will first look to their luxury car and decide that they could do with a smaller car.  Another family might decide to do without their holidays on the Continent or their fortnight in Ballybunion, in Lisdoonvarna or Salthill.  In still another family the <Col N="1828" /> housewife would decide to reduce her consumption of cigarettes while the husband would cut down on his liquor.</P>
    <P>Families decide to take various steps like that.  However, the last step they would think of taking would be a reduction on essential foodstuffs. When a family find that things are tight they will not cut down on the number of loaves they at present eat; they will not cut by half the amount of butter consumed.  Neither will they cut down on milk or on tea.  If they did any of these things they would be unfit for the responsibilities of parents.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach wants to pursue his comparison of the Government with heads of households, then he will have to take the same logical steps as the husband and wife would.  But his Minister for Finance did not start as the head of a family would have done; he did not start by pruning the luxuries.  For a start, the Minister for Finance did not suggest that the Government would get rid of the luxury embassies we have abroad, on two of which we spent something like £500,000.  He did not suggest to the President in that palatial establishment in the Park: &ldquo;We will trim your sails for you; we will cut your expenditure in the coming year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance did not say: &ldquo;We will get rid of these obsolete jet aeroplanes and try to use the proceeds for some productive purpose.&rdquo; He did not take any action in connection with these non-essentials.  He did not suggest that the Government would get rid of the luxury motor cars in which the Ministers drive from their place of abode and instead provide them with baby Fords or Anglias. Instead, the action that was taken was to the detriment of the poorer sections of the community who now must pay more for and consume less of the essential articles of their diet.  With one stroke they removed the subsidy on bread and butter.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should be more realistic when he makes comparisons in this House between the running of the State and the running of a family.  I would agree with his comparison if he were prepared to take the same steps as the <Col N="1829" /> head of a household takes in the balancing of his books, but, unfortunately, his comparison fits only on the surface.  When you make a real and close examination you find there is no true comparison at all between the running of a State and the running of a family.  There are vast resources at the disposal of a State which are never available to a family.  I do not know whether or not the Government believe such resources&mdash;exist or whether the Government realise that the country itself, the manpower in it and the undeveloped assets we have in agriculture and so on, are, in themselves, first class assets.  I do not think these things are taken into consideration at all.</P>
    <P>The Budget itself is something which has come as a shock to the community, but it did not come as a shock to all the community.  Some time has elapsed since the Budget statement was made and it is interesting to see how the Budget impositions were received and the reactions among various sections of the community to them.  That is the truest picture you can get in regard to the people whom this Budget hits and whom it favours.  If you give a man a prod of a pin, he will react; on the other hand, if you give him a £5 note, unless for a very doubtful venture, he will smile and be happy.</P>
    <P>We will see where the praise came from and where the criticism came from, and let us see whether the praise or the criticism was justified.  I should like to ask this House who welcomed this Budget.  Was it the man whom the Taoiseach describes as the man with modest means who welcomed the Budget?  Was it the small income group?  Was it the salaried worker? Was it the small farmer who welcomed it or was it the unemployed man?  Did any of these sections, or any representative of these sections of the community speak one word of welcome or praise for any part of this Budget?  We have the various daily papers with their reporters going around the country taking the views of representatives of the different sections of the community.  These papers are tripping over themselves to publish the reaction to the Budget from the various sections of the community.  Was there printed <Col N="1830" /> from any of the sections I have mentioned one word of welcome or praise for any part of the Budget?  I have not seen any word of praise and I made a close examination of most of the daily and weekly papers.</P>
    <P>I have seen a welcome for the Budget as outlined in some of the papers from representatives of certain sections of the community.  I have here a copy of the <i>Irish Press</i>, dated Thursday, May 9th, 1957, and the headings are: &ldquo;A Realistic Budget: Commerce Chiefs on Dr. Ryan's proposals. A Realistic Budget ... a Facing up to the Problem ... a Step in the Right Direction.&rdquo; I will just quote one or two of the individuals who are reported here as commenting upon the Budget.  Mr. J. W. Gallagher, President of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>He is no relation of mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The patriotism of the people is being put to the test.  Are they prepared to work for Ireland, in Ireland, and accept cheerfully the sacrifices they have been called upon to bear so that the nation may obtain the necessary breathing space to enable it to survive economically?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the President of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  He specifically asked whether the people were prepared to accept cheerfully the sacrifices they have been called upon to bear.  Was he talking about the members of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce when he spoke about sacrifices?  Will anybody in this House tell me what problem does it present to one of these individuals to pay 2d. or 3d. more for the loaf of bread, or what hardship is imposed on one of these gentlemen by the Budget in regard to the loaf of bread, or what hardship is imposed on his relations and household with regard to the purchase of the same quantity of butter? Is there a burden put upon them to wave the green, white and gold flag because they are sacrificing themselves <Col N="1831" /> for the future of this State?  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On more occasions than one the Association of Chambers of Commerce of Ireland in budget submissions to Ministers for Finance had stressed that for years past they had been living beyond their means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think these people are living in cloud-cuckoo land when they talk about people living beyond their means.</P>
    <P>Here is a quotation from a past President of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, Mr. F. M. Summerfield. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In common with other taxpayers, I do not relish increased taxation. But at least it must be said of the new taxes that they should yield the maximum amount to the Exchequer, as the collecting of them will not require any increase in administration charges.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has given a simple but realistic cure for our present economic difficulties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I, like other Deputies, subscribe to the view that many of our manufacturers and industrialists are doing their job, but I also subscribe to the view of leading members of the Opposition and the Government that many of these Irish manufacturers and industrialists who speak and preach to the public are themselves hiding behind tariff walls and failing ignominiously to do their duty to the State.</P>
    <P>It is too bad that all the burdens and the hardships must now be borne by the weaker sections of the community, while these same gentlemen who preach about the duties of the ordinary citizen themselves take no action to improve the situation financially by expanding production and getting into the export market.  Yet Governments are prepared to listen carefully to the advice given by these gentlemen, some of whom I have referred to here in quotations.</P>
    <P>The same type of people to whom I referred here, namely, the Chambers of Commerce, industrial groups and the <Col N="1832" /> company directors welcomed the 1952 Budget.  But, in the welcoming process, they pointed out at the time that they were disappointed that certain other facilities, inducements and encouragements were not given to them in order to ease the burden of taxation and give them, perhaps, a further incentive to expand.  You can take it that the Minister for Finance has heeded the expressions and admonitions of these gentlemen who spouted about giving them further facilities in 1952. He has listened to them with a sympathetic ear in the 1957 Budget.</P>
    <P>I have here a report of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of Ireland in regard to the 1957-58 Budget and in the course of their pontifications on situations obtaining in the State they point out what they want for themselves, after telling the Minister how the people are living beyond their means and how the balance of payments problem exists.  They state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The association is pleased to note that during the past year the Minister has introduced the initial allowance principle and that 20 per cent. of the cost of machinery and 10 per cent. of industrial buildings, will in future be allowed as a deduction in income-tax assessments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They go on to say that this will encourage business firms who have available capital to re-equip and modernise their plants.  This is the kernel of the paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some disappointment must be expressed, however, that the Minister did not see his way to increase the existing wear and tear allowance. No alteration in the wear and tear rates has been made since the State was established, although the British authorities have made several increases in that period.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister, amongst other helps he gave them, made sure that that particular request was granted because, in column 952 of the Budget statement, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I propose to lessen the tax burden upon trading profits by providing an accelerated depreciation allowance for plant and machinery <Col N="1833" /> (other than vehicles).  This will take the form of a 25 per cent. increase in the present rate of wear and tear allowance and will have effect as from the year 1958-59.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say, of course, that there will be no cost to the Exchequer in the present year, but every complaint that has been made over the years by these people who sheltered behind the tariff walls has been met, if not in the particular year in which it was made, in a year or two afterwards. They have got what they wanted but the public have not got the return in increased exports and increased employment as a result of the extra facilities granted to these people.  I would not have the least objection to these people getting facilities if, as a result, they showed signs of appreciating them by expanding their output.</P>
    <P>As I said, the section who welcomed this Budget was a limited section in the commercial field.  The ordinary sections of the community did not welcome it.  As a matter of fact, I was listening to the welcome which the unemployed had for it the other night. At the moment we are welcoming tourists into this country.  Down in Dame Street, a first-class band is welcoming visitors every night and showing them what a beautiful place Dublin is by playing music, and helping the visitors to get into a good frame of mind before they go to bed.  Inside the rails at Dame Street the band was playing &ldquo;A Nation Once Again&rdquo; and outside the rails there must have been three or four thousand Dublin people singing &ldquo;Starvation Once Again&rdquo;. That was the welcome which a great section of Dublin citizens had for this Budget and, so far as they were concerned, that parody on that well-known song portrayed the situation existing amongst that part of the community in Dublin.  Remember, there is nobody like the Dublin man to put his finger on the spot.  It is a danger for the Government to find any section of the community in that position to-day.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Budget weigh heavily in favour of the industrial and commercial groups.  That is an extraordinary <Col N="1834" /> position to find, especially in view of the fact that over the years we have had warnings and admonitions, first given since I came into this House by Deputy McGilligan.  His severe admonition to these sections was that if they did not play their part in expanding output and increasing the wealth of the country he would have to impose further excess profits tax on them.  He followed that line for a number of years and Deputy Lemass, as I have already pointed out, skipped lightly over that warning of Deputy McGilligan.  He did, however, give a warning to a certain section of the community, that section which had tariff walls and levies on products coming into the country, in order to strengthen their business here at home, that if that section did not respond to the protection given by increasing their output, a complete reexamination of all these tariff protections would be made.  That is Deputy Lemass's way of repeating the threat made by Deputy McGilligan but, in spite of all the threats made, that section made no attempt to get into the export markets.</P>
    <P>It took the setting-up of a State body, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, to bring about any concerted move to get into foreign markets.  All credit to them even though the result of that board's activities has been limited so far.  Had it not been for State interference private enterprise would have failed to meet its obligations. We have heard a lot of talk here of what private enterprise could do if given a free rein.  That means giving them Government grants, giving them increased wear and tear allowance and not attempting under any circumstances, to interfere with them because it is freedom that they want.  Freedom for what?  Is it freedom to sit down comfortably behind the tariff walls, to keep the company directors and the people who run these activities in luxury, to enable them to go to the Continent, to America, run their cars, their yachts and all the rest?  Then they say to the community that we should be thankful to have them here to give a little employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass and others have <Col N="1835" /> pointed out that there was to be no more feather-bed treatment of these gentlemen, that this feather-bed treatment would cease.  Instead of a little chastisement, or at least a plea to these people to accept the same burdens and the same sacrifices as the rest of the country we have had this Government coming in and giving them tremendous easements.</P>
    <P>The distilling industry should possibly be the second or third most important industry in this country. What was the position in regard to that?  We had the Irish Pot Distillers' Association here for the past 30 years making absolutely no effort to break into the American or foreign market&mdash; not an attempt.  I may say that I was the first Deputy in this House to spotlight the position.  I went so far as to invite all these pot distillers to a meeting.  Perhaps it was impertinent on my part to suggest such a thing. However, I suggested they should come together and see if they could get agreement as to putting all their resources together in order to get into the export market.  I was told by them to mind my own business.  Some went further.  Yet these very people will get concessions in this Budget.  They allowed the Scotch distillers to walk into the American market and build up a trade there worth £40,000,000 to Scotland while ours is worth approximately only £280,000 per annum to us.  Nevertheless, in order to expand, these people will be given special facilities. I do not know where we will end.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that in many of these distilleries the guiding influence and the people who control them have no respect for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or any Government in this country since 1922&mdash;none.  Yet the Governments of this country are prepared to bow and scrape to these people.  Facilities are being given to them and they are going to try to put on the American market a product that will get nowhere.  However, I shall go into that matter in more detail on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>We have another section.  I have said that the distilling industry, from <Col N="1836" /> the farming point of view, industrial point of view, employment point of view and the point of view of export possibilities is to my mind next to the cattle trade in importance, if developed.  But developed it must be on the right lines.</P>
    <P>Let us take another group&mdash;the car assemblers.  I do not suggest that their business is in the same important sphere as the distilling industry.  I do not want that even suggested.  But here is what I can describe as a hot-house plant.  These people give, I believe, pretty good employment here in Dublin.  However, the main justification for their existence in this State is the employment they give.  They have got special facilities under this Budget to keep up the employment.  But, on the overall picture, who is subsidising them?  Why was it necessary to remove the subsidy from bread, an essential foodstuff, and leave the subsidy there as it is in the Budget for the motor car assemblers, because that is where the subsidy is left?  There is a subsidy for all these hot-house industries.  The subsidy is there, hidden or otherwise. It is in the Budget.  But the subsidy for the essentials of life for the community has been removed ruthlessly.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government have made any attempt to spread the hardships, even admitting that these hardships were necessary or that this finance had to be raised.  I do not think they made anything like a careful and reasoned examination of them at all.  I think it was a case of the easiest way out for them&mdash;of grabbing the handiest money and grabbing it from the easiest source.  We know that if they had taken it from other sections of the community there would have been a howl from the various organisations and that pressure would have been brought to bear on the Cabinet. Naturally enough, taking it from the human point of view, it would be very hard for any Minister or the members of any Government to hit those closest to themselves.</P>
    <P>The facilities in this Budget are given to one particular section in the community in the hope that these people will respond and expand.  There is the hope that they will respond by <Col N="1837" /> getting further output, and, by further output, that they will get into the export market and thus help us to give more employment here at home. Of course, the object of getting more employment is highly desirable.  It is absolutely essential.  However, I have grave doubts that the methods which have been adopted will achieve that result.  Instead of giving these facilities to these gentlemen, I think that if any facilities were being given they should have been given first of all to the real primary producer, that is, the farming section.  In this Budget, the only aspect of agriculture which I see dealt with is in connection with the sum of £250,000 which is there in order to get markets abroad.</P>
    <P>No matter what Senator Moylan, the Minister for Agriculture, may say, or, for that matter, no matter what any member of the former Government may say about the desirability of giving first-class facilities so far as the expansion of agriculture is concerned, when it comes down to practical matters such as facilities for expansion such facilities are not given to agriculture but to this sheltered industrial section.  I think a fundamental reexamination must take place there.  It is quite possible that, on examination of a lot of these so-called industries, it would be found that a certain justification could be given for the protection but I am quite sure that a number of them would go to the wall.  However, it need not be necessary for them to go to the wall overnight so long as provision is made, while dealing with their position, to expand agriculture and industries based on agriculture.  If you took the necessary steps in time to expand agriculture and to develop further industries based on the land you could absorb into those industries the people who might be displaced in the hot-house industrial concerns.  Not alone would you absorb these people from industries which might not be able to hold their heads above water but you would also be able to absorb more and more from the present stream of emigrants.</P>
    <P>There is no good in saying that since 1922 the position of the farming community and of the man in the street <Col N="1838" /> has improved in this country.  In spite of the fact that the revolutionaries from 1916 to 1922 helped to change the Flag, to change the colour of the letter boxes, and so forth, the hard fact still remains that although the British gentry may have packed their bags here in 1921 and 1922 they were replaced by worse.  The present-day snobocracy in the shape of company directors and sheltered hot-house industrialists who have taken over have left the ordinary man in such a position that he is worse now than the serf in feudal times.  I need not go further than that.  His position is more tragic than that of the feudal serf because the feudal serf had no say in his condition, had no recourse to a ballot box, had no means of improving his position.  However, the ordinary man in the street to-day has the right to cast his vote in a secret manner and, by casting it, to select his Government. Is it any wonder that this new elite have nothing but contempt for the ordinary people when we see the results that come from the ballot boxes?</P>
    <P>Since this State was formed a new set of parasites has been created. They have been allowed to rise up here while the fighting revolutionaries were dealing with the serious political problems.  The tragedy of it is that the thinking men amongst the revolutionary group are gone from us.  It would appear that many of those who were left thought purely in terms of political freedom in the sense that they thought that by changing the Flag and by having our own Army and so forth, in time things would improve. I regret that it would seem, looking back over the past 35 or 40 years, that no real thought was given by many of our honoured heroes as to what kind of social and economic structure would be set up here when political freedom was established.</P>
    <P>I regret to have to say that.  It is very hurtful to have to say that priority has been given all the time to this question of aping the outward symbols of power to be seen in great nations.  We got the Flag changed and we proceeded then to set up a palatial establishment in the Park.  To-day we have an Army composed of lieutenants-general, <Col N="1839" /> colonels and other high-ranking officers.  We have some of the most luxurious embassies abroad trying to compete with countries that have material resources 1,000 times greater than our own.  We have forgotten the fundamentals and concentrated on the external signs of freedom. Until there is a complete reorientation or change of mind in regard to that, I am afraid we shall get no cure for the ills that beset us in this country to-day.</P>
    <P>It is very tragic to look back over the last 35 years and study the attempts made by the Irish people to assert themselves and to secure a change in the economic and social spheres.  A number of steps forward were taken, then there was a marking-time and a stepping back.  At the start, Cumann na nGaedheal got their opportunity in the social and economic spheres.  Their record is best passed over; the least said about it the better. Then we got 16 or 17 years of Fianna Fáil.  Now we hear about all the difficulties of that period.  We had the economic war and the World War After that, we had the inter-Party Government coming along and we had the Korean war.  There was always some misfortune, some excuse given by each Government which prevented them carrying out the great expansion they desired.</P>
    <P>When each Budget came along there was always an excuse that some imposition in it was due to a crisis abroad.  The Korean crisis has been trotted out here for years.  Even in regard to the present Budget we have traces of talk&mdash;I must say principally from the Opposition&mdash;about the Suez problem, that it had a big bearing on the deficit to be seen in the Budget and that we did not get as much into the accounts because of it.  All down through the years we had the attempts of the Irish people to get here in Ireland a suitable economic programme that would give a chance to the majority of our people to live here at home in security and to rear their families&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you say so, Sir, I shall not pursue the matter further except to say that down through the years the Irish people tried the different political Parties in the hope that the necessary change would come.  We have reached the stage now that you have certain sections of the community who say: &ldquo;What is the use of supporting any of these Parties? Why recognise Dáil Éireann at all?&rdquo; That is the serious situation emerging from this.  The younger generation have lost hope or are beginning to lose hope in this establishment.  I think that is a terrible tragedy.  The political Parties may have been bad in the past. I agree they failed on many of the fundamental issues.  That failure has given the opportunity to people outside the House to say that nothing can be done within the House and that steps should be taken outside.  There is nothing in this Budget to counteract that type of propaganda, which is drawing new recruits into the ranks every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am entitled to emphasise the seriousness of that situation.  Over the years the failure of the political Parties to put an economic policy into operation to solve emigration and unemployment has meant that outside this House every politician, whether an Independent or a member of a Party, is now looked upon with suspicion and contempt by the public.  I had always believed that it was a proud and honoured position to be elected by the people.  However, outside the House we now hear nothing <Col N="1841" /> but bitter criticism of the members of this House, no matter to what Party they belong.  It is said they are all the same, that one cannot trust them, that they say one thing and do another.  How is that to be remedied? It will not be remedied by the harsh impositions of this Budget.  There is no hope that the sentiments prevailing to-day will be removed and that instead a sense of hope and pride in the country will be restored.</P>
    <P>We are very mixed up in our thinking here so far as social and economic matters are concerned.  We kneel down and adore at the altar of private enterprise. In any speech he makes, every public representative of any standing is always anxious to point out how much each Government depends on private enterprise to solve our problems here.  It is accepted, both by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, that private enterprise, perhaps helped here and there by State subvention, will solve our problems here, such as those referred to in the Budget statement. Is it not a fact that private enterprise got its opportunity in this country for 35 years and has it not been proved that, over those 35 years, nothing of a really progressive nature has been accomplished by it that could not have been better done by the State?  Is it not also a fact that, in the majority of the cases where the State did take over, a first class job was done?</P>
    <P>Surely, then, we should forget all about this talk of private enterprise and this idea of having to give further incentives to private enterprise, because, if we do that, private enterprise will produce.  The argument is advanced that there is no red tape in private enterprise and so these people are in a better position, since they are not subject to red tape and regulation, to expand production and to get markets for increased output.  Is it not a fact that these are the very people who have failed so ignominiously to get a foreign market?  Is it not a fact that it was not until the State stepped in that there was any sign of a foreign market at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to pursue this, but I shall say a word on a matter that was discussed here and for which there is provision made in this Budget.  I refer to Irish Shipping Limited.  Certain facilities are being given here to Irish shipping.  I am one of those who welcome any expansion in Irish shipping&mdash;I am sure most Deputies do&mdash;but I would like the Minister to tell us: Whither Irish shipping as far as this Budget is concerned?  What is the aim?  Is it the intention that we should provide money under this Budget to expand Irish shipping, so that ships under the Irish flag can be hired out to foreign countries to ply in world ports?  Is it not a fact that at the moment many of our Irish ships have never seen an Irish port, except once in a blue moon?  Is it not a fact that they are hired out to trade between other countries, chartered out to serve other nations? Is that the aim?  Or will the aim be, as was originally intended, that Irish ships will serve first the needs of the Irish nation?  I know perfectly well the profits to be made in hiring out our ships, but I think it is a very foolish policy on which to embark.  It is a foolish programme to build Irish ships and hire them out to serve other countries, when, at the same time, we have such a dire shipping problem here in connection with our trading between Ireland, Britain and the Continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is agreed that our cattle trade is our main source of income.  That trade is to-day completely dependent on outside transport in order to reach the British market.  We have no say in the transport of the produce of our main industry to British markets.  What attempt has ever been made to solve that stranglehold by providing Irish <Col N="1844" /> ships?  Was it ever intended that our ships would compete with British shipping in that regard?</P>
    <P>Provision is made in this Budget to expand our agricultural market on the Continent.  Have we the means by which increased production in agriculture can be transported to the Continent? Over the years, we have made a number of trade agreements with European countries whereunder we supply certain commodities to those countries and, in return, we take certain commodities from them.  Has not the balance always been in favour of the other country?  Have we ever been in a position to provide the necessary Irish transport to implement our bargain?  No.</P>
    <P>The time has come when we shall have to have a complete reorientation in our policy and outlook.  Instead of thinking in terms of symbols of freedom, we shall have to get down to fundamentals.  Deputy N. Browne asked a question as to the cost of embassies.  Leaving out the question of cost altogether, I asked a question some six months ago as to what work these embassies were doing to expand Irish trade, with specific reference to agriculture.  What did I find?  I asked specifically how many men were engaged in London and in Paris solely for the purpose of expanding our agricultural trading&mdash;not, mark you, for expanding industrial trading.  The answer given to me was that there was one man employed in the London Embassy and one man employed parttime in Paris.  The population in Paris is such that, if our agricultural marketing people were in direct communication with their counterpart there, we could sell on the Paris market all the fat lambs produced in Ireland; but, in order to do that, we need transport facilities for direct contact and we need trading agencies between this country, France, the Continent generally and Britain.  Instead of sending people abroad to represent us in cultural matters, quaffing champagne and eating caviare with the elite of the world, we should send representatives to sell our Irish agricultural produce.  Emphasis should be on the export of agriculture rather <Col N="1845" /> than discussing pseudo-culture, about which many of them know nothing; many of them have to go to a public art gallery, or elsewhere, to see a picture.</P>
    <P>As you, Sir, have seen fit to direct me on the particular matters that can be discussed, I bow to your ruling; but in conclusion, I want to suggest to the Government that it is not too late to reconsider and, even at this late stage, to make an alteration in the Budget proposals, in so far as bread and butter are concerned.  I urgently appeal to them to listen to the people who represent the community, to listen to those who have their ear to the ground.  If they do that, they will make no mistake because democracy, as such, should be Government for the people by the people themselves and not Government of the people by a little group who want to feather their own nest and improve their own condition.</P>
    <P>The Budget presented here by the Minister has definitely been weighted in favour of a section of the community. I suggest to the Minister that it is not too late for him to reconsider the position with regard to bread and butter.  In the course of the next 12 months, then, we can have any necessary reassessment with regard to capital expenditure, capital expenditure so essential if the twin evils of unemployment and emigration are to be cured in the lifetime of any member of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>The stability secured by the inter-Party Government during their three difficult years of office is seriously threatened by the austerity of this Budget.  We have in this Budget what I might call a carbon copy of the notorious Budget of 1952.  In fact, the Minister for Finance may be regarded as an echo of his colleague, Deputy MacEntee, when he was Minister for Finance five years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The abolition of the food subsidies is a wicked and serious action which will affect the vast majority of our people.  This can really be regarded as a Tory Budget because of its serious implications and the results which are likely to follow.  It could also be <Col N="1846" /> called a rich man's Budget.  There are certain provisions in it for the removal of the import levies on television sets, radios and high powered cars, whereas the removal of the subsidies on foodstuffs will seriously affect the living standards of the ordinary individual.  It is certainly not a poor man's Budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and his colleagues appear to have taken the easy way out in their endeavour to do away with the deficit that existed.  The Budget may be regarded as a lazy man's Budget.  The Minister simply slashed the food subsidies and imposed taxation on petrol, tobacco and beer.  These appear to be the usual commodities affected whenever money is required.  It is a wonder there was not also an increase in income-tax.</P>
    <P>The removal of the subsidies must seriously affect the living standards of our people.  These food subsidies can, in a sense, be taken as items which will help in production because of their value in maintaining increased prices for wheat and some other commodities. They also played their part in stabilising wages.  The inter-Party Government, during its period of office, by maintaining these subsidies, helped to stabilise wages.  That stability is now threatened by the Government's action.  Anybody can foresee that organised workers will look for an increase in wages in order to make up for the increased prices of essential foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the subsidies also hits the business man, especially small shopkeepers and the white collar workers.  These are the people who will suffer most because they have no organisations through which to recoup themselves in any way for the increased costs of these commodities.  If it was considered good economy to abolish these subsidies, surely it would have been less harmful to do it piecemeal rather than abolish them all at once.  Not only will there be claims for increased wages by organised workers but the present social benefits will be regarded as entirely inadequate to meet the increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>Apart from this increased taxation <Col N="1847" /> and these increased prices of foodstuffs affecting the people, they will also affect local authorities, because local authority employees will be seeking increased wages.  Hospitals and various other institutions of local authorities will cost more, so that this increase in taxation will cause a further rise in the rates.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, during the election campaign and even since, had plans by which £100,000,000 would be made available to employ 100,000 workers. We hear nothing of these plans now. It was good propaganda during election time, and we have already heard quotations from speakers during the election campaign in connection with subsidies.  It is rather peculiar that somewhat similar speeches were made during the 1951 election campaign in connection with the penal taxes imposed by the Fianna Fáil Budget of 1947.  The Tanaiste, stated in Cork on 12th May, 1951, as reported in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 13th May, 1951:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Coalition Minister has said that Fianna Fáil if elected would increase the taxes on beer and tobacco.  Why should such taxes be necessary?  There is no such reason why we should reimpose these taxes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, they were reimposed in the Budget of 1952.  On 15th May, 1951 the Minister for Health stated in Rath-mines Town Hall, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 16th May:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A number of persons in the licensed trade were spreading a rumour that Fianna Fáil if returned to power, would reimpose the tax on drink which was imposed by the Supplementary Budget of 1947.  There is no truth in such a rumour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These taxes were reimposed in the Budget of 1952.  It is very difficult to see how we can trust the statements of all these Fianna Fáil Ministers or ex-Ministers. We had a similar procedure during the last election campaign when the Tanaiste at Waterford on 28th February, 1957 stated, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i>, 1st March:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some Coalition leaders are <Col N="1848" /> threatening the country with all sorts of unpleasant things if Fianna Fáil becomes the Government&mdash;compulsory tillage, wage control, cuts in Civil Service salaries, higher food prices and a lot more besides.  A Fianna Fáil Government does not intend to do any of these things because we do not believe in them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is of course, they do not believe in higher food prices.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;How definite can we make our denial of these stupid allegations? They are all falsehoods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yet, we now have higher prices for essential foodstuffs as a result of this Budget.</P>
    <P>On the same day, on 28th February, 1957, the Taoiseach stated in Belmullet:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Coalition Parties were urging the people not to vote for Fianna Fáil because there was hell around the Fianna Fáil corner.  You know the record of Fianna Fáil in the past you know we have never done the things they said we would do. They have told you that you would be paying more for your bread.  They do not say that it was as a result of a legacy in the shape of a £62,000,000 deficit in our international balance of payments and a Budget deficit of £15,000,000 from them that bread was increased before....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We did not cut them all out because we did not want the price of bread&mdash;so important an article of diet for the poor&mdash;to be increased.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now it has been increased by the slashing of the subsidies on bread and flour, after all the more or less similar statements made by the leading members of the Fianna Fáil Government. We have the statements made in the 1951 election campaign and made in 1952.  Here is something else, a statement by Deputy Mrs. Lynch on 22nd February, 1957, during the election campaign:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Fianna Fáil Government is the housewife's choice.  It must be; there is no alternative.  The housewife, the mother of a family, has been the greatest victim of Coalition <Col N="1849" /> bungling.  Housewives, use your intelligence, your practical experience and your sound reasoning.  Vote in strength for the Fianna Fáil candidates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder what they think now, if they remember that statement of Deputy Mrs. Lynch, who is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>The removal of these subsidies on essential foodstuffs is a matter of great importance to the constituency I represent along the western seaboard, because in those areas no wheat is grown, whereas in the Midlands and in the eastern counties, the farmers grow their wheat and therefore they can grind it and have it for their own use, as well as for sale.  The removal of the subsidies on bread and flour in their case will not be as serious as it would be for those along the western seaboard.</P>
      <P>The removal of the butter subsidy is also bound to have a serious effect in Kerry and other counties.  For instance, in my county, 95 per cent. of the people qualify for all the benefits to be derived under the Health Act; one can see how the increased prices of butter and flour will affect people in the western areas much more than in the East and Midlands. The increased price of butter will certainly result in our having a large surplus.  What are we to do with that surplus?  We must really pay the foreigner to eat our butter.  It would be better to subsidise butter so that our own people could use it instead of having to buy margarine, all the ingredients of which have to be imported, thus adversely affecting our balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is allowing £250,000 for the improvement of marketing arrangements for our agricultural produce, but at the same time he removed the £352,000 payable to creameries for the cold storage of butter.  That meant a further increase of 2d. a lb. on butter, making the price 4/4 instead of 4/2 per lb.  In <Col N="1850" /> order to help in some way to meet the increases caused by the removal of the subsidies, some increased benefits were granted to certain people, such as old age pensioners and those in receipt of non-contributory widows' pensions and unemployment benefits, but surely an increase of 1/&ndash; for old age pensioners does not in any way compensate them for the increased cost of living.  It is not even 2d. per day.</P>
    <P>One can imagine how the ordinary working man will be affected by the increase of 1d. on the pint.  When his day's work is over, he likes to have a pint and suppose, on an average, he has two pints a day for seven days of the week.  We can see that any benefits he may derive from the increased children's allowances, for instance, will be spent in that way.  The increased benefits will not make up for the increased cost of living and therefore the standard of living of all such people will be lower.</P>
    <P>The increase of 6d. a gallon in petrol will have serious implications so far as agricultural people, and in fact people generally are concerned, because petrol is now required by almost all types of people, professional, agricultural and commercial.  Increases in this way will mean that industrialists will have to face higher costs in connection with the distribution of their goods.  Therefore, it will mean an increase in production costs and an increase in wages, and so on, for their employees.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government were in office in three of the most difficult years, I should think, since the State was established and yet, when they left office, they had overcome the various difficulties.  One of the means by which they brought about stability was the maintenance of these subsidies. In addition, they brought about an equilibrium in the balance of trade by means of the import levies.  The import levies may have caused a certain amount of unemployment, but they did good in other ways.  They did good to the country as a whole, so much so that, when the inter-Party Government left office, the adverse trade balance had been reduced by <Col N="1851" /> £24,500,000.  In fact, complete equilibrium had been achieved.</P>
    <P>The new Government is entering on a period when everything should be more pleasant for them and they can carry on without all the difficulties the past Government had to face.  It is rather peculiar, therefore, that the Tanaiste should remove the levies on luxury goods.  One would think that, if anything, he would remove the levies on other commodities which may be of some benefit to the ordinary people.  The removal of the levies on television sets appears to be ridiculous in a sense, because we have no television service in this country and, in view of our financial position, will not have it for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Everything that could be said against this Budget and anything that could be said in its favour has been said already.  There is no use in my prolonging the discussion, but I will say that the Budget has come as a shock to the people.  It was not right or just that the subsidies should be removed without having let the people know during the election that Fianna Fáil intended to remove them.  I could guarantee that, if there were a general election in the morning, Fianna Fáil would not be returned with an overall majority, that they would lose many seats.  Of course, their leaders are good politicians.  Perhaps their idea is that, by imposing extra taxation now, removing the subsidies and scourging the people in the manner they have done, they will be enabled, as years go on, to have a bigger surplus and, when the next general election takes place, will be able to increase benefits and reduce taxation in the belief that the people, being very gullible, will forget the past and will again vote Fianna Fáil.  I doubt if that will happen, but that could be the idea.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are really playing politics instead of statesmanship. There were various other ways by which they could raise the necessary £9,000,000 to balance the Budget. Neither the Minister nor the Government devoted any time to thinking out a plan as to how that could be done.  They simply slashed the subsidies <Col N="1852" /> and imposed taxation on the commodities nearest to hand&mdash;the usual game.  The position is serious for the ordinary person in this country. It is very serious for the ordinary working man with a large family. I am perfectly certain that, as we on this side of the House are not satisfied with the position that has arisen as a result of the Budget, those on the opposite side feel still worse about it, especially when they meet their constituents down the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Palmer finished by suggesting that we were playing politics.  When the Minister for Finance finished his Budget statement, we heard the replies from the former Taoiseach and the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, and then we saw the reception the Budget got from our leading newspapers. The leading articles in most, if not all, of them and in the provincial papers also, spoke well of the Budget.</P>
      <P>I think that came as a disappointment to some people on the other side of the House and it strikes me that they decided then to play a bit of politics and they looked for all the adjectives they could get to describe the Budget&mdash;hairshirt, harsh and all the other adjectives they used in 1952. They did that because they were disappointed by the reception the Budget got, especially from some of the papers that always supported the Coalition Government.  It will be agreed that the Budget did get a good reception from the national dailies.</P>
      <P>I have listened to quite a number of speeches in this debate and am more than satisfied that the majority of the speakers agree with the principle of a balanced Budget and the soundness of that principle.  In fairness to the leaders on the other side of the House I must say they agreed that the principle was very sound and its adoption most essential to get us out of our present difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could ask the question: what is wrong with the principle of having our yearly outgoings met by yearly income?  That is a fair question.  Anyone with any sense of responsibility will cut out all this nonsense of describing <Col N="1853" /> the Budget as a hairshirt Budget, a harsh Budget and all the rest, by answering that question.  In our ordinary life, we adopt that principle. Why not adopt it here?  Why, then, criticise the Minister and try to create friction and trouble when he and his colleagues make an effort to carry out that principle?  It amazes me at times to hear people, who in their hearts know that what they are saying is not correct, saying things because they are forced to say them because, as Deputy Palmer said, it is playing politics.</P>
    <P>The Minister disclosed in his Budget statement, and the Taoiseach also referred to it, that the Government were left with an unbalanced Budget to the tune of £8,000,000.  There is no denying that, no matter what the people on the opposite side may say.  The facts are there and very few Deputies on the other side have told us how we were to bridge that gap.  We have heard Deputy Palmer and others say that we should not have removed the levies on motor cars and television sets.  Would it not be better if they would tell us exactly what revenue we would get from those levies?  Would it be £8,000,000?  Would it bridge that gap?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <P>It would pay Deputies better if instead of quoting what people said during the election they got down to figures and found out if the levies would bridge the gap.  It would have been very interesting indeed to hear what taxes they would impose to bridge that gap.  Was it wrong to remove the levies on oranges and fruit?  We know that in Dublin there was a big protest about that levy. The tax on oranges was certainly wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

      <P>Time will tell.  There was an ontcry from the motor assembly workers who were trying to get back to work.  Deputy Barrett from Cork <Col N="1854" /> suggested that we should get after the soccer people, the rugby people, the G.A.A., racing and dancing and that there were moneys to be got from those who engaged in such activities.  That was his suggestion as to how we should bridge the gap of £8,000,000.  As one interested in amateur sport I must say that I could not see how we could get £8,000,000 from Dalymount, Lansdowne Road or Croke Park.  I know nothing whatever about racing and still less about dancing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about racing at all.  I think he should have left those three sports, and particularly Croke Park, alone.  I think the organisations running these sports are doing useful work and bringing honour to the country.  To my mind it was a very poor effort indeed to suggest that this was one way of bridging the gap.  We should take these things seriously and not come along with suggestions like that.</P>
      <P>I read Deputy Corish's speech; he was more or less going to town on the question of the price of bread.  He rapped his desk and said that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dr. Ryan, were allowing the price of bread to sky-rocket to any price by removing the subsidy. That has been stymied by the Minister's Control Order so that one sees that apparently there is not a great deal of thought given by Deputies from the other side of the House to their speeches.  Deputy Corish knew the Minister had the power to control the price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish also gave this guarantee and I quote from Volume 161, column 1396 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If the inter-Party Government had been still in power this year, we would have had a very difficult task but, believe it or not, I give this <Col N="1855" /> guarantee&mdash;we would have explored every single possible method before attempting to impose any burden on the ordinary people by asking them to pay any more for food.  That was proved in the last two Budgets which Deputy Sweetman introduced. He used ingenious methods&mdash; methods which could not be questioned and were not questioned&mdash;in those two Budgets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those ingenious methods gave us over 90,000 unemployed and a deficit of £8,000,000.  That is not, to my mind, a very sound method and not in keeping with what some of the speakers said in regard to the principles of a balanced Budget.  If these are methods of ingenuity it is certainly not playing the game with the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach pointed out that the primary purpose of this Budget was to lay the true foundation for future progress, for employment and for increased production by balancing current expenses by current revenue.  That is the primary purpose and the main object of this Budget and if this Budget only achieves the plans which were announced yesterday, in answer to a question on employment for Dublin, then it will be going a long way.  The main trouble certainly is the question of employment.  We all know, even those of us who have jobs, that increases in the price of bread and butter are certainly not welcome but then again if one has a job one can meet these increases in some way.</P>
      <P>Yesterday afternoon I was a member of a group of Deputies, including the Minister for Justice, which interviewed a deputation of seven women and one man from a Dublin North East constituency. They were not from Deputy McGilligan's or my constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin was also in the group and I think he will <Col N="1856" /> agree with me that, while the majority of them had husbands who were unemployed, they did state that if their husbands had work they certainly would not be pressing matters as they were pressing them at the moment. One woman whose husband was working in England, made it clear that by reason of the fact that he was sending some money home she was not in the same position as the other women whose husbands were not employed. They made it clear that if their husbands were employed and they had a weekly wage coming in they would not be looking upon things as harshly as they were.  The primary purpose of this Budget is to procure employment and then the problem of these people will be removed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>These people were very fair and their whole case was: &ldquo;Give us work.&rdquo; Their whole case was that if they had a proper wage they would not look upon this Budget in so harsh a light.  Where they have no weekly wage coming in they have every reason to consider that it is difficult to make ends meet, despite the fact that they are getting some compensatory allowances.  If the Budget makes some contribution towards increasing employment, it will be doing very well indeed.</P>
      <P>However, if there is an attempt by any person or group of persons to create friction now and to start any sort of trouble, they are refusing to give the necessary co-operation in the difficult task which the Coalition members admit exists and would exist, even if they were in Government. Fianna Fáil are in Government now.  They have been only two months in office and surely they should be given some time to solve these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1857" /> I agree with the Minister for Lands that our home market has become much too small and that we should go all out for exports on a substantial scale.  I agree with him, also, that there should be production inducements, so that employers can increase workers' wages in order that the workers may be able to meet increased food prices.  We must be honest and endeavour to make every possible effort to achieve increased production so that there will be inducements to employers to increase wages.  I certainly would like to see workers getting sufficient money, not alone to meet their commitments properly but to save a little as well.  That is not easy.  If we go all out for the export market on a very large scale, we should be able to give inducements by way of higher production to increase workers' wages.  I do not agree with all this talk about holding wages down.  What I want to see is increased production and consequent increases in wages.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to say except to express the hope that this Budget will put the country on a firm basis so that we can reduce the unemployment and emigration figures.  We must all make honest endeavours to achieve these aims.  It is unfair and uncalled for to say that we on this side of the House set out deliberately to hurt the Irish people, that we are being unnecessarily harsh and severe.  Such statements are unfair in view of the past records of our Ministers.  They constitute what I would call playing politics.  They are dishonest politics and unfair tactics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking here last evening, a member of the Government Party made a passing remark on the speech of a new member of the House, Deputy Miss Hogan.  He commented that she had apparently not got the usual Party propaganda literature to use in condemnation of the Budget.  In my opinion, he made one mistake; he forgot that in the very able way in which she spoke on the subject, she explained, as only a woman can, the problems confronting the most important section of the community as far as the Budget proposals <Col N="1858" /> are concerned&mdash;the woman in the home.</P>
      <P>We should always remember the importance of a balanced budget in the homes of our people and surely, if more attention had been given to the remarks of this new Deputy, perhaps some of the old hoary ideas in relation to the balancing of the national Budget might have been changed somewhat. Whether we like it or not, we cannot discuss this Budget without making some comparisons between it and the Budget of 12 months ago.  I do not propose to be hard on some of the members of the Government and I will not quote from statements they made last year.  I shall content myself with saying that I believe what they did say last year was meant by them.  They thought at that time that what they said in relation to proposed or suggested new burdens was correct.</P>
      <P>Let us consider some of these statements in the light of the proposals enshrined in the present Budget.  Last year, one Fianna Fáil Deputy from the West of Ireland stated that the petrol tax would play havoc with the people in the West who made their livelihood by selling turf.  At that time, and even now, I feel sure he thought he was correct in thus sizing up the situation. What about the turf cutters in the West of Ireland now?  What have our friends from the north-west to say now about petrol prices?  Last year, there was great play made of the increased cost of transport, due to the increased price of petrol.  Perhaps now they will agree with something the Minister for Lands then said&mdash;that any statement made by a Deputy in this House would bear revision in years to come.  I suggest that many of the Deputies opposite should go to the Library for a good read, that they should read some of the statements they made last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They had a lot to say then about the increase of a ½d. in the price of a box of matches.  According to them then, the people of rural Ireland were to be left in perpetual darkness because the then Government found it necessary to increase the price of matches by a ½d. a box.  I believe that the Taoiseach should instil <Col N="1859" /> in the minds of the members of his Party the importance of being sensible. They should not be satisfied just to follow the leader, refusing to exercise their God-given right to examine the economic problems at present confronting the country and each individual in it.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to pick out any juicy pieces which I could throw at them but I believe it is important that we should draw particular attention to some of the statements made by our leading or elder statesmen including the Tanaiste.  He was in bad humour 12 months ago but he was sitting on this side of the House and apparently it makes a vast difference when a member sits on one side of the House or on the other.  Last year, as reported at column 49 of the Official Debates of the 8th May he asked: &ldquo;Will their answer be to laugh at them because they were such fools as to believe them?&rdquo; He wanted to know whether the members of the Government and those supporting the Government would laugh at the people because, as he stated, the people were such fools as to believe in them. Whom do they believe now?  Who are fooling the people now?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Deputy Gallagher is interested in a certain sport but I did not know until last year that the present Tanaiste was a great follower of the fistic art.  He went so far as to say that the Government had thrown in the towel completely in relation to the cost of living.  All of us remember his frothing from the mouth because, as he said, the Government had thrown in the towel in relation to the cost of living.  What has happened since?  Apparently he has wrapped the towel around himself and he is cooling down because he finds himself in a different position in the same Chamber.</P>
    <P>I thought, having regard to the responsible position the Tanaiste holds, that he went to the limit when he could not control himself and termed the Government and those supporting the Government at that time as being a pack of &ldquo;phonies.&rdquo; That may be a common expression in Dublin but it is <Col N="1860" /> not a very pleasant one for a responsible statesman to use.  He called the members of the Government at that time a pack of &ldquo;phonies&rdquo; because he maintained, they were responsible not only for an increase in the price of petrol but for an overall increase&mdash;not alone in respect of the few items mentioned in last year's Budget but in regard to every item that would have to be purchased by the housewives throughout the country.  His complaint then was the credit squeeze but the credit squeeze is still on, I am afraid.</P>
    <P>Another complaint of the present Tanaiste was the increase of ½d. to 1d. at that time in the price of mineral waters.  Apparently he was horrified by the savage brutality of the Minister for Finance 12 months ago with the able support of all members of the Government in increasing the price per bottle of mineral waters so that, he said, every little child in the country would die of thirst last summer.  That did not happen.</P>
    <P>He was ably supported by another member of the Government and may I say that I am somewhat surprised that this member has not graced the House with his appearance to defend the present Minister and lecture everybody concerned in his usual manner?  I refer to the present Minister for Health.  What was his complaint last year?  Deputy Gallagher said&mdash;and I believe he means what he said&mdash;that he would not wish to see the workers on a lower wage rate.  Does Deputy Gallagher know that sitting in one of these benches last year the present Minister for Health, then Deputy MacEntee, complained that, owing to the high wage structure, the commercial banks were suffering from pernicious anaemia?  According to the present Minister for Health, the cause of all our troubles last year was the high wage structure.</P>
    <P>We will have to take particular note of the statements of the present Tanaiste, ably backed up by other speakers on that side, who are trying to get it across to the public through the newspapers that the country is endangered if the workers say they want something to meet the increased cost of living.  The Minister for Health <Col N="1861" /> could never be outdone in some of the famous statements he makes here.  Last year one of the most outrageous statements ever made by a Deputy in opposition in relation to the fiscal policy of a Government was made by the then Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    <P>He had three complaints against the Government.  He said that the matter was common knowledge throughout the city but he was cute enough not to say who was making it common knowledge. His complaints were that some Ministers of the inter-Party Government were threatening to bulldoze the banks into bankruptcy if they did not give the Government the money they wanted.  That was one of the statements spread over the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Another little bird whispered to Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, that while some Ministers were going on in this disgraceful manner apparently more of them were putting as much pressure as possible on the insurance companies.  I know that the present Front Bench will not put any pressure on the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The third complaint&mdash;the most serious and the most damaging of all to economic recovery in this country&mdash; was made by the Minister for Health when he said that there were widespread rumours and widespread apprehensions about the suggested possibility of the removal of Post Office savings for Government purposes.  Yet we are now told that the member who made these statements is supposed to be a responsible member of a responsible Government dishing out to the people under this Budget the severest attacks ever made on the people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago the Tanaiste stated that the increase in petrol at that time was the highest single increase ever imposed, but does it differ from his own increase on this occasion? If it was so severe last year, surely they should be the last to put a further tax on a commodity which, according to the Tanaiste, had already been so severely overtaxed.  We remember the determined opposition put up by the Tanaiste 12 months ago when he was fighting, as it were, a losing battle in this Chamber against. <Col N="1862" /> to use his own words, a lot of &ldquo;phonies&rdquo;.  He was fighting on behalf of the people of Dublin and every part of the Twenty-Six Counties, determined that he would not throw in the towel, but that he would fight to the end to cut down the cost of living. He said that they promised to make some effort to stop the cost of living going up still further.  The cost of living has gone up a lot further now than during the past 12 months.  It is quite true that the problem confronting the working people of this country has been the cost of living, coupled with the fact that the wage rates, instead of being, as the Minister for Health thinks they are, a high wage structure, are, in my opinion, a low wage structure in many industries.</P>
    <P>In 1952, butter was 2/8 a lb.  After roughly one hour's speech in the month of May, 1952, made by the Minister for Health, who was then Minister for Finance, it was decided that to counteract the high wage structure, butter would be increased in price from 2/8 to 3/10 per lb.  He made sure on that occasion that the housewife would pay 9d. instead of 6½d. for the 2-lb. loaf.  It was also decided that the people, having the advantage of a high wage structure, should be made to pay more for tea and he increased the price from 2/8 to ? per lb.  It is strange to relate that the next sudden jump in the price of butter and bread, vitally important items in the lives of the people, had to wait until May, 1957, when the same man occupied the Front Bench of Government in this House.</P>
    <P>If anyone still tries to persevere with the line that the inter-Party Government should be damned for all time, owing to the increases imposed on some of these items during their period in office, I suggest to him that he should forget that Fianna Fáil ever formed a Government in this country.</P>

      <P>The present Minister for Health, 12 months ago, complained <Col N="1863" /> that, owing apparently to the irresponsibility of the inter-Party Government, the increase in national capital in 1950 amounted to only 5 per cent. of the gross national proceeds, to roughly £27,000,000.  How could it be otherwise when a responsible person such as he was went around whispering that Government Ministers were preparing to burrow into the banks and that Post Office savings were to be tampered with?  Surely all these contributory factors, brought together, must show what is one of the outstanding features of irresponsibility in public life, because of desire for office, coupled with the dismay caused by having to sit in opposition, which seems to have interfered with the national outlook of some people in this country, and for which we have suffered.  I am not speaking as a politician, saying that any Party has suffered, but the country has suffered. The people will know in future years where to lay the blame in relation to what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all their criticisms, these members conveniently forget to admit one important fact.  Each and every one of us knows that, because of the geographical position of this country, we have little or no control over the price of imported raw materials or over the price of exports in the international markets.  If we take the figures, as based on the March-April period of 1952, of the price of imported raw materials and compare them with the prices in the autumn of 1954, what do we find?  In March and April, when the inter-Party Government were in office, import prices over which we all know the Government had no control, were at the very high figure of 193 points.  In 1954, when the inter-Party Government were in power, and again had no control over these prices, they had dropped from 193 points to 136. Surely then if there was an advantage at all in relation to the import prices index in that time, it must have run in favour of a Government that had no control over these prices.  If members wish, they can check these figures, but remember that at no time were the inter-Party Government or the Fianna Fáil Government able to take <Col N="1864" /> any control over prices of raw material imports.</P>
    <P>Have we control over export prices? Each and every one of us knows that the answer is no.  We hear a lot about the question of balancing the Budget, but it is very well for some people to note that in this morning's <i>Irish Press</i> there is a very important headline: &ldquo;Adverse Balance Now Halved.&rdquo; How has it been halved? It has not been halved through the activities of the present Government.</P>

      <P>Nobody can say that. In the <i>Irish Press</i>, it states that, despite steeply rising import prices, imports dropped to £47,000,000 and also &mdash;this is the important fact&mdash;at the same time, export prices were lower than in the first quarters of 1955 and 1956, but exports rose to £32,000,000. That surely must mean, as it says in the <i>Irish Press</i>, that cattle exports constituted 72 per cent. of the overall increase in exports.  That is not a matter of three months' work here. Does anyone suggest that it was only since Fianna Fáil came into office on 20th March that that huge increase in the number of live stock available for sale was achieved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Twelve months ago, another Deputy joined the Tanaiste in a chorus of protests. In his own sincere way, I presume, this Deputy pointed out the terrible future that was facing the young lover.  He gave us a terribly dark view in relation to the little pleasures of the young lover.  He said he could see what was going to happen after the passage of last year's Budget. He pointed out that the young man would have to pay more to bring his young lady to a dance.  He also said that, if they had not bicycles and were not in humour for walking, the young man would be obliged, owing to the increase in petrol prices, to pay more for the bus ride home.  He further pointed out that if the young couple sat out a dance and had a mineral each the young man would have to pay an increased price for the minerals. To sum it all up, the Deputy in question termed last year's Budget a <Col N="1865" />&ldquo;kill-joy Budget.&rdquo; It is a damn good job that that Deputy got his two months' holiday before the introduction of the present murder-the-people Budget.</P>
    <P>It was very easy for a Deputy who was in opposition 12 months ago to raise a hue and cry about the &ldquo;terrible situation&rdquo; then prevailing in relation to the housing of the Dublin people&mdash; but the people in Dublin were in need of housing for the past two months also.  The present Minister for Health found it suitable 12 months ago to castigate Ministers of the then Government for going to other countries. Apparently it is a case of &ldquo;I can do as I like but you dare not do anything but what I like you to do.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a word.  A friend of mine who is now on the Government Benches was the only man who hit the nail on the head.  Maybe he did not think that things would happen so quickly but, in his speech last year from the Opposition Benches, he uttered three very important words. Now, looking back over the past 12 months, that friend of mine must admit, in the light of the present situation, the importance of his statement that &ldquo;Honesty will prevail.&rdquo; Deputy J. Brennan said that 12 months ago.  Honesty will prevail&mdash;but when? That is the question.</P>
      <P>It may be of some interest to try to pull away a little from the situation of 12 months ago and consider it in the light of some of the statements made at the present time.  One new member in this House struck a different note from that sounded by many members of the Government Party.  I am afraid his voice is added to the increasing number of conservative voices that seem to be making themselves heard in the Government Party.  I do not believe for a moment that the rank and file of the Government Party&mdash;the men from rural Ireland&mdash;are, at heart, in any way conservative.  However, as Deputy Dr. Browne said yesterday&mdash;I mentioned it long before that&mdash;it would seem that the minority are controlling the majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> Deputy Booth, a new member of this House, went so far as to suggest the abolition of income-tax and the introduction of a purchase tax.  Who will gain by that?  Who will lose by it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Not Deputy Booth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Consider a man with £5,000 or £10,000 a year.  What purchases would he have to make in order to keep going?  I suggest he would not have many purchases to make.  The human being can go only to a certain stage in wishing to get things to keep him going.  Therefore, the purchase tax which Deputy Booth would like to introduce would impose a very small burden on a man with £10,000 a year.  What about the man who is rearing a young family whether in Dublin City or elsewhere in the country?  Consider the overall purchases of his family.  I believe suggestions are creeping into this House which, in themselves, are views expressed by people who believe in a solid Tory outlook in political endeavour in this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth went further.  He made another statement which, to say the least of it, is appalling.  On Tuesday, 14th May, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 161, No. 9, Deputy Booth, who was arguing that the Minister had done his best&mdash;perhaps, from their point of view, he did &mdash;stated: &ldquo;...the Minister has spread the load most heavily on those who can bear it best.&rdquo; Do they believe that?  Are we supposed to believe that the removal of the subsidies, which has imposed an added burden on the community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If Deputy O'Malley were living, as some of us had to, on unemployment benefit he would know a little more than to try to ape the antics of a Deputy who was always noted as the spiteful member of Fianna Fáil.  I advise a young Deputy such as Deputy O'Malley not to adopt those antics.  Three months ago, the people were told there was no question <Col N="1867" /> whatsoever of removing the food subsidies.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley has probably eaten damn little bread in his time.  I know some of the unfortunate people in Limerick City and also in County Tipperary, where Deputy Loughman will probably answer for his own sins of omission in relation to this Budget.  Let us bear in mind that last year Deputy O'Malley was sitting on the Opposition Benches.  Does he remember expressing the view that the then Government had taken the disgraceful action of increasing the price of the box of matches by ½d.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that Deputy O'Malley should go down to the Library and read the speech he made here last year and then say at least an act of political contrition.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste made it quite clear to the House that the removal of the food subsidies was essential for the welfare of the taxpayer.  Apparently the taxpayer will benefit by the removal of the food subsidies.  In the light of the overall position, however, what difference does it make to a man or a woman who is both a taxpayer and a ratepayer?  How many people in Cork, Limerick and elsewhere are ratepayers as well as taxpayers?  Take the Regional Hospital or Barrington's Hospital in Limerick, or any such hospital. With the increase in the prices of bread and butter, how can they manage to do what the Taoiseach insists they must do&mdash;balance their budgets on current expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies on the other side know as well as we do that it is only a few months since every local authority in the country dealt with their estimates for the present financial year.  The members did their utmost to try to prune them down.  In no local authority can it be said that a margin was provided by the members or the manager to meet any emergencies <Col N="1868" /> which may arise during the present year.  Therefore, is it not correct for us to say that the present increases must mean that additional finance will have to be found for the provision of foodstuffs in these institutions?  Who will provide that?  Maybe not the taxpayers; but, if not, the ratepayers. It is a case of taking the &ldquo;bob&rdquo; from one pocket and putting it into the other.</P>
    <P>The people are not being relieved by the removal of the food subsidies. We are told that the well-to-do people, who had been getting these foodstuffs at subsidised prices, will not do so now.  We are not told about the same people getting children's allowances. It will not make any difference to the person who is both a ratepayer and a taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Many statements have been made by the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach, too, and indeed by many of the members opposite.  It is a new war cry; yet it is an old one: &ldquo;The country must stand by us or the country is doomed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In relation to emigration and unemployment, Deputy O'Malley was a tame little boy in this House when I challenged him, and every member of the Opposition, as they were at that time, with statements made here in 1940 by the present Minister for Health, who said that the Government would not take any responsibility for people who had gone to England and who might wish to come back home from the bombing there and seek a living here.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not enlightening himself in the way he should.  The old war cry is still the same but it is dressed up in a different way.  I cannot understand the approach of the Tánaiste towards the proposed discussions of the united trade unions organisation.  He was on the same theme when speaking here last week.  He strongly advised all the officials of the various trade unions that, when this conference takes place, they should be sure that those attending it were only those who were in good standing with the unions.  We agree with that; but the Tánaiste went on to maintain that they should also be working members of the unions. Apparently, an unemployed member of a union, although in good standing, should not be there.  The Tánaiste got very excited yesterday when Deputy Dr. Browne asked what was the present position and what was intended in the future in relation to possible wage increases.  We are entitled to worry about the future because we know what happened in the past.</P>
      <P>In framing his Budget, we do not know whether the Minister for Finance had at the back of his mind the possibility of these suggested increases in salaries and wages, and, if so, in what way he intended to deal with them.  The greatest credit has always been due to the officials of the trade union movement for the way they have acted as responsible people.  At present, the Tánaiste and many others are throwing out the suggestion that some members of the Opposition are planning an economic uprising, planning to keep wages&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>And advocating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley was able to suggest these things a couple of years ago.  We are favoured by the fact that there are a few on this side who know a little more about trade unions than the members on the other side will ever know.  In 1950, there was a clamour for wage increases, at a time when the inter-Party Government <Col N="1870" /> came back to office and was faced with the problems of the Korean war. The demand from certain members of unions at that time was very insistent. They got very heavy headlines in the <i>Irish Press</i>.  In 1951, came the change of Government and the self-same people, who in 1950 had been seeking substantial increases as members, not officials, of trade unions, were noted for their absence from meetings.  This was in spite of the fact that the 1952 Budget was, to say the least, no help to the worker.</P>
      <P>The <i>Irish Press</i>, which had been so anxious to play up the situation in 1950, was sure of one thing between 1951 and 1954, that is, that there would be no trouble from the boys because orders had come from headquarters.  I am convinced that the self-same position exists to-day, that the words of the Tánaiste, &ldquo;Keep quiet, boys,&rdquo; are meant for a certain section of the trade union movement.  That can be dealt with in another way, a sensible and honourable way, by the officials of the trade union movement, who are noted for their sense of responsibility and sincerity in dealing with the claims of their members.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be surprised.  Deputy O'Malley was apparently so anxious for publicity that he jumped into the fray last week to defend his Taoiseach when Deputy McQuillan wanted to discuss him.  Perhaps he may be able now to consult with and advise the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to what have become known as the &ldquo;Lemass millions&rdquo;.  Remember the £100,000,000 that we heard about some 12 months ago.  At that time, of course, Deputies on the other side of the House were not in Government.  In a southern newspaper, the <i>Cork Examiner</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A good, decent paper, with a good, decent man in control of it.  On 21st November, 1956, there appeared in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, in black type, a report of a speech made <Col N="1871" /> by the then Deputy Lemass.  He was not then Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our banking system will have to be such as will ensure that production exports will not be starved for reasonable facilities and they may require some extension of the powers of the Central Bank.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Barry says, Deputy Lemass was not Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce then.  There has been one remarkable feature of this debate so far and that is a notable absence from the speech of the Minister for Finance and that of the Minister for Industry and Commerce of any reference to the powers of the Central Bank.  We have not been told now whether or not the Central Bank have sufficient powers or, if they have not, what will be done to remedy that situation?  Last November, the then Deputy Lemass was going to do something about the powers of the Central Bank.  From what we know of them, I am afraid that now they will conveniently forget the Central Bank, and Deputy O'Malley will forget it, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be as active as the Deputy is when he is in jubilant mood.  Much has been said about balancing the Budget; we are told that balancing the Budget is of vital importance.  Whatever happens, the Budget must be balanced; what-ever happens in the home, according to the Taoiseach, the Budget must be balanced to ensure that everything is in proper order at the end of the financial year.  I can cite cases in my constituency where men working for the country council have to travel quite a distance to reach their work and, because of that, they had to go to the expense of buying bicycles.  I am sure Deputy Barry knows many such cases. When buying these bicycles, of course, these unfortunate men were in the <Col N="1872" /> position of not being able to balance their budgets.  They had to pay 2/6 per week for those bicycles, and, at the end of their financial year, they could not strike a balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. Their budgets showed a deficit at the end of the year, but they were satisfied because they appreciated that day-to-day expenditure must, of necessity, be coupled with capital expenditure.  If Deputy O'Malley will shake up his ideas and, at the same time, try to shake up the ideas and get rid of the phobias of some of the Front Benchers of his Party in relation to capital expenditure and budgetary deficits, he will be doing a great deal more for the country than he might otherwise think.</P>

What will the Minister for Industry and Commerce, second-in-command of the Fianna Fáil Party, tell us now about the powers of the Central Bank and the degree of active consideration, as Deputy O'Malley likes to put it, being given to it?  Of course, if the present Minister for Industry and Commerce can lay his hands on this £100,000,000, we shall not need any more powers for the Central Bank; but where will the Minister get this sum of £100,000,000?  Where will Deputy O'Malley get it?  I remember speaking here on 13th of last December. I drew attention to the problem then.  Though we had a different Government in power, I was as critical of the then Minister for Finance as I am of the present Minister in relation to this important problem.</P>

      <P>I am drawing attention to statements made by Ministers in relation to the problem of finance, whether it be capital finance or the day-to-day expenditure of the State. We are told that our capital programme is dependent upon small savings, coupled with a proposed loan. Apparently before the year is out, we shall have another loan, although last year Deputy O'Malley did not want to hear of a loan at all.  Now, so far and so long as we are prepared and content to continue financial policy in its present form, be it a Fianna Fáil Government in power or an inter-Party Government, so long will we have, as we have had for some years now, emigration and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us, when dealing with the abolition of the subsidies and all the other problems, that they had to accept the advice of their experts. Twelve months ago, he stated that a Government should be prepared to accept and put into operation their <Col N="1874" /> own policy and not the policy of their experts and advisers.  I do not know who these advisers are; I do not know whether they are civil servants or others elsewhere in the City of Dublin; but, so long as the Government accepts the advice of these so-called advisers, whether they are officials, businessmen, insurance groups, or anybody else, so long will the Budget mean, as Deputy McQuillan so rightly pointed out, something more for the industrialist and something less for the worker.</P>

      <P>Of course, the present value of money has not been taken into account.  I know that the Minister for Finance, in his own good jovial way, gets away with a lot.  Possibly others may fight more determinedly.  Twelve months ago, before the election, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was propounding a policy of encouraging foreign capital in here.  Apparently at that time the man who is now Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet did not agree with him. He was giving voice to views against the introduction of Canadian capital, or any form of foreign capital, even though it meant giving employment.</P>
      <P>I do not mind a difference of opinion between members of the same Party when that difference of opinion is confined to back benchers, but the position is much more serious when one finds a difference of opinion between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce on a matter of fundamental principle, namely, as to whether or not foreign capital should be induced into the country.  If that difference is not satisfactorily solved we shall find, at the end of the term of office of this Government, the same half-baked policy in operation.</P>

Thanks to a benevolent Providence, across Cork Harbour now, a few miles from <Col N="1875" /> where I live, I see the beginning of what will be a fundamental industry of tremendous importance in the economic life of the people of Cork, the people of Munster and, possibly, the people of the Twenty-Six Counties as a whole.</P>

      <P>In 1937, he wanted everything here in the Dublin docks. However, instead of talking about all the blueprints for the spending of £100,000,000, would it not be fitter for the Government to consider a planned economy, which we cannot ultimately escape, if we want to set up prosperous industries&mdash;for instance, the various projects arising out of the refining of the oil?  Would it not be better to think about these things than to be speaking in a high-handed manner about what they intend to do and giving the answer that was given here yesterday: &ldquo;Everything will be grand.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne is right in his approach in at least one respect.  Every Government has failed in relation to the necessity for a planned economy and I am afraid, according to the expressed views of the Minister, we are further away from it than ever before. If we want to achieve prosperity, we must be prepared to alter the policy of many of our industrialists, about which the Minister complained in the past, but did nothing, in relation to the high tariffs which many of them are enjoying at the expense of the community. We must pull away from that old system, if we want to succeed in the free market of Europe.  If we are not prepared to have a properly planned economy, then, whether we have a Fianna Fáil or an inter-Party Government, we will not achieve much.</P>

      <P>I have here a little docket which was circulating during the election campaign.  It came into my hands from a widow, with one child, who came to me seven or eight days ago.  She was not one of the lucky ones who get the increase to make up for the increased cost of bread and butter, or an increase in respect of her child.  She admitted that she had voted for Fianna Fáil, as she was entitled to do, but she drew particular attention to what was at the bottom of the card asking for her support for the two candidates in her constituency: &ldquo;Keep this card; you may need our help.&rdquo; She does need it now. She needs the help of the Fianna Fáil Deputies in Cork to oppose the increased burden on her for bread and butter for herself and her one son. She wants fair play and Fianna Fáil said they would give it.</P>
      <P>A short time ago, the same members&mdash;they thought they were right&mdash; decided by their votes to oppose giving an increase to road workers in Cork County.  What is the position now?  Are we still to be told that the people are in the same position, that they have no reason to complain? Fianna Fáil cannot have it every way. While we are prepared to accept that the ultimate hope of Fianna Fáil, by their policy, is to give prosperity to the country, we consider they are going about it the wrong way.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce said last week, when speaking in this important debate, they were sorry for some of the hardships already imposed, and perhaps more that are to come.  That means that the people are still unaware of what may be in store for them.  The Government could not expect co-operation from an Opposition when such an important factor as a reduction in the cost of living is not put into operation but when, instead, a vicious increase in the vitally important items of food, such as bread and butter, is placed on the shoulders of the people.  I do not mind what concessions they may wish to give to the man with the £1,300 motor car; I do not mind whether or not they thought it wise to remove the levies on television sets&mdash; that is their business&mdash;but I do not agree with the removal of the food subsidies coupled with the suggestions to the trade union movement that it should not look for an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to draw attention <Col N="1879" /> to the statement made by the Minister for Lands on Tuesday, January 29th, 1957, as published in the <i>Irish Press</i>.  Deputy Childers, as he then was, speaking at a Fianna Fáil cumann meeting in Wicklow said&mdash;I would like to add this quotation because I know we shall not get it from Deputy O'Malley:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was not popular to tell the people that if they looked for as near an English standard of living as they could get, more and more of their wages would be spent on imported materials and more and more goods must be exported or more and more barley and wheat produced at home to pay for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What was wrong with that?  What is wrong with trying to build up a better economy to give the people a higher standard of living?  Of course the Government Party complains about emigration, and one of the problems in connection with emigration, whether we like it or not, is the question of the standard of living.  Is there anything wrong in suggesting that people here should get a nearer approach to the higher standard of living in operation in other countries?  Is there anything wrong in suggesting that in order to achieve that, greater production should be the aim?</P>

      <P>Coming to the final point, in regard to the balancing of the Budget, on what basis do we balance the Budget?  If a man who has a wife and family wants to balance his budget at the end of the financial year, he counts his cash and his bills, but does he take into consideration what capital assets he has in the way of stocks?  We were told that we had an adverse balance at the end of the last financial year; we were told by Fianna Fáil that the country was near bankruptcy, but if we combine the assets at that time with the returns that were not brought into account by the end of the financial year, but had, of necessity, through being store cattle, to be brought into the new account, we see much of the hypocrisy of balancing the Budget.  It is in itself just a cute way used by people outside the House, certain sections of whom have been telling us for years back: &ldquo;Hope for little because you will get little.  Do not expect too much because much must be reserved for those who have much.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Listening to the long speech made by Deputy Desmond one would despair of this country's future.  I think one of the reasons why the Coalition Government was defeated <Col N="1881" /> in the last election was that the people believed the country had reached the stage when a little reality should enter into political life.  To use a hackneyed expression they were about fed up with people playing to the gallery and with the unreal approaches being made, and with a good deal of the fiddling with our whole economy.  They simply said: &ldquo;Give us something real for a change. We want a Government that will take action,&rdquo; or in other words, &ldquo;let honesty prevail&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I listened attentively to Deputy Desmond for the last hour and I challenge anybody in the House to point out where he made a single constructive suggestion at a time when this country is undergoing the greatest crisis it has ever experienced.

      <P>If Deputy Desmond had paused for one moment and reflected on the state of the country at the time it was handed over to a strong Fianna Fáil Government, it would, of course, have completely spoiled the background of all he was trying to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to be led by him to follow the same line, repeating promises made and not kept by members of this House or Governments or Parties.  It should suffice for me to remind the Labour Deputies that they as a Party were the one section who <Col N="1882" /> definitely promised, by word and advertisement, written and spoken, that they stood for the reduction of the cost of living by means of subsidies, prior to their coming into office in the Coalition Government on the last occasion.  Why should people who so utterly dishonoured their pledge to the people on that occasion, take up the time of the House for an hour to-day alleging that Fianna Fáil have dishonoured promises to the people on this occasion?</P>
    <P>I do not want to go on quoting everything said by Labour Deputies here over a number of years.  I do not think it gets us anywhere when one Deputy quotes what another has said and points out how he dishonoured his pledge.  The policy of the Labour Deputies is to criticise the people on this side of the House.  If it is constructive criticism it may be useful, but if it is criticism just of the type in which Deputy Desmond has indulged for the last hour, it leads only to complete frustration in the minds of the people, who over the last two and a half years have lost completely their confidence in the public representatives of this country.</P>
    <P>When these subsidies were introduced first, what was the attitude of the Labour Party?  What was their attitude towards the subsidies, about which so many crocodile tears have been shed here within the last week? I take the Leader of that Party, Deputy Norton, and quote what he said on the introduction of subsidies on the first occasion.  It is given in Volume 108, column 435, of the Official Report, dated 15th October, 1947:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The highlight of the documents put before us is, I take it, the subsidies to reduce the prices of tea, bread and butter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was the first introduction of the subsidies, about which we hear so much now.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think these are sham reductions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the sham reductions we are now crying about.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think they make any perceptible contribution to relieving <Col N="1883" /> the plight of the ordinary working people to-day and they make a less perceptible contribution in the circumstances in which they are offered. ... The Government, in this emergency Budget, this crisis Budget, this Budget to relieve the small man of his difficulties, will give him 3/10½ a week in the form of reduction in the prices of tea, sugar and bread and will take back 4/1 if he consumes a pint of beer per day and smokes a packet of cigarettes each day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are the people who have made it plain to everybody that they come in here merely to criticise what the other fellow does, irrespective of whether it is right or not.  I do not like to interrupt any Deputy, but I found it difficult to restrain myself when I listened to the hour-and-a-quarter dirge from Deputy Desmond in regard to the subsidies.</P>
    <P>I do not think we shall convince the people that we are in earnest about anything, if one Government starts quoting what another did.  If we on this side of the House in our Budget produce the best possible results, the Labour Deputies and the others opposite seem to regard it as their function to criticise it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to my speech on the Budget last year.  I would make the same speech to-day.  I said then that, if the Budget held out hopes of an expanding economy, to relieve unemployment and provide a better future, I would say it was a good Budget, irrespective of what hardships it might mean.  I say the same thing about the Budget to-day.  After 35 years of native Government, what have we to show to the rest of the world?  An alarming decline in population, as revealed by the last Census, the greatest unemployment problem of any country in the world to-day, complete dwindling of our external assets&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the position in which we find ourselves.  I shall not go round all the various speeches, but I shall take that of the leader of the Opposition and refer to one statement he made, which every Deputy knows was received very cynically by the country.  He said: &ldquo;We handed you over a clean slate.&rdquo; His speech was less critical than most of those made from the same side of the House.  He at least made an attempt to be realistic and he did not deal with trivial, petty matters for the purpose of criticism of his opponent.  He said: &ldquo;We handed you over a clean slate.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He handed over a crisis such as this country has not experienced since it first got native Government 35 years ago.  He handed over a Budget which failed to balance to the tune of £8,000,000, and no one on that side of the House has even attempted to explain where the £8,000,000 could be found.</P>
      <P>All who spoke seriously&mdash;I do not think Deputy Desmond spoke seriously, as he did not agree with the idea of a balanced Budget&mdash;and every member of the Fine Gael Front Bench, including the former Taoiseach himself, agreed with the principle of a balanced Budget.  They are now at one with those of us who say our economy must be built on a strong foundation and that such a strong foundation can spring only from the principle of a balanced Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come together and decide that, once and for all, however hurtful it may be to anyone at the moment, we shall make one serious attempt to put the country on its feet, to expand the economy, to create employment, to build up the nation to what it should be and what it was intended to be when people gave their lives for it. Let us not come in with petty political <Col N="1885" /> bickering, to spend days and weeks talking about petty things in which above all things the Labour Party should not indulge because if we are to develop this country, if employment is to be increased, if our economy is to be expanded, if our standard of living is to be maintained and improved, it will not be done by throwing out sops to the people one after another.  It can be done only by honest endeavour, by getting the people to realise that by their work alone can a nation be built.</P>
    <P>I remember a very biassed, pro-British, series of textbooks and most members of the House remember it too, the Cunningham and MacArthur Oxford series, which people were compelled to use as textbooks at one time. One of these texts dealt with the industrial development of England.  In the very opening page it said that not in a country's resources alone can greatness be achieved for a nation; it is only in the ability of its manpower to exploit those resources that greatness can be achieved.  However biassed the series may have been, nobody could refute the good, sound logic of that statement of fact.</P>
    <P>We are teaching our people to believe that prosperity can be gained in some peculiar manner without extra work, endeavour or attempt on their part.  Are we to go on, one year after another, telling them that we can increase social services, that we can give them doles and sops just to please them, for political purposes alone, without making any serious attempt really to develop the resources of the nation and give the people a chance to do what I believe they should and can do&mdash;to endeavour by their own skill and strength and work to put the country on its feet and create the prosperous State, which we are entitled to have equally with any of the other small States such as Denmark, Belgium, or Luxembourg?</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody on the other side of the House would disagree with one single word of what I say but when a Budget like this is introduced they see an opportunity and it is very difficult to let it pass.  But, remember <Col N="1886" /> the people have become very, very intelligent and they resent people who overplay their hand when an opportunity presents itself.  I would advise the Opposition not to overplay their hand on this occasion.  We must let an air of reality permeate the House and I say, in all earnestness, that this is the first really non-political Budget that we have had in this country for a long time.  The people opposite who talked so much about a national Government when they saw that Coalitions were discredited and forsaken by the people should realise that if a national Government were in power here to-day all that they could do is exactly what Fianna Fáil have done on this occasion. They have done what is honest, wise and prudent in the best interests of the future outlook, progress and development of this little nation.</P>
    <P>Somebody had to start some time. We could not go on as we were.  The people realised that and expected a severe Budget on this occasion.  There is no doabt about that.  They realised that we could not go on increasing social services, making available further easy payments which could be procured without work or endeavour, physical or mental, on their part. While our social services leave much to be desired, they are already far in advance of our national income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I want no ambiguity about what I am saying. What I say is unequivocal, that our social services leave much to be desired but, as they stand to-day and as they are costing the country, they are far in advance of our ability to pay for them.  Let us begin at the beginning and lift up the standard of the people first and social services will more easily follow because nothing succeeds like success.  Let us not put the cart before the horse.  I have heard people crying about the price of the loaf.  What does it matter to a housewife whether a loaf is 1/&ndash; or 9d. if her husband is unemployed?  What does it matter whether a loaf is 10d. or 1/6 if there is not a penny in the house to buy bread?  What is to be done with the <Col N="1887" /> almost 100,000 unemployed that have been in this country over the past few years?  Are they to be told that money can be brought out of the clouds?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you tell them that money can be produced out of a hat?  Where is the good in talking nonsense?  Deputy O'Sullivan and every other Deputy realise as well as or better than I do that an honest approach has to be made, that we cannot go on forever telling the people that they can have things without paying for them, that they can have wealth and a higher standard of living without working, without an extra effort, without increased production.  The most elementary economist in the world knows that the position in which we were fiddling&mdash;I use the word deliberately&mdash;would land us eventually in complete ruin.  Now that a serious attempt has been made, however hurtful it may be, I do not blame the Opposition for trying to exploit it but I say: &ldquo;Do not overplay your hand.&rdquo; We did not make any promises in the election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor did the people accept us as having made any promises.  The one thing with which the people became completely disgusted was this business of giving a little sop here and a little sop there, increasing some little social service, putting a halfpenny on something to pay a little extra.  They have come to realise that the expanding economy for which this country is crying out could not derive from such action.</P>

      <P>The people in this House need not get too worried about the situation.  We will take what we think is the proper action to develop this country, in a really genuine and sincere manner.  We have the important problem before us of increasing production, of giving employment to our people, of stemming the tide of emigration and getting the people to realise there is no easy road to national progress.  I do not think that all the patter which has issued from the other side of the House in relation to this Budget will ever again lead the people to believe there is any easy road to better times&mdash;as the Labour Party pamphlet put it before the 1954 election: &ldquo;Better times and lower taxes.&rdquo; This is the type of thing which creates a sense of unreality in the minds of the people.</P>
      <P>For the first time in years, we have had a Budget which is not in any way designed or framed to meet political exigencies.  It is the first non-political Budget we have had since 1952.  It is the first really serious attempt that has been made to take cognisance of the serious situation in which we live and if any man who has spoken attempted to explain where we can get £8,000,000 to balance the Budget, then he would have made a really serious contribution to the debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond believes in going on in the old humdrum manner and that nobody need make any effort at all.  That was the only inference I could draw from Deputy Desmond's speech, although I do give the Deputy the credit of being threatened with intelligence.  Earlier, I quoted Deputy Norton's condemnation of subsidies on the first occasion they were brought in here.  Now it is the worst thing in the world to remove them, the people have become so accustomed to them.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the former Minister for Defence.  The former Minister for Finance became realistic when he became Minister. Before he became Minister, he had the panacea for all our evils, just like the Labour people.  When he found himself faced with hard facts, he had to warn the people that they could not go on spending as they were spending. People, he said, could not expect to get easy money every day for doing nothing.  The former Minister for Defence could go to a by-election meeting in Limerick and tell the people that he was bringing a Bill that would please everybody.</P>

      <P>I believe this is the sixth day of this debate.  I notice Deputy J. Brennan is leaving the House, but I hope he will not go for a moment.  It will do him all the good in the world to listen to me.  I have never heard such a flow of frothy nonsense as his speech.  The backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party who are compelled to speak here have not one word to say about what the results of this Budget will be for the people throughout the country.  Here is what this Budget means: the 10-stone bag of flour gone up from £2 to £3 12s. 6d., an increase of £1 2s. 6d. the loaf of bread gone from 9d. to 1/1, an increase of 4d.; the lb. of butter gone from 3/9 to 4/4, an increase of 7d.; cigarettes increased in price from 2/10 a packet of 20 to 3/&ndash;, an increase of 2d. a packet; and an increase of 6d. per gallon on petrol.  How about what <Col N="1892" /> Deputy Killilea used to refer to as the poor man's pint?  That has gone up by one penny.</P>
      <P>In the light of these facts, how can the speeches made by Fianna Fáil Deputies be anything other than nonsense of the worst type?  They tell us they had to put the country on its feet. Instead, they have put the workers of this country on their backs, where they will remain until this Government goes out.  We heard Deputy J. Brennan say: &ldquo;We did not make any promises.&rdquo; Has he not got a &ldquo;neck&rdquo; for anything? In a speech in Waterford on 28th February, a few days before the election, what did the Tánaiste say? I presume he was speaking for Deputy J. Brennan, for the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Beegan, and presumably for Deputy Killilea.  He said: &ldquo;The present leaders are threatening the country with all sorts of unpleasant things if Fianna Fáil become the Government, such as compulsory tillage, wage controls, cuts in Civil Service salaries, higher food prices and a lot more besides.  The Fianna Fáil Government do not intend to do any of these things because we do not believe in them.  How more definite can we make our denials of those stupid allegations?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>How, after that statement by the Tánaiste on the eve of the election, can Deputy J. Brennan stand up and say: &ldquo;We made no promises?&rdquo; Surely if the Tánaiste made that statement on the eve of the election, he cannot now justify the increase in the prices of all these commodities.  This Budget has become known throughout the country as Ryan's Blister.  That is what this Budget is called and, mind you, no man can put on a more severe blister than can a doctor.  He certainly succeeded this time.  Remember he is a great man for the blisters; remember that while he was in charge of Agriculture in days gone by, he put on more blisters than that.</P>

      <P>Of course, Deputies who stand up now and attempt to defend this Budget do not approach the real issues.  They cannot approach them.  I think it was Deputy Gallagher who spoke about how the newspapers received it.  Does he know what the local papers wrote about it?  He said that the papers regarded it as a great Budget, a Budget that would put the country on its feet.  I have here a quotation from the <i>Sunday Press</i> of May 12th, a brazen one, I may say.  It quotes Professor Joseph Johnston, a Senior Fellow of Dublin University, as saying it was right to do away with the food subsidies.  Not alone that, but another gentleman quoted, Dr. Louis Smith, said also it was right to do away with the subsidies.  Last came Joe McGrath.  He said it was right to do away with the subsidies.  What about the man down the country?  I happen to have here a copy of a well-known paper in the West of Ireland&mdash; the <i>Tuam Herald</i> for May 18th.  It says that the unemployed are facing starvation.  Here is what the <i>Tuam Herald</i> has to say on the Budget:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is nothing but starvation facing the unemployed in this town unless something is done,&rsquo; declared Mr. Mio Campbell at Tuam Trades Council meeting on Monday night, when he condemned the increases in the price of bread and butter resulting from the withdrawal of the subsidies under the Budget.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil's attitude in trying to defend this Budget is to say they have been only two months in office but if they do as much damage in the next two months as they did in the past two months, what will be done at all?  Their attitude is: Hit me now with a child in my arms.  They do not realise that there are people starving in the country.  I think it was in the <i>Sunday Press</i> last Sunday that the Tánaiste said nobody would sabotage this country as they were a strong Government.  Why should the worker look for an increase in wages?  He should not do it and he would sabotage this country if he did.</P>
      <P>I say the workers of this country must look for an increase in wages and they must get an increase in wages; otherwise they will starve.  I know there are quite a lot of people in the Fianna Fáil Party who do not mind whether they do or not.  All they care about is being on the Government side of the House.

The people of this country, the workers and the producers, are not going to be hounded down in that despicable way. They must get an opportunity to live. I appeal to the Government to reconsider this Budget.  The extra 1/&ndash; for the old age pension or for children's allowances is only fun&mdash;they cannot be serious in giving it.  Surely that is only pulling the wool over the eyes of the people, trying to pretend that they are compensating them for the money being taken from them.  They are doing no such thing.</P>

    <P>I believe that, instead of putting the country on its feet, you are putting the country and its people on their backs.

You could put back the levies which the inter-Party Government had imposed on luxuries and unnecessary articles and get the money required in that way <Col N="1899" /> rather than by taking it from the section of the community which is least able to give it, and which will not give it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been going on for a number of days and nearly every aspect of it has been covered or spoken to in one way or another.  I should like to make a few comments upon the proposals and to ask the Government just exactly what they mean by different statements. We had a statement from Deputy Brennan to-day that this was an honest Budget, that it was necessary and that the previous Administration had done, or omitted to do, something which created this position.  Is it not rather significant that the Minister for Finance, who introduced the Budget and made the Budget statement, did not make any such charge or make any such comment?  It is left to the back benchers of the Party who now form the Government to make these charges, as if they were well founded, when everybody knows that what caused the change of Government was an effort and a determination by the previous Government to bring in an honest statement by imposing the levies necessary to correct the balance of payments problem that had arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that Government had not imposed these levies at that time, it is true to say that we would not have so much unemployment.  If the previous Government had not to restrict expenditure upon various matters, there would not be so much unemployment, but they considered it necessary then. They did the work so well that when a change of Government did take place, the balance of payments problem had been rectified and to-day our balance of payments for the first time is in balance.  I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister, when he was introducing this Budget, was quite clear that it was going to be a very great hardship.  In the course of his speech, he declared that there was a sacrifice that the people would have to accept <Col N="1900" /> and, if they did not accept it, there would be certain consequences.  He had no doubt whatever in his mind that a sacrifice would be asked of the people.</P>
    <P>How history repeats itself.  In 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, and 1938, the people of this country were being asked to accept sacrifices.  I do not intend to go into them, but everybody knows what they were, and that strong Government then imposed these sacrifices. They got their supporters all over the country to believe that these sacrifices were necessary in the interests of the country, when it was well known that no such sacrifices were necessary, and that it was just the antics of a Government imposing hardships of a very grave nature upon the people who, unfortunately, had given them their support at that time.</P>
    <P>I challenge any Fianna Fáil Deputy, in the House or outside the House, to say that he welcomes this Budget, that he is satisfied that it was a grand thing to do.  No; what he will say, and what he is saying, and getting all the supporters he can to say, is that the Government had to do it, that there was no alternative.  The Government speakers here ask what was the alternative and they expect us to put up the alternative.  The former Taoiseach in his speech, the reading of which I commend to the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil and to the Government &mdash;I am not going to quote from it&mdash; showed how the Budget could be balanced and how the difficulties could have been got over, without taking away the food subsidies and imposing the taxes that have been imposed. There are many methods of getting taxation from the people, if they are able to bear it; if they are not able to bear it, then the only alternative is to reduce expenditure.</P>
    <P>When the previous Government attempted to reduce expenditure, is it not true that there was not a Deputy then on this side of the House who did not hold the Government up to ridicule and scorn?  Was it not a pity that the Opposition did not support the Government at that time in doing what was necessary?  It is true that the leader of the Opposition and <Col N="1901" /> the Minister for Health did say that they would not vote against the proposals. They had only one comment to make upon them, that is, that, in their opinion, they would not be sufficient and that we would have to put on more.  Yet, they were so efficient that, in nine months, the balance of payments problem which they set out to rectify was rectified.  That is the proof of their success.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, that brought about a certain amount of unemployment.  We now hear Fianna Fáil talk about 90,000 unemployed and a strong Government.  They forget that in 1940 the total number of unemployed in this country was 147,000.  That was at a time when our Defence Forces were at their highest peak with over 50,000 in the Regular Army.  There were also the countless people who joined the British Army or got work in Britain under the permit system.</P>
    <P>After a great number of years of strong Government, we took office in 1948.  Unemployment was then at a high level.  The net result of the inter-Party Government's operations between 1948 and 1951 was a reduction in unemployment to the lowest level for years.  A rather more significant thing happened.  Because of the increase in the marriage rate, by 1952 there were over 47,000 more children on the school registers and the number has been increasing since then, notwithstanding all the talk about a dwindling population.</P>
    <P>Is there even one member of the Fianna Fáil Party who went into the Party room the day after the Budget and said to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;I am delighted with your Budget?&rdquo; I know well that no member of that Party did that.  I know that they came out here to whistle going by the graveyard. They had to try to defend it and I do not blame them.  Deputy Gallagher said the Opposition are playing politics.  We would have a lot to learn before we could ever play politics as the Party now in Government can and have played them.  I do not know that it would be of any advantage to us, at the same time, because our reputation for honesty in public life would not improve.  We have that reputation and we have always had it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1902" /> When a Deputy gets up behind the Minister and says here in my presence that the sops and the throwing of money to the people for not working are responsible for putting the country in its present condition, I heartily agree with him.  I was referring to all that Fianna Fáil did in that respect&mdash; whether it was free beef or anything else or whether it was like the famous occasion when the present Minister for External Affairs, speaking at Athlone, said there was any amount of food in the country and that it would be a great blessing if every ship were sunk going to and coming from the country, that we would have more and more to eat, and that, instead of having to tighten our belts, we should have to loosen them.</P>
    <P>One farmer, working hard at cleaning a drain and up to his knee in mud was addressed by one of those boys going along the road who said across the ditch to him: &ldquo;Hard work, John.&rdquo;&ldquo;How are you doing?&rdquo; asks John.  &ldquo;I am going in for the free beef.&rdquo; John said: &ldquo;You are lucky to get it that way.  Just look at how hard I have to work for it.&rdquo; The man on the roadside replied: &ldquo;Ah, by the time you walk in for it and walk back again it is hardly worth it.&rdquo; Then John said: &ldquo;Indeed, it is a mean Government that does not post it out to you.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan asserted here in my presence that the reason for this Budget was the sops thrown by the inter-Party Government &mdash;the &ldquo;weak Government&rdquo; according to him.  I am countering that statement by pointing out that if his argument is correct it must come back to his own door and to the door of his Party but not to our door.  Fianna Fáil has the great technique of being able to charge their opponents with their own sins and almost convict them &mdash;and sometimes succeed in convicting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it candidly to the Government that the harshness in this Budget is unnecessary.  The matter could have been adjusted in an easier way.  They <Col N="1903" /> could have taken steps to ease the burden, somewhat.  Let me be quite clear about this.  I am anxious that, as we are doing this, it will get a chance to succeed but it will not succeed if there is another round of increases in wages.  Therefore, along with the Government, I appeal to all concerned to give this Budget a chance.  It will be a sacrifice and a hardship but whatever chance it has rests with the people in doing the best they can.  They voted for this Government and put them into office knowing that they would do this and, as the Minister has asked them to accept the sacrifice, I think they should do so.  I do not know whether or not they will accept my advice but, if they do not, this Budget will be a colossal failure.</P>
    <P>I submit that if the inter-Party groups were in office to-day and brought in a Budget anything like the present Budget then, no matter what the circumstances, there would be a howl from the Fianna Fáil Deputies. We should be torn asunder and politics would be played in a ghastly way.  We should get no opportunity of defending ourselves and, no matter how much we might point to the circumstances that required in our opinion such a Budget, or one nearly as bad, our explanations would not be accepted.  They would say&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;&ldquo;It does not matter what the circumstances may be: this is what you are doing.  These are the hardships you are imposing.&rdquo; The net result would be that the inter-Party Government would be torn asunder with a broadside of political propaganda the like of which we have never heard.</P>
    <P>The harsh effects of the present Budget will be felt daily more and more.  I know that no member of the Fianna Fáil Party is satisfied that it will not impose very grave hardship. The defence is that this Budget is necessary.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, proved conclusively that it is not essential and that there are other alternatives.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 together.  Licences have been granted under Section 5 of the Wireless <Col N="1912" /> Telegraphy Act, 1926, as amended by the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1956, in respect of wireless telegraphy apparatus comprising fixed or base stations and mobile stations fitted in certain hackney vehicles.  The terms and conditions of the licences which cover both transmission and reception and for which the appropriate licence fees have been paid, are in accordance with those specified in the Wireless Telegraphy (Business Radio Licence) Regulations, 1949 and 1956.  The frequencies and power permitted are such that communication with ships at sea is not normally practicable.  In any event such communication would be a breach of the conditions of the licences.  The question of consulting the advisory committee referred to by the Deputies did not arise as Section 19 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, limits the functions of this committee to matters relating to public broadcasting which is not involved in the licensing of private business radio systems.</P>

    <P>The number of persons who have been given notice of dismissal to expire on next Saturday is 32.  These are all employed at the Curragh Camp.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" /> As I have informed the Deputy in reply to a recent question on the same subject the redundancy has occurred because the programme of works planned by the previous Government for the current financial year and the amount of money provided for these works does not provide for employment on the same scale as last year.  As the Deputy is aware the Estimate for Defence for the current financial year has already been passed by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries as to whether there are any schemes prepared in my Department, which if brought forward, would keep these men in employment and have been informed that there are not.  In view of the fact that the plans for schemes to keep these men in employment were not prepared there is no point in asking the Dáil to provide additional funds for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Government at a meeting which was held in July, 1956, decided that the persons then employed in the Curragh Camp should be retained in employment and that work should be provided for them in order to avoid any pay-off, through redundancy or otherwise? Having regard to the fact that there would be no alternative local employment for the men who are now under notice and that he has agreed to receive a deputation from the trade unions concerned to-morrow, would the Minister, at least as a temporary measure, suspend the present dismissals until he hears the case which will be put to him by the trade unions to show that useful maintenance work can be carried on in the Curragh Camp and thus prevent a deterioration in valuable State property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked into this matter from the moment I took office and I am assured by the people concerned that there is no work at present available for these men, no work on which these people could be usefully employed.  Such work was not provided for during the previous Government's period of office; neither was any provision made in the Estimates for money with which to pay these people.  The money provided in the Estimates prepared by the last Government <Col N="1914" /> is not sufficient to maintain employment at the same level, or anything like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If a case can be put to the Minister by the trade unions concerned showing that the pay-off of these men will result in a deterioration in the maintenance of valuable State property and remembering that these men would be entitled to draw £3 1s. per week from the local employment exchange, whilst doing nothing, when useful employment could be provided for them in the Curragh Camp, would he not agree to suspend the dismissal notice for at least a week in order that he may hear the other point of view? There would be very little loss to public funds in the meantime.  In view of the fact that every one of these men will draw £3 1s. per week from the Department of Social Welfare, surely the case has some economic basis as well.</P>

      <P>The Minister is very slick.  At page 24 of his Budget statement he said: &ldquo;This is a sacrifice <Col N="1916" /> which is necessary.&rdquo; He went on further to say: &ldquo;If this sacrifice is not...accepted.&rdquo; This is all very reminiscent of 1933 and 1934.

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>They talk of the sacrifice necessary, but I notice that no sacrifice will be asked of the purchaser of the big motor car or of the television set.  Neither will £140,000 be taken off racing this year.  The Minister for Finance in last year's Budget imposed a stamp duty upon racing and that duty brought in £140,000.  It was imposed for one year.  This Government has decided not to reimpose that stamp duty, thereby making a present of £140,000 to the people who are engaged in racing.  That may be necessary, but it is done in a very slick way.  We are not told about it. Neither is any defence made in the Budget statement as to why the racing confraternity here and the book-makers are to get a gift of £140,000.</P>

      <P>The whole defence of this Budget by Fianna Fáil spokesmen is that it was necessary.  It is completely unnecessary.  As has been clearly demonstrated by the former Taoiseach several other measures and remedies were available.  I commend <Col N="1919" /> that speech of the former Taoiseach to the Fianna Fáil Government for their reconsideration of the submissions he has made for the balancing of the Budget.</P>

      <P>And the twist is in.  I do not intend to detain the House elaborating on the Budget.  I am satisfied it is unecessary and that it imposes grave hardship.  We have a problem in regard to securing a market for exports and I commend the principle I have enunciated all my life and that I put into practice at every opportunity, that is, that everybody should give of his best in what-ever field he is working, that the more that is produced and the greater the exports, the better for everybody.  I do commend the previous Government for its assistance in remitting taxation on profits on exports and this Government for carrying it on.  I would suggest that they would go further and give even more extensive benefits to those who are developing exports of goods that were not previously exported from this country or not manufactured here.</P>

      <P>There are other things the Government can do, for instance, in relation to tourism.  They can assist hotels to give better accommodation, and so on, by giving them the same rates as commercial firms have, banks, etc., for the depreciation of their premises.  That would be well spent money because it would develop <Col N="1920" /> tourism and make accommodation available.  There are 101 things that could be done, but mention of the obligation is not enough to provide the solutions.  The former Taoiseach, as I say, has given a headline and has shown conclusively how the Budget could have been balanced.  Everybody knows that were it not for the Suez situation and all the other things that happened last year, we would have balanced the Budget.  Those events were completely outside our control but Fianna Fáil when in opposition did not make it any easier for us.  Anything they could do to make it more difficult they took pride in doing.  It was a disservice to the country, and I hope that we, on this side of the House, shall not follow that line.  I suggest to the Government that they should be careful and not demand sacrifices where sacrifices are not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that, in talking about this Budget, many of us are inclined to pay too little attention to its effects on the people at large and, through its effect on the people, its effect on the national economy. Fianna Fáil Deputies have repeatedly advanced the argument that the effect of the Budget will be to help to create employment among the thousands of idle workers.  It is somewhat peculiar that, by increasing the cost of the basic foods of ordinary workers' families, by reducing their power to buy other necessary or desirable goods, the result will be a greater demand from Irish industry and agriculture for their products.  This is the type of argument that Fianna Fáil Deputies repeatedly put forward: Workers must spend more of their earnings if they are to provide their families with the same quantities of bread and butter as previously; and if they spend more on bread and butter, obviously they will have less for other products, and if they spend less on other products, there will be still more demand for these other products within our own domestic economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, Fianna Fáil Deputies already appear to be flirting with their sole remedy for what is likely to prove <Col N="1921" /> the natural reaction of those affected by these imposts on basic commodities, the suggestion being, first of all, that workers should not seek to maintain the standard of living, such as it is, of themselves and their families, by seeking adjustments in their wage rates. The Minister for Defence, in making a contribution to the debate, said, as reported in Volume 161, No. 10, at column 1289:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The whole tenor of the speeches here has been to exaggerate the effect of the Budget on the cost of living.  The actual fact is that, as regards the two items affected by the withdrawal of the subsidies, the increased cost per head of the population will be no more than 2d. per day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the same column, he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it is a pity at this juncture that Coalition speakers should adopt such an irresponsible attitude by their speeches here and attempt to incite people to take action which they know would be detrimental to the nation's interests.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Defence is not here, but I hope he reads his own contribution, because I know he represents a constituency, and is fairly familiar with it, on which these burdens will fall very severely.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach as reported in Volume 161, No. 11, at column 1441 said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main purpose behind our Budget, apart from laying an assured foundation for future progress, is to try to induce conditions which will lead to increased employment and production, which will give greater opportunities to our people for earning a livelihood and through increased production, provide at least the same standard of living coupled with the opportunity to save.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does this Budget serve that main purpose?  The Taoiseach says it does. Therefore, an increase of almost 50 per cent. in the cost to a working class family in the price of bread, an increase in the price of butter&mdash; although there are many thousands of working-class families who are not <Col N="1922" /> familiar with the taste of butter&mdash;will be a factor contributing to increased production.  Increased production of what?  Certainly not of bread and butter, because if one cannot buy bread and butter, there will be less demand for it.</P>
    <P>The Budget will certainly increase the cost of living for the average family.  If one takes, for example, an average family in the City of Dublin with two or three children, one finds that each day, two or three loaves are required to feed them.  The family can either reduce its intake of bread or its intake of butter; or it can endeavour to buy the same quantities at the expense of other commodities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher referred to a deputation which was received by Deputies yesterday evening and he said that the main complaint of the women, who live in a north-eastern constituency in a working-class area, in what one might term a depressed area, was that there was no employment available for their husbands or their families.  He indicated that the members of the deputation assured him that if their husbands or sons secured employment, they would be able to provide for their families. Deputy Gallagher also dealt with one specific aspect of the matter.  He is adopting the tactics of a competent lawyer, of asking a leading question. Obviously, if a family has been suffering chronic unemployment and if the family have been required to depend not just on the unemployment benefits but on unemployment assistance, and they are asked, if the members get employment, will the members be in a better economic position, the answer must be &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher did not dwell too much, however, on the fact that the members of that deputation stated categorically that the effect of the withdrawal of the food subsidies would be to injure their miserable standard of existence and compel them to reduce their purchases of bread for their families.  Of course, with a family in the middle or upper income group, the variation in the price of a loaf might not be so very serious, because their <Col N="1923" /> basic food is not confined to the simple basic necessaries, bread, margarine and tea.  To the general families who are covered by social assistance, this variation and increase in the cost of bread will, without any doubt, cause very severe hardship.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth suggested that Fianna Fáil, having returned here with 78 seats and no doubt having received a lot of votes from working class voters, represents the interests of the working class.  If a trade union official went to an employer and represented his members in the same way as Deputy Booth and his colleague are representing the working class, as evidenced by this Budget, he would not have his job very long.  The greatest single example of gross betrayal&mdash;if they did represent the working class&mdash;is their action on this occasion.  I have no doubt that a lot of working men and working women and a lot of trade unionists voted for Fianna Fáil at the last general election</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt a very considerable number cast their votes in the firm belief that Fianna Fáil would provide full employment almost over-night. Certainly they had not the slightest suspicion that Fianna Fáil's first activity would be to attack basic living standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am no apologist for what has happened in the past three or four years.  I expressed the view here in relation to the building industry that the situation was becoming very serious, on account of increasing unemployment in that industry.  Deputies who were here then know that I never hesitated to be critical on the question of the provision of employment for our citizens and particularly for those with whom I have most contact, those living in our capital city.  Members of Fianna Fáil have repeated very often in the course of this debate that they are interested mainly in two things, in endeavouring to provide a solution for the unemployment problem and to develop industries here so as to afford <Col N="1924" /> opportunities to workers to maintain a good standard of living.  Surely if Fianna Fáil were in earnest about all that, their first action should have been to make sure by all means which lay in their power, that the present economic situation would not be complicated. There is no Deputy who does not realise that if workers' standards are reduced, if the cost of living is increased, and particularly by direct Government action, workers who are members of trade unions will consider that they are right to protect their interests and to maintain the standard of living of themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>Has this Government or any Government the right to say to the citizens of this country, to the workers in urban and rural areas, to the small shopkeepers, to those employed in offices and elsewhere, that we can advance solely on the basis of the sacrifices of those people and their children?  Yet, Deputy after Deputy from Fianna Fáil, in this House and outside the House, adopts the attitude that an increase in the cost of living does not justify workers in taking action to protect their own living standards.</P>
    <P>The following report appears in the <i>Irish Times</i> of May 23rd of yesterday's proceedings in the Dáil at Question Time:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dr. Browne asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the reduction in purchasing power consequent on the Budget proposals, and the possibilities of demands by wage and salary earners to secure increases, he would state whether the Government intended to facilitate such increases or, on the other hand, to introduce an Order similar to the Emergency Powers Order of 1941 restricting increases on remuneration.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass referred the Deputy to the statement he had made on the Budget Resolutions.</P>
    <P>I have read the Minister's statement on the Budget Resolution and I fail to find any indication in it that he or his Government will not introduce wage standstill orders.  The Minister, in reply to a supplementary question, again by Deputy Dr. Browne, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" />&ldquo;The Deputy has not the slightest grounds for suggesting that any such idea is in mind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that any of the Ministers, when candidates in the recent election, indicated to anyone that they had any idea in their minds of removing the food subsidies, and when Deputy Norton put that question&mdash;I think, on the election of Taoiseach&mdash;in connection with food subsidies, the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not have any idea in his mind then. Why are Fianna Fáil Deputies harping on this question of wage restraint?  In 1950, they were able to raise their voices very strongly for wage increases. They certainly have some influence with members of many trade unions.  I had experience on many occasions in that year of hearing the demands of trade unions for increased wage rates.</P>

      <P>The Minister interrupted me.  I heard many demands for increased wage rates from members of trade unions, many of whom I knew to be active Fianna Fáil members.  The peculiarity about the matter was that I never heard them claiming or seeking at that time anything less than an increase of 30/&ndash; a week.  In 1952, when Fianna Fáil indicated their contempt for the ordinary people of this country by their first attack on the basic foods, there were other demands.  The significant feature in that year was that the active Fianna Fáil members in the various trade unions and trade union branches were very quiet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>When it suits the political programme of Fianna Fáil, they can manage to get very vocal demands.  On other occasions, their members manage to forget that they have any responsibility.  It appears to me, speaking in a general way on this matter, that the Government have three lines of approach to the present problem.  One approach appears to be the approach of what might be called a caretaker Government, that is, a caretaker Government within their own period.  They have 78 members and should be reasonably secure, for a short period, at any rate.  The approach to this Budget problem may be based on the outlook: &ldquo;Well, we have no idea at the moment; we took a certain line of action in 1952; we shall try that and see what happens <Col N="1927" /> in a few months' time.&rdquo; Of course that might be confused with the other possible explanation that they have no real idea of how to deal with the present situation.  Thirdly, and only time will tell if this approach is being used, the approach may be one of cold-blooded cynicism, with the outlook: &ldquo;We are imposing this Budget in the hope that within a year or so we may be able to provide some form of relief under various headings of taxation and then hope to get another mandate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the necessity for maintaining and improving the standard of living.  I wonder would the Minister or some of his colleagues clearly indicate what section of the community they are talking about when they refer to maintaining and improving the standard of living.  The standard of living for the general level of the community will not be maintained. The effect of course, will be to reduce it.  I am talking not only about the agricultural labourer or the semi-skilled workers in the urban community; I am also talking about the professional classes, the semi-professional classes and the thousands who have been encouraged to enter into commitments to purchase their own homes.  I am talking for those on a salary limit of £8, £10 or £12 a week who have been finding it very difficult trying to maintain their families under existing conditions&mdash;trying to repay capital and interest under the Small Dwellings Act loans, to repay insurance companies and to pay ground rent and rates.  Now they have this additional cost on their families' basic needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told to-day that there has been £140,000 remitted on racing.  In answer to a question yesterday we we were also told that expenditure on Embassies in London and Paris was in the neighbourhood of £300,000 and £400,000.  Of course £180,000 was spent on the little cottage in the Phoenix Park.  Do these appear to be justifiable items of expenditure?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce remarked that they are accepting the <Col N="1928" /> responsibility.  It is nobody else's responsibility. They are accepting the responsibility for cold-bloodedly imposing this burden on the people by the removal of the food subsidies, thus increasing the price of bread and butter.  They will accept the responsibility if at this juncture, by throwing a spanner into the national economy, they spark off claims for increases in wages and salaries and further adjustments in prices.  They will accept that responsibility too.  Of course they say that people should not look for wage or salary increases.  They say that the people should be content and try to exist.  If they do try to exist the possible market for the purchase of goods produced in this country is contracted. Mind you, they may be right.  They may be on the right road to prosperity but surely it would have been more in the interests of the community if they had maintained some sense of responsibility by endeavouring to avoid upsetting the economy and doing something for the unemployed in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I do not think that a solution for unemployment will be easily found.  If there is an easy solution it should have been found some time during the last 30 odd years during which this country had control of its own affairs. Every Deputy knows that a figure of around 60,0000 unemployed has not been an unusual figure.  It is a figure we should not be prepared to accept. Reference was made during the course of this debate to the question of abnormal unemployment.  It was suggested then, even at the beginning of the effort to provide jobs for 100,000, that Fianna Fáil are thinking in terms already of a normal unemployed pool of thousands.  Of course that would not be out of character.  The Minister for Health on more than one occasion indicated quite clearly that it would be a fairly healthy thing for the economy of the country if there was a constant pool of unemployed.  In other words, the intimation was that it would be a happy thing if employers could always rely on having a few thousand men or girls signing on at the labour exchanges, so that they could always hold over their heads the fear of unemployment.  On more than one <Col N="1929" /> occasion, the Minister for Health said that.</P>
    <P>I wonder if that is the idea permeating the minds of Fianna Fáil so soon after the election.  Before the election, they quite clearly gave to understand they were satisfied they had definite plans for providing 100,000 new jobs.  It is known that, to maintain the present level of employment in this country and to provide new jobs for those leaving schools and universities, it is necessary to find 20,000 new jobs each year.  Past Governments have managed to provide something like a thousand jobs each year.  Fianna Fáil have intimated that they propose to deal with unemployment and emigration by providing 100,000 new jobs.  I hope they do it, and, if there is anything anyone on these benches can do to help them, they can rest assured of our full co-operation.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that the way to tackle a problem like that is, first of all, to impose a burden on the workers.  No country in the world has increased production and employment by deflationary methods.  We hear a lot about the U.S.A.; we expect to entertain a lot of tourists from there, particularly at this time of the year.  In the early 1930s, what was the position in the U.S.A., following an acute crisis?  Someone developed a little common sense and arrived at the conclusion that the crisis could not be surmounted by reducing employment, that the way to do it was to inject finance into the provision of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>All one could read about the U.S.A. at that time was the suicide of financiers and the collapse of banks; but their approach was not deflationary.  What would have happened if, in 1945 and 1946, Britain had adopted the measures adopted in the hungry 1930s?  Fianna Fáil were given a majority in the last election. Deputy J. Brennan used the words <Col N="1930" />&ldquo;strong Government&rdquo;.  I do not like those words, because strength and power can so easily corrupt.  It is very easy for people who feel themselves strong to lose their regard for the weak.  Strong Governments tend to produce solutions for problems by methods arising from their strength and not from their understanding of the difficulties of the people they are supposed to represent.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, Fianna Fáil will remain in office, if they so desire, for five years.  Before the election, they did not tell the people they would solve the difficulty in five years' time; they indicated they would solve the difficulties overnight. People who are hungry cannot afford to wait very long.  I am speaking now of those who are not in a position to do anything for themselves&mdash;the people for whom the Minister, a former Minister for Health, should have particular regard.  I can only gauge the Minister's regard for those people by the provisions made in this Budget for increased social assistance benefits to offset increases in prices.</P>

      <P>The proposals in the Budget pose problems that will have to be faced by the citizens throughout the country.  I do not believe this Budget will be conducive to results which will be of any lasting benefit to the nation or its people.  I do not think it tends to solve in any material way the very serious problems of unemployment or emigration, but it will tend to upset the internal economy of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that Deputy Gallagher, in making a contribution here to-day indicated he was not opposed to workers seeking an increase in wages?  He went on to talk in terms <Col N="1932" /> of increases to compensate them for increased production.  Of course, production has increased, so far as the workers are concerned.  I think he neglected to indicate what his views were regarding the possibility of workers seeking compensation to maintain or restore their standard of living. If his views were similar to those expressed by his colleagues, which were clearly based on a suggestion that any hardships imposed by this Budget should, in the view of Fianna Fáil Deputies, be suffered by the ordinary people and that the people at large would not, in their view, be entitled to secure compensation for the very serious reduction in their living standards, I can only say I believe the Budget is an unwise one, ill-conceived and beneficial to no one.  It is certainly not beneficial to any of the main sections of the community who give some service to the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow, there has been a good lot of talk.  The talk was all in the one direction, that the burdens imposed by the Budget would destroy all and sundry within the country. Deputy Larkin has been speaking about the class he knows best, the working class.  He spoke about imposing burdens on the working class.  I take it they are in employment.  He was also concerned that the workers in employment in this country should have the right, arising out of this Budget, to make further demands on the community, in order, as he said, to maintain their present standard. Personally, I often wonder whether Deputy Larkin and the Labour Party are satisfied that all the burdens put on the workers in employment in the past three years under the Government of which he and his Party were part were fully compensated for or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good number of people in this country happen to know that, within the past year, the trade union leaders of this country were not slow to inform their members down the country who <Col N="1933" /> were inclined to make demands that they should hold off as it would embarrass the Government and the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <P>The Budget introduced some nine days ago contains proposals to raise certain sums of money to maintain the services that were in operation.  None of the Opposition Deputies has attempted to prove that suggestion that increased taxation was not necessary.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened in the last three years?  Why was it necessary to have increased taxation in this Budget instead of reducing the cost of Government by £20,000,000 as Deputy McGilligan broadcast in 1954? The Coalition Government was responsible for putting up the cost of Government by almost £25,000,000.  Is that not a fact?  Let us face facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are further facts. For the last 18 months we had much talk about the balance of payments problem and about the great measures which Deputy Costello took 12 months ago to deal with that problem.  Who was responsible for creating the situation that caused inflation in this country and brought about the change in the balance of payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ask Deputy Briscoe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Coalition Government took over in 1954 without any balance of payments problem.  On the eve of the general election Deputy McGilligan promised to pay out <Col N="1935" /> £2,000,000 to the civil servants and the Minister for Health, then Deputy MacEntee, said that the finances of this country were unable to pay it. They were not in office 24 hours before they took off the sugar and butter subsidies.  They then had to take measures to impose taxation on the people of the country.  What created unemployment last year?  Was it not those taxes imposed to fight inflation? They used up the sustenance of this country and as a result of that policy created inflation.  The Government of this country deliberately created inflation. There is no doubt about that. They created the problem in this country to-day, that we have no source of income and no new source of taxation. They have put up the cost of Government so high that the taxpayers of this country are unable to pay further taxation to maintain the expensive machine that has been created.</P>
      <P>All the foreign assets were used up at the same time.  We have had, to use a popular expression, a damned good time in this country.  We have spent all that is to be spent.  All the resources of the country have been spent and we are driven now in this Budget to take off the food subsidies on bread and butter.  There was no other source available.  Nobody got up on the Opposition Benches to say you could raise £10,000,000 without economies of some sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>No responsible Deputy got up and said we could raise £10,000,000 as they said in the past. The situation that was created is well known to the community as a whole. Fianna Fáil are in office to-day because the community, the people of Ireland, realised that fact.  Why had we the General Election in March of this year?  The previous Government were telling us that they had two or three years to go.  They could have remained here as a Government.  They went to the country because it was a well known fact that they could not carry on any longer because the credit of the country was lost.</P>

We must increase production from agriculture and industry and in every other way.</P>
      <P>I would describe this Budget as a stop-gap Budget.  If it is not effective this year, and if we do not get the improvement which is so essential, things will get worse as we go along. Some Minister for Finance will come here at some future date and, instead of imposing a rather mild but, admittedly, disagreeable tax he will be forced to put much more serious proposals before the House.  It is unfortunate, but, nevertheless, we must face it; both sides of the House must take responsibility and face facts.</P>

They made that decision because of the economic situation and because of their inability to solve it.  They were in a cleft stick and the country was in a cleft stick.  They were incapable of getting agreement in that Government to raise sufficient taxation to pay for the cost of government.  They created inflation and that, in turn, brought about unemployment.  It put up the cost of living.  The total production of the country was unable to maintain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we want to maintain them if we can.  However, they must be paid for by somebody.  The taxpayers can pay those taxes only out of production. If we impose a heavier burden on the taxpayers, then production will be unable to pay and the situation becomes serious for the country.  Our credit goes down.  I might say that it could not have sunk much lower than it was in the period before the Coalition Government left office.  It is unfortunate for the country and for everybody in it that things are as they are.  The members of this House were elected by the people to look after their interests and, whether in Government or in opposition, each member of the House must realise his responsibility and act accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised at the line taken by the Opposition in this debate.  That is particularly so when one remembers that the Coalition Government left office because of the prevailing economic <Col N="1939" /> situation.  I would not mind so much if times were normal, but times are abnormal, and abnormal steps have had to be taken to put things right. Deputy Sweetman's last Budget did not balance.  He may have paid the debts that arose out of the Budget in so far as he paid salaries, wages and allowances, but he paid them out of quite a considerable amount of borrowed money.  He will not deny that.  It is obvious that we could not continue to borrow each year in order to pay for our ordinary current expenditure. That is the reason for the present taxation and for the removal of the bread and butter subsidies.  There was no other resort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The fundamental purpose of this Budget is to pay for the cost of the services which this House orders, to avoid the necessity of borrowing money to pay for those services and to enable the Government to pay the grants which they committed themselves to give to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Deputy who is also a member of a local authority, knows quite well the situation that faced the Government and the country since June of last year.  It was quite apparent.  Circulars were coming down every day from some Minister or other stalling on this, that or the other grant.  You got authority from the Minister for Local Government to go to your treasurer and borrow more money.  I am a member of one county council.  Last year we built a certain number of houses. At the end of February this year, we found we had not got a shilling from the Local Loans Fund although sanction had been given ten months before <Col N="1941" /> that.  No money was left in the Local Loans Fund to be advanced.  We went to our treasurer for £140,000 of road grants.  We spent all those grants and, at the end of the last calendar year, we had not got a shilling.  The money was not in the funds&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to be judged on the fact that the finances of local authorities were strained to breaking point because of the failure of the Government to pay out the grants, so much so, that their treasurers warned the county managers in the different counties, that, if this continued, they would have to dishonour their cheques.  That was a well-known fact.  It is no wonder the credit of the country was low.  At least one local authority had their paying orders dishonoured by their treasurer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The credit of the country was dragged into the mire by the last Coalition Government.  That is why Fianna Fáil is in power to-day.  For the last nine months the people were dying for an opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1942" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They are dying for another opportunity now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We got a mandate to try and put the affairs of the nation straight and give it an opportunity of making progress again.  Thank God, we are doing that.  The Minister for Finance has taken the first steps in that direction by providing the necessary finances to pay for the ordinary running expenses of the country.  I suggest to the Minister that he will have to take, perhaps, even further far-reaching measures before this day 12 months to reduce the cost of State services in whatever way it is possible to do so.  The sooner the country faces that the better.  If we do not give a little help to the people from whom we expect to get production, be they agriculturists or industrialists, we cannot expect to get the response that is absolutely necessary.  Whether we like it or not, we will be forced to give that lead.</P>
      <P>We hope it will be possible to give more employment and to put into employment again those who were employed two or three years ago.  We also hope to have less emigration.  I admit straight away that a great number of people are leaving this country who had decent employment in it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>You did not say that last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but not all those who left had employment.  Probably half of them had employment in this country.  Unfortunately, however, we have up to 100,000 unemployed.  It is agreed that at least a third of them are unemployable.  Nevertheless, we have huge numbers, especially in the towns and cities, unemployed.  There are great difficulties in a place like Dublin.  I often think that the total production of whatever industries are in Dublin is not capable of maintaining a third of the population.  From estimates made of the total production in the City of Dublin, it is stated that that production is not capable of maintaining more than one-third of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a serious problem in rural towns.  We must start building <Col N="1943" /> again.  We must build where the building is necessary and not just for the sake of building.  There are still thousands of houses needed in towns and rural areas.  Because of the damper put on building last year, it will be very difficult to get any output this year.  No arrangements were made to get sites ready or anything else since this time 12 months.  It will take some time to get the country into its stride. A period of great difficulty faces the country in that respect alone.</P>
    <P>It was only last week that county councils got notice of grants.  Ordinarily they would have got them in February.  I am speaking of Road Fund grants.  They would have got that notification early in February and would have been making their plans for road construction since then.  Now they are getting notice only in the middle of May.  That will further delay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They were told the usual thing in February.  Wexford County <Col N="1944" /> Council were told: &ldquo;You may spend on anticipated work grants out of the Road Fund to the sum of £X&rdquo;&mdash;I think it was £18,000&mdash;&ldquo;but you must go to your treasurer for it&rdquo;.  On the date the local authority received that, little or none of the previous year's grant had been paid to them.  Our treasurer had notified us at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
