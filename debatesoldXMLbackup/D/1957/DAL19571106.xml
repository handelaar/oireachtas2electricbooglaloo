      <P>I have been informed that it is the practice of Radio Éireann to preserve the scripts of its news bulletins for one year only and that no records are now available for any date earlier than the 1st October, 1956.  The first occasion of the kind referred to in the Deputy's question that arose since that date was the broadcasting, on the 5th October, 1956, of a report of a statement made by the then Taoiseach at a meeting of representatives of the political parties that supported the last Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the sponsors of the Whitegate refinery have announced that it is not their intention to produce oil by-products, and, if so, and in view of the fact that an enormous amount of by-products could be produced from oil to supply the raw materials for several ancillary industries, whether he will take steps to encourage the refinery company to alter its policy on this important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a report in a newspaper of a lecture given recently by one of the oil refining company's representatives in which it was stated that it was not at present intended to manufacture by-products at the Whitegate refinery because the process of conversion involved considerable expenditure which would not be justified owing to lack of adequate market outlets here or elsewhere.  It is my intention to encourage the refining company and any other persons who may be interested in using the by-products of the refinery to undertake such additional operations as may prove feasible when the appropriate time comes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the use of Irish manufactured <Col N="463" /> materials, including paint, glass, tyres, springs and upholstery, normally used on vehicles assembled at an Irish plant (particulars supplied), is prohibited in the case of cars assembled at that plant for the American market, and, if so, whether he will state the reasons for this prohibition, and if his Department have been consulted in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any prohibition on the use of Irish produced materials in the assembly here of cars intended for exportation to the American market.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers are entitled to import without payment of customs duty and free of quota restrictions any article required for use in manufacture and subsequent export.</P>
      <P>I should like to add that, in my view, the firm concerned deserve to be commended on having developed this trade, which is giving quite substantial additional employment, and I have no intention of putting any obstacle in its way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the information I supplied to the Minister, can he say that inquiries were made by him and does he not think it desirable that whatever steps are open to him might be taken to encourage the use of materials manufactured in Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this type of meddling question should be discouraged. Any Irish manufacturer can get the trade provided he can give competitive prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Manley</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the frequency of cattle mart sales in various centres of County Cork, and of the inadequacy of licensed transport in catering for haulage to and from these marts, he will, in the interests of the live-stock trade, extend the same facilities in respect of live stock to unlicensed hauliers as obtain for the haulage of milk and wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any such inadequacy of licensed transport as is stated in the question. There are C.I.E. lorry depots at seven centres in County Cork and, in addition, there are 180 hauliers in the county whose licences authorise the carriage of live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that these marts are held once a week and that the fairs were formerly held once a month?  Further does he realise that the tendency now is to transport all live stock to these marts and to transport them back again from the marts and that it is of paramount importance that the. private hauliers should get these facilities in the interest of the live-stock trade?</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a question on this subject on the 30th October.  I can add nothing to that reply at present.  It would not in any event be appropriate to enter into figures of the company's expenditure from its own funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The recollection of the Deputy is not quite correct.  It was stated at the time that it was the intention to introduce legislation to put the capital position of this company on a more regular basis and that the Government had approved, in principle, of the idea of proceeding with its development in the manufacture of sheet steel.  That scheme was not proceeded with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister now consider it wise that the company should import the blank sheets from <Col N="466" /> Britain at an exorbitant price and that the farmers should have to pay high prices for corrugated iron?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there is considerable disappointment in the East Wall area over the comparatively small amount of employment being provided by the new graving dock, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of utilisation of the new graving dock and the employment afforded by it must, of course, depend on the success of the efforts to secure business by the ship-repairing firms who use the dock.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Port and Docks Board that in the few months in which it has been in use, 15 vessels have used the new dock.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is the practice of the owners of large fleets to arrange in the early months of the year their programme of overhauls for a period of 12 months ahead.  I am advised that the Dublin ship-repairing interests are pursuing a vigorous campaign, by advertising and otherwise, to secure a share of this work, the volume of which might normally be expected to increase as the new dock becomes known to a wider circle of ship owners.</P>

      <P>My information is that the holders of medical cards in County Kerry who obtain institutional services in the Regional Hospital, Limerick, are not obliged to contribute towards their maintenance in the Regional Hospital if the services for which they are referred are not available in a health institution in County Kerry.  Where, however, the services obtained in the Regional Hospital, Limerick, are such as are available in any institution administered by the Kerry County Council the patient is regarded as exercising a choice of hospital in accordance with the provisions of Section 25 of the Health Act, 1953.  The patient is then liable for the difference between the hospital charge and the health authority's subvention which subvention at present is 13/- per day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>By this year's Finance Act the income-tax relief originally afforded by Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, was extended to all securities issued to the public subsequent to 1932 by Irish manufacturing concerns. The tax remission as extended applies not only to issues already made but to future issues as well.  The extension of the remission to existing issues which <Col N="483" /> had not previously qualified will facilitate the raising of fresh capital by the companies concerned and so indirectly will act as an incentive to production. It will be appreciated that where such a company proposes to float a further issue the removal of the subdivision of securities previously necessitated by the provisions of Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, will mean that the new shares will join a larger uniform class and so will possess enhanced marketability.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to query (b)&mdash;the steps taken to deal with complaints&mdash;technical <Col N="505" /> staff with vans and the necessary equipment travel continuously from centres at Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford on interference investigation and a person who makes a complaint is visited as early as practicable.  It will be realised, however, that as almost every piece of electrical equipment in the country and every electric light switch is a potential source of interference it would need a huge interference organisation to be able to investigate complaints immediately on receipt.  Generally an effort is made to concentrate on whole towns or other areas in which there is evidence of considerable interference and to eliminate or reduce the trouble in the areas visited.  This general investigation often discloses unsuspected as well as known sources of interference and gives assistance to all the set owners in the area whether or not they have made complaints.  The staff is prepared to fit suppressors at cost price but of course owners of offending apparatus can only be urged but not compelled to fit them.  I am glad to say that the co-operation of the owners of electrical equipment in this matter has generally been excellent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A new National Loan will open for subscription on Monday next, the 11th November.  The loan will be for £10,000,000 and it will be underwritten jointly by the Banks and the Government. The rate of interest will be 6 per cent.  per annum and the issue price is £100 for every £100 of stock purchased.  The stock will be redeemed at par in 1967.</P>
      <P>To facilitate investors, there is, as usual, provision in the prospectus whereby only 10 per cent.  of the purchase price need be paid on application, the remainder being paid in three further equal instalments over the months of December and January.  On the other hand, those who wish to pay the full amount on application or to complete their subscription on allotment will be entitled to discounts which will give them approximately 6 per cent. interest from the date of payment.</P>
      <P>The loan is for the relatively short period of ten years.</P>
      <P>The tax privileges which have been a feature of recent loans are again included.  Interest will be paid without deduction of tax at source, though, of course, holders will, if ordinarily resident in the State, be liable to whatever tax on the interest is appropriate to their respective incomes. Stock of the issue will be accepted as the equivalent of cash in satisfaction of death duties on properties of which it formed a part.  The stock and the interest on it will be exempt from all Irish taxation, present and future, if owned by a person neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
      <P>The issue is being made under the authority of the Appropriation Act, 1957, and other statutes.  Both principal and interest will be a charge on the Central Fund.  The market value of the stock will be upheld not only by its short life but also by the high interest rate it carries, by its status as a trustee security, by the concession whereby it will be accepted in payment of death duties and by the substantial sinking fund allocations which are being provided.  A continuing and active market will be ensured by the arrangement under which the Government Stockbroker will be prepared at all times to buy and sell blocks of the stock in reasonable amounts.</P>
      <P>Three and three-quarter per cent. Financial Agreement Loan, 1953-58, is due for redemption next September, and I am giving holders of that stock an option of converting into the present issue.  This is a very attractive offer and I hope it will be availed of to a large extent.</P>
      <P>Five and a half per cent.  National Loan, 1966, which was issued in October, 1956, carried a right of conversion into any public issue made by the Government within five years.  I am giving effect to this right in the present issue.</P>
      <P>Stock of the new loan issued under these conversion arrangements will be additional to the £10,000,000 of stock offered for cash subscription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> The prospectus will be published in to-morrow morning's newspapers. Copies of the prospectus, with the application form for cash subscriptions appended, may also be obtained as from to-morrow from any bank, stockbroker or post office.  The lists will close not later than Friday, 15th November.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We wholeheartedly support this loan and recommend every patriotic citizen who has the means available to do the same.</P>
      <P>Where the national interest is involved there can be no disagreement between Parties and there can be no question but that the national interest requires that this loan should be a success.  We have at all times, whether in Government or in Opposition, maintained that there can be no disagreement about the proposition that the national interest requires the investment in Ireland of the national savings, current and past.</P>
      <P>We are quite appreciative of the urgent necessity that adequate capital should be available for private enterprise, the carrying-on of agriculture, business and industry, but every Government in the circumstances now confronting us must carry out an extensive capital programme if the problems of national development, emigration, unemployment and poverty, are to be expeditiously and effectively dealt with.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, Irish people who have investments abroad should so arrange their affairs as to secure that at least a substantial proportion of those savings should be invested in Irish securities.  No Irish person with means should have it on his conscience that any Irishman has been left unemployed who could be put to work but for lack of national investment.  It is quite literally true that unless the people with money are prepared to invest in Irish prosperity they will do injury to themselves, their fellow-citizens, and the future of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial structure of this State is very strong and justifies every confidence. The improvements in the <Col N="540" /> balance of payments and in the banking position are very encouraging.  A well-supported loan will mark another stage in the recovery which the nation has made from the economic blizzard which hit it last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister's announcement and to commend the terms of the loan to all those who can afford to subscribe to it.  The terms are attractive.  The relatively short-term character of the loan makes it additionally attractive. The provisions for maintaining the stability of the loan and for repayment all offer attractions which no doubt will be realised by those who propose to invest.</P>
      <P>Whatever differences there are on other matters between the various Parties in the House, there is, happily, agreement on the fundamental question that capital investment is essential if we are to promote the development of our shipping potential and of our peat resources; if we are to erect houses for our people, promote electrical development, carry out our air developments, provide for schools and proper afforestation of the country.</P>
      <P>The best way of raising the capital necessary to finance these projects is by the savings of the people.  No country that has been able to achieve a high level of capital development has been able to do so without relying on the resources of its own people to finance those capital developments. Therefore, the best form of investment from the Irish point of view is savings by the Irish people.  Savings by our own people which promote capital development are much more desirable than seeking moneys elsewhere for the development of our resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Savings, too, have the additional merit that they promote thrift and it is that thrift&mdash;a virtue in itself&mdash;which makes national development possible. We have all heard from time to time cynical comments on savings.  Some people are so warped in their approach to the problem that they take the line that savings are undesirable and that they have no responsibility to participate in a savings movement.  That is an unhealthy outlook.  The poorest <Col N="541" /> person in the country, whether he likes it or not, must be interested in the success of a National Loan and must be interested in the promotion of a savings campaign.  It is savings that make development possible.  It is the fact that we can develop our potential and carry out essential capital works that provides work even for the poorest person in the country.</P>
    <P>Investment in a National Loan, therefore, has the merit that it provides a reasonable return for the investor.  For those who are not able to invest it makes possible the development which enables them to secure work and thus lubricates the whole economy.  I have great pleasure in commending this loan to the general public.  I hope it will be oversubscribed and that the Minister shortly will be able to announce that the success of the loan is evidence of the faith of our people in the development of their own country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Business, as set out in the Order Paper, will be taken as follows: Nos. 1, 2, 6, 7, 3, 8, 9, 4 and 10.  Private Members' business will be taken at 9 o'clock or earlier if the Government's business concludes early.</P>
      <P>Last week I was asked if I could give an indication of the business for the rest of the session.  I think it is possible to give a general indication of what the Dáil will be asked to do before the Christmas adjournment. First, there is the completion of all stages of the Bills now in progress.  In addition, it is desired to secure the enactment of the following Bills already introduced but not yet circulated: Scholarship Exchange Bill, the Trustees Savings Bank Bill and the Tourist Traffic (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, it is desired to secure the enactment of Bills yet to be introduced. One is to continue the Rent Restrictions Act, the Administration of Estates Bill, to be sponsored by the Minister for Justice.  There is the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill and the Agricultural Institute Bill, which is being introduced to-day.  There is a Bill to amend a Local Loans Act and <Col N="542" /> a Gas Price Bill.  Furthermore, it is hoped the Dáil will agree in this session to give Second Readings to the following Bills which may require considerable interval between the Second Reading and Committee Stages: the Greyhound Industry Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>He will have a lot to say about it, I am sure.  There are the Trustee (Authorised) Investment Bill, the Restrictive Trade Practices (Grocery Order), Confirmation Bill and the Control of Manufactures Bill, if it is ready.  There is some drafting difficulty there and the draftsman cannot undertake to have it in time.  In addition, there will be Supplementary Estimates for transport services, which it will be necessary to deal with this session, and a motion for scheduling to the State Guarantees Act of the Dundalk engineering works.  There may be some other urgent and important business not at present foreseen.</P>
      <P>It is suggested that the Dáil on completion of to-day's business should not meet next week but should adjourn until November 20th.  On that date it is anticipated that the business will be the Second Reading of the Agricultural Institute Bill, the Committee Stage of the Gaeltacht Industries Bill and this motion about the State-guaranteed grant.  Possibly there may be some other business but that will be the main business.</P>

As the Tánaiste has mentioned the question of the tempo of the Dáil, may I point out to him that the reason the business has been dealt with expeditiously, without much discussion to date, is that all business done since this session opened was business introduced by the previous Government in the previous Dáil, and which this Government has rubber stamped and brought in again?</P>

      <P>I want to say a word about representations I received from the Master Bakers' Association, who suggested that the provision in this Bill which empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce from time <Col N="548" /> to time to fix a maximum wholesale and retail price for bread is unnecessary and who represented that it implies in some way a reflection upon the bakery trade and those engaged in it.  That provision was not intended to have, and indeed, in my view, it does not have that implication.  As I said in the course of my remarks on the Second Reading, I considered it to be necessary, when dismantling the existing prices control machinery, to preserve intact the right to control the prices charged for certain essential commodities, without having to wait for a recommendation from a committee of inquiry.  I made it quite clear to the Master Bakers' Association that I am not prepared to depart from that position which was indeed arrived at only after very full and careful consideration of all the factors involved.</P>
      <P>I do not propose, therefore, to make any alteration in the provisions of Section 17.  I want to make quite clear that the decision to insert that section was based on an assessment of what was required in relation to prices and not on any temporary situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (10) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(10) This section shall apply in the case of an illegitimate child whether such child is being nursed and maintained for reward or not.</P>
      <P>The section represents a desirable advance in so far as it provides that those who take children for nursing and maintenance for reward or promise of reward must now, up to the age of 16, give the necessary notification, from which notification inspection, and so on, may follow.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment, however, is to direct the attention of the House to the fact that the procedure envisaged in this section applies only where the nursing is for reward or promise of reward.  I have had experience of quite a number of cases where children, particularly illegitimate children, are taken in circumstances in which it is not possible to establish an undertaking to provide payment or where, to all intents and purposes, the maintenance is entirely free.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is probably aware, there are many children who are placed with a view to adoption but who, in fact, are never legally adopted and in respect of whom no charge or reward has been demanded or accepted. Once illegitimate children can be placed with foster parents in those circumstances, without any question of reward, it does seem that there is room for abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that, in the case of illegitimate children, notification should be given, whether or not the nursing or maintenance is for reward.  This matter has been the subject of inquiry in this <Col N="550" /> country and also in other countries by those interested in the welfare of children.  I should like to quote an extract from a U.N.O. study of the subject.  It appears in a work dealing with children deprived of normal life. The extract is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Other free foster homes are those where no payment is made, but legal adoption is not possible or desirable. Without the proper kind of supervision this kind of foster home care may be very dangerous for the child, as he may not always be wanted for his own sake but because his labour is considered important.  In many cases foster homes without remuneration, or free foster homes where the child is placed directly by his parent for instance, with relatives, are not included in the legislative provisions nor in the statistics concerning children cared for outside their own homes.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would appear wise, however, in countries where licensing of all foster homes is not required, to apply to free foster homes the regulation of compulsory notification to the local authority if a child has been received for care, so that the proper supervision can be applied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an opinion expressed in a study of this problem carried out under the auspices of U.N.O. and it does emphasise the kind of gap which would be left in this desirable legislation, were an amendment of the kind I have suggested not included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise for the Minister that free fosterage, if excluded from this Bill, may leave considerable openings for abuse and there may be cases of unfortunate illegitimate children being taken into homes, with a view to adoption and no adoptions taking place, and the circumstances of the children may be very bad indeed.  In those circumstances, I can see no objection to providing that a person who undertakes nursing and maintenance of children should notify the local authority of the fact, so that at least the whereabouts of the child will be known and proper inspections can be carried out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> May I remind the Minister that, in the case of free fosterage, it may often happen that the presence of the child in the foster home may not be discovered until the child begins to go to school and until the school medical service is availed of?  Often, it is only then that the presence of the child in the foster home is discovered.  I believe that in most cases nothing undesirable may have taken place, but in a few cases a lot of medical difficulties may arise which, by the time the child appears in school for the first time, may have become permanent. Some of these difficulties might have been avoided if notification were compulsory and if an inspection had been carried out on behalf of the health authority.  I would urge the Minister to consider this amendment with his officials and advisers, and, if he feels it possible to accept the amendment in principle, to deal with the matter on a later stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that, coming into the House at this stage, I am not disposed to accept the amendment.  I think he will agree that the section as it stands is a considerable advance on the situation that existed heretofore.  The Deputy, no doubt, is aware that up to the passing of the 1934 Act, the provisions of this section as it then stood applied to children up to the age of seven years.  As a result of the 1934 Act, the provisions were extended to the age of nine years and the present Bill is intended to extend the provision in regard to notification by prospective adopters and foster-parents and by those making arrangements for the placing of children up to the age of 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands, without the Deputy's amendment, it is a considerable advance and does in fact provide a desirable amendment of the law in relation to illegitimate children, as it stands up to date.  My information is that the Minister for Health has not had any reports of abuses in the fosterage of illegitimate children who are taken into homes of persons other <Col N="552" /> than relatives.  The introduction of the principles suggested by the Deputy would have a very wide application, and unless there were very strong reasons for them, I would be inclined to resist the amendment.</P>
    <P>I might point out at this stage that sub-section (9) of this section refers specifically to illegitimate children.  It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a child who is illegitimate is kept and maintained in such circumstances that the notices mentioned in this section would be required to be given if such keeping and maintenance were done for reward, the child shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed, until the contrary is proved, to be so kept and maintained for reward.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The child is then deemed to be kept and maintained for reward as an illegitimate child.  Under these circumstances, the health authority, on a report, may investigate the circumstances and, even without report, may make an investigation, if any abuses have come to their knowledge.  They may investigate the circumstances and conditions under which the child lives, and if it is proved to their satisfaction that reward for maintenance is being received, the health authority will then have power of inspection. During the period while the necessary proof is forthcoming, the health authority will be in a position to examine the conditions of the home and, to that extent, the provision sought by the Deputy is already in the section.</P>
    <P>Since the Deputy mentioned proposed adopters, I feel sure he will appreciate that in many, if not all, cases where children are to be adopted, the parents or heads of homes generally get the child into the house for a period at first.  Adoptions cannot legally take place until the child is six months old and, in cases of illegitimate children, oftentimes the child is placed in the home before it is six months old.  In the meantime, there is a certain amount of supervision and the conditions of the home are examined, if that is necessary.  People who usually adopt children are people who, in the normal sense, would not require <Col N="553" /> supervision, and in any case adoptions are generally placed by adoption societies recognised under the Adoption Act.</P>
    <P>To that extent, I think there is no necessity to cover such cases by introducing this amendment.  In the second place, in that regard, the adoption of children is often a matter of some delicacy, certainly of some tact and discretion.  Adoption societies, recognised under the Adoption Act, are responsible people and they have to treat cases with all due tact and discretion and, from the point of view of proposed adopters, I think it would be undesirable that they should automatically be subject to inspections by the health authority.  I believe they are performing a very useful function and I feel that any undue interference with their privacy&mdash;many of them think there is some interference from the point of view that adoption societies inspect them&mdash;might be detrimental to the legal adoption of children.</P>
    <P>I may also say that abuses might possibly arise in the case of children when they come near the age at which they can earn.  These abuses would probably arise at, say, the age of 12 but in such cases it is hardly likely that a child who, perhaps, has been reared by its mother&mdash;that child being an illegitimate&mdash;up to that age would be transferred when it would have a certain earning potential.  I am informed that the cases, if they do arise, arise only on rare occasions.  Therefore, from that point of view, I am not yet convinced that there is a case for the amendment.  Finally, in this regard, I should like to say that religious bodies of all denominations were given particulars of the provisions of this section and in no case has there been an objection or argument advanced from them on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Having heard me, the Deputy might agree that the section is wide enough as it stands and that it gives adequate protection for children under 16; and in the case of illegitimate children, having regard to sub-section (9) and to the desirability of not interfering with, or prejudicing proposed legal <Col N="554" /> adoptions, I suggest it might prove to be a provision which would not inure to the fulfilment of the purpose of the Adoption Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the Minister and I agree that the section does represent a considerable advance.  The machinery envisaged in the section was put into the Bill by me when I was Minister for Health.  In so far as it is defective, I concede that the section as it was drafted did not cover the case of free fosterage, but I would have hoped, if I were in charge of the Bill now and listened to the arguments put forward on behalf of free fosterage, that they would have prevailed with me but that is a matter entirely for the Minister.  Might I just remind the Minister that obviously when the section was being prepared attention was drawn to the possible position of illegitimate children in free fosterage homes?  I think that is what was in mind when sub-section (9) was inserted in the section.</P>
      <P>Under sub-section (9) if a report is made to a local authority that a family in the area have the custody of a child, the local authority can inspect, until they are stopped by evidence that the custody and maintenance are not for reward.  Since that problem was in mind when the section was being drafted, I do not need to remind the Minister that, apart from cases of such notification being brought to the local authority, there may be any number of such free fosterage cases which are not known of at all and which come to the light of day only through the school medical service.  It may be that, in circumstances where an illegitimate child is placed in a home with a view to adoption, nothing very seriously wrong may take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that in those circumstances the intending adopters are generally anxious to make the child their own and to bestow on it all the affection and care&mdash;perhaps greater affection and care&mdash;than they would bestow on a natural child of their own.  But there are cases, even apart from that, in free fosterage where unsuitable conditions may exist and that is the type of case that I had in mind.  In <Col N="555" /> fact, where the fosterage is initiated with a view to adoption, I am satisfied that there is already, under the adoption code, sufficient machinery for examination and so on, but it is a matter for the Minister.  The Minister seems to feel that this, as a first step, is long enough and that it might be unwise to go further but I might suggest to him that if the amendment is withdrawn he might consider the matter between this and the Report Stage.  If he feels on examination in both Departments concerned that there are matters which require some rectification he might consider the matter on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall do that but I should like to make one other point. As the Deputy knows, illegitimate children are often taken over from the mother and kept within the family circle with the grandmother, grandfather or uncles, or even with less close relatives.  The mother might leave the locality in which the child lives and the child might not know very much about the circumstances of its birth.  It might be desirable, and very often it is, that these circumstances would not be generally known, even though the child itself might know them.  The coming of the health authority inspectors to that house might naturally enough give some publicity, in the neighbourhood, to the circumstances of the child's birth, which the Deputy will appreciate should be avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), page 4, line 2, to delete &ldquo;under the age of 16 years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether or not this amendment is necessary; I shall be guided by the Minister.  This section is one in which I took a considerable interest because I was aware, unfortunately, of cases, far too numerous, where children were sent out from fosterage into employment, and the circumstances of their employment <Col N="556" /> were often a public scandal.  Prior to this Bill there was no means whereby any employer of such a child was under any obligation to notify the fact of employment, nor was there any opportunity for the local authority to carry out an inspection as to the circumstances in which such a child was employed. Therefore, again, the section itself is a considerable advance.  It provides some form of very necessary supervision in the case of the employment of such children.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my notice, however, that the section, as it stands, does not appear to cover the case of a child sent out to employment from, say, an institution upon reaching the age of 16.  If the Minister says that is covered, I am answered, but I feel it still remains desirable, where an institution is seeking employment for a child who is reaching 16 years of age and places him on a farm or somewhere else, that there should be an obligation on the institution itself if it is within the jurisdiction and, if not, on the intending employer to notify the local authority of the fact of such employment.</P>
    <P>I will not mention the part of the country I have in mind, but there are parts of the country where young boys leave an institution or are sent out for employment and often the circumstances under which they are employed leave a great deal to be desired.  I feel that if the necessity for notification ends at 16, then, during three or four very formative and impressionable years, young boys may be employed in very uncongenial employment and in circumstances which may have quite a prejudicial effect on their mental and physical health in after life.  I would, therefore, urge the Minister to ensure that notification extends beyond the age of 16 and, if that is not covered by the section, to acept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first saw this amendment, for many reasons, I was unenthusiastic about it, but, having being told that the Deputy, when he was Minister, had some experience of his own, I felt that it was justified to cover such circumstances arising.  In the first place, the section, as it stands, catches every child, no matter where he lives, once he lives beyond parental <Col N="557" /> control in regard to the necessity for having his place of employment notified to the health authority when the child leaves the house in which he normally resides.</P>
      <P>I feel that the limit prescribed in the Bill at present, up to the age of 16 years, will effectively cover the Deputy's intentions, when he was Minister, to make sure that the conditions under which these children are employed are conditions up to decent standards, but I cannot say the point of view expressed by the Deputy, that children, who, having left certain places of detention, can be supervised beyond 16 is already covered.  I do not think that is the case.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the age of 16 years conforms to other provisions in the Act.  In the Health Act, for instance, as the Deputy is aware, the age of 16 is the age up to which a young person is a child for the purposes of the Health Acts and up to which the health authority normally maintain boarded-out children.</P>

      <P>is that the child reaches 16 years in an institution and the authorities then make arrangements for its employment.</P>

      <P>The simple fact is that it is not certain that local authorities are bound to make their contribution, once the child has left the place of detention to which it has been sent. For instance, in some schools, they give tuition up to primary age.  They might be able to provide, out of their own resouces, secondary tuition for that child in another place&mdash;perhaps, even in another place under the care of the same people.  Even in that case, it is doubtful if the local authority is bound still to contribute to the support of the detainee.  It is to make sure that such cases are covered that the provision is in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I can understand the position in regard to the certified school, but let us apply the same consideration to foster parents.  I am informed that if the child becomes ill and has to go to hospital, there is a deduction in respect of the payment the foster parents receive.  I am told that during such periods as the child is out of the foster parent's care, in hospital or wherever else it may be, there is a deduction in the payment.

      <P>The people in charge of these certified schools are considered to be experts and it is only fair, therefore, that they should be given due discretion to permit the child to follow whatever vocation he may feel inclined to follow.  Secondly, where guidance is necessary, these are the proper people to give such guidance and direction to the child along vocational lines.  There is, too, an inspection system manned by trained and experienced personnel, and the inspectors frequently consult with the school management as to the general lines followed and also in relation to particular cases.  The system we have gives the necessary discretion to the school management and, secondly, there is the necessary consultation between the school management and the inspectorate.  Finally, if the child expresses any desire, I believe that desire is met in so far as it can be.</P>

      <P>I will give the Minister a specific instance.  A certain individual offered to pay for the training of a child in a vocational school and the person in charge of the particular certified school refused permission for the child to attend on the ground that it would be showing favouritism and would have a bad effect on the morale of the other children.  Another point I should like the Minister to clarify is in relation to the position of the parent or parents. Are they consulted at any stage as to the welfare or education of the child? Is the parent consulted if the person in charge decides that the child will make a good shoemaker, while, in fact, the parent knows that the child's particular aptitude lies in the direction of farming, or some other vocation?  Is there any consultation on that particular aspect?</P>

Generally speaking, it is undesirable that the management of these schools should be interfered with.  These people are experienced and are capable of assessing the lines along which a child ought to be trained.  The Deputy will appreciate, too, that there is the important question of discipline. I do not know whether in the instance he has quoted the question of discipline may not have been taken a little too far, but I am sure he will have due regard to the fact that school managements have to guard their powers in that respect very jealously.</P>

I would be extremely disturbed if I thought the parents were not consulted.  The primary duty still remains on the parents and their views should be considered very carefully and very sympathetically. I am sure they are.</P>

      <P>Section 2, under &ldquo;Definitions&rdquo; describes &ldquo;building lessee&rdquo; as &ldquo;the lessee under a building lease&rdquo;. I suggest that this definition should be amended as it does not include anyone except the original lessee.  It should correspond to that of &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; in the Act of 1931 and should read: &ldquo;the person for the time being entitled to the interest of the lessee under a building lease&rdquo;.  On line 31, it is sought to define &ldquo;proprietary lessee&rdquo;.  In the Bill as drafted, &ldquo;proprietary lessee&rdquo; means &ldquo;the lessee under a proprietary lease&rdquo;.  I suggest that should be changed to mean the person for the time being entitled to the interest of the lessee under a proprietary lease.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister will want any further explanation, but it is obviously too tightly drawn and could be construed to mean a particular lessee, the original lessee, if you like, as distinct from persons who are now in possession.  I wonder if the Minister will give that consideration and, possibly on the Report Stage, agree to have the necessary amendment made.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the parliamentary draftsman is satisfied that no amendment is necessary because Section 2 of the 1931 Act says: &ldquo;The word &lsquo;lessee&rsquo; shall, where the context so admits, be construed as including the executors, administrators and assigns of the lessee,&rdquo; and Section 1 (2) of this Bill provides that the Act of 1931 shall be construed together with this Bill.</P>

      <P>With all respect to the Minister and to the House, I should like to say that one of the problems that arises with people who are in dispute and who have to go to litigation is the fact that, no matter what the draftsman might construe as being the meaning, the courts do not always hold, and therefore when we make the necessary amendments under the landlord and tenant legislation, we should at least make sure that the definitions are quite clear and that there can be no ambiguity about them.</P>
      <P>We have often had discussions in the House as to the meaning of legislation, and then immediately after the legislation is passed and becomes an Act of the land, there is litigation and the judge trying the case will say: &ldquo;I am concerned only with what the Act specifically states.&rdquo;  What I suggest will not make any change in the policy or in the intentions of the Minister, and I urge him to accept the suggestions which I make and which I consider are necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement which Deputy Briscoe has just made makes it clear, to my mind, that it is an impossibility to get what might be described as perfect legislation.  I have had the same experience as Deputy Briscoe with Bills that have been brought into the House.  They have been discussed at length, examined by experts and then examined by people here with technical and practical knowledge such as Deputy Briscoe would have in a matter of this kind, and then it has been found that, when the Bill becomes an Act, there are all these loopholes which he mentioned.</P>
      <P>While we cannot get the perfect Act, we try to get as near perfection as possible.  However, I will have the matter examined, but I must, of course, take into serious consideration the advice my experts give me.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased the Minister has indicated that he proposes to have my suggestions examined, but in view of what he has said just now, may I point out to him again in a simple form that any layman understands the definition of &ldquo;building lessee&rdquo; which the Bill here <Col N="564" /> specifically states means the lessee under a building lease.  That can bear an interpretation only that whoever was the original lessee of a building lease is the person so meant by this Bill.  There is nothing very radical or extraordinary in suggesting that the building lessee should be &ldquo;the person for the time being entitled to the interest of the lessee under a building lease.&rdquo;  It means then that if he were the original lessee and sold any interest, there can be no doubt that the person to whom he assigned is entitled to everything he is entitled to and that there can be no limitations.  The original landlord could say: &ldquo;I had certain rights.  I was not asked about them.  I did not intend to do this.&rdquo; One could have unnecessary litigation.</P>
      <P>In the same way, in regard to the second suggestion I have made, I shall be quite happy if the Minister will put these amendments to the draftsman and his advisers and have them reconsidered for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to sub-section (3) (a) of Section 4.  In order to make that specifically clear, there should be added at the end of the first line of the section, the words &ldquo;commencing on or after the 1st January, 1914&rdquo;, so that the section would begin &ldquo;Where a lease is for a term of not less than 50 years commencing on or after the 1st January, 1914, and the rent reserved...&rdquo; I think that is the intention of this sub-section.  I would ask the Minister to have that considered for the Report Stage so as to make that provision clear.  I might add it is considered that the supposition that the fact that the land leased at less than the poor law valuation indicates that the lease is a building lease may be valid in the case of leases entered into after 1914, but would not be valid in the case of leases entered into before 1914.  It is again a technical matter and the Minister may like to consider that for inclusion in the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a note which <Col N="566" /> says that the acceptance of such an amendment would defeat the object of the provisions of sub-section (3) as far as leases entered into before 1914 are concerned.  It is precisely because records of pre-1914 leases are often so scanty and evidence as to who built the property is so hard to establish by the present lessee that sub-section (3) was introduced.  However, the Commission of Valuation has been asked for his advice on the matter, and further consideration will be given to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (b) of sub-section (3) provides that the certificate of the Commissioner of Valuation shall be conclusive evidence.  Certainly the certificate should be <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  It is possible there might be an error in the certificate, and I suggest that the section should provide only that the certificate of the Commissioner of Valuation shall be <i>prima facie</i>, so that there will be an opportunity for a litigant to show a mistake, if in fact there was a genuine <i>bona fide</i> mistake in the certificate.</P>

      <P>Under sub-section (5), it is intended, I understand, to carry out the recommendations in clause 68 of the Conroy Report.  This sub-section does not clearly do so.  What was aimed at was the reinstatement by a sub-lessee. I would suggest the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; should be substituted for the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; before &ldquo;lessee&rdquo;.  Preferably it should read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where permanent buildings on land comprised in any lease or sub-lease have been reinstated by the person for the time being entitled to the interest of the lessee under such lease or sub-lease in pursuance of a covenant contained in such lease or sub-lease in the event of their destruction by fire or otherwise such buildings shall be deemed to have been erected by the person who erected the original buildings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> I think that would probably meet the case.  I do not know whether the Minister has had any suggestions made to him on this sub-section so as to be able to give his opinion now.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a different point on sub-section (5).  I am not too happy that the word &ldquo;reinstate&rdquo; is adequate.  In relation to this section, it seems to me there is a possibility of a very strict interpretation by a court.  Take the case of buildings which have been destroyed by fire and a new building has been erected which is substantially the same as the old building.  It may be slightly different; it may be an improvement. I am a little bit worried that a slightly different building, even though an improvement, might not be considered as being a reinstatement.  If there is anything in my anxiety in that respect, I would suggest it would be met by the insertion of the word &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; before &ldquo;reinstated&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;where permanent buildings have been substantially reinstated.&rdquo;  I do not think anybody would desire that the sub-section should be construed too rigidly, and without some covering adjective of that nature, there might be that danger.</P>

      <P>With regard to sub-paragraph (ii) at the top of page 5, as I understand it, the effect is to apportion the rent between the land that has new buildings on it and the land that has not, by reference to area alone.  That need not necessarily be a fair apportionment.  We all know, for example, that in relation to any building site the portion that is near the road, near the water and sewerage services, is of greater value than the <Col N="569" /> portion that is at the back that requires development before building can take place on it.  Equally, it often happens in relation to a building site, particularly in an urban area, that the site consists of old buildings and virgin land.  In such circumstances the old buildings have some value.  I would suggest that the general position should be that the natural possibilities of the site should be taken into account that it should not be merely a strict area division, excluding old buildings, as I think this draft excludes them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to qualify as a proprietary lessee a lessee must have paid a capital sum, or fine as it is usually called, to the lessor or have spent a substantial sum of money on the premises or have both paid a fine and spent money on the premises.  The object of having this condition is to ensure that the person to be entitled to the reversionary lease has acquired the beneficial interest either by buying the premises or by spending a substantial sum on it.  It has been suggested that sums of money spent on decoration of the premises should not reckon as expenditure on them for the purpose of giving the sub-lessee rights to a reversionary lease to the exclusion of his lessor and this amendment gives effect to that suggestion.  The sub-paragraph would then read: &ldquo;partly in consideration <Col N="570" /> of the expenditure (otherwise than on decoration) of a sum of money&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <P>I had intended to suggest an amendment almost the same as that and for the same reasons as those adduced by the Minister but, rather than the expression &ldquo;otherwise than&rdquo;, I thought it would be better that the sub-section should read &ldquo;partly in consideration of the expenditure (other than expenditure on decoration)&rdquo; and so on.  That makes it specific that for the purpose of negotiation and calculation and for the establishment of rights one way or the other the occupant of a building now claiming new reversionary rights and so forth cannot make a claim arising from any expenditure whatever on decoration. The Minister might consider my words as compared with his own.  They mean the same thing but I believe it is better from a layman's point of view to use the words I suggest.</P>

      <P>I am not quite clear as to what is intended by the words &ldquo;exceptional rent&rdquo; in sub-section (3), paragraph (b).  The case I have in mind is the type of case where there is a graded rent for different periods of the term.  If it is a graded rent for different periods of the term and if part of that graded rent is in operation for the last five years, then the rent so graded and so in operation should be considered.  I agree entirely that a penal rent for breach of covenant should not be taken into account, but that is the first part of the paragraph. The second part of the paragraph says &ldquo;an exceptional rent.&rdquo;  I do not want <Col N="571" /> to make a pun but I am not satisfied that that is happy phraseology.  I think a graded rent could be an exceptional rent.</P>
      <P>For example, there could be the case that there is a lease where, if the premises are used as a private dwellinghouse, one rent is charged and, if the lessee changes that user into shop premises, another rent is charged.  If the lessee does that some ten years, shall we say, before the end of the term and the shop rent is accordingly payable during the last five years, that is an exceptional rent but it is not a rent which should be excluded in the same way as a penal rent for breach of covenant is excluded.  I think that the sub-section as drafted excludes cases that should not be excluded while properly excluding penal rent cases.</P>

      <P>It was recommended in paragraph 177 of the Report that the new legislation should not prejudice the rights of any person who, between the passing of the 1931 Act and the passing of this Act, made a sub-lease which was expressly framed so as to reserve his right to a reversionary lease under present law.  The section as now drafted differs somewhat from the recommendation in paragraph 177 in that it now only says sub-leases granted during this period for a term of less than 99 years and expiring more than five years before the building lease.  This modification of the recommendation is considered to be consistent with the views expressed earlier in the report that a building lessee who gives a sub-lease for a term <Col N="572" /> greater than 99 years should be deemed to have parted entirely with the beneficial interest in the premises, quite irrespective of the length of the reversion which he reserved to himself.</P>

      <P>In paragraph (b), page 6, line 17, before &ldquo;if&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a proprietary lease&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to make it clear that persons holding under renewals of proprietary type leases which expired before the 1931 Act was passed will have the right to get a further reversionary lease when the present lease expires.</P>
      <P>As it stands, the section gives this right to persons holding under renewals of building-type leases which expired before 1931, but there are some cases where the renewal of the lease was made to a sublessee who, if the transaction were to take place now, would be regarded as a proprietary lessee.  Acceptance of the amendment will make the section in full accord with the recommendation in paragraph 101 of the Conroy Report.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(2) The notice referred to in paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of this section shall be a valid notice only if served not earlier than 15 years before the expiration of the building lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the objects of Section 10 is to ensure that a lessee will not be deprived of his right to a reversionary lease where he omits to apply before the expiration of the existing lease.  It seeks to secure this by providing that the lessee will be entitled to apply for the reversionary lease even after the building lease has expired so long as he applies within three months of receiving a notice from the lessor of the expiration of the lease.  However, the object could be circumvented by the landlord serving notice well in advance of the expiry of the lease&mdash; perhaps at the very commencement of <Col N="574" /> the lease.  The amendment closes this possible loophole by rendering invalid any notice which is served more than 15 years before the expiration of the building lease.</P>

      <P>In regard to sub-paragraph (b) is there not a danger in respect of the wording of that paragraph that where somebody allows a person to stay on to get alternative accommodation and at the same time it was desirable that the right to a reversionary lease should be negatived because of the other methods in the Bill such as the development of a building estate and so on, that that right would be lost?  I am afraid I have put the case in a rather cumbersome way.  What I really mean is this: where this section comes into operation, is it clear that the savers that there are against a reversionary lease <Col N="575" />&mdash;and which savers would ultimately be decided by the courts if necessary &mdash;still operate notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13?</P>

      <P>This provision is designed to give effect to the recommendation in paragraph 175 of the report which itself followed the lines of Section 47, sub-section (4) of the 1931 Act.  The object of Section 47 (4) was to give certain limited rights to claim a reversionary lease to a lessee whose lease would expire within five years before new legislation came into force but who were still in occupation of premises.  It is proposed in this section that any person whose lease expired within five years before new legislation comes into force who is in possession of property demised by lease and who has not previously had the right to a reversionary lease should be given a period of 12 months instead of six months&mdash;the period mentioned in Section 47&mdash;in which to claim a reversionary lease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am thoroughly in agreement with Deputy Sweetman there.  There have been <Col N="577" /> cases where objections to reversionary leases, successfully contested, have been in fact securing back the premises from an occupant by what one might claim as false pretences.  I do not agree so much with the figure of the fine, since that is relevant always to the premises concerned.  If, however, the person does not complete the undertaking in a reasonable time or a fixed time, the original occupant should be allowed to claim back his tenancy and occupation of the premises.  I have known cases where, if you have enough money to contest something successfully and get possession of something on the grounds that you are going to do something, you dispossess the other person and then you do not go on with the undertaking, saying that the times have changed, and then you dispose of the premises at a very considerable profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to consider whether he would be prepared to amend this section by adding a new sub-section after sub-section (1), as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) In this section the words &lsquo;applicant&rsquo;, &lsquo;objector&rsquo; and &lsquo;proprietary lessee&rsquo; respectively shall mean and include the person or persons who, when such compensation shall become due and payable, is or are entitled to the interest in the land the subject of the application for a reversionary lease which when such application was refused was vested in the original applicant, <Col N="578" /> objector or proprietary lessee as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the subsequent sub-sections would need to be renumbered.  I should like to say that the section does not take into consideration the fact that the application may be made and refused 14 years before the expiration of a lease.  We have a number of cases which are well known, where for the purpose of reconstructing premises, remodelling them or rebuilding them, you have to anticipate the expiry date and you ask for a reversionary lease before the expiration of the actual lease.  Therefore, it is counterside of that.</P>
    <P>The section does not take into consideration the fact that the application may be made 14 years before the expiry of the lease and during that time the interests of both parties may have devolved upon other persons either by assignment under a settlement, will or intestacy, or by operation of law.  I am not prepared to say how the section should be redrafted, but if the intention is that the compensation should be paid to and by the parties entitled to the interests of the applicant and objector when the lease expires and the reversionary lease, if granted, would have begun, the section fails completely to carry out that intention and should be redrafted entirely, or else a &ldquo;sub-definition&rdquo; clause should be inserted for that particular section.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would consider that, he will find that this application for a reversionary lease years ahead of expiry of the original lease is quite a common thing and in many cases would be refused before the end of the lease and would result in the occurrence of the things I have suggested. I should like the Minister to indicate that he is willing to have this suggestion examined with a view to seeing if there is any merit in it and, if there is, to having it introduced on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new section. I do not think it was in the 1931 Act; if it was I have failed to find it. I should like to make just one point in relation to sub-section (3) (a).  There should be a saving clause in that sub-section that the tenant for life or other person in a fiduciary position could only have recourse to the capital funds of the settlement to recover the compensation he has paid if he has not been guilty of any default.  If a tenant for life, or if a trustee has personally been guilty of default in dealing with the matter it should not be right that he should have recourse to the capital funds of the settlement.  There should be that saver in it.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly proper where everything correct has been done by a trustee, or tenant for life, that he should be reimbursed but if he has deliberately decided to flout an order of the court, and thereby caused additional costs to be incurred, or where he has not furnished the information which is required to be furnished by notice under this Act, even though he had that information in his possession all along, and that has caused additional costs to be incurred, I do not think a person in the light of a default like that should have recourse to the fund.  All I am anxious to ensure is that a tenant for life or trustee acting <i>bona fide</i> in the matter would be reimbursed, and if he does not act <i>bona fide</i> he should not be reimbursed.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Its object is to avoid any possible conflict with sub-section (6) of Section 12, which alters the present law by providing that a reversionary lease which has been applied for after the expiration of the old lease should normally commence on the date of the application for the reversionary lease and not from the expiration of the old lease.

    <P>The object of this amendment is to secure that when fixing the gross rent of property which is controlled by the Rent Acts the court will have regard to the restricted rent permitted by these Acts only where there is a tenant actually in occupation of the property.

The only power the court has, as the Bill stands, in the direction of compelling an applicant to put his premises in repair before granting a 99-year reversionary lease is that of requiring him to spend &ldquo;a specified sum of money on repairs&rdquo;.  It is possible that the lessee would refuse to do the repairs which the court had in mind when making the order but spend the specified sum on other repair work, while neglecting the repairs necessary to prolong the life of the building.  The amendment empowers the court to specify the particular jobs to be carried out.  Amendment Nos. 10 to 12 are purely consequential.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is raising a matter which I have also in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we are in agreement and that I get the Deputy's support. That paragraph reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If any new covenant or condition restricting the lessee's rights is included <Col N="583" /> in the reversionary lease, the court shall have power to fix a lower rent where it thinks proper to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider amending that sub-section to read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If any new covenant or condition restricting the lessee's rights is included in the reversionary lease, other than a covenant restricting the use to the then existing user of the premises and/or a covenant restricting erection of additional buildings, the court shall have power to fix a lower rent where it thinks proper to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is self-evident.  I do not know if the Minister has had this point put to him and argued to him, but I recommend the Minister to consider it seriously.  Many old leases contain virtually no restrictions.  It is considered that, in a modern lease, the lessor should be able to control a change of user and that, in fact, unless he is able to exercise such control it is impossible to fix a rent on the premises.  It is also considered that the lessor should be entitled to control the development of the land by the erection of new buildings and should be in a position to obtain the full ground rents from such new development if it is allowed.</P>
    <P>In our local authority we had this case recently.  We had given a lease to a public institution for a specific purpose. That meant that the land remained agricultural land for the period of an unexpired portion of a 99-year lease, of which roughly 30 years had gone.  It now turns out that the tenant has applied to the Dublin Corporation for permission to sell six of those acres to another public authority at a very substantial sum of money.  They applied to us also for a reduction in their rent because they will now be paying on a piece of ground less the six acres.</P>
    <P>We have considered the matter.  We hope that, under this Bill, we will have a right to insist that we will be given a portion of the purchase price because it was a lease with a restriction. <Col N="584" /> If we agree, we will share in the purchase price and we will also be enabled to recover from the purchaser a capital sum equivalent to our loss of rent on the six acres which are now being surrendered.</P>
    <P>It the Bill goes through in its present form, any lessor in a transaction such as that, if there is not protection, might be prevented from getting reasonable rights.  I suggest, therefore, that the Minister re-examine the Bill. If he wants further particulars of the case to which I have referred, I shall be available.  I do not think the case will come to any litigation because the three parties to the problem are all sensible and I think agreement will be reached.</P>

      <P>The amendment which the Deputy has suggested is pretty complex.  I would point out that there are eight amendments in respect of this section.  It did not occur to us to make an amendment of that particular type.  Again, however, as in the other cases, we shall have it examined.  It is somewhat complex.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If I correctly understood the suggested amendment by Deputy Briscoe, I am 100 per cent. against it.  It seems to me that it overrides all the rights in relation to private property.  I understood the Deputy to suggest that portion of the value that a lessee has attained under this Bill or under the 1931 Act should be expropriated to the Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>That is what I understood the Deputy to mean.  If the Deputy is merely suggesting that the apportioned rent on the part being sold should be redeemed, he is entitled to make that suggestion.  However, to make the suggestion, in addition, that the lessee should pay away part of the value of his property held subject to a reversionary lease seems to me contrary to the entire spirit of this Bill and to the entire spirit of the 1931 Act. Perhaps I misunderstood the Deputy.</P>

      <P>When we have an opportunity of reading what Deputy Briscoe has said, and the amendment which he has suggested, then he and I and the Minister will, each of us, have an opportunity of knowing what the real meaning of his suggested amendment is.</P>
      <P>I want to make another suggestion in relation to paragraph (c) of sub-section (3).  This sub-section visualises solely that the rights of the lessee should be restricted by the new reversionary lease.  I had a case recently where the opposite obtained. A building lease was coming to an end.  The lessor and the lessee both desired that, in the new reversionary lease that was to be granted, permission would be given to the lessee to extend the rights he held under the old lease.  The old lease was silent on who was entitled to erect neon signs on the building.  In fact, in certain respects, it was agreed between the lessee and the lessor that the right to erect neon signs and get additional rentals from them was jointly vested in the old lease in the lessor and the lessee.  Both the lessor and the lessee agreed that it was desirable that that right should be vested solely in the lessee in the future.  That is an enlargement of the lessee's rights.</P>
      <P>Happily, the parties were able to agree on a rent but, if they had not been able to agree on a rent because it was an enlargement, not a restriction, there would be no power under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, to enable such a case to be decided.  It would merely mean that the parties would have to go on in the same inchoate state in which they were before, with doubts on either side.  I think the case could be met quite easily by ensuring that if the covenant was to be varied either by way of enlargement or restriction the court would then have the right to vary the rent according as it thought fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Sweetman is 100 per cent. against the suggestion I made, he has argued 100 per cent. in <Col N="586" /> favour of it, except that he takes a different illustration.  In this particular case, it was not a question of the corporation's acquiring something.  The corporation was the lessor of a restricted lease.  Because of new development&mdash;or, if you like, these new signs; new improvement&mdash;they sought the very same thing which Deputy Sweetman now seeks to preserve for the private lessor.  It is exactly what I said.</P>
      <P>In the first place, I said that many old leases contain virtually no restrictions and that it is considered that, in a modern lease, the lessor should be able to control a change of user and that, in fact, unless he is able to exercise such control, it is impossible to fix a rent on the premises.  I said it is also considered that the lessor should be entitled to control the development of the land by the erection of new buildings and should be in a position to obtain the full ground rents from such new development if it is allowed.  That is another way of saying that portion of the benefit accruing to the lessee from the new development he is able to get by way of an income in respect of neon signs, for example, should fall to the lessor.  I shall leave it to the Minister first of all to consider what we have said and whether he is prepared to introduce a further amendment on Report Stage.  I feel sure that when, in the peace and quietness of his home and office, Deputy Sweetman considers what I have said he will withdraw his objection.</P>

      <P>Whilst I hesitate to suggest any amendment to this section, I should like to say that I think the section is a layman's section.  One knows what is meant to be dealt with, <Col N="587" /> but doubts the manner of doing it effectively.  A lease cannot be negotiated under an Act unless the Act provides the machinery of the negotiation. Some of the ambiguity could be removed by saying: &ldquo;A reversionary lease granted to a building lessee or a proprietary lessee in consequence of an application to the immediate lessor of such lessee for a reversionary lease to be made to him by such immediate lessor under Part V of the Act of 1931 or this Act whether such reversionary lease shall have been granted by the court or negotiated between the parties shall be deemed to be a building lease....&rdquo;  I would suggest that the section be framed in that manner.</P>

In other words I suggest that after the words, &ldquo;where a building lease,&rdquo; at the beginning of this section, we should add &ldquo;which expression shall in this section include a built-on lease which under Section 6 of this Act is deemed to be a building lease.&rdquo;  I think that is simple enough and understandable enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>(3) Where any expenditure was incurred before the commencement of this Act by a local authority within the meaning of the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts, 1914 to 1930, in providing free of charge, or meeting the whole or part of the provision free of charge of, meals for children attending a national school, that expenditure and any contribution thereto made out of the Exchequer shall be deemed to be and always to have been valid and proper.</P>
      <P>It has been found necessary to introduce an amendment, to be inserted as sub-section (3) of this section, to regularise expenditure in previous years on school meals and I will deal with that matter in due course.  As regards sub-sections (1) and (2), the position is that, under the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts, 1914 to 1930, urban district councils, county borough councils and town commissioners are empowered to arrange for the provision of meals for schoolchildren.  Section 1 of the 1914 Act empowered the local authorities to provide meals for children attending national schools in their areas, but, except as permitted by Sections 2 and 3, debarred them from incurring any expenses in the purchase of food for the meals.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Act required them to make a charge for every meal supplied and empowered them to recover the amount involved from parents, except in cases where they were satisfied that the parents could not pay.  Section 3 empowered them, subject to the sanction of the Minister, to defray the cost of the food out of the rates in cases where they were satisfied that any of the the children were unable by reason of lack of food to take full advantage of the education provided for them and that funds other than public funds were not available or were insufficient to defray the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the inception of the service, <Col N="592" /> the school meals schemes have been operated by the appropriate local authorities mainly on a non-contributory basis, under Section 3 of the 1914 Act.  Arrangements for a general contributory service on the lines envisaged by Sections 1 and 2 of the Act have never been made by the local authorities, but in five areas out of the total of 59, part of the cost of the meals is met either by collection of contributions or by the co-operation of a voluntary body.</P>
    <P>Under an amending Act of 1917, provision was made for recoupment from the Exchequer of one-half of the net expenditure on food.  This was £164,000, in the year ended 31st March, 1957, towards which the State will contribute £82,000.  Administration expenses borne by the local authorities were £9,800.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the Committee of Public Accounts have been considering the administration of the service and have expressed the view that public moneys were being used not for the contributory schemes envisaged by the Act but for non-contributory schemes, with a resultant inflation in the payments from the Exchequer.  They considered that, where the defect in legislation caused such a fundamental change in a scheme, new legislation should be introduced to remedy the defect, either without changing the scheme or to obtain parliamentary authority for changing it.  It is not intended to change the scheme, but merely to remedy the defect and to place beyond doubt the right of local authorities to continue to operate non-contributory school meal schemes. This is done in sub-section (1).</P>
    <P>Arising from consideration of the views of the Committee of Public Accounts, another defect has emerged. The Acts permit a local authority to defray the cost of food furnished in non-contributory school meals, but I am advised that they do not permit expenditure from the rates on the cost of preparing the food for a meal.  The preparation of the food is essential in the presentation of the food in the form of a meal, and it had always been assumed that the local authorities had <Col N="593" /> power to meet the cost and that this cost ranked for recoupment from the State.  It is proposed to set this matter right and this is provided for in sub-section (2).</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>An English columnist once deplored, on the elevation of a baron to the title of viscount, that a very ancient barony had been submerged in a pinchbeck viscountcy.  I should like to say that in a way I am sorry to see this provision coming in wrapped up in a Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The School Meals Acts have a long and somewhat historic background and I should like very briefly to dwell on that consideration because I think it should be on the records of this House.</P>
      <P>The most interesting point is that the very first Act, which did not apply to Ireland, but applied only to England and Wales, was the very first measure on the English Statute Book promoted by the British Labour Party in 1906 when it acquired strength at the time of the Liberal landslide.  The Bill was promoted then as a Private Members' Bill.  The names associated with it are, I think, interesting.  They included Keir Hardie, Philip Snowden, Ramsay McDonald, John R. Clynes and Arthur Henderson.  It was designed to meet a specific set of circumstances in England and Wales where there were industrial areas and where, because both parents had to go to work, the children could not be provided with food during school hours.  It was not purely a question of necessity and poverty.  This other angle obtruded itself also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, there were in England and Wales school committees which provided some sort of a meal service for children in industrial areas. The original Act was designed to enable local school authorities to join with these school committees in providing the meals.  From that, a great deal of our subsequent trouble arose, because, in 1914, some of the Irish Members of the House of Commons decided that this measure should be applied to Ireland.  One group sought <Col N="594" /> to do this by an amendment to a new Bill to extend the Education (Provision of Meals) Act in England.  That was ruled out of order, but at the same time a Private Members' Bill was initiated as well.</P>
    <P>That Private Members' Bill, which is a warning to private members of the dangers of drafting legislation, was lifted word for word from the 1906 Act which applied to England and Wales. Again, from that a great deal of trouble arose.  I do not know whether the Act of 1906 ever operated as it was intended to operate in England and Wales, but certainly I am very doubtful if its provisions were ever properly applied to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The House of Commons was rather debarred from paying a great deal of attention to the measure by reason of the fact that it came before the House in Committee on 5th August, 1914, when the House of Commons had a great deal more to trouble it than the Education (Provision of Meals) Act.  It shows the common sense that can manifest itself in a Parliament, even under very great stress.  It did succeed in making the Act apply to Ireland, which was more than the sponsors of the Bill had succeeded in doing.</P>
    <P>However, that was done.  The circumstances in Ireland were quite different from those envisaged by the original sponsors in 1906.  From that, I think, stemmed all the trouble the Department of Local Government and its successor, the Department of Social Welfare, have been in ever since.  The original Act of 1914 only provided that the local authorities should pay for the provision of food for school meals and limited them to a halfpenny in the pound.  An amending Act of 1916 raised that to 1d. and an Act of 1917 provided that there should be regulations made by the Local Government Board for Ireland, and they were made.  I am afraid that I do not know what was in the regulations because they were superseded by subsequent regulations made by the Department of Local Government and Public Health in 1927.</P>
    <P>In 1951-52, the Comptroller and Auditor-General became alarmed at the rise in the cost of the service and drew the attention of the Committee <Col N="595" /> on Public Accounts to it.  He was not completely satisfied that the regulations were, in fact, being carried out. If I say at this stage that the Audit Office never quite got round to the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts, I do not think they would quarrel with me.  What happened subsequently was due entirely to the Committee of Public Accounts. The Audit Office became satisfied that the regulations were defective because, subsequent to the inquiry into the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the Department of Social Welfare, which had now taken over this service from the Department of Local Government, were advised, I take it, by the Attorney-General, if my recollection is correct, that what was wrong was Article 8 of the regulations, which provided for a means test.</P>
    <P>I take it that at this stage the Audit Office was satisfied that an amendment of the regulations would be sufficient.  The Committee of Public Accounts were not satisfied.  They had examined the statutes and it appeared to them that the statutes were very vague.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me on that point at least.  This series of enactments by the British House of Commons, with additions now and again, had succeeded in creating a situation where it would be doubtful if any two lawyers would agree as to exactly what was meant by any of the provisions.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, the Committee of Public Accounts proceeded to inquire further into the question and pressed the matter.  If I say that the Committee of Public Accounts had to press the matter, I should not like anyone to think I was questioning the right of the Departments concerned&mdash;Social Welfare and Finance&mdash;to fight back. They were perfectly entitled to do so. I think it should be put on the records of the House that the Committee, as a body of laymen, successfully fought back against all the powers that be and succeeded in the end in having this amendment made law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> Many angles were examined by the Committee both in public and in private, so to speak.  Because a great many discussions took place in the office and never got on the records at all, I am afraid that a good deal of the precise history of this affair can never be found.  One thing, however, is abundantly clear: the Committee set up by this House for a specific purpose very successfully carried that out.  My real reason for speaking this evening is to emphasise that the Dáil was very well served in this case by its Committee.</P>
    <P>I want to do that because there have been from time to time in recent years suggestions made that the Committee was rather a waste of time and never did anything.  I do not suggest that this is a particularly important piece of work on their part&mdash;the Committee does a great many other things&mdash;but at least this has to be said for the Committee. I believe this to be the only piece of legislation which springs directly from the operations of the Committee of Public Accounts&mdash;certainly from the action of the Committee backed up by no one at all.</P>
    <P>I think I have succeeded in doing what I set out to do, but there is just one further point.  There is one thing which worried the Committee besides the points covered.  It was disclosed that the meal provided varied very considerably indeed.  I cannot at the moment recall the precise details, but I think the provision varied from 2d. to as much as ¼ in various areas. The Committee considered that something might be done&mdash;it would have to be done by regulation and not by Statute&mdash;to ensure some standardisation of the type of meal given to children in the various areas.</P>
    <P>I take it that the amendments made here do not affect the provision for the making of regulations, but I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that these 1927 regulations should be looked at again, not only from the point of view of what is being done now, but also from the point of view of ensuring that children are getting an adequate meal where the State and the local authority are providing the <Col N="597" /> money.  It could occur that money might be expended on something which was not a meal at all.  To give children a penny bun in the middle of the day and call it a meal would only be making a mockery of the intentions of this House.</P>
    <P>I take it the intentions of this House would be to ensure that children were not prevented, by reason of lack of food, from making full use of the educational facilities provided for them.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary should look into the matter from that angle and ensure, in whatever regulations he may deem it necessary to make, that attention will be paid to the type of meal provided and that children will not be fobbed off with something which is quite inadequate and merely a mockery of the intentions of this House.</P>

      <P>This amendment comes as a result of the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.  That committee is one of the most serviceable and useful committees this Dáil has.  Nobody has given greater attention to the work of that committee than has Deputy Sheldon.  Deputy Sweetman referred to that and he said, quite justly, that one could really call this the &ldquo;Sheldon amendment&rdquo;, because it regulates a number of matters and resolves doubts in relation to administrative costs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheldon referred to the work of the Public Accounts Committee in relation to the general work of the Dáil.  He said this might not be of great importance.  It is of importance. I will quote him a Northern proverb: &ldquo;Every mickle makes a muckle.&rdquo;  It is the detailed accuracy of the approach of the members of the Committee of Public Accounts which makes for good work in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheldon also referred to the cost and nature of the meals.  The costs vary in different areas.  In the City of Dublin, the work is done by contract. In other parts, such as the Gaeltacht, the work is done voluntarily by the teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am straying a bit.  Where the work is done voluntarily, it naturally costs less. The local contribution is an important factor in that, plus the help given. Notwithstanding this Bill, it will still be possible to make regulations.  The Department does its best to ensure that the best possible meal is provided. We had a general discussion to-day in the Department on that matter.  There are certain areas in which it is impossible to get milk at certain times of the year.  I appreciate the Deputy's contribution and the work of the Public Accounts Committee which has made it possible to embody this in permanent legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us the justification for such powers of inspection?  Is there any evidence of abuse in the administration of the free footwear scheme? It seems a bit far-reaching that an inspector should have power, if he has reason to believe that a certain person is eligible for free footwear or has, or had, a voucher, to go in and ask a series of questions.  Many people will resent that.  If there is reason for it, I am sure they will appreciate the necessity for inserting this section; but recipients of free footwear may now be subjected to an inquisition by an inspector.  There are hundreds and thousands of people receiving assistance from the State in various forms, to wit, the agricultural industry, industry generally and social welfare recipients.  In these, there is not the same type of inquisition and I should like to hear the reasons which prompted the inclusion of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of recipients is 79,234.  There are two categories: the footwear is either given free or with a contribution.  Local <Col N="599" /> authorities make their own regulations and there may be certain inquiries as to the income in the home.  Such inquiries are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where an inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that any person has in his possession or control a footwear voucher or official footwear, the inspector may request that person to state whether he has or has not in his possession or control any such voucher or footwear.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under sub-sections (3) and (4), the inspector may ask a number of questions. Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of any abuses that occurred?  Is it proven that a person who gets a voucher for free footwear goes into a shop and receives other than footwear for that voucher?  Is that the reason for the inclusion of this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There is a regulation that footwear must be stamped with the letters &ldquo;C.P.&rdquo;  The best of leather and handiwork goes into them. We want to ensure that cheap footwear is not pawned off on the recipient of a voucher.  That is where the powers of inspection come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very laudable. It is only right that the recipient should be protected and that precautions should be taken.  Why is it necessary, however, for an inspector, who has reasonable grounds for believing that a person has a free footwear voucher, to ask such person the circumstances in which that voucher came into his possession or control, to produce the voucher, and to permit the inspector to examine the voucher or footwear?  It would be reasonable enough if the inspector could go into a certain home and say: &ldquo;I want to see the pair of boots you got for your son to ensure they are the right quality, the right price, that the stamp is on them,&rdquo; and so on.  But why these other questions are to be asked, I cannot imagine.  Sub-section (4) states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;An inspector may request any <Col N="600" /> person to whom a footwear voucher has been issued&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to state whether he has or has not exchanged the voucher for official footwear,</P>
    <P>(b)  if he has not exchanged the voucher for official footwear, to produce the voucher to the inspector and permit the inspector to examine it,</P>
    <P>(c)  if he has exchanged the voucher for official footwear, to produce the footwear to the inspector and permit the inspector to examine it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The third one is all right, but as regards (a) and (b), has the Parliamentary Secretary reason to believe that recipients are getting other than official footwear, the stamped footwear?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oddly enough, this matter also came up at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I think the committee gathered at the time that there was no real evidence of anything going astray in this regard. Some years ago, I spoke on the Estimate on which the question of footwear was relevant, because I had some knowledge of this business.  My belief was that the whole scheme was mad.  It has probably settled down a little better by now, but certainly in the earlier years it was mad.  Undoubtedly merchants were selling the official footwear to people who did not give them vouchers; there were people presenting vouchers who got other than official footwear; instead of a child getting a pair of boots for which a voucher was officially issued, the father got the boots, and there was all sorts of fiddle-de-dee going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there was a far more serious effect than that.  The whole scheme was badly drafted.  Far too much of an onus is put on the country shopkeeper to keep a full range of this footwear which has a very limited profit margin designed to produce good footwear at a very low price.  The manufacturers and the retailers are restricted very sharply in their profit margin.  The difficulty is that in a small country shop the shopkeeper has no <Col N="601" /> idea of the size of footwear that will be required by the people who present the vouchers.  If he intends to keep this footwear at all, he has to order in bulk from the maker.</P>
    <P>The maker, to protect himself, because of the low margin of profit, makes this footwear in what is called a roll of sizes, what they reckon, on the average, to be the right number of the various sizes.  This block has to be taken by the retailers, many of whom have been scared of this slow and uncertain trade.  There is not much use in a retailer having size three if no child in the area needs that size, and as a result of the arrangement that exists a shopkeeper may have such footwear on his shelves for years.  Another factor that has to be taken into consideration is that the advantage to recipients of vouchers is lessened by their having to travel a considerable distance to get footwear against the voucher.</P>
    <P>A much easier system could have been devised.  Admittedly, it would mean that the manufacturer might have to carry a little more of the burden, but I am sure adjustment of the profit margin to the manufacturers and the retailers could easily be devised to meet that situation.  All that is required is that instead of one counterfoil on the voucher, there should be two which should be presented in advance.  Instead of the retailer stocking this footwear he would send the appropriate counterfoil to the manufacturer and get the exact size he wanted back.  He would not then have to carry a stock and he would be well satisfied to take a very nominal profit margin.  The manufacturer, however, because he would now have to carry all the stocks, might require a little more, but I am sure that adjustment could be made.</P>
    <P>This system would prevent all sorts of abuses.  Vouchers could only obtain official footwear which could go only to the person entitled to the voucher. Admittedly, there are abuses nothing can stop.  There is nothing to prevent a family getting official footwear and &ldquo;flogging&rdquo; it to somebody else, but you could stop some of the abuses.  It would help matters if the Department <Col N="602" /> would consult again not only with the manufacturers but with the representatives of the retail trade, because I understand that the only discussions that ever took place were with the manufacturers; they very sensibly wanted to get rid of the stocks off their shelves and adopted a scheme whereby the retailer carried a considerable part of the capital burden.</P>
    <P>As I say, this would eliminate some of the abuses which exist.  It must be remembered that resistance against all sorts of pressure which is easy in a large town is very difficult in a village where everybody is related to everybody else and the country shopkeeper cannot afford to fall out with his neighbour.  Some arrangement should be made whereby the stock of footwear would be carried by the manufacturers &mdash; if necessary giving them a wider margin of profit for doing so &mdash; and the footwear for the voucher holder obtained by means of a second counterfoil which would be transmitted by the retailer to the wholesaler or manufacturer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Corish that these powers of inspection have existed since 1944, and have not been changed.  The inspector must produce his authority, if required.  There has been &ldquo;flogging&rdquo; of vouchers and sales of vouchers, and where a parent is neglectful, it is up to us to safeguard the child.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheldon made certain suggestions which we will consider.  Living in a rural part of the country, I realise that the efficacy of the scheme is done away with to some extent when a person has to travel in a bus from, say, where I live to Mullingar to get a pair of boots, but the Department in recent times has arranged the exchange of groups of boots between one trader and another.  It strikes me that there could be an anticipation by the home assistance officers of the number of boots that would be required in the area and the sizes.  In that way, there could be an avoidance of the difficulties to which Deputy Sheldon referred.  We shall certainly consider the suggestions made by the Deputy and fit them in as best we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we come to the inspector.  If <Col N="603" /> the home assistance officer reports that he has issued certain vouchers within a certain time, that they have actually been given to the people, he is put down as carrying out his duties.  These regulations have been there since 1944 and we have had very few complaints, if any.  The scheme is working towards perfection each year as it is carried on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Parliamentary Secretary has misunderstood my brief remarks.  My object was to elicit the information he has now given. I wanted to know the reason for the inclusion of the section and I am satisfied now that there is justification for it.</P>
      <P>I appreciate there is a limited amount of money for free footwear, to each local authority, but I am not absolutely satisfied that the most deserving cases get it.  I do not mean there is abuse by the Department or the local authority, but I think the local authority could be a little more careful in the selection of the applicants. My impression is that, as soon as the scheme starts, it is a case of first come, first served.  I know local authorities have their standards and that there is a type of means test, but it seems to me they are anxious to finish with the scheme as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister could ensure some new arrangement, it might result in the most deserving cases getting the footwear.  If, say, the latest date for application were set as the 5th November, then before a voucher was given, all applications could be considered and the most deserving then selected.  I know of deserving applicants for free footwear having been told that all the money was expended and all the vouchers gone.  There are many unfortunate people who do not appreciate that they should put their applications in before a definite time. If all applications were considered together, there would be better administration of the scheme, especially, in the case of rural areas and some of the smaller provincial towns.  It may be difficult to do that; but at present there are many deserving people who <Col N="604" /> make application year after year but do not get the benefit of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate very much Deputy Corish's approach and I do not think we can express full satisfaction with the scheme.  From my own local knowledge, I agree that there is a rule of thumb in it.  The suggestion he made about its administration will be conveyed to the local authorities and if they carry out what he has in mind I think there will be a better and a fairer scheme.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Parliamentary Secretary, I want to make it quite clear that the Government received seven days' notice of the fact that motion No. 26 on to-day's Order Paper would be moved immediately after the motion dealing with the United Nations.  The intention, when the Dáil reopened on the 23rd October was that motion No. 26 would be moved.  Due to a misunderstanding which occurred on that occasion &mdash; which, I want to have it on the records of the House, was not due to the staff of the House in any way &mdash; that motion had to be postponed and, instead, the second motion on the Order Paper, dealing with a plebiscite on the matter of United Nations observers, was taken.  I made it clear last week that, if I received the consent of the other Deputies who had motions on the Order Paper to postpone their motions, it was my intention, immediately after the motion dealing with the United Nations, to move the motion dealing with internee arrangements.</P>
      <P>Earlier to-day the Government had sufficient notice of the fact that this motion was coming up to-night because the Government, through some of their representatives, made the necessary inquiries through the Ceann Comhairle's office as to whether it was my intention to move motion No. 26 on the Order Paper and the Government was so informed.  There is no doubt whatever that the Government knew that this motion was coming up.  It even went so far that the Government suggested that the motion be postponed on the basis that the Minister who was to take the motion was ill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a tragic state of affairs that a motion such as this has to come before an Irish Parliament. It is essential to give Deputies the background as to why it was necessary to put this motion on the Order Paper. On 5th July last, the Irish Cabinet had a protracted meeting.  The result of that meeting was that Part II of the Offences Against the State Act, which amounts to power to arrest and detain without trial, was brought into operation. The Government proclamation, dated 5th July, 1957, appeared in a special issue of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on 8th July, 1957.  On that same date, swiftly and ruthlessly, the Government went into action and 63 Irishmen were arrested and taken without charge or trial to the Curragh internment camp. This sudden action on the day the proclamation appeared shocked and stunned the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since that date other Irishmen have been unceremoniously hauled off to that internment camp.  Some of them were taken from their beds at night; others were taken from their work and, without charge or trial, were rushed by lorry behind barbed wire, so that to-day there are approximately 120 Irishmen of tender years and more <Col N="609" /> mature years, all men of patriotic outlook, held behind barbed wire as a result of the decision of the Government to bring Part II of the Offences Against the State Act into operation.</P>
    <P>I want to put this proposition to the House.  It is, or it should be, an accepted principle in Ireland that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty.  I think all Deputies, on the face of it at any rate, accept that proposition.  I think all fair-minded people, in this House and outside it, deplore the fact that such detestable and undemocratic legislation as Part II of the Offences Against the State Act should be put into operation. I think all fair-minded people profoundly disagreed with the Government's decision in this respect.  It is, in my opinion, blatantly dishonest to suggest or to say that the Constitution safeguards the natural rights of the individual when, in fact, internment without trial can be brought into operation at the whim of a Government.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible condemnation of our political institutions that such a revolting and shameful provision as Part II of the Offences Against the State Act should be enshrined in our legislation. Nobody will deny that if a man is believed to be guilty of a crime or an offence, whether the offence is criminal or political, the fair way is to have him brought before the normal courts where such an alleged infringement will be tried.  All Deputies, therefore, who believe in democratic procedure and the democratic way of life can show their true conviction in that regard by supporting this motion.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal with the motion from a number of aspects.  First, I shall take it from the point of view of those people both in the House and outside it, who may entirely disagree with the political outlook of many of the young men at present interned.  Dealing with the matter from the point of view of the ordinary rights of the individual, I want to point out that this country regularly sends its representatives to the Council of Europe and one of the first creations of the Council of Europe was the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" /> When that charter was being discussed, Deputies from both sides of the House took a very prominent part in the proceedings.  They vied with each other in submitting proposals and suggestions to make the convention the most effective instrument possible for the protection of human liberties. Some of the Deputies who took part in the discussions boasted that the convention was only an empty formula, until the Irish delegates got to grips with it.  Irish delegates, who were representative of all political Parties in the House, submitted numerous proposals to improve the convention. One of the Irish delegates &mdash; I do not think it is fair to give his name here &mdash; stated publicly that the charter was defective, until the Irish delegates got their teeth into it.  They submitted a series of proposals on the right to free elections, to private ownership of property, and on the rights of parents in providing religious and moral training for their children.</P>
    <P>According to themselves, they fought tirelessly to make this an ideal instrument to preserve the fundamental rights and liberties of the individual. For the benefit of Deputies who have not studied this convention, it lays down a series of rights and the Governments subscribing to it have guaranteed the observance of these rights within their jurisdiction.  The convention provides for the protection of life and liberty: it outlaws forced labour and &mdash; let me emphasise this &mdash; it outlaws detention without trial.  Mark you, this charter was approved by Dáil Éireann and by the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal at any length with the various provisions of the charter and I shall confine myself to one section and a few sub-sections which have a bearing on the motion we are discussing.  It describes the conditions under which an individual may be deprived of his liberty.  Subsection (a) mentions the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court.  These are the conditions under which a man may be deprived of his liberty.  Another condition is (b), the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-compliance with the lawful order of a court, or in <Col N="611" /> order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law: and (c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence, or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence, or fleeing after having done so. That is the important section, so far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>Under certain conditions, the Government are entitled to restrain an individual for the purpose of bringing him before a competent legal authority and having him tried and, if found guilty, having him convicted. It is important to remember this in connection with that latter clause.  It states that where a person is arrested or detained under that clause he &ldquo;shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is clear beyond doubt that the convention specifically outlaws or prohibits internment without trial.  That clause I have read out says it is the duty of a Government promptly to bring before a judge or before another officer authorised by law the man who has been arrested, whether he has committed an offence or is about to commit an offence.  At any rate, he must be brought before the competent authority and tried.  If he is not brought before the competent authority within a reasonable time, he must be released pending trial.</P>
    <P>We have subscribed to that Charter and the Dáil has agreed to it.  Let us see what has happened.  In the Articles of the Convention on Human Rights and Freedoms there is a certain loophole given to the consenting parties &mdash; namely, the Governments who are members of the Council of Europe &mdash;to deviate from the provisions and regulations concerning arrest and trial I have already mentioned.  There is a very slight loophole for Governments to derogate that instrument on freedom and human rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> This is the loophole.  It states that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation, any party to the Convention may take measures derogating from its obligations under the Convention to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided such measures are not inconsistent with its other obligations under international law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, it means this.  If a Government does not wish to abide by the terms whereby a man must be given a trial &mdash; and if he is not given a trial within a reasonable time, he must be discharged or allowed out pending trial &mdash; it must invoke the following: &ldquo;in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation.&rdquo;  It goes further.  Any contracting party, namely, a Government, that avails itself of this right of derogation must keep the Secretary&mdash;General of the Council of Europe fully informed of the measures it has taken and the reasons therefor.  The machinery for availing of derogation is clearly defined. Only in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation can derogation be allowed.</P>
    <P>Last year the British Government submitted a formal instrument of derogation in respect of Cyprus and recently submitted another formal instrument of derogation in respect of the Six Counties or occupied Ireland. In both cases the British Government are pleading the existence of an emergency threatening the life of the nation.  I would like to know what is our view.  Deputy Declan Costello put a question to the Minister for External Affairs in connection with the bringing into operation of certain sections of the Offences against the State Acts. I quote from column 31 of Volume 164, of Wednesday, 23rd October, 1957:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. D. Costello asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he has been advised that the bringing into operation of certain sections of the Offences against the State Acts constitutes a violation of Article 5 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental <Col N="613" /> Freedoms; and whether there has been any communication with the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe under Article 15 of the Convention, and, if so, if he will state the terms of such communication.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not propose to weary the House by quoting at length the Minister's reply.  I will confine myself to the third section of his reply, concerning his indication to the Secretary-General of the action taken by the Irish Government and the reasons therefor.  The Minister for External Affairs notified the Secretary-General that the Irish Government had brought Part II of the Offences against the State Acts into operation.  This is the reason he gave, and I quote from column 32 of the same volume:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The detention of persons under the Act is considered necessary to prevent the commission of offences against public peace and order and to prevent the maintaining of military or armed forces other than those authorised by the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the statement made to the Secretary-General by the Minister.  It is a statement of the action taken by the Government, but the Government lodged no formal instrument of derogation with the Secretary-General. However, they suggested indirectly that the communication sent to the Secretary-General could be construed, if necessary, as an instrument of derogation. They did not want to take the same formal action concerning the bringing into operation of internment camps here as the British Government did in regard to Cyprus and the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest doubt that the Government's action setting up these internment camps sets aside the Human Rights Convention and is contrary to what the members of this House expressed themselves in favour of when they spoke at Strasbourg.  As I have said, this instrument to safeguard the freedom of the individual was ratified and approved by the Dáil and the Government.  In spite of that, the Government saw fit to trample on the rights of the individual by bringing into operation Part II of the Offences Against the State Acts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> The Deputies who took part in the various debates at Strasbourg on this Charter should interest themselves very much in this motion.  They will find it very hard to explain to their colleagues at Strasbourg that, in spite of the fact that they, the Irish delegates, had spent so much time trying to make such a perfect instrument of this Charter, an Irish Government was the first to take steps in conflict with the decisions made by the Council of Europe, and in conflict with the decision taken by this House and this Government, when they ratified that Convention. I would say to those Deputies who may not agree with the outlook of many of the men who were interned, that, at the same time, they have an opportunity now of suggesting to the Government that their action was wrong and that, if the Government felt certain individuals have committed offences, political or otherwise, against the State, whatever the State may be in the minds of the Government, the process that should be followed by the Government should be that laid down by that Charter, namely, arrest of the individuals concerned, trial before the normal courts and the decision allowed to rest there.</P>
    <P>To those Deputies who were anxious to preserve the freedom of the individual, who believe it wrong for a Government to take a man from his bed at 2 o'clock in the morning, or from his work or recreation without warning, haul him into a truck and deposit him behind barbed wire in the Curragh, I suggest that this is the place to show their sincerity in bringing home to the Government that the people of the country do not believe that is the correct approach to dealing with any problem.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that we have it on the records of this House how the internment camps came about and how that sad state of affairs obtains at the present time.  Deputies should throw their minds back to December, 1956.  I propose to show here to Deputies and to the people outside the House that the action taken by the Government in setting up this internment camp was taken as a result of the direct and indirect pressure, the threats and <Col N="615" /> intimidation brought to bear on the Government by the British Government. In order to produce the necessary evidence, in so far as it lies within my power, I propose to refer back to December, 1956.</P>
    <P>I have not had, of course, an opportunity of having a look at correspondence and papers between various Departments, or at correspondence which passes between heads of Governments, but it is not necessary for any Deputy to be in a position to read any of these files.  All one has to do is read the papers for certain dates and watch the result of certain statements made by people in high positions outside this House.  On 12th December, 1956, there was a widespread series of incidents, raids and attacks on British installations inside the Six Counties.  On 14th December, two days afterwards, the Irish Government, then the inter-Party Government, announced certain plans involving the use of the Army, the Garda Síochána and the Special Branch along the Border, this unnatural Border.  I understand the duties of the Garda and military at that time were to protect and safeguard the nation.  The dates are important. On the 12th there was the series of raids and attacks and, on the 14th, the Government announced its plans to deal with these events, mark you, outside their own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>On 19th December, Sir Anthony Eden spoke on the situation in the British House of Commons.  It is well worth while reading his speech on that occasion because it conveys a lot, and every sentence dealing with the situation in the Six Counties, every sentence making reference to the Irish Government, carries grave significance in the light of events that have taken place since.  On 19th December, he said: &ldquo;Immediately after the outbreak of violence on 12th December, Her Majesty's Ambassador in Dublin arranged to see the Minister for External Affairs to obtain further information from him, and to express the serious view which Her Majesty's Government would be bound to take of these events.&rdquo;  That statement was made on 19th December.  He went on <Col N="616" /> to say, and this I think is of significance also: &ldquo;As the House will know, on December 14th, the Republican Government issued a statement on their own initiative in which they said that they had determined to take, in conjunction with the police and Defence Forces of the Republic, such steps as they deemed necessary and appropriate to prevent activities which, if they were allowed to continue, would inevitably cause loss of life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We now know that immediately after the raids on 12th December, the British Ambassador made known to the Minister for External Affairs the serious view which Her Majesty's Government was taking of the situation.  We now know that the Irish Government disclosed their plans for action after a Cabinet meeting, presumably some time before 14th December, because it was on that evening the plans were announced.  The result of that Cabinet decision was that police and military were sent hot-foot along the Border to turn back young men from the Twenty-Six Counties and prevent them crossing over, and at the same time to prevent young men from the Six Counties area from crossing over here.  One would think that the statement issued on 14th December by the Irish Government, pointing out the steps they were prepared to take, would have given a sense of satisfaction to the British Government or, at any rate, that they would be satisfied the Irish Government had things well in hand.</P>
    <P>One would think that that statement by the then Taoiseach, that the military and the police would be sent along the Border and that the Irish Government would take all possible steps to prevent loss of life, should have satisfied Her Majesty's Government.  I wonder if it did.  I want to put to the House that, in spite of the reassuring statement made by the Irish Government on the 14th, Sir Anthony Eden went on to say in the course of his speech on the 19th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the light of this action&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that is, this statement by the Republican Government&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Her Majesty's Government decided to direct Her Majesty's Ambassador <Col N="617" /> to deliver a communication expressing their very great concern at the recent incidents in Northern Ireland and the hope that the important objective which the Republican Government had proclaimed in their statement would be effectively and successfuly secured.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, it is quite clear that Sir Anthony Eden is not satisfied that the statement made on the 14th by the Republican Government would result in securing the objectives that the Irish Government had proclaimed in their statement.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody can deny, even though we have no documents from either the Minister for External Affairs or his counterpart in the Foreign Office, that the British Government were putting the screws on our Government.  I asked in this House some time ago if the Minister for External Affairs would disclose the texts of the communications which passed between the two Governments in the period 12th to 20th December.  I got the reply that there was nothing doing. In view of statements made in recent months by the Taoiseach in connection with the threat of war by another nation, it is necessary that we pay great attention to the events that took place last December.</P>
    <P>I think the British Government made threats to our Government last December in connection with the events that took place in the Six Counties.  I think our Government lost no time in paying heed to the threats issued to them by the British Government because, on the 19th, in the very same speech, Sir Anthony Eden concluded by saying &mdash; after telling the House of Commons about the communication that was sent to the Irish Government through Her Majesty's Ambassador; in my opinion, &ldquo;communication&rdquo; is the wrong word: I would say &ldquo;ultimatum&rdquo; is a better word &mdash;&ldquo;In the Ireland Act, 1949, the Parliament at Westminster declared Northern Ireland to be an integral part of the United Kingdom.  This is a declaration which all Parties in this House are pledged to support.&rdquo;  Here, to my mind, is the kernel of the speech: &ldquo;The safety of Northern Ireland and <Col N="618" /> of its inhabitants is, therefore, a direct responsibility of Her Majesty's Government which they will, of course, discharge.&rdquo;  The sting was in the tail-end of the speech, when he disclosed to the House of Commons that there would be no doubt whatever with regard to what action would be taken by Her Majesty's Government if certain events were allowed to pursue their course in the occupied part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Is it unfair, then, to suggest that these first threats of war or vengeance were issued by the British Government to the then Government here in Ireland? We know that the incidents started on the 12th.  We know that on the 14th the Irish Government announced their plans to deal with events along the Border.  We know that on the 19th Sir Anthony Eden, in a speech in the House of Commons, disclosed that the British Government directed their Ambassador in Dublin to deliver a communication expressing their very great concern at the incidents in Northern Ireland and, at the end of his speech, Sir Anthony Eden pointed out that, under the Ireland Act, 1949, the British Government would not hesitate to give the necessary protection to the Six Counties as an integral part of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Let us go back.  On the 17th December, a number of young men were arrested by Irish forces in the vicinity of the Border.  These men were arrested by the Garda Síochána and the military but they were all released. No charges were preferred.  No Offences against the State Acts was invoked.  However, after that speech by Sir Anthony Eden on the 19th December, as soon as the next series of incidents took place, the police force in the Twenty-Six Counties went into action and part of the Offences against the State Acts was enforced. As we all know, there was a series of arrests, charges and trials resulting in many cases in imprisonment for periods ranging from three to six months for many young men in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>That, briefly, is an outline of what took place during the latter portion of the inter-Party's Government reign of <Col N="619" /> office in connection with the incidents and events in the Six Counties.  It is to the credit of the inter-Party Government at the time that, when they did decide to take action, they took action through the normal channels and &mdash; whether it is felt rightly or wrongly does not matter &mdash; when an offence was committed they decided that the people alleged to have committed it would be brought before the ordinary courts, charged and tried and, if found guilty, would be punished in accordance with the law as set out. It is to their credit that, in spite of threats and everything else that were invoked by outside Governments, the Government of the day decided that an offence or an alleged offence, as far as they were concerned, would be tried before the court and that a man would get a fair trial.</P>
    <P>As things turned out, we know that a certain district justice disagreed with the evidence and the manner in which the prosecution was brought and we know that as a result of his action and of his comments, he was subjected to an inquiry.  The result of that inquiry was not made known until the change of Government had taken place.  We also know that the judge who conducted the inquiry specifically stated that, in his opinion, the justice involved should not be asked to resign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall relate it to the motion in a moment.  The views of that district justice were that it was contrary to legislation to have, at that stage, any such charges brought before him under the Offences against the State Act.  However, let me say in passing, the Government at present in office decided that the district justice had better be removed, and removed he was.  I have no doubt his removal was a reminder to our other district justices that the same fate awaited them if they did not agree with the great chief.  As I have said, the heavy hand was held over the inter-Party Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> In this matter the first big event occurred under the Fianna Fáil Government. This House sat during the early summer months and we had no talk here of repressive legislation.  On July 4th there was the attack on Forkhill Barracks in County Down at 2 o'clock in the morning.  On Friday, July 5th, the day afterwards, the Minister for Home Affairs in the Six Counties, Mr. W.W. Topping, said that he hoped the Government in Dublin would re-examine the situation in the light of the representations made by the United Kingdom Government, but also from the realistic approach of what might happen if they allowed the campaign to continue.</P>
    <P>That statement was made by Mr. Topping on the afternoon of July 5th and it would appear from it that the United Kingdom Government had already made representations to the Irish Government in connection with the Forkhill ambush.  In fact it was suggested then that the men involved had escaped across the Border.  If such representations had not been made, how would Mr. Topping have been able to say so?  We can take it that the British Government lost no time in telling the Irish Government what their views were and what the consequences were likely to be if the campaign, as it was described, were allowed to pursue its course.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out, the Government took action on the 5th July, that evening.  There was a protracted Cabinet meeting and the result was the issuing of a proclamation in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on July 8th.  That morning 63 men were hauled unceremoniously down to the Curragh.  If that were not action taken as a result of representations, I do not know what to call it.  It stunned this country.  This House had been in session up to Thursday, 4th July.  The Government waited until the Dáil rose for the Summer Recess before deciding to bring in Part II of the Offences against the State Act, giving them power to intern without trial any man who, in the opinion of the police, should he arrested and interned.</P>
    <P>The people felt so perturbed about the position in July that a wrinkle of <Col N="621" /> their feeling went back to the Taoiseach through the members of his Party, many of whom did not support in any shape or form the action taken by the Government when they set up the internment camp.  The Taoiseach, like the wise politician that he is, made a special pronouncement on the reasons why the Government found it necessary to apply Part II of the Offences Against the State Act.  Putting it in a nutshell, stripping it of its verbiage, this is what he said: &ldquo;The possibility of embroilment, not only in war with another country but a hateful civil war as well, was one of the reasons for the Government's action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was published in the Sunday newspapers of 14th July.  Does it not prove that the statements I have made all along were correct&mdash;that the threat of war must have been made by the British Government?  Otherwise why did the Taoiseach say that the possibility of embroilment in war with another country was the reason for the setting up of the internment camp?  I am accepting the Taoiseach's statement as true; I am accepting that there was this threat of war.  I do not suppose for a second that the Taoiseach would be dishonest to the extent that he would try to frighten the Irish people with the threat of war if such a threat had not been made.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Taoiseach would try to panic the Irish people in order to get them to support his policy of repression against young Irishmen if such a threat of war had not been made to the Government by outside forces.  An ultimatum must have been given to the Government.  It would appear, therefore, that what Sir Anthony Eden said on the 19th December had its repercussions in July of the following year.  Let me just repeat what he said in December: &ldquo;He hoped that the plans of the Republican Government would be successful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is evident that, when this incident at Forkhill occurred, the British Government felt that the actions of the Irish Government were not successful enough and that they then put the gun to the Irish Government saying: &ldquo;You must take further action; the action that has been taken is not sufficient.&rdquo;<Col N="622" /> The result was that Part II of the Offences Against the State Act was invoked on July 8th, when the internment camp opened.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible tragedy that men in this House, who themselves were interned and under sentence of death by the British Government for trying to secure the freedom of the 32 Counties, should reach the stage of interning young Irishmen for trying to secure the very same thing.  It is bad enough that it should have been done to them without their doing it to young men who have read the history of this country through Fianna Fáil glasses.</P>
    <P>The House is entitled at this stage to have full particulars concerning this threat of war with another country which the Taoiseach announced on 14th July.  Surely it is a very serious thing if such a threat has been made?  Surely, in the light of statements made by the British Government and the puppet Government in Stormont, it is essential that the texts of the statements which passed between the two Governments, the British Government and the Irish Government, between December and the present time, should be disclosed? In regard to this threat, or ultimatum of war, as contained in the Taoiseach's speech, what reply did our Government make and what action did they take, apart from setting up the internment camp?</P>
    <P>Did they bring the matter to the attention of the Irish nation or to the attention of the Secretary-General of the United Nations?  Did our Minister for External Affairs make any attempt to make this known when he visited the United Nations and spoke there at length recently?  If there is not a true disclosure in connection with that period of time, between December and July, if we are not given the facts and if the correspondence is not disclosed, then we are entitled to suggest what I would regret to have to say, namely, that the Taoiseach was bluffing here on July 14th when he made the announcement to the Irish nation giving the reason why the internment camp had been set up.</P>
    <P>I want to make this clear to Deputies who do not subscribe to my views but <Col N="623" /> who believe that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty.  Let them concentrate on the kernel of the matter: is it right to take a man away without a trial, to lock him up and to keep him there as long as the Government wish?  Let me quote the London <i>Times</i>&mdash; which I do not think is a paper which is said to favour Ireland&mdash;on the action of the Fianna Fáil Government on July 9th, 1957.  In an editorial headed &ldquo;Grasping the Nettle&rdquo;, it says: &ldquo;The bold stroke it has delivered was prompted by a fundamental necessity which is well understood in Belfast and in London, as in Dublin&rdquo;.  It goes on to say: &ldquo;But wholesale arrest is distasteful and the sooner it is superseded by specific charges against individuals, the better will be the prospects of moving into a phase of peaceful co-existence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even the London <i>Times</i>, although it felt that action was imperative, and although it has described young Irishmen as scum, thugs and murderers, still felt the action taken by the Irish Government was distasteful and that it would be wiser and in the interests of peaceful co-existence if the Government superseded internment by specific charges against each individual.  It would appear from some of the speeches made by some of the Deputies here that they have the idea in their minds that until the majority in the Six Counties decide that they want to come in here, they have an absolute right to say they will stay out.  On that basis, I would suggest to the Deputies that they can support this motion and, if they wish, can then suggest to the Government: &ldquo;You think offences have been committed and you think that men interned have been guilty of offences against the State. Arrest them and then, if they are found guilty, punish them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us come to the internment camp itself.  As I said on 8th July, the Government issued its proclamation of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940 (Detention) Regulations, 1957.  The regulations came into operation and that series of regulations bears the signature of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Kevin <Col N="624" /> Boland.  That instrument, which I think is a disgraceful product, contains 64 paragraphs dealing with the internment camp and how that camp is to be conducted, the privileges and punishments to be awarded to the members therein.  It is significant that when this came out on July 8th, no copy was sent to any individual Deputy.  It is the normal procedure in this House that copies of regulations and so forth are, out of courtesy, at any rate, sent to every individual Deputy, especially when the House is in recess.  This series of regulations was not sent out to each individual Deputy and it was up to an individual Deputy to go along and purchase a copy of the regulations.  I do not blame the Government and I do not blame the Minister for Defence trying to keep as quiet as possible some of the data contained in this paper dealing with the internment of young men.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it contains 64 provisions and some of the provisions, or regulations, are copied directly out of old British internment camp regulations, word for word.  There are other regulations in it that are the product of the native, brilliant, penal intellect They are actually an improvement, if such is the correct word to use, on the work of the experts the British used. They were able to think up refinements that the British had not thought of.  It is a tragic thing for Irishmen to think up these restrictions to impose on brother Irishmen.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to bother the House by quoting these at length, but I propose to refer to a few.  Paragraph 24 of the regulations governing the Curragh Internment Camp deals with the chaplain and this is what it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The chaplain shall conform with the rules and regulations of the camp and shall not interfere with the working of them as regards the safe custody, discipline and labour of the internees but shall support the camp commandant in the maintenance thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That regulation, in so far as the chaplain is concerned, simply means that the chaplain shall support the commandant of the camp in the maintenance, safe custody, discipline and <Col N="625" /> labour of the internees.  That is what the chaplain is asked to do.  That is a new function for a chaplain, whose main duties should be to care for the spiritual welfare of those in his charge.  Here we have it specifically laid down that he is charged with helping the commandant of the camp in seeing that the prisoners are held in safe custody.  Is that not a nice function for a chaplain?  To my mind, it is a new and novel function, at any rate, for a spiritual adviser.</P>
    <P>Let us go on to paragraph 30 which deals with some of the offences against camp discipline.  In this paragraph, there are 14 sub-sections pointing out the different ways in which an internee can commit an offence.  I do not propose to read them all out now. I will just comment on a few.  Number 3 of the rules and regulations in the paragraph states that &ldquo;an internee shall be guilty of an offence against camp discipline, if he behaves irreverently at Divine Service and prayers&rdquo;. Where was that taken from?  Was it thought out by Irishmen or was it taken word for word out of a British manual on regulations dealing with internment? That is taken directly from the old penal system imposed by the British Government to deal with Irishmen, in so far as their religion is concerned.</P>
    <P>The other 13 provisions deal with all sorts of things.  For example, if a man sings or whistles in a noisy manner, he is liable to commit an offence against camp discipline.  Number 12 sums up the situation beautifully. It says that if an internee in any other way offends against good order and discipline, he has committed an offence against camp discipline and can be punished by receiving close confinement for three days.  He can be given a restricted diet; a deprivation of victuals for a period not exceeding three days and also deprivation of facilities such as receiving visitors, sending letters and so on.</P>
    <P>The only other paragraph with which I shall bore the House is paragraph 35. I think it would be well for Deputies to bear in mind where this came from. I am going to ask Deputies a six mark question.  Was this the result of the <Col N="626" /> British penal system?  Did it come from the French convict system, or is it the product of the Irish penal intellect? It says that an internee may be put in irons or under mechanical restraint by the camp commandant, if necessary.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  I think the Bastille is only trotting after the provision in that respect.  There were no written provisions, to my knowledge, in connection with the type of restraint used on prisoners in the Bastille.  We read history.  They were sent to that prison without trial or without any charge preferred.  They were locked up without their relations knowing where they were.  They were put in chains, but it took an Irish Government to put it in writing that an Irish officer was entitled to put Irishmen in chains, if he found it necessary.  These are some of the regulations in force, so far as the internees are concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for one moment that those provisions are being operated, but it is a terrible thing to have in cold print such disgraceful restrictions laid down.  I do not think the Irishmen in the unfortunate position of being in charge of the camp would like for one moment to find themselves in circumstances in which they would have to do what is suggested in the regulations.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at the camp itself. As I have said, there are approximately 120 men in this camp.  I have not nad, personally, an opportunity of seeing for myself what I am about to say now, but the information I am about to give is information that I am satisfied was true up to the past fortnight. I cannot say what may have happened during the past fortnight.  I cannot say whether improvements or changes have been made.  The position, as I will outline it, is what was described to me as being in operation in the camp up to a fortnight ago.  I will tell the House later why I was not in a position to see the conditions myself.  I cannot say what changes have taken place.  Up to recently, internees have been interned in huts that were formerly occupied by German internees. I was familiar myself with German internees.  The German internees <Col N="627" /> had comfortable cubicles, but I understand that they were all removed. I understand that the ordinary huts have no privacy whatever and that the huts concerned have been grossly overcrowded. Not only that, but the huts are damp and draughty, and it is quite normal for the men to suffer from heavy colds as a result of the draughts piercing through the wooden partitions.</P>
    <P>The sanitary arrangements were, again up to recently, in my opinion, very poor indeed.  Last August, as a result of the sanitary conditions that obtained, there was an outbreak of dysentery.  For several weeks after these men were interned, there was no arrangement whatever made for the men to dry their clothes after washing. Provision is made for washing in an outhouse, a galvanised shed.  Many of the taps are leaking.  Many of the pipes are corroded with the result that the floor is constantly wet.  The drain leading from this washhouse is choked. Conditions are indeed most unpleasant for anybody at this or any other time of the year.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position is at present in relation to footwear, but it was bad.  I shall not go into that in further detail since it might be hurtful to certain people.</P>
    <P>Some of the relatives of these internees have to travel 150 miles to visit the camp.  They are allowed only a quarter of an hour.  If a number of relatives come, there is no waiting-room provision.  All interviews take place inside a hut, with a bayonet in the back of the internee as he marches in.  While he is engaged with one visitor, the rest must wait outside irrespective of whether or not it is wet and for as long as it is felt necessary they should wait.</P>
    <P>Up to recently many men were badly in need of dental treatment.  When an application was made, the only treatment offered was for the purpose of extractions.  There was no question of fillings or anything else.  Only where an internee was suffering acute discomfort as a result of toothache were extractions permitted.</P>
    <P>Many men in the camp had asked for the services of an optician.  So far they <Col N="628" /> have received no information as to when this service will be made available. Where false teeth and glasses are needed, they have to be supplied by the relatives of the internees.  Many of these relatives were dependent on these men, since many of these men were the breadwinners of their families.  It is now suggested that these relatives should bear the cost of glasses or false teeth for these unfortunate men behind barbed wire, many of whom were the only breadwinners in their families.</P>
    <P>I can say without fear of contradiction that the conditions are far worse than those which obtain in any other State prison.  Mountjoy and Maryborough are luxury hotels by comparison. Criminals in State prisons are not treated in the way I have suggested. Neither are they neglected in relation to their personal health and hygiene in the way in which these unfortunate men are, men whose only crime is that they want to unite this country.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I am not for a moment criticising the personnel in charge of the camp, the commandant or any of his staff.  I do not for one moment suggest that they are responsible. They are merely carrying out the distasteful duties imposed upon them and, to my knowledge, they are carrying them out as favourably as they possibly can from the internees' point of view.  They are trying to make things as easy as possible but, if they have not got the necessary facilities which should be made available, they can do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>I have given the House an outline of conditions in the camp.  I was perturbed on a number of occasions by the complaints made to me about the conditions obtaining and some time ago I came up here and rang the Minister, Deputy Boland.  I could not get him.  I told his private secretary the purpose of my call, namely, that I wanted permission to visit the Curragh Internment Camp for the purpose of inspecting the housing and sanitary arrangements therein.  I told the private secretary I would ring again.  In one day I rang the Minister <Col N="629" /> three times and on every occasion he could not be got.  It was extraordinary that he could be absent for so long.</P>
    <P>In order to clarify the position, I wrote a formal letter to the Minister, a blunt one, asking him for permission to visit the internment camp to satisfy myself as to the conditions in relation to housing and so forth.  I got a reply from the Minister's private secretary as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;20th September, 1957.</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Defence to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant and to say that if persons detained in the camp at the Curragh intimate that they wish you or any other member of the Dáil to visit them and see the camp the Minister will give the matter immediate and favourable consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I never at any time asked the Minister for permission to visit any particular internee.  I never suggested that I wished to see Mr. A., Mr. B., Mr. C. or Mr. D.  All I was concerned with was to inspect the housing and sanitary arrangements.  Mark the clever reply I received: if persons detained in the camp intimated that they wished to see me, the Minister would be glad to facilitate me.  I do not propose to try to interpret what was in the Minister's mind, because that would be impossible, but I am entitled to suggest that I fear the Minister's aim was to get me to disclose to him the names of individuals or relatives who had made complaints to me so that he, in turn, could go back through his agents to the camp and say: &ldquo;John So-and-So who has been interned here is recognising Dáil Éireann and making representations to Deputy McQuillan&rdquo;, thereby hoping to break the morale of the men by setting them against one another.  That is the only interpretation I can put on that reply.</P>
    <P>I pursued the matter a little further. I replied to that letter on the 24th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant and it would appear that a misunderstanding has arisen. <Col N="630" /> I repeat that I am anxious to inspect the internment camp housing and sanitary arrangements for the purpose of satisfying myself as to the accuracy of some of the allegations made to me concerning this camp's facilities.  I feel as a public representative it is my duty to do so and I therefore urge you to grant me the necessary permission to visit the camp without delay.</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Signed) J. McQuillan.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I got a reply to that, dated 27th, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    <P>I am desired by Mr. Kevin Boland, Minister for Defence, to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th instant and to inform you that the internment camp at the Curragh is administered under the provisions of Statutory Instrument 146 of 1957, as amended by Statutory Instrument 154 of 1957, made by me in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 7 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the reply I received from the Minister.  In other words, on the 20th he was prepared to facilitate me or any other Deputy in visiting the internment camp if I would name individuals in it who wanted to see me. When I specifically state I want to visit the camp to inspect housing and sanitary arrangements not to discuss anything with internees, he replies on the 27th giving me a whole stream of regulations which simply mean the Minister has not the power to allow me in. If those are not contradictory statements from the Minister inside four days I do not know what to call them.</P>
    <P>However, I cannot do any more about that, but I have given the facts as I know them as to the conditions that obtain in the camp.  If the Minister tells me the information I have given is not fully correct he can only blame himself because I would have preferred to come in to this debate having seen for myself what the conditions are or were in the camp.  The Minister refused to give me that permission and his refusal, to my mind, is significant.  I do not see why, when a <Col N="631" /> Deputy of this House asks for permission to visit such a place as the internment camp to satisfy himself that these men are being treated as human beings, any Minister should refuse him permission to do so.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the camp, let us have a look at the cases of individuals who are in the camp.  I am disclosing no information that is not already printed and available to the public when I put this on the records of the House.  I have asked for permission from nobody; I have consulted no individuals or relations of individuals in the camp in connection with the facts I shall put before the House now.  They have been published elsewhere.  If Deputies want to satisfy themselves they can read them in other places outside the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The first case I want to bring to the notice of the Minister is that of a member of this House, a Deputy who is interned in the camp.  It can be seen from the motion that is down in the name of Deputy Finucane and myself that we have called on the Government to release a member of this House who is interned.  There is a young man in the Curragh Internment Camp, Deputy Rory Brady.  He was employed as a vocational teacher under the Roscommon Vocational Committee.  Last January a notice came down to the Roscommon Vocational Committee from the Minister for Education suspending Deputy Brady from duty with the vocational committee because he was serving a sentence of six months' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>To give the details briefly, Deputy Brady was arrested and charged under Part I of the Offences Against the State Act and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment.  That was during the inter-Party régime.  While he was in Mountjoy a letter was delivered to Deputy Brady asking him to lodge a certain signed document with the chief vocational officer of Roscommon before a certain date.  The letter said that if the document was lodged his suspension would be lifted.  This happened in July.  In the meantime, Deputy Brady's release came about and as he was being released from <Col N="632" /> Mountjoy he was seized unceremoniously outside the gates, thrown into a lorry and hauled off to the Curragh Camp &mdash; a member of this House, a member of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>He had no opportunity at that time of doing anything in connection with this letter or threat with regard to his employment, but while in the camp he applied for permission to consult his legal adviser in connection with his proposed suspension.  Deputy Brady sought the permission of the camp commandant to have an interview with a solicitor on the 29th August, 1957. The camp commandant sent this request to the Minister, namely, that Deputy Brady wanted permission to interview his solicitor for the specific purpose of obtaining advice in regard to his suspension and future employment by the Roscommon Vocational Committee.  On the 5th September Deputy Brady was informed by the camp commandant that the Minister had refused him permission to see his solicitor in this connection.  This cannot be disputed because it came before the Roscommon County Council on two occasions in the last two months, and the Fianna Fáil Party on the Roscommon County Council joined in to make a unanimous resolution of protest to the Minister in connection with the scandalous way of treating this Deputy.</P>
    <P>There is another case which I believe should be brought to the notice of the House.  When the Taoiseach spoke here in July last in connection with those who were to be interned, he said that the persons detained were detained because they were members of one of the unlawful organisations, that is one of those engaged in armed activities.  Let us take the example of this man who was interned.  I shall not mention his name here but he is related to a Deputy in this House.  This young man, who was President of the National Students' Council in U.C.D., was arrested at 11.30 on the night of July 18th last.  He was arrested as he was leaving a cafe in Lower Leeson Street and taken to the Bridewell.  His parents were never officially notified as to where he was taken or as to his arrest.  They were notified by telephone by a young student, a friend of <Col N="633" /> this boy, at 12.30 that night, an hour after his arrest by the Special Branch. In other words, he was picked up off the street, just as men are picked up in Hungary and Russia and then disappear and that is the last one hears about them.</P>
    <P>This young man is 21 years of age, a law student, and he was detained under Section 30&mdash;as far as I could gather&mdash; of the Offences against the State Act. He was not charged with any specific offence.  He was not given any opportunity of undergoing a trial for any offence.  He was not, to my knowledge or that of anyone else, a member of an illegal organisation.  In case Deputies here doubt that, this young man is prepared to testify on oath that he is not a member of an illegal organisation. In spite of that, he was hauled off to the camp without warning.  He was brought to the Curragh.</P>
    <P>What was his offence?  His offence, to my mind, was the fact that he was President of the National Students' Council, that he got up at public meetings outside and that he was rather boisterous and tough in his attack on the Government for bringing in Part II of the Offence Against the State Act. He also organised a number of protest marches in connection with that Act. These protest marches, to my knowledge, were conducted in no more unruly fashion than any other protest meeting which has ever taken place in this capital.  He organised and spoke at meetings.  He spoke at other meetings protesting strongly against the detestable provisions in the Act which give power to the Government to lock up men and intern men without trial. Ironically, with all his protests about what happened to other men, that is the very thing which happened to himself. He was hauled in at 11.30 and swept off to the Curragh.</P>
    <P>The present Pope Pius, in a Christmas message in 1944, had this to say in one of his major statements on the theory of government, in a speech which concerned democracy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A necessary condition of every democracy is that there shall be complete freedom to state the opposite view when policy is being debated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> It means freedom of speech, freedom for university students outside this House in their youthful idealistic manner &mdash; in a manner at times that may be brusque and over-enthusiastic &mdash; but they should have that freedom at the same time to express their views against action taken to restrict the freedom of their fellowmen.  That was the view also expressed by His Holiness with regard to freedom of speech.  However, with no disrespect to His Holiness the Pope, &ldquo;his holiness&rdquo; here does not agree with that.</P>
    <P>That young man has since been released.  He was released because the proper pressure was brought to bear on the Government.  That cannot be denied.  I wish him luck in so far as his examination is concerned.  It was a shocking thing to do to a young man who was studying at the time, but it just shows what can happen in this country, in spite of what many well-thinking men in the Fianna Fáil Benches believe.  This could happen, although they themselves do not believe to this day that it could happen.</P>
    <P>A third case concerns a man who was employed by C.I.E.  This man also did three months under the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Deputy a question?  Did this young man who was President of the Students' Council have to sign this peculiar form to be released?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The man I am talking about now and who did three months, was employed by C.I.E.  He went home after serving his sentence and was whisked away again and taken off to the Curragh.  Before he went, he was asked to sign this document that we have heard so much about.  He was asked by C.I.E. to sign this document; he did not sign it and lost his job. How is it that C.I.E. are in a position to force any employee to do what the Government was desirous of doing with every other man whom they have interned?  Are we not told every day of the week that, as far as employment and administration are concerned, the Government has no function, the Minister <Col N="635" /> has no function in the day to day administration of C.I.E. business and that the question of termination of employment is a matter for C.I.E.? Yet we have this semi-State company, this semi-bankrupt outfit, coming along and saying to this young man: &ldquo;You must sign this document or else your job is gone.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those are only some of the cases. Let me deal with a few more.  I call this man Mr. A.  He is now in the camp.  He appeared before a district justice in January.  He was charged with failing to give an account of his movements for a period of a fortnight before his arrest.  That was not the only charge against him.  There was a worse charge.  The other charge was that of failing to give to Detective Officer So-and-So information in his possession regarding other persons. That young man is down in the camp, too.</P>
      <P>Another case concerns eight young men charged with failing to give an account of their movements and there is the second charge against them of refusing to give all information in their possession in relation to the commission by another person of scheduled offences.  Those eight men are detained in the camp.  They refused to tell what their comrades were doing. In their case, Inspector So-and-So gave evidence of the preferring of the charges against Mr. X, of his refusing (1) to give an account of his movements and (2) to give information in his possession regarding the movements of others.  All these men are behind barbed wire to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, this is a very important aspect of the Offences Against the State Act and of the reasons why men are interned.  The informer is a species peculiar to Irish history and for a handful of gold men have been known to betray the cause and their comrades down through the centuries.  Every generation of Irishmen has had its quota of traitors and spies &mdash; those who give away their comrades.  In Irish history those people are remembered and spoken of and treated with horror <Col N="636" /> and disgust.  Irish history, as we know it, emphasises that the lowest form of humanity, the lowest animal, is he that would betray his comrades.</P>
    <P>The British Government and Dublin Castle used the weapon of bribery in olden times to attain their ends.  Offers of high offices and offers of money were made to many individuals, money was lavished in order to achieve the ends suitable for the British Government. But there was no legislation that I know of in British days, that made it an offence for a man to fail to betray his comrades.  It was always sought to get the betrayal by bribery or by threats.  It took an Irish Government to bring in legislation making it mandatory and an offence against the State if a man did not betray his comrades and tell what they were doing two days or a week or a month before.  We have it in Irish history on the records of our Legislature that it took an Irish Government to bring in that type of foul legislation which would ask a boy to betray his pals.</P>
    <P>I can state the section of the Offences Against the State Act, if anyone does not believe me.  It gives authority to the police to arrest a citizen, to question him as to his activities, his whereabouts on any given day.  Not alone that he must disclose the names of his comrades and what they were doing on that particular day and during that particular time as well.  I do not know what happened in the Bridewell or in the other places where these young men were interviewed, but I know that every effort was made to get them to &ldquo;spill the beans&rdquo;.  They were told: &ldquo;You will get off if you tell us where So-and-So was.&rdquo;  That was done and that is a terrible approach, especially when we consider that these men were only following in the footsteps of the men who now man the Front Benches here.</P>
    <P>I could say that the bogs and lakes of Ireland contain the bones of men who were executed, under old customs, for alleged spying on their colleagues, and when those colleagues are in this House, the legislation they now have is to make it an offence for a man who wants to remove the unnatural Border if he does not betray his comrades.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get this clear. First, it is made an offence if you do not tell on your comrades.  In other words, the feeling is there that they are doing something disgraceful.  Does the Minister not realise that the very implication of a man having to sign this document is that he is branded in the minds of the people outside, even of those who disagree with him in many respects, as having betrayed himself, his cause, his comrades and what he is doing?  Is that not the one weak point in the Minister's argument?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me bring home clearly to the Minister that, no matter what he may say about the Constitution, the Constitution does not embrace the Six Counties.  The people in the Six Counties were never consulted in connection with the Constitution that was enacted for the Twenty-Six Counties.  Therefore, if young men, misguided or anything else &mdash; call them what you will &mdash; wish to take action with comrades in occupied Ireland, there is no right for any Minister or Government to suggest that they must sign a pledge which would preclude them from going to the assistance of resistance fighters inside the occupied part of Ireland.  Our writ does not run there.  Our Constitution as such was not put to the people of the Six Counties.  We have no right to suggest that the Constitution as such should be imposed on the people of the Six Counties.  Therefore, it is wrong for <Col N="638" /> the Minister or the Government to suggest that any man should sign any pledge with regard to any activity that takes place outside the jurisdiction of the State and, therefore, the Minister will not get anybody to sign this document.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with what has been described as the legislation which calls on a man to betray his comrade.  The Ceann Comhairle says I cannot develop that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect that I want brought home to the public.  Down through the years, Irishmen who took up arms and fought, as in practically all cases, a losing fight for the freedom of the country, were described as traitors, thugs, murderers, disturbers of the peace.  They were described in these terms by the British Government on the basis that they should be put away from society, that they were not fit to mix with the ordinary people.  That situation obtained throughout Irish history and that outlook obtained as far as the British forces were concerned.  In the occupied part of Ireland to-day, young freedom fighters and resistance fighters are described in the very same terms by judges and men of high position.  They are described as thugs, murderers, criminals and all the rest.  The weight of the British Empire has been brought to bear in the occupied part of Ireland to crush these people, to crush the nationalist population and to crush the people and the young men in the nationalist movement who are not prepared to accept British dictation and who want the British to get out. Armoured cars, the British Army, all sorts of things are used in occupied Ireland to-day to crush the nationalist population.  The internment camp, arrest without warrant, jail without trial, midnight raids, intimidations &mdash; all sorts of things &mdash; are used in the Six-County <Col N="639" /> area to bludgeon and intimidate the nationalist population.</P>
      <P>What is happening here?  Here, young men who go to the help of the nationalist population in the Six Counties are described as misguided, as fine young courageous men who are misguided. The same type of young men in the Six Counties are called thugs, murderers and are interned in Belfast. Here the same type of young men are described as misguided and courageous and are interned in the Curragh.  Work that out for yourself.  They are described here as misguided young men, but we are taking the same action as the British Government are taking through their puppet in Stormont.  The British Government call them thugs and murderers and lock them up, put them out of action, keep them out of circulation, put the barbed wire on them.  Here, we take exactly the same action and, if we do, we must think of them along the very same lines as those on which the British forces think of them in the Six Counties.  We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot have the idea that they are just misguided young men and yet clamp down on them with the same iron fist and impose the same penalties as the British impose in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>It is worse than that.  Not alone are we locking them up, not alone do we call them misguided and intern them, but the nationalists who may from time to time come across here are sent back or handed back across the Border to the British occupation forces.  I want the Minister to deny that.  I want the Minister to deny that high level conferences have taken place frequently, on the Border and elsewhere, between the Special Branch officers here in the police and their opposite numbers in the Six Counties in connection with the method of apprehending young men on both sides of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officially there is no such thing in operation as extradition as far as the Six Counties is concerned but we have extradition going on behind the scenes quietly, persistently and in a sinister manner.  I do not know whether it is going on with Government approval or <Col N="640" /> not but it is hard for me to believe that such collaboration could obtain between the occupation forces in the Six Counties and the Special Branch here without the Government knowing it.</P>
    <P>Let me give a few examples.  I am quoting now from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of September 10th.  The heading is: &ldquo;Gardaí Release Men Detained at Drogheda&rdquo; and it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Three men taken into custody by detectives on Sunday during a raid on a farmhouse near Dunleer, County Louth, were released yesterday. The men, believed to have addresses in County Armagh, had been detained at Drogheda Garda Station.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Earlier it was reported that in a hayshed adjoining the farmhouse the police found four machine guns, a number of rifles and a quantity of assorted ammunition together with a quantity of gelignite and some detonators and coils of fuse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was on September 10th, 1957, and in spite of the fact that all that ammunition and rifles and machine guns were found the three young men were released.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that so far as the Offences Against the State Act, Part II, is concerned it involves internment, and I am giving reasons why the Government found it necessary to intern these young men and why these young men are interned. On the 11th September, the following day, the <i>Irish Independent</i> states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Three youths who were released by the Gardaí after being captured in a raid on a house in Dunleer, County Louth, were detained by the R.U.C. when they crossed the Border...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How did it come about that they were released when found on this side of the Border with machine guns and ammunition and were arrested when they crossed the Border?  What happened? They were taken to the Border and released at the Border and grabbed at <Col N="641" /> the far side of the Border within two minutes by the representatives of the British armed forces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing, Sir, with young men who should be, if the Government are sticking to the provisions of Part II of the Offences Against the State Act, interned down here rather than up there and I want to point out that this internment is on the wrong side so far as the Government here is concerned.  I shall have to get over the particular problem you have raised.</P>
      <P>To treat another aspect of this, we shall have to go back to the Forkhill ambush on July 5th. Mr. C.W. Armstrong, Conservative M.P. for Armagh, asked a question in the House of Commons on July 10th, 1957, in connection with the ambush at Forkhill and the Prime Minister replying said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It has been established by the R.U.C. that persons concerned in the ambush escaped into Republican territory.  In view of this, the British Ambassador in Dublin has already taken the matter up with the Government of the Republic which equally deplore the incident and are doing all they can to trace the culprits.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is that not co-operation?</P>
      <P>I shall give one final example.  I have personally seen the reward notices posted by the forces in the Six Counties acting on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, notices ranging up to £1,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give him plenty of time so long as he makes a more detailed and practical statement than he made on this matter before. I should like the Minister to tell us in how many other democratic countries are there provisions in operation such as Part II of the Offences Against the State Act, countries which have such provisions that they can intern their citizens without trial and hold them indefinitely at the whim of the Government? We know that the special courts that were set up in Hungary with a great flourish of trumpets were suspended last week and, according to international newsagencies, ordinary law has come back into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our representatives spent much time both in the Council of Europe and in the United Nations criticising the conditions that obtained in Hungary and the fact that arrest without warrant and detention without trial were possible. <Col N="643" /> These were some of the things that horrified our representatives. They also expressed horror and shock that similar arrangements obtained inside occupied Ireland.  Can it be that the same representatives who expressed horror and shock at conditions inside Hungary and at the fact that internment camps were set up by the French in Algeria will stand over internment camps here in Ireland?</P>
    <P>It is suggested that many of the young men who are interned &mdash; many of them are mature &mdash; have shown disrespect towards our law courts and it is suggested they have nothing but contempt for them.  These men have not the slightest opportunity of pleading their cases properly, unless they go before this tribunal set up by the Minister. If anybody has disrespect for the law, I would suggest with great respect that it is not the men interned by the Government but the Government themselves. Not alone have they shown disrespect for the law but they have also shown disrespect and disregard for the international conventions they have signed.  They even showed disrespect recently when a <i>habeas corpus</i> application in respect of one Gearoid Lawless came up in the High Court. The President of the court, speaking for himself, said he thought the Government, through the Attorney-General, was acting towards the court in a highhanded manner.  How then can it be suggested that young men have disrespect for the court when the Government themselves have shown such disrespect for the High Court?</P>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House any longer.  There are some matters which I will leave unsaid at this stage and hope that the opportunity to refer to them will arise at a later stage.  I will conclude my remarks by again calling on the Government to leave this matter to a free vote of the House.  I do not know whether or not my words in this regard are falling on deaf ears. The people outside are becoming very cynical of the fact that many Deputies outside the House have expressed themselves as being in sympathy with certain viewpoints but when they came into the House voted in exactly the <Col N="644" /> opposite way to their former expressed views.  This should be left to the conscience of each individual Deputy and the Party Whip should not be put on at this stage.  There are Deputies who like to shelter under the Party Whip. I would prefer to leave it to each individual Deputy to stand on his own feet, make up his own mind and say whether he is prepared to prove by his vote that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish formally to second the motion and I reserve the right to speak later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that Deputy McQuillan did not want to have a very explicit statement made in regard to the wide, rambling charges he has registered in the course of his speech.  He has been talking now for two and a quarter hours.  The debate, I understand, continues for only three hours and the Deputy has the right to reply at the conclusion of the debate.  He has talked for two and a quarter hours and he expects me in half an hour to discuss all the statements and the wild charges he has levelled against the former Government and this Government.</P>
      <P>The Deputy tried to win some sympathy from the inter-Party Government group by telling the House that at least that Government never interned prisoners, that they only imprisoned them after trial.  May I point out that on 21st March last the Deputy had this motion down in his name and in the name of Deputy Finucane:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that the Government should forthwith release from custody members of Dáil Éireann who are imprisoned and others persons imprisoned under the Offences Against the State Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that occasion, he was as strongly against the imprisonment of these people who had been committing these illegal acts as he is against their internment to-day.  It is a measure of the sincerity he has displayed this evening and of the disgusting manner in which he acted here two weeks ago when he came into the House and <Col N="645" /> charged the Ceann Comhairle, the Clerk of the Dáil or myself with interfering with his original motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, with due respect to the Minister, this position was clarified.  There was no attempt made and there is no record that I suggested the Minister tried to interfere with the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Ceann Comhairle had to send for the original document in order to prove that it was not interfered with and was in the form in which it was handed in.  When the Deputy himself altered his own motion to include internment, I agreed to accept the altered motion and to allow him discuss it as if it were his original motion.  It was only when he came into the House and made the charge against the Ceann Comhairle, the Clerk of the Dáil and myself that I refused to continue with the discussion.  I then insisted that the motion go down to the bottom of the list.  Now, by some other form of intrigue, he has managed to push down six or seven other motions and get this motion brought up to the front in order that he could talk for two and a quarter hours on the subject and prevent me and other members of the House anxious to speak from stating their side of the case.</P>
      <P>I shall not follow the Deputy down the maze of intricate passages into which he tried to lead me and lose me, if I were foolish enough to follow him. I propose to deal with this case by the production of cold, hard, unanswerable facts.  The Deputy's charges in respect of this Government and the previous Government, with regard to taking orders from an alien Government outside the country, are typical of the Deputy, and are about as crude as his manner of dealing with this altered motion.</P>
      <P>To appreciate the reasons for the Government's decision to bring into force the powers of arrest and detention provided for in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940 it is necessary to review the sequence of events which led in July last to the Government's action in making the necessary Proclamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> It will be recalled that on 26th November, 1955, Roslea R.U.C. Barracks was attacked with gunfire and explosives by a number of armed men, one of whom was brought across the Border to die of gunshot wounds. Speaking in the Dáil on the 30th November the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, condemned the raid and appealed to those who were engaged in unlawful activities to give them up.  He went on to say that if his appeal met with no response, the duty of the Government would be clear and he used these words as reported in Volume 153, columns 1349-1350:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We must,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;assert and vindicate the people's right to determine national policy and the right of the Oireachtas and the Government to maintain and to uphold the authority that reposes in them ...We are bound to ensure that unlawful activities of a military character shall cease and we are resolved to use, if necessary, all the powers and forces at our disposal to bring such activities effectively to an end.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking on the same occasion the Leader of the Opposition said that his views and the views of his colleagues were well known and he expressed the hope that the appeal of the Taoiseach would be listened to, that his warning would be heeded, and that those &ldquo;who can influence public opinion will realise fully the direction in which we have been drifting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For some time after the Taoiseach's speech there was a lull in the unlawful activities but events soon showed that this was not because those concerned had seen the folly of their ways but rather because they thought, it prudent to lie low until public opinion, which had been disturbed and alarmed by the Roslea incident, had had time to settle down.</P>
    <P>Early in the new year, 1956, the leaders began again to hold meetings in secret and there was a resumption of the parades and of the drilling in the hills.  Towards the end of January there was a pronouncement by the Hierarchy that no private citizen or group of citizens had the right to bear arms or to use them against another State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> Notwithstanding this, illegal meetings, parades, drilling and training with arms and explosives went on frequently throughout 1956 but it was not until November that any serious incident took place involving the use of firearms or explosives.  In that month, several British customs huts on the Border were blown up.  A month later, a series of armed attacks were made on R.U.C. barracks and military posts in the Six Counties, in the course of which several persons were injured and there was serious destruction of property.  On our side of the Border the Gardaí made a number of arrests and seized a quantity of arms. Those arrested were prosecuted and those convicted received prison sentences.</P>
    <P>On 6th January, 1957, there was a broadcast by the Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, who referred to the deaths of three young Irishmen in the course of attacks on R.U.C. barracks some days earlier.  In the course of his broadcast he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The consequences that would follow a continuance of these attacks must now be clear to the whole nation.  So far as they are directed from within the territory under our jurisdiction, it is the duty of the Government of this State to prevent their continuance.  That duty we are resolved to perform.</P>
    <P>No Irish Government could permit the rich achievements of past generations to be squandered in the hands of ruthless or reckless men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Still, the cross-Border campaign of violence continued.  In addition, the explosives magazine at Moortown, Co. Dublin, was forcibly entered and a large quantity of explosives was stolen. Whenever possible, the Gardai made arrests, preferred charges in court and secured convictions, but it was not found possible to identify individual members of the organisation with the acts of violence and any charges preferred were necessarily limited to offences such as refusing to answer police questions as to their movements, which carry sentences of imprisonment not exceeding six months. <Col N="648" /> Documents, which were produced in evidence in court, reveal the very widespread nature of the conspiracy. Efforts have been made to intimidate the courts and, as my predecessor will recall, one of the justices has been threatened.</P>
    <P>When the present Government came into office on 20th March there were 53 offences-against-the-State prisoners under sentence in Mountjoy Prison.  Six days later, as Minister for Justice, I replied in the Dáil to a speech of Deputy McQuillan who had urged the release of all the offences-against-the-State prisoners, and said in the course of my reply as reported in Volume 161, columns 98-102:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There can be only one Army in the State and that shall be the Army established by this Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Does the Deputy want this Government or any Government to sit down and do nothing?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I then appealed to the Deputy to use his influence to convince the people on behalf of whom he was speaking of the futility of these actions they were taking at the present time.  And I went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As far as this Government is concerned, it will be our task to see that peace is preserved and I will endeavour to share in the responsibility of ensuring that that is done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From December, 1956, to 1st July, 103 men had been committed by the courts to serve terms of imprisonment ranging from 14 days up to six months, for offences against the State or the unlawful possession of firearms.  Forty-one of these men had served their sentences, however, and were again at large and most of them were known to be engaged in preparations to resume their activities.  The 62 men still in prison were due for release within a comparatively short period.</P>
    <P>On 4th July an armed attack was made on an R.U.C. patrol in South Armagh and a police constable was killed and another wounded.  On the same night a number of police huts in Tyrone and Fermanagh were destroyed by explosives.  In this week, too, a number of men who had been returned <Col N="649" /> for trial on charges of armed robbery from an explosives store in County Laois were acquitted in the Dublin Circuit Court, several witnesses who had identified them both to the police and at the preliminary hearing in the District Court, having gone back on their identification when the case came for trial.</P>
    <P>These civilian witnesses were intimidated from giving evidence: during the District Court proceedings an organised mob demonstrated outside the court precincts and when the court recessed for lunch the witnesses asked the Gardaí to have food brought into them as they said they were afraid to leave the building; some time later, before the case came for trial, these witnesses were visited in their homes by members of the organisation and were given &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; advice.</P>
    <P>It was in these circumstances that, on 5th July, the Government made a Proclamation bringing into force the powers of arrest and detention provided in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940.  On the following day the Gardaí arrested 11 leaders of the so-called I.R.A., including the so-called Chief of Staff, the so-called Adjutant-General and members of what they themselves describe as the &ldquo;Army Council&rdquo; who were assembled in a Dublin premises under cover of a meeting of the executive of Sinn Féin, a movement which while professing to be constitutional, describes itself as the &ldquo;civil arm&rdquo; to the military body of the &ldquo;Republican Movement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 25th July, the Taoiseach made a Press statement as to the reasons for the Government action.  He stated once more, clearly and unequivocally, that there could be no tolerance in the community of groups which arrogated to themselves the right to make war at will in defiance of the legitimate Government and the basic law.  He went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Those against whom the Irish Government have had recently to take action were leading members of such groups, the activities of which had already led to loss of life and <Col N="650" /> were likely, if continued, to embroil our people not only in war with another country but in a hateful civil war as well...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In August, a printed document, in poster size, headed &ldquo;I.R.A. Manifesto&rdquo; was issued by, as it said, the &ldquo;Army Council Irish Republican Army.&rdquo;  It denied the right of the elected representatives of Dáil Éireann to proceed against them and said that their activities would go on.  In August, also, in a case involving the use of firearms, two civilian witnesses who were in a position to identify those concerned informed the police that they were afraid to get involved with any member of the organisation and the criminal proceedings would have failed were it not for the evidence of a police witness.  By September close on 200 outrages involving the use of firearms or explosives had occurred across the Border.</P>
    <P>The motion before the Dáil asks that all those persons interned under the Offences Against the State Act be released forthwith.</P>
    <P>There are 125 persons in custody in the Curragh Detention Camp and of them 73 were convicted by the courts and imprisoned earlier in the year.  The motion makes a specific reference to the release of the Sinn Féin Deputy in detention.  I see no reason for singling him out.  He is in detention, as are all the others, because it is necessary in the interests of the security of the State.  As it happens he was one of a group arrested near the Border last December and his detention took place at the expiration of sentences of imprisonment for offences which included possession of incriminating documents and ammunition.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in the minds of the police that if these men in detention were set free they would resume their activities.  Are we to release them and stand idly by while they plan and carry out armed raids resulting in loss of life and destruction of property and in activities likely to embroil our people not only in war with another country but in a possible civil war as well?</P>
    <P>The position is that the limited measures which could be taken under <Col N="651" /> ordinary law did not succeed in stopping the armed conspiracies, the use of explosives, the widespread destruction of property, and the injury to and loss of life.  Proceedings in the courts were held in an atmosphere of tension, and, as I have already mentioned, civilian witnesses were intimidated from giving evidence.  The warnings by the Government and the pronouncement of the Hierarchy had not the desired effect.  The short sentences of imprisonment did not appear to be a deterrent as, on release, most of those concerned resumed their plotting and their training in arms preparatory to a new offensive in the fall of the year. They made no secret of their intentions: they went so far as to publish in August what they describe as an &ldquo;I.R.A. Manifesto&rdquo; in which they pledged themselves to continue their activities.</P>
    <P>In case any Deputy is not aware of the safeguards against error in the issue of detention orders, the position is that every detained person has the right of appeal to a commission which consists of a judge of the Circuit Court, a justice of the District Court and a senior Army officer.  And if the commission decides that there are no reasonable grounds for his continued detention he is set free.  Moreover, the Government have already made it known to each interned person, and in public statements, that no person will be kept in detention who undertakes to respect the Constitution and the laws and to refrain from being a member of or assisting any unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>In view of what I have said, does Deputy McQuillan, or any other Deputy, think that these men should be released from internment to carry on a so-called war which might well end in the loss of liberty that exists in this part of the country to-day?  Will Deputy McQuillan not realise that these men refuse to recognise the Parliament and the Constitution which he himself accepts?  Surely, he realises that over 1,000,000 voters acting as the freest possible agents elected 143 Deputies who were prepared to legislate for the people through the medium of the Oireachtas.  Such a vote of the <Col N="652" /> electorate in favour of constitutional methods ought to be a convincing argument and worthy of recognition.  The persons on whose behalf the Deputy speaks refuse to recognise the fact that the people by their votes have clearly shown that they wish to live in peace and harmony and that they are not in favour of waging illicit war on our fellow countrymen.  These men are pledged to destroy the institutions which govern this State.  They describe this Parliament as a puppet Parliament taking its orders from a foreign source.  I need hardly say that only people whose minds are completely warped would give thought to such an idea.</P>
    <P>This Government, as well as this Parliament, has been elected in accordance with the Constitution which is the fundamental law of this State.  And speaking for the Government, I can say that as long as we hold the responsibility of office we will govern with firmness and in the full knowledge that we are acting in the best interest of the vast majority of our people who are not prepared to give sanction to the methods which are being used by this illegal organisation at the present time.  As everybody knows the Government and the Members of this House are every bit as anxious for the reunification of our nation as those who are referred to in the Deputy's motion.</P>
    <P>In concluding, I wish to say that there is no question, of course, of using the powers of detention as a substitute for trial by court.  In any case in which the police can get evidence court proceedings will follow.  But as everyone knows it is in the nature of a conspiracy of this kind that evidence is very difficult to get.</P>
    <P>The names of the leaders are known to many, but legal proof that they are the leaders is impossible to obtain.  It is no doubt a pity that internment should be necessary at all, but the only way in which individual liberty can be defended in the long run is by defending the institutions of the State and, if these institutions can be defended in no other way than by internment of those who attack them with violence, then we have no choice but to take that way.  I can promise that <Col N="653" /> the Gardaí will continue their efforts to eliminate the dangers which these activities, if not checked, are likely to produce.  I wish to assure the House that the policy which operates at the moment will continue until those people allow reason and understanding to replace hatred and violence.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to refute some of the statements which the Deputy has made with regard to the conditions which he says exist in the internment camp at the Curragh. The conditions in the internment camp at the Curragh are such that the cubic footage allowed to the ordinary soldier is exceeded by the cubic feet allowance given to the prisoners in respect to the huts within which they live, so that from that point of view there is no question, good, bad or indifferent, of overcrowded conditions or of conditions which would not meet with the requirements of any health authority.  Adequate supplies of fuel are made available for the heating of the huts which are equipped with stoves.</P>
    <P>Since the camp was opened in July List many improvements have been effected.  The three huts in which the men are housed have been reroofed and the walls sheeted internally. Porches have been erected inside doors where considered necessary to prevent draughts.  Lighting has been improved by the provision of additional lamps and the repositioning of the existing ones to meet the requirements of the prisoners.  Electric plugs have been installed in each hut to facilitate the boiling of water and such things within the huts and the men have provided themselves with the necessary equipment.  All three huts have flush toilets installed within the precincts of the huts so as to avoid any question of the men having to go out in inclement weather or at night.  Lignatex tops have been provided for the dining tables.</P>
    <P>In regard to sleeping conditions, for security reasons cubicles cannot be piovided and the men sleep in dormitory-like conditions similar to those in which serving soldiers sleep. <Col N="654" /> They have the same sleeping accommodation as that provided for the serving soldiers of this country.  Each bed is equipped with three blankets &mdash; four in the winter period&mdash;two sheets and one pillow.  Each man is supplied with a wooden locker.  Under the detention regulations the commandant is required to pay attention to the ventilation, drainage and sanitary condition of the camp and to take such measures as may be necessary for their being maintained.  It is the custom that detention camps should be kept clean by the detained persons themselves.  The necessary brushes and materials are supplied and the men are maintaining a high standard of cleanliness in their huts.  Apart from the toilets attached to the huts, outdoor toilets are also available.</P>
    <P>In regard to ablution and laundering facilities, separate huts are provided in the camp for washing and laundering.  The soap ration for laundering was recently increased. Several defects reported were rectified and some improvements effected.  Hot pipes were installed in the laundry and extra mirrors supplied for the washroom.  Three sets of hair-cutting equipment have been supplied and the men wash their own clothing and do their own haircutting.</P>
    <P>As prescribed in the detention regulations, the diet is as laid down for men of the permanent forces with the addition of a supper ration of bread, butter, tea, sugar and milk. The food which is inspected regularly by the medical officer is cooked by Army cooks and there have not been any complaints as regards the quality of the food or the way it is cooked.  A mobile canteen at which the men may purchase an assortment of foods visits the camp each day.  They also receive food parcels from outside.</P>

      <P>Additional foodstuffs may be issued for health reasons on medical certificates.  In regard to clothing and footwear, the detention regulations provide that the detained persons shall be allowed to wear their own clothing and that supplies of necessary clothing by friends shall be permitted.  The men's needs in clothing and footwear are under constant review by Army medical officers and are met as they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to recreational facilities, the men are permitted to associate and to take exercise daily from 9 a.m. to sundown.  Apart from the outside space where they play netball, a recreation hut is available for reading and for indoor games such as cards, chess, draughts, darts and rings. Blackboards and chalk are supplied and classes are held by the men in Irish, journalism and electricity. Hobbies, such as rug-making, are conducted individually and it is understood that a dramatic class is being organised.  Leather work classes are in operation and steps are being taken to provide facilities for wood working classes.  The men are at present considering the conditions on <Col N="656" /> which they would be prepared to operate a sub-library if that could be arranged.  The detention regulations permit the supply from outside of books, newspapers and stationery.</P>
    <P>The health of the men is under constant supervision by Army medical officers.  Facilities are provided for medical, dental and optical treatment and, where necessary, for hospitalisation. An Army medical officer, who is an eye specialist, has visited the camp and dealt with any urgent cases.  His recommendations in the case of others are under consideration.  The question of the provision of dentures, spectacles and surgical appliances where recommended by the medical officer as being necessary is receiving consideration.</P>

      <P>The detention regulations require the commandant to carry into effect, as far as practicable, the written recommendations of the medical officer for the alteration of the discipline or treatment of any detained person or for the supply of any additional articles to any detained person on medical grounds.  The number who have been admitted to hospital and received treatment is seven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Religious welfare is looked after in a manner which meets all the necessary requirements.  The men are allowed to write one letter per week and the commandant has discretion to allow more.  There is no limitation on the number of letters received.  Under the Detention Regulations, a detained person may (a) receive one visit per month from relatives, (b) at the discretion of the Adjutant-General receive additional visits from relatives and may also receive visits from legal practitioners, and (c) at the discretion of the Minister for Defence receive visits from other persons. These provisions are being generously applied.  No application for additional visits from relatives has been turned down.  All applications for visits from legal practitioners have been granted except two applications for visits from a particular solicitor which, for security reasons, were not allowed.  Subject to security considerations no <Col N="657" /> genuine and reasonable case under category (c) is refused.</P>
    <P>I want to say, in reply to the Deputy, that a hut has been erected outside the outer gate where intending visitors can wait their turn to see internees. This hut is newly painted, is heated by a stove and provided with forms.  It accommodates 20 people approximately. There are two permanent visitors' rooms which have been redecorated and fitted with tables, lignatex topped, and chairs.  In addition when there is a rush of visitors the C.O.'s office and detail room are used for the purpose.  The duration of visits varies from a half hour to an hour according to the numbers waiting.</P>

      <P>It would be quite impossible for me, in the five minutes left before the Adjournment, to explain the attitude of my Party, which I am authorised by them to give to the House.  I regard this motion of Deputy McQuillan as one highly dangerous to the national interest, not so much from the point of view of its form or what it seeks to achieve as from some of the extremely dangerous doctrines which the Deputy has expressed and the strange phrases he made use of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan asked for a free vote of the House.  I am authorised by the Fine Gael Party to tell the House that they are voting against this motion.  That is not being done by Party Whip; it is being done as a united Party giving expression to an <Col N="659" /> opinion that they feel absolutely essential in the national interest.  One of the most urgent requirements in the present state of affairs of the country is that public opinion should be properly educated to the issue involved in the maintenance of order by whatsoever Government has the responsibility for maintaining law and order. I suppose it could be said, in the ultimate and last analysis, that we, certainly the Fine Gael and Labour Parties and those Independent Deputies who supported us, are on this side of the House in opposition because of the manner in which we treated the matter of the I.R.A.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for anything done by me and my colleagues during our term of office, the duties of which we fulfilled in accordance with our consciences and in accordance with what we believed right, proper and just.  The present Government sought for and obtained in the last general election, a clear and unmistakable mandate to deal with the problem of the I.R.A. There was no doubt that was one of the issues put forward strongly in the course of the general election.  We were deprived of our position as Government by the Clann na Poblachta Party because of our treatment of the I.R.A. We were criticised by members of the present Government because we had not been &ldquo;tough&rdquo; enough with the I.R.A. One of the members of the present Government, at present occupying a very responsible position in the Government, criticised me in my own constituency for the manner in which we had dealt with the problem of the I.R.A.</P>
    <P>The present Government has received a clear mandate from the people; it is their responsibility, their full responsibility, and we certainly feel that we should take no action which would give comfort to the men whom we regard as engaged in illegal activities, contrary to the law of God and of man.  Whether we agree or disagree with the policy of internment, as followed by the Government, we feel we are bound to give them the support necessary for them in the interests of order in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> Deputy McQuillan in the course of his observations did say that these men were interned because the only crime that they committed was that they wanted to unite this country.  It is essential that the people realise to the full that the crime they are committing is not that of uniting the country but something contrary to the law of God and of man and has so been declared by the authoritative voice of the Church and of the people and of this Parliament.  Deputy McQuillan said we were intimidated by something he called an ultimatum by the British Government.  I made it clear, in the speech referred to by the Minister, on the 30th November, 1955, that we were not going to be intimidated by the I.R.A., as they called themselves at that time.  But I did give them the opportunity, having explained the issue at stake for the country, of mending their ways.</P>
    <P>We were accused of flabbiness and of treating them with kid gloves. There was the most solemn announcement by me in the Dáil at that time that we were appealing to them in the interests of the country to cease their activities.  Then, in the course of the few sentences immediately preceding the quotation given by the Minister for Justice, I said that if my appeal to the members of the organisation concerned met with no response, then the duty of the Government was clear, but I did give them that opportunity and they did not take it.</P>

      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins has given notice that he wishes to raise the subject matter of Question No. 138 on the Order Paper of the 30th October, 1957.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice of my intention to raise on the Adjournment to-night the subject matter of a reply by the Minister for Defence to a Parliamentary Question which I raised last Wednesday.  I asked the Minister last Wednesday why <Col N="661" /> members of the Army were not permitted to render appropriate military honours to the memory of the late General Michael Collins and the late President Arthur Griffith at ceremonies held for this purpose last August at Dublin and Béal-na-Bláth.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his reply stated that in order to avoid the difficulties involved in selecting individual anniversaries in commemorating which the State might participate, a special day, Easter Sunday, had been set apart on which the State celebrated the securing of independence and honoured all who took part in the struggle to achieve it.  It is a matter of regret that now, 35 years after the foundation of this State, it is necessary that a member of this Parliament should register a protest with regard to the manner in which those at present in authority respect the honour and the memory of the twin architects of this Parliament and of this State.</P>
      <P>The late President Arthur Griffith was the founder of Sinn Féin.  It is to him that the movement which led inevitably to the foundation of this State will be attributed by the historians of our people.  Arthur Griffith was the first head of the Government here.  A man who by reason of his service to Ireland and by reason of his contribution to the foundation of this Parliament and to the formation of the Government of which the Minister is now a member, is surely a person whose memory should be revered by our State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General Michael Collins was the leader of the fight for Irish freedom, a man whose name was feared and dreaded by British forces and a man whose name was a by-word in every Irish house throughout the War of Independence.  He was also the founder of the Irish Army and its first Commander-in-Chief.  For some years, the Irish Army have paraded with full ceremonial to pay an official tribute to the memories of Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins.  They did so wearing the same uniform as Michael Collins wore when he died in action at Béal-na-Bláth in 1922.  They did so as soldiers in the Army of a sovereign <Col N="662" /> State and as soldiers in an Army paying tribute to its first Commander-in-Chief.</P>
    <P>It was, therefore, with some concern that the Irish people learned last August that this year the Irish Army would not be permitted to attend the ceremonies in Glasnevin, ceremonies which have been carried on each year for over 30 years, and the ceremonies in Béal-na-Bláth, and pay an official tribute to the memory of both these great men.</P>
    <P>It was further a matter of concern for the people to learn that the Dublin Brigade of the I.R.A., who were in charge of the Dublin ceremonies, had been notified by the Department of Defence that if they availed of the services of Army buglers and drummers at the commemoration ceremonies, the personnel engaged must wear civilian clothes.  Those circumstances, coming to light last August, undoubtedly created a very deep feeling of indignation amongst the people of this country.</P>
    <P>Our people could not forget that last year in County Wexford, properly and rightly, the Irish Army paraded to pay tribute to the memory of an Irishman who founded the great Navy of the United States, nor could they overlook the fact that this year the Irish Army paraded again with full ceremonial to pay tribute to the memory of an Irishman who founded the Navy of the Argentine Republic.  But here, at home, the Irish Army was prohibited by deliberate action from honouring the memory of its founder and Commander-in-Chief, and I must attribute that action to the Minister, though I believe that, while his may have been the ultimate say, it was not the responsible voice.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that for a moment.  The Minister is a young lad and it was his boss who spoke.  Here, at home, our Army was not permitted to honour the memory of its founder and Commander-in-Chief. It is regrettable that this matter should have to be raised here, but I would feel it wrong if some voice were not raised in protest against such action.  The man who decided that the young Irish soldier, wearing the uniform of Ireland's Army, could not participate in honouring the memory of the first President of this State and the founder of Ireland's Army is the man who seeks to perpetuate bitterness and keep our people divided.</P>
      <P>Why is it necessary to denigrate men like Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins?  Why is it that we must honour in Ireland only Irishmen who have served elsewhere?  Why must we never pay due and proper tribute to the men whose valour and courage and determination made it possible for all of us here in this Parliament to breathe the air of freedom?  Why, at a time when the young men of Ireland are being fooled into joining illegal and treasonable forces, should the Government fail to respect, properly and adequately, the men who founded the lawful forces of this State?  Is it any wonder these young lads, who to-day are joining illegal forces, think their course right when the elected Government, through its head and through its Minister for Defence, prevents the lawful Army of the country from adequately and properly honouring the men who founded it, inspired it and protected it in times of difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said in his reply to-day that the reason the Army was not permitted this year to attend these ceremonies was the difficulty in selecting particular commemoration ceremonies. Now, whether or not the Minister agrees with me, and no matter what <Col N="664" /> other members of the Government may think, the place held by Collins and Griffith in the memories and affections of the Irish people can never be diminished: they will be writ in Irish history as the twin architects of the State that we all honour now.</P>
    <P>In 1954, in 1955, and in 1956, the soldiers of Ireland's Army paraded with due military ceremony at Glasnevin cemetery and at Béal-na-Bláth and there on every occasion they rendered an Army's tribute to the memory of both these soldiers.  I never heard anyone question the propriety of their doing so; I never heard it suggested that they were doing less than right in memory of these two great patriots. I wonder why it was that, this year, without any previous warning, it should have been found difficult to select these two ceremonies for due military honour?  Both in Glasnevin cemetery and at Béal-na-Bláth, it is a heartening thing that one can record that many of those who attended the ceremonies last year and in previous years were men who differed politically from both Griffith and Collins, men who took a different stand in the unfortunate Civil War of 35 years ago, but nevertheless men who came to pay a soldier's tribute to the memory of both these men.  I know, and I am certain the Minister knows, that the most serious condemnation of the Taoiseach's and the Minister's prohibition this year came from those who took a different side from Collins in 1922.</P>

Might I suggest to the Minister that he should take my raising this matter here to-night not as intending any perpetuation of the differences of the past, but as a sincere effort on my part to ensure that next year, both at Glasnevin and at Béal-na-Bláth, the Irish Army under his ordinance, if he should still be in office, will parade with full ceremonial to pay a well-deserved tribute to the memories of Griffith and of Collins?</P>

      <P>I find difficulty in understanding why, first of all, this question should have been put down and, secondly, why it should have been considered necessary or desirable to raise it on the Adjournment.  The answer to the question was perfectly clear; the reasons which were stated there for this decision were perfectly clear and such as would, in my opinion, be considered entirely justifiable by any reasonable person.  Before the question was put down at all, the reasons which prompted my decision to revert to the original procedure in these matters had been made quite clear by the Taoiseach in a letter which was published in the papers.  The decision was taken for those reasons which were given there and no other reasons.  The reply stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In order to avoid the difficulties involved in selecting individual anniversaries in commemorating which the State might participate, a special day, Easter Sunday, has been set apart on which the State celebrates the securing of independence and honours all who took part in the struggle to achieve it.  This is, of course, apart from the annual State commemoration at Arbour Hill for those who died in 1916.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances the Army did not officially take part in the ceremonies referred to by the Deputy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins concluded his remarks to-night by stating that it was not his purpose to arouse old bitternesses. I cannot see what other purpose he could have hoped to serve. It was to avoid the necessity of making selections that the previous Fianna Fáil Government decided to set aside the one day for commemorating all these events and all these anniversaries that it would be considered desirable to commemorate.  It must be obvious to everybody that there are very many men who died during the period from 1916 up to 1923 whom it would be considered by different groups desirable to commemorate, and there is an obvious difficulty in making choices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, this was a proposal to <Col N="666" /> commemorate the date, 22nd August. An equally strong case could be made for the commemoration of other dates, for instance, the 8th December.  We did not want to have to make invidious distinctions and so we came to what I think was a very wise and prudent decision, to set aside the one date to which there could be no objection, namely, Easter Sunday, commemorating all who died in the struggle for independence.</P>

      <P>I believe it was my duty to try to keep politics out of the Army.  Deputy O'Higgins has tried to give the impression that the Army always attended these celebrations.  In fact, as he well knows, that is not the position at all.  This idea of the Army <Col N="667" /> attending these celebrations was first introduced in 1948.  It had never been the position prior to that that the Army took part officially in these commemoration ceremonies.  I cannot see what other reason there could have been for this changing of the policy in this respect in 1948, if it was not the desire of the then Government to reintroduce these bitternesses to which Deputy O'Higgins has referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which would be likely to have that effect.  The Deputy has stated that there was only one founder of the National Army.  I understood that it was always contended that this Army was the successor to the Army that fought throughout the struggle for Independence.  Is it now Deputy O'Higgins's contention that there was a new Army formed in 1922 <Col N="668" /> which was founded by Michael Collins? He stated there was no previous warning that this was likely to happen for this year, but I would remind him that, on the change of Government in 1951, the position that obtained prior to 1948 was reverted to.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to follow all the Deputy's remarks because if I did, I would only be helping him in his apparent objective of reopening old sores.  I can only state that the sole reason for taking the decision to revert to the original position was that we considered that the decision come to originally to commemorate all these men who gave their lives in that struggle by one ceremony in which the Army would participate was the wisest one in the circumstances.  Anybody who attempts to set up this new idea of commemorating individual anniversaries is, in my opinion, doing a disservice to the Army, first of all, and a disservice to the nation.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I am determined to keep the Army out of politics. Therefore, if we are to ask the Army to take part officially in the commemoration of this anniversary, I certainly could not resist requests for the Army to take part in the commemoration of anniversaries of other men who are equally entitled to be honoured.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of the food items comprising the consumer price index (a) the Dublin average price per unit in mid-February, 1957, (b) the Dublin average price per unit in mid-August, 1957, and (c) the average change per unit in terms of money.</P>

      <P>The following table shows the average retail prices in the Dublin-Dún Laoghaire conurbation of certain items of food in mid-February and mid-August this year and the difference between them.  A few items of food (e.g. tinned salmon) included in the index are not included in the table below because the quotations obtained for them relate to a variety of qualities and any average prices computed would not be meaningful. The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive inquiries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state to the last convenient date the total amount expended on the erection of new hospital accommodation for which a grant was given in whole or in part from the Hospitals Fund; and, in respect of such expenditure, the respective amounts provided from (a) the Hospitals Fund, (b) local authorities, (c) the State, and (d) other sources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Information in the form sought by the Deputy is not readily available.  It would involve detailed and prolonged research of departmental records and files extending over the past 24 years to determine the expenditure which was incurred by way of grants and loans on <Col N="513" /> new hospital works as distinct from reconstruction, adaptation and repair schemes, etc.  In many instances, moreover, details of the amounts raised by hospital promoters (particularly in the case of voluntary hospitals) from sources other than the Local Loans Fund and the Hospitals Trust Fund are not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy, however, that up to the 31st October, 1957, the total grants paid out of the Hospitals Trust Fund for capital purposes amounted to £26,842,165.  The grants were made in respect of hospital capital projects including new construction, reconstruction, adaptation, repairs and the provision of furniture and equipment. It is not possible to say how much of that total was paid from sweepstake sources or from the Exchequer.  Exchequer Grants-in-Aid of the Hospitals Trust Fund amounting to £6,780,000 were paid into the fund and were utilised to meet all charges falling on the fund as they arose, including capital charges, payments in respect of the revenue deficits of voluntary hospitals and miscellaneous purposes and no portion of the Grants-in-Aid were set aside specifically for capital purposes.  The total advances obtained by local authorities from central borrowing sources to meet expenditure on hospital capital projects from 1st August, 1933, following the enactment of the Public Hospitals Act, 1933, up to 31st October, 1957, was £4,557,177.  That figure includes expenditure on county homes but it does not cover amounts raised by local authorities from other sources such as banks and insurance companies.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state to the last convenient date the amount of the Hospitals Fund which has been expended on administration since the inception of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as it is readily ascertainable the amount expended on administration since the establishment of the Hospitals Trust Fund in 1933 <Col N="514" /> up to 31st October, 1957, was £344,815. That sum covers expenditure on the Hospitals Commission and the Hospitals Trust Board and expenditure on staff in the Department of Health who were employed on work connected with the establishment of the three regional sanatoria.  The figure mentioned does not, however, include provision in respect of staff in the Department of Health whose duties are connected with the administration of the Hospitals Trust Fund generally but whose salaries are not a charge on the Hospitals Trust Fund.  Neither does the total include administration expenses incurred by voluntary hospitals, an element of which would be recouped in deficit payments made by way of grants from the fund nor administration expenses incurred by such bodies as the Hospitals Library Council, the Medical Research Council and the National Organisation for Rehabilitation as such expenses are not readily ascertainable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the information required is related to the capital costs incurred in providing bed accommodation.</P>
      <P>Information on the lines requested by the Deputy is not readily available in relation to all hospitals (including voluntary institutions), the cost of which has been met either wholly or partly out of public funds.  Figures are subjoined, however, in relation to the approximate cost per bed in the case of a number of hospital projects which have been completed under the post-war hospitals building programme. It is necessary to emphasise, however, that, owing to substantial differences in the factors governing cost, such as the size, functions, location, date and form of construction, etc. of the various projects, the figures given are not generally comparable with one another.</P>

      <P>Apart from the rates of entertainments duty applicable to cinemas and dances, the information requested by the Deputy is contained in the Customs and Excise Tariff and Tariff Supplement.  In order to <Col N="518" /> facilitate reference to the tariff and supplement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report a statement showing the items in the consumer price index which are subject to customs duty, special import levy or excise duty and the reference numbers in the tariff or supplement applicable to each item.  The statement also contains the rates of entertainments duty applicable to cinemas and dances.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NOTES ON THE TABLES.</P>
    <P>1. The rates of Customs and Excise Duty and Special Import Levy, if any, applicable to the items listed in the table are set out in the Customs and Excise Tariff and Tariff Supplement at the Reference Nos. indicated opposite the various items.</P>
    <P>2. The Reference Nos. quoted indicate all tariff headings at which liability to duty or levy might arise.  In many instances, however, the liability of the article to duty or levy may be conditioned by such factors as the material from which it is made (e.g. Tariff Ref. Nos. 272/12 and 603/01), its method of manufacture (e.g. Tariff Ref. No. 132/5), its value (e.g. Tariff Ref. No. 90/2) or its dimensions and weight (e.g. Tariff Ref. No. 98/5).  Where an article is shown in the table as liable to duty under two or more tariff headings or under two or more sub-heads of a tariff heading, its precise liability cannot be determined without reference to such factors as are mentioned above.</P>
    <P>Where an article would not normally fall within a dutiable category, it has been shown as not dutiable.  Possible liability in such cases, however, has been indicated, where required, in the &ldquo;Observations&rdquo; column of the table. (For example, certain articles of clothing made of knitted wool are not liable to levy.  Accordingly pullovers (wool, sleeveless), woollen vests, etc., have been shown as not liable to levy as they would normally be made of knitted material.)</P>
    <P>3. The duties set out in the Tariff and the Tariff Supplement should be read in conjunction with the General Notes to the Tariff and the Tariff Supplement (pages 14-22 and 1-2 respectively) regarding various general exemptions from duties and levies (including in particular the duty-free licensing provisions), and also in conjunction with the Notes on Individual Customs Duties at pages 132-156 of the Tariff which indicate exemptions, etc., from the scope of particular duties.</P>
    <P>4. The Special Import Levies are in addition to and not in substitution for any ordinary customs duty chargeable under the main tariff.</P>
    <P>5. Package duty (Tariff Ref. No. 166) may also be chargeable in certain cases.  The scope of this duty is indicated at pages 16-17 of the Tariff.</P>
