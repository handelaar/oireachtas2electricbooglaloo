      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 36, to delete &ldquo;the passing of the Act&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1st May, 1923.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We had a fairly considerable discussion on the subject of this amendment on the Committee Stage on Wednesday. I indicated then that I was proposing to repeat the amendment on this stage, partly for the purpose of giving the Minister an opportunity of providing a better excuse than he had the other day for the rejection of it, if he is still of that mind.  I hope that the 48 hours' interval has persuaded the Minister that there is no case whatsoever to be made on any fair basis against this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has considered what he said the other day about the confidential nature of the report on capital for industry, but having read it again myself, I cannot see anything the least bit confidential in it at this stage.  The Minister, in his reply, suggested that the proposal by <Col N="362" /> the Industrial Credit Company that issues of securities to an underwriting house, and then for subsequent sale to the public, should be covered by this section, and that was one of the reasons why he was introducing the section.  I agree with him entirely that they should be covered in legislation but it has been done administratively all along.  While it is desirable that there should be provisions of this sort included in the legislation <i>per se</i> it is no reason to advance for the rejection of this amendment bringing the benefit of this section back to the financial inception of the State.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to go over the ground that we covered the other day. This is not an incentive section.  It is a section that will not improve marketability in any shape or form.  No specific reason is advanced by the Industrial Credit Company for its inclusion. It will have the effect of giving an uncovenanted benefit to certain Irish securities.  There is a case for doing that but the case is for doing it for all Irish securities and not only for a selection of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot add very much to what I said the last day, that the clause put into the 1932 Act was an incentive measure to try and influence people to invest their money in Irish industrial shares, but there were certain restrictions, and it has been found from experience that these restrictions were to a great extent doing away with the benefit that was given in some cases.  Last year, the then Minister removed some of those disabilities&mdash;in particular, the disability in regard to the bonus and rights shares.  I am going further now and clearing the way for all shares issued since 1932, with certain exceptions which I shall mention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not asking the Dáil to approve of including all shares which are quoted on the stock exchange.  As an instance, a company sometimes, when starting business, may get a small group of people to take up shares to start off.  The company succeeds.  They get a quotation in respect of those shares on the stock exchange and they become marketable.  If this clause <Col N="363" /> were not put in, those shares could not get the benefit of the 1932 Act.  We are not going the whole way because it might happen that four or five people would go into a private company with no intention whatever of selling their shares, but might get a stock exchange quotation in order to benefit by this provision.  We are, therefore, putting in the proviso that there must be at least 50 shareholders in the company as well as having the shares quoted on the stock exchange.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment, the point is that it was inserted as an incentive measure in 1932.  In 1956, certain restrictions were removed from the section.  Now I am proposing to remove further restrictions.  Therefore, the clause inserted in 1932 would give the benefit that, generally speaking, we intended to give at that time.  For that reason, I think the Deputy's amendment is not in the spirit of the clause inserted in 1932 because it is not an incentive amendment.  It is, if you like, to reward people for putting their money into Irish industries between 1923 and 1932.  That was not the intention at any time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this section not to reward people who put their money into Irish industry between 1932 and the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is removing some restrictions that were there in 1932.  It will have this benefit: For future issues, it will have the incentive&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no arguing about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might say: &ldquo;Confine it to future issues.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell the House what restrictions he is removing?  He mentioned one about the stock exchange, but none other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only restriction of any importance which we are removing is that where shares were issued by a company.  Sometimes, when a company was starting, shares were issued at a meeting.  One person might say: &ldquo;I will take a thousand shares,&rdquo; and so <Col N="364" /> on, and the company would be started. Then, afterwards, they would like to have their shares quoted on the stock exchange.  They could not reap the benefit of the 1932 Act, as the law stands&mdash;but now they would.  If they get a stock exchange quotation, then the particular lot of shares covered by that stock exchange quotation will reap the benefit of the 1932 Act.  That is a very big change.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman brought in the rights and bonus shares, which was a very big item.  However, it was not an incentive either last year, but for the purpose of removing certain anomalies that existed since 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are removing others. I cannot see that it will be necessary to go further in this direction, although some future Minister may think it desirable to do so.</P>
      <P>The only other point covered here is the holding company.  I think that is a fairly obvious case.  A holding company might have a big share capital and might start a subsidiary company in line with their business.  In that case, the shares of the holding company would not be disqualified from the benefit.</P>
      <P>The other change to which I referred already, and of which the Deputy approved, is that these shares will be certified by the Revenue Commissioners and not by the Minister for Finance. As the Deputy knows, the Minister for Finance was not able to question the recommendation of the commissioners in the past.  Therefore, it was only a matter of form that the Minister should sign it.  It would be better to put the onus completely on the Revenue Commissioners in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am completely flabbergasted by the Minister.  This is the first time in the history of this State, to my knowledge, that a Minister has come here and made the brazen case that public moneys should be given purely on political grounds&mdash; public concessions.  There is not any other case at all.  The Minister has stripped himself of any shred of respectability for this clause.  He talks of the <Col N="365" /> removal of restrictions.  He is removing no restrictions in respect of any genuine issue made since 1932.  We all know that shares were alloted on the basis of offers for sale, that that was dealt with administratively and that the section does not in any way affect it.</P>
      <P>The Minister purported to refer to the holding companies, sub-section (5). That sub-section is not in the same position as sub-section (1).  It is not being written into the Act because this Act is for the future.  It is an excellent amendment for the future. There is no incentive whatsoever in this section as it is at present.  The reason it is being done is to make a certain section of Irish securities more valuable.  If any Irish securities are to be made more valuable, it is monstrous that the Minister should frame his Bill on the political basis that the beginning and end of the world, so far as we are concerned, happened in 1932 when Fianna Fáil came into office.  I think this is the first time that that type of political approach has been introduced into a Finance Bill.  I sincerely hope it will be the last.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and negatived.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take Final Stage to-day.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last night, I was criticising the Fianna Fáil Party for making the farmers the plaything of politics, particularly prior to the last general election. We have the fruits of that campaign now.  The farmers are the persons who will realise they were deceived by that campaign, which was waged particularly in respect of wheat prices and milk prices.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party agitated vigorously for an increase in the wheat price to a maximum of 82/6 a barrel. Thousands of farmers were led to believe that, if that Party became the Government, one of their first actions would be to adjust the wheat price and bring it up to a scale where the maximum of 82/6 would be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was put down towards the end of March, before the major portion of the wheat crop was sown, asking the Minister whether he would adjust the scale of prices paid for home-grown wheat.  He replied that an announcement of an increased price would not affect the acreage of wheat <Col N="367" /> to be grown during the present year. Not 10 per cent. of the wheat had been sown on that day, although most of the land had already been ploughed and made ready for the various grain crops.  A great portion of that land was sown in barley.  If the Fianna Fáil Party were in earnest in their desire to increase the wheat acreage, they could have announced an increased price if they considered it would have the effect of increasing the acreage under wheat.  Therefore, the argument that an announcement of the price towards the end of March would not have changed the acreage was not a fair reply or a fair argument.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Government that in August, 1951, an increase of 5/- per barrel was given for wheat. That was long after the crop of 1951 was sown and it was before the harvest of 1951.  We have not yet reached August of 1957 and, if there were any honesty in the Fianna Fáil campaign regarding the wheat prices, which was carried out vigorously amongst so many farmers, particularly in the 12 wheat-growing counties, we should reasonably expect that in this August we could have an announcement of increased prices to be made available to wheat growers in respect of this year's harvest.</P>
    <P>In the answer to the question in March last, it was mentioned that an announcement in good time for the autumn sowing would be made concerning a revised price for wheat.  Any farmer who knows his job will confirm that 90 per cent. of the wheat is sown in the spring&mdash;90 per cent. of the crop is spring wheat, not winter wheat of an autumn sowing.</P>
    <P>We had arguments here on the motion on wheat prices.  One Deputy quoted a price for wheat in Turkey, in Switzerland and in Austria.  Could we imagine the fertile land of Ireland being compared with the sunburnt surface of the Turkish lands or with the snowclad hills and mountains of Switzerland, where the price for home-grown wheat is higher than the price being paid for wheat in this country?</P>
    <P>In any case, the argument has been <Col N="368" /> put by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party in favour of a greater price for wheat than the present price.  It was made an issue in the general election and any farmer who read those speeches or listened to them throughout the country had very good reason to believe that the price of wheat would be increased immediately the change of Government came about.  The Fianna Fáil Party are now on trial in respect of that campaign, in respect of the attitude which they adopted towards the scale of prices existing for home-grown wheat at the present time.</P>
    <P>Now that we have the Fianna Fáil Party sitting on the fence, pretending to take such a very great interest in wheat, we should like to know from them what interest they intend to take in the flour industry.  Do they intend to allow a monopoly to develop, where a lot of the small bakeries are being absorbed by a large monopoly, well known in this country, well known for playing hand in glove with the Fianna Fáil Party?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister responsible for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am about to make is that in the long run it is the farmers who will be subject to this monopoly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a repeat of the speech made last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a very good memory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Even the part about Turkey and Switzerland, which was mentioned again to-day.  Furthermore, Deputy Flanagan said everything that Deputy Rooney has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say this in another way.  The farmers in years to come will find themselves under the control of a monopoly, a monopoly in the flour industry which has become apparent in the last couple of months. The farmers will find themselves growing <Col N="369" /> wheat under contract for that monopoly under terms which will not be as favourable as they are when the farmer has the right to make his own plans for the sale of his own crop in his own way.  They will find their acreage controlled as, indeed, the Fianna Fáil Party intended to control them when they declared at a Cabinet meeting in January, 1954 that the maximum intake target for home-grown wheat would be restricted to 300,000 tons per annum.</P>
      <P>Farmer Deputies know that a fairly good crop of wheat is two tons to the acre.  Therefore, it is apparent from the decision of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet in January, 1954, that they intended to bring down the acreage of wheat in this country to a figure of something over 150,000 acres which would ensure a mill intake of 300,000 tons.  I know the average on some land comes down to nine or ten barrels which would be something over one ton per acre.  In any case, we can take it that it was intended by the Cabinet decision to ensure that the acreage of wheat would be cut down to 150,000 acres and possibly 250,000 acres.  That would tie in with the report furnished by the Fianna Fáil Party in 1946 to the Marshall Aid administration, when they were asked for their agricultural programme.</P>
      <P>In that programme, they indicated that it was intended to reduce the acreage of wheat to an average of approximately 247,000 acres per annum. It was on that basis that the loan was negotiated; it was on that basis the case was made.  Any Deputy who takes the trouble to examine the records will see that figure of 247,000 acres of wheat clearly stated there.  That is the sad story for the wheat growers, so far as the Fianna Fáil agitation and the Fianna Fáil campaign are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said by the Fianna Fáil Party that the farmers were getting a bad price, but they are going to get no better if we are to believe the declaration of March last.  We have reason to hope, however, that their target may be improved if we remember that in August, 1951, when the crop was ripening in the fields, an increase of <Col N="370" /> 5/- per barrel was declared by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>We remember that wheat and milk were the two issues which the Fianna Fáil Party played down to the farmers in the hope of creating discontent amongst them so far as the inter-Party Government was concerned and in the hope of securing support on a promise or insinuation that their terms would be improved if the Fianna Fáil Party were given an opportunity to improve them.  To-day, any of the creamery milk suppliers who are prepared to look ahead can see only a crisis in the dairying industry.  It is staring them in the face.  Any of them who take the trouble of seeing the amount of milk being presented to the creameries for the manufacture of Irish creamery butter can ascertain that this year a surplus of 20,000 tons of butter will be manufactured.</P>
    <P>It will be there for somebody to eat, if they can, but the people of this country cannot eat it.  In the past, they have been eating almost the highest amount of fresh butter per head per week of any country in the world.  That position is going to be changed.  People will switch from the eating of Irish creamery butter to the consumption of margarine or other substitutes for butter.  They will be compelled to do so by reason of the high price, 4/4 per lb. now.  In the meantime and while the consumption of Irish butter is being reduced as a result of the increased price, we have more milk going into the creameries for the manufacture of Irish butter than ever before.</P>
    <P>The creamery milk suppliers are going to see a surplus of at least 20,000 tons of butter this year with nobody able to pay for it or eat it in this country.  We are going to see the ridiculous situation where our butter will be exported to Great Britain, Northern Ireland and elsewhere at approximately 3/- per lb.  We have the situation where Winston Churchill will get a lb. of Irish butter at approximately 3/- and Mary Murphy in Bally-fermot will eat a lb. of butter from the same cow in the same farmyard at 4/4 a lb.</P>

      <P>I shall not refer to it again.  I want to say it is obvious that, at the end of this year, a change must be made concerning the production of Irish creamery butter and the sale of milk to creameries.  Perhaps we could hear from the Minister now what changes are contemplated.  Will we have a situation where we will have to try to sell up to 20,000 tons of surplus butter to the corners of the earth because our own people cannot afford to consume it?  What is being done about increasing the price of milk, a move we heard so much about in this House from Fianna Fáil during 1955 and 1956? At every opportunity in those days, the question of milk prices was raised by them.</P>
      <P>They gave the farmers the Milk Costings Commission.  It remains to be seen now whether that body have been of any service to the farmers&mdash;the commission that cost the taxpayers almost £40,000 over a period of five years.  When that commission was set up, the conditions in relation to milk production were completely different from what they are now.  The inter-Party Government were blamed repeatedly for the delay in the issuing by that commission of their report.  Now, the report has been issued.  Now, Fianna Fáil have had an opportunity of studying it.  Having studied it, what increase in the price of milk do the Government propose to give?  It is a question of how much the Fianna Fáil Government are prepared to add to the price of milk for the benefit of milk suppliers.  It will be a great shock to the suppliers if they find next year or the year after that they may be required to accept a substantial reduction in the price of milk supplied to creameries for the manufacture of butter.</P>
      <P>I want also to refer to the damage being done here by the importation of cattle from Northern Ireland. Hundreds of cattle from the North with punched ears were in the cattle market last Wednesday and in previous weeks.  The cattle trade was seriously affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should realise we are capable of producing large surpluses of various commodities.  At the present time we are able to export only a very limited amount of such surpluses&mdash; mainly live stock on the hoof, some pigs and poultry.  Exporting cattle on the hoof appears to be the most economic way of getting them out of the country and of increasing our trade.  There are many other commodities of which we are capable of producing surplus amounts.  The trouble is to get a market for them.  I suggest that the Minister survey the commodities which we could export at a profit and try to find a market for our surplus production of these commodities.</P>
      <P>It would not matter if it were only cabbages in vast quantities, provided we had a market for our surplus.  We did export large quantities of cabbages and cauliflours during the past 12 months.  However, there is a limited market for that type of produce in Great Britain.  The Minister might also set up an inquiry into the prices of certain types of exportable commodities. If we could get tabulated prices for various commodities, particularly in the countries within striking distance, we could then embark on the production of surpluses of different commodities, whether they be vegetables, live stock or live-stock products. In the field of manufacture the competition would probably be keener but at least in our fertile lands we are capable of producing vast surpluses of various kinds of food, and in most cases we are not able to sell those surpluses in competition on the world market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I inquire what are the Minister's <Col N="375" /> intentions regarding the land project for the coming year?  Does he intend to slow down the scheme until it is hardly working or does he intend to pursue it vigorously?  There are complaints regarding delays in service and in regard to delays in giving approval for the carrying out of work in certain areas.  It remains to be seen whether that is an administrative defect or whether it is Government policy to delay these approvals and delay the pursuance of this scheme in the normal way.</P>
    <P>We should like to be informed whether the payment of grants on hay-sheds will be resumed.  The payment of those grants was discontinued last August but there was an agitation to have them resumed.  Will the Minister say whether he will make arrangements to have the payment of those grants restored and, if so, whether it will have retrospective effect?  Many people would have qualified for the grant if the contractors had taken proper steps to ensure that the necessary application would be in the Department in good time to secure sanction for those grants.</P>
    <P>The sale of wool is greatly to be encouraged nowadays, considering that a bag of wool is now worth about £40 compared with £6 some 20 years ago. There seems to be a very strong demand for wool and it is a very important part of a farmer's economy. Any farmer can now get the best part of £100 for the fleece of just so many more sheep and it is a big part of the economy compared with the old times when it did not pay to shear the wool off the sheep to keep the sheep cool during the summer time.</P>
    <P>Is there any hope of securing an export market for our poultry and poultry products?  We seem to be in a very competitive market there.  There is a system now apparently where they are producing table fowl very rapidly in a mass production, mechanised way, particularly across the water.  I was wondering whether it would be possible to introduce that system on somewhat the same scale here, especially amongst our larger producers in order that we could get into that market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> There is a strong demand, at a competitive price, for table poultry which, as I say, is produced in a different way from the old times.  We are not able to complete in the matter of selling table poultry under the old system.  We have the same position regarding eggs. Not many months ago we noticed that Great Britain was able to export thousands of tons of eggs broken into barrels, so that our prospect of getting a market for eggs over there is not very good.  Possibly, we could go further afield.  We had a fairly good contract, I believe, for the export of eggs to Spain.  Perhaps we could secure a market for eggs in some other countries outside Great Britain.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I should be glad to have his observations regarding our participation in the free trade area, particularly so far as it would affect the agricultural industry. Many farmers are inquiring amongst themselves what would be the best action for the country to take, what safeguards would be necessary.  I am sure this question is engaging the attention of the Minister and the Government at present.  Since the agricultural industry is so important to the country we are anxious that guidance should be given to the farmers in this matter to ensure that they will be able to get into any markets that may be available as a result of the reorganisation of the marketing area which will arise as a result of the free trade area proposals put before this country for consideration.</P>
    <P>A great contribution is being made to agriculture by voluntary educational organisations such as the Young Farmers' Association and the National Farmers' Association, in addition to the Livestock Exporters' Association and the Irish Countrywomen's Association. I believe that closer co-operation and harmony between the Department and these organisations will bring great benefit to the agricultural community.  The agricultural community, who have the fertile lands in their hands, are ready to accept guidance if that guidance will lead them to a market for the surplus produce of their lands.  We must, above all <Col N="377" /> things, concentrate on exporting those surpluses.  Our trading figures are favourable to-day and our trading position has been restored to a satisfactory extent, but that trading position was restored as a result of great sacrifices in 1956.  We can keep our trading position in our favour if we ensure that more and more of our exportable surpluses from the land are marketed abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said in this debate about increased production by the farmers of Ireland but my opinion is that the first step in getting this increased production is to get the market for it.  I am very glad that provision has been made for this.</P>
      <P>There are people who believe that the Irish farmers are not as efficient as they should be but when they have guaranteed markets for their produce, as in the case of wheat and beet, they can be depended upon to produce as much and as well as any other farmers in the world.  Our production of wheat and beet is at least comparable to that of anybody else because we have a guaranteed outlet.  In the case of our meat exports I think if markets were sought, found and maintained, that our grass husbandry which has so much to do with our meat production would improve.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that our grass husbandry is not as good as it should be and one of the chief reasons for that, I think, is that there is not enough security in the production of either beef or milk.  In the case of the beef trade last year farmers were subjected suddenly to a most calamitous slump in prices.  We had no forewarning from the Department or the Minister or anybody else.  In fact, at that time, the then Minister for Agriculture told us that the reason for the drop in price was what the <i>Irish Press</i> published. We know that the reason for last year's drop in cattle prices was that there was a considerable quantity of meat coming in from the Argentine. That was not the Minister's fault or the fault of anybody else.  But the farmers should be forewarned of such things. Not only that but there should be some sort of buffer mechanism to carry the industry over these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> Another point to which I would like to refer concerns grass husbandry and the production of ensilage.  Several Deputies referred to our system of production of milk and beef here yesterday and quite rightly they said it was geared to the summer grass, but if we are to produce milk and beef in the off-season, we shall have to go in for this business of ensiling grass in the period of the year when it is over-plentiful, when store cattle and beef cattle prices tend to fall on the British market.</P>
    <P>The production of grass from the land is higher then than at any other time.  This grass is the best native source of protein we have and there lies its importance.  If this were ensiled, and carried over for the winter, the production of milk in the winter could be carried on to a much more profitable degree.</P>
    <P>The nutrition of milking cows and young stock here leaves a good deal to be desired.  In the winter, farmers who understand the husbandry of root crops and hay, generally have ample supplies of these commodities but where the ration falls down is in the absence of protein.  At present the young beast or the milking cow, or the in-calf cow&mdash;which is worse&mdash;either has to be maintained on very dear American or Egyptian protein or has to do without protein.  I think it would be very profitable for the country if the production of grass ensilage were encouraged even to the extent of adjusting farm grants so that silos would be erected and special attention given to self-feeding silage.</P>
    <P>I think the matter of animal nutrition has a very grave bearing on the incidence of bovine tuberculosis because, as we know, the production of milk at present is based on the fact that we graze the grass in the summer and the cows calf in May. They are in calf during the winter and in many cases, especially in the South of Ireland, their rations during the winter are not sufficient to keep up their strength and they become victims of tuberculosis.  For that reason I should like to see more attention given to the production of ensilage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak only for a few minutes because I do not wish to stand between the House and the Minister.  A great part of the speeches from the Fine Gael benches yesterday was devoted to wheat, and while I welcome the belated interest of Fine Gael in wheat, I want to point out at the same time that the main burden of their effort last night was to suggest, apparently, or even to state, that Fianna Fáil candidates and leaders and speakers generally during the past year, in by-election and general election campaigns, made extravagant promises to increase the price of wheat to the old price that existed before the cut.</P>
      <P>I want to deny that absolutely and entirely.  I was on the platforms and spoke with most of the present Ministers during those campaigns and not once did one of them make any such promise.  I go further and say that not once did I hear any Fianna Fáil candidate or speaker make any such promise.  I should like to remind Fine Gael Deputies and that Party generally that our criticism of the reduction in the price of wheat was not just opposition to the reduction.  Our determined opposition was to the drastic reduction that was made and to the time at which it was made after the worst harvest since the Famine and at a time when nearly £1,000,000 was handed over as a kind of Christmas box to pretty well paid officials.  Our criticism of the reduction was that it had not been a reasonable reduction.</P>
      <P>My constituency colleague thought fit yesterday evening to state that I promised this restoration.  He went even further and said that I promised a little more.  I want to deny that absolutely and I challenge Deputy O. J. Flanagan to bring forward any responsible, independent person who will back up his statement.  I would not be such a fool.  I know too much about the wheat position and about the economic position generally.  I am not in the habit of making foolish statements.  I have not the reputation for making foolish or irresponsible statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all read, and Thomas Davis wrote a poem about it, that the <Col N="380" /> Geraldines became, in time, more Irish than the Irish themselves.  I never thought I would live to see the day when the Fine Gael Party would become more wheaten than wheat. Deputy Rooney last night was most anxious about the price of wheat. It is very heartening to hear Deputy Rooney going all out 100 per cent. for a 100 per cent. Irish loaf.  I do not despair, and I would not be at all surprised if, after all, Deputy Dillon&mdash;let us hope very many years hence&mdash;would not object to having a nice, fleecy, wavy, golden field of Irish wheat for his winding sheet.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party cannot really expect us to swallow all this.  As regards wheat, they did go to Damascus, did they not?  I welcome the change of heart now.  I welcome their conversion. It augurs well for the future and for the future of the wheat industry.  Our record with relation to wheat is well known.  Our achievements are there since 1932.  The people know that our policy with regard to wheat is good and sound.  We will be goaded on now by Fine Gael for they have all the burning, hot zeal, enthusiasm and fanatical faith of the newly converted.  Surely, the future of wheat is safe, and a reasonable and fair price will be paid to the farmer.  Deputy Dillon is an amazing man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NicholasEgan" hpid="Mr. N. Egan Mr. N. Egan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Egan</NameTxt>
      <P>What astonishes me about Deputy Dillon is that he can cod himself into believing and, not alone that, but he is able to dazzle the Fine Gael Party and cod them into believing, too, that he was responsible for certain things.  One delusion from which Deputy Dillon suffers is that he thinks he is responsible for the increased yield in wheat, in barley and in oats.  Indeed, I should not be surprised if Deputy Crotty believes that Deputy Dillon was in some way responsible for that.  Of course every farmer knows that he was as much responsible for the increased yield as Chiang Kai Shek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every farmer who knows anything at <Col N="381" /> all about farming knows that what has revolutionised corn growing here in the last five, seven or ten years and what has increased the yield so substantially is the advent of the combine corn drill. Any farmer who does not know that knows damn all about farming.  The advent of the combine corn drill means that farmers are able to get a much greater yield, with half the manure. Make no mistake about it; it is that machine which has brought about the increased yield.</P>
    <P>There are other factors.  Fertilisers are available and a great deal of credit is due also to the young farmers and Macra na Feirme for making people more conscious of the value of manure. If Deputy Dillon can prove to me that he had anything to do with the invention of the combine corn drill I will be prepared to give him due credit for having some share in bringing about the increased corn yield.</P>
    <P>Another delusion from which Deputy Dillon suffers is that he is in some way responsible for the increased numbers of cattle exported in the first quarter of this year.  He said that in the early part of this year we exported the highest number ever&mdash;I do not know whether it was since Clontarf or the Yellow Ford.  He apparently takes credit for that.  He has got the Fine Gael Party to believe that he was responsible for that increased export. He has dazzled them with the figures. Apparently no one in the Fine Gael Party has ever heard Disraeli's theory of &ldquo;lies, damn lies and statistics&rdquo; and apparently Deputy Dillon is able to cod them into believing that he was responsible for this huge export.  The fact is that the average minimum age of these cattle was about two and a half years.  They were calved in the summer or autumn of 1954.  The cows must have been serviced late in 1953 or very early in 1954 before the Coalition Government returned to office.  Surely, therefore, Deputy Dillon does not ask us to believe that he was responsible for having the stock that these calves grew into in the country?</P>
    <P>To a great extent I found myself in sympathy yesterday evening with the speeches of Deputy Giles and Deputy <Col N="382" /> Palmer.  They made very honest speeches.  They were not carpingly critical of Fianna Fáil and, at the same time, they did not let down their own Party.  They showed a good attitude of mind and I recommend their speeches and their attitude to the Fine Gael Party in general.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to burden the House or to keep the Minister waiting.  I cannot claim to have the global or cosmic knowledge of agriculture that my colleague, Deputy O.J. Flanagan, seems to have.  After all, I am only a farmer.  Deputy Flanagan blamed the Fianna Fáil Party for talking about wheat in the wheat areas and milk in the milk areas.  For half an hour he talked about onions.  Surely he does not expect us to go down to the Coombe and talk about onions and down to Castlegregory to talk about a maternity hospital?</P>
    <P>I wish, in conclusion, to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to this office which Deputy Dillon says is the most important office in the Government. I agree with the Deputy.  I do not always disagree with him.  He says some damn good things sometimes and some damn queer things at other times.  I agree with him this time that Deputy Seán Moylan is in charge of the most important and most vital Department.  It is as a result of the activities of the Department of Agriculture that this country will sink or swim.  I congratulate the Minister and I hope and believe that he will have a very fruitful period of office.  He is a man of wide and long vision.  I know he is a man of action, a man of sound judgment.  He combines these qualities with great determination to do his very best and give of his very best to this country in any capacity.  I believe that, the Minister having a combination of all these qualities, the results which we all desire and which members of every Party hope for will be achieved in the Department under his directorship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of intervening in the debate because, as the Minister has been only a month in office, I felt that we could not expect any great changes.  There is also the <Col N="383" /> consideration that the Government have been only three months in office. But, Deputy Egan, a man whom I admire, a very fine Deputy, said certain things which I thought should not go unanswered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Egan was very upset about reference to the price of wheat being made by the Fine Gael Party.  He stated that during the by-election in Laois the price of wheat was not used to gather votes for Fianna Fáil.  I was canvassing in Laois and I know the way in which the price of wheat was used, although I have no doubt that what Deputy Egan says is true, that he was on the platform with Ministers and that they did not state it.  Others besides Ministers could state it.  I have no doubt that it was stated and that it had a big effect on the by-election in Laois at that time.</P>
      <P>To come closer home, to Kilkenny, which is also a corn-growing county, it was stated there and to very good effect.  If none of the present Ministers stated it, a shadow Minister stated it.  The man who was reputed to be a shadow Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Corry, stated it in Kilkenny. He said: &ldquo;If you put back Fianna Fáil in office, you will get back Tommy Walsh's price for wheat.&rdquo;  The farmers there knew the late Tommy Walsh and admired him very much, and that statement had a definite effect on the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another speaker said: &ldquo;A man who grows 100 barrels of wheat, if Fianna Fáil were in office in the morning, would get £50 more for those 100 barrels.&rdquo;  One hundred barrels of wheat in Carlow-Kilkenny is not a very large amount.  It is quite a normal amount of wheat for a normal farmer in that area.  I have no doubt that that statement had a big effect.  Most people believed that if there were a change of Government, the price of wheat would be restored at least to 82/6 per barrel.  Quite a number of farmers were disappointed when the acting Minister for Agriculture, in March last, stated that he did not intend to change the price of wheat this year as it would have no bearing on <Col N="384" /> the acreage which was being sown at that time.</P>
    <P>I do not think it should have been a question as to whether it brought about an increased acreage this year or not. Apparently, without any increase in price, there has been a substantial increase in the wheat acreage.  I do not think that was any excuse, if they had canvassed through the corn growing counties on that basis, for not giving the 82/6 per barrel.</P>
    <P>Likewise in Limerick, on the occasion of another by-election, the slogan was that the inter-Party Government were holding up the Report of the Milk Costings Commission.  That was a very effective slogan in that by-election and had a very big effect on votes.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say if he will honour the promise given by his predecessor that, if there was any increase in price on the basis of that report, that increase would be made retrospective to last July?  The former Minister gave that promise to the House.  I think the Minister would be bound as a matter of honour, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated he was bound to honour his predecessor's guarantee, which his predecessor stated he never gave.  In this case, there is no question about whether the guarantee was given in the House and is on the records of the House.</P>

      <P>What is he talking about?  Deputy Egan said that we all thought Deputy Dillon was a wonderful man.  I agree with him and I think the Fianna Fáil Party agree that he has been a wonderful man.  I think so.  Deputy Egan asks if he claims credit for the increased production of wheat, barley and other crops.  I am sure any Minister for Agriculture who is in office when these things come about, whether they are brought about <Col N="385" /> or facilitated by him or not, is inclined to claim credit.  That is only natural. If there were any improvements in the morning, I am sure the present Minister would be inclined to claim credit, and I would not deny him that credit. Whatever about claiming credit for these things, does Deputy Egan deny credit to Deputy Dillon for land drainage? There was no land drainage before Deputy Dillon brought in the scheme.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, there is one matter I wish to raise with reference to the point made by Deputy Oliver Flanagan concerning the horse flesh trade.  I do not claim to know anything about the merits or otherwise of this industry, except to say that the argument put <Col N="386" /> forward by Deputy Oliver Flanagan last night is complete nonsense. If the Minister will examine this question, I appeal to him to examine it on its merits&mdash;whether it is good for the country or not&mdash;and not to be misled, as other Ministers have been, by this argument that the export of horse flesh from this country would injure our prime beef industry.  The fact is, and it has been known to Ministers, that we are already dealing in this trade over a number of years.  If that has not injured our prime beef trade, then the argument should not be used when a suggestion is made that this industry should be developed here.</P>
      <P>I believed that argument for a number of years, but I took the trouble of visiting an abattoir in Antrim.  I saw there horses being freely delivered. I saw them being slaughtered, being examined by competent veterinary surgeons and certified as being fit for human consumption and export to these countries where horse flesh is considered superior to beef.  We all know now that all the horses exported from this country to these countries are in fact slaughtered and used for human food.  The fact is that the law in these countries prohibits the import of horses for any other purpose.</P>
      <P>The issue as far as I see it&mdash;and it is on these lines I want the Minister to examine the problem&mdash;is that we are exporting these horses alive and they are being slaughtered and used for human food.  I am informed that horses so slaughtered do not produce the best meat, because the horses are not in the best condition for slaughter. Why, therefore, do some Deputies continue with this argument, when the meat is sold in these countries as prime Irish horse flesh, and in fact is not the best we could produce? Whereas, if the horses were slaughtered under proper conditions, they would produce a far superior meat.  There is a limited but a ready market in these countries for horse flesh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I simply want the Minister not to be misled, as apparently other Ministers have been, by the argument put forward <Col N="387" /> by Deputy Oliver Flanagan.  His argument was about as correct as his argument here about a famous racehorse, Tulyar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Moylan) Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Moylan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ramifications of the Department of Agriculture are so great that, even if I were an intellectual Ronnie Delany, I could not come round to all of them in the time at my disposal.  Certainly, no aspect of the Department's work has escaped criticism during this debate.  Even Deputy Rooney, who gave us such a wealth of information, had certain criticisms to make.</P>
      <P>In referring to Deputy Rooney, I must say I have a much higher opinion of the people of this country and their intelligence than Deputy Rooney apparently has.  I have heard aspiring politicians on election platforms spouting about the benefits they could confer on the public after the election, and finding the cynical, critical crowd rejecting their advances and refusing to put their Party or themselves into power.  I am of the belief, if I may quote Deputy Oliver Flanagan, that it is a decent thing to go on an election platform and tell the truth.  Coming from that source, all of us must be very definitely impressed.</P>
      <P>I did not invent or create the Department of Agriculture.  For any benefits it may have conferred on the people of Ireland, I am due no gratitude.  If the Department has worked evil on the people, I am not, for the moment anyhow, to be accused of participating in working that evil.  Certain questions have been asked by Deputies and I will try to answer them.  Deputy Flanagan spoke at length and entertained himself highly.  One point he made was in regard to onion production and storage facilities.  A very substantial sum has been provided for the provision of storage facilities for onions at Castlegregory and further proposals are before the Department for a possible further extension of these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rooney asked me if it is intended that the land reclamation scheme will be pursued.  The Deputy will have noticed in the Book of <Col N="388" /> Estimates that the amount provided this year for land reclamation is even somewhat larger than last year.  He also made a statement about the influx of cattle from the Six Counties.  Of course, that is possible; but the extent of it is entirely exaggerated by Deputy Rooney.  I am confident of that.</P>
    <P>We could eliminate that evil by the elimination of Partition.  I was in America during the Prohibition period. The Prohibition law was a law that defeated itself.  The result of it was that, instead of making the United States a sober country, it succeeded in spreading the amount of drinking done. But it went further than that.  The fact that it was a law against human nature meant it was broken by everybody; and the result was that, having developed a contempt for the law in one of its aspects, it developed a contempt for the law in many other aspects and gravely affected moral conditions in the United States.</P>
    <P>Partition is a law against human nature also.  One of the developments has been that of smuggling both ways across the Border, a breach of the law which may lead to the development of a contempt for law in its other aspects. I have no possibility of preventing a certain amount of smuggling down here and the people on the other side are in just as difficult position as I am. I assume that in general the incidence of smuggling does iron itself out.  The Deputy is entirely wrong when he says that there are hundreds of these cattle coming down here.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked about the storage of barley.  The storage of the extra barley is, in good measure, a matter for the co-operative societies.  I have had a discussion quite recently with those who represent those societies and, as a result, I am not fearful that there will be any grave difficulty in providing the necessary storage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney, having devoted a long time to the question of election promises and of the delinquency of Fianna Fáil, attacked the Government's decision to withdraw the butter subsidy.  He was quite illogical in his approach to the matter because he wants a further development of markets overseas for our surplus produce. <Col N="389" /> I realise that the withdrawal of the butter subsidy was a hardship on certain persons in the community, but I think it was an approach to reality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney almost raved about the fact that we may have 20,000 tons of butter surplus this year and that we will sell it on the overseas market at 3/- a lb., denying the benefit to our own people.  That we sell cheaper on the overseas market than we do at home is quite correct, but to say it is wrong to do so is only a social argument and even a false social argument because it takes no cognisance of fundamental economics.  At the same time, Deputy Rooney, while deploring that we may have 20,000 tons of surplus butter, desires that we should embark on the large scale production of eggs for sale in England, although recently the Danes had to complain to Britain about the price of British eggs on the traditional Danish markets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney also spoke about the need for close collaboration and consultation between the Department and certain organisations which he mentioned. There is no difficulty in having close collaboration and consultation between them.  The Department of Agriculture is open to everybody.  My predecessor said that most Ministers for Agriculture spent much more of their time than they ought in warding off cranks, male and female. We have to admit that many cranks, male and female, find their way into all Departments and there is no check or bulwark against their intrusion.  Not that it is an intrusion because these people are welcomed, if they have anything to contribute to the development of our agricultural system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher asked for some information in regard to breeding tests. There have been trials of comparison between the Dairy Shorthorn and the Friesian for the production of fat cattle and these were carried out at Clonakilty and Ballyhaise.  The result of the first series of tests showed that the Friesian put on more weight than the Dairy Shorthorn.  The latter, however, matured earlier than the Friesian; one month at one centre and two months at the other centre.  The <Col N="390" /> Dairy Shorthorn killed out somewhat better than the Friesian.  These results will be published in due course and the trial will be continued.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wycherley spoke yesterday about Shorthorn cattle.  He said that from the mating time to the time of the sale of the beast in the market occupied a period of three and a half years.  That is the thing we have to avoid and, to my mind, the tests so far do prove that the Shorthorn is the superior beast for the production of the animal that matures earlier.  I have spoken before about the need for attuning our work to the market demand and the demand on the market is for the smaller joint and early maturing beast.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked a question about water supplies.  A sum of £118,000 was paid for this scheme in 1956-57 and the amount of £100,000 is provided this year.  Due probably to economic reasons, there had to be a suspension of applications on 7th August, 1956. The suspension was so sudden that it seemed to me to operate unfairly against a certain small group of people. I am examining the possibility as to whether, in their case, we might have a small extension to meet urgent and difficult cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher spoke about premiums to Friesian bulls and said they were being denied.  I hold the view that the development of A. I. will mean the complete withdrawal of all premiums for bulls.  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned premiums for boars.  I remember when we had what was called a &ldquo;boar election&rdquo;, when our political opponents distributed premiums to all and sundry within the limits available in the Cork County Council.  I do not like rackets and I think A. I. has many advantages, apart from its influence in the question of politics.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes, again on politics, pointed out that this country remained in the wilderness from 1922 to 1948. That was rather a hard knock for some of my friends of ancient days.  I should not be surprised if Deputy Hughes was at one time a supporter of the Irish Parliamentary Party.  He seems to have completely forgotten the work that was done by Fine Gael and naturally <Col N="391" /> he denies that anything was accomplished by Fianna Fáil.  I should like to tell Deputy Hughes, and anybody who holds the same views, that, irrespective of our past history, irrespective of the different political views we eventually came to hold, this country was served between 1922 and 1938 by men who, whatever their faults, served it unselfishly.  If Deputy Hughes had read Irish history, he would have a much clearer picture of the reasons why this country is still backward.  It will be a good many years before we can overcome all the difficulties.</P>

      <P>Well, no objection. Agriculture had its part to play during all those years, and it must have played it with effect, because it is the basis of our economy to-day.  I should like to point out to Deputy Hughes that the developments in farm housing, roads, electricity, water supplies, farm building improvements, vocational schools, the extension of library services, the telephone service and transport were not available before 1922 to farmers.  They are now available and agriculture must have played its part in providing a good many of them.</P>
      <P>So many things have been said, so many questions have been asked, that it would be difficult for me to get around to all of them.  I will make mistakes as all my predecessors have done.  The Department of Agriculture is the graveyard of political reputations, because, as Deputy Dillon truly says, there are so many experts to tell the Department and the Minister how he should run his own business.  Generally those people have failed to run any businesses of their own.</P>

      <P>I have suggested in my opening speech that it is my view that, irrespective of changes in the political Parties in power, there ought to be a continuity of policy.  Very definite changes should not be made without due consideration and every care being <Col N="392" /> taken.  I think my predecessor, if he were free to do so, would agree with me that there can be no solution of our economic and social problem, if we do not face one incontrovertible fact, that production, more production, is valueless if it is not accompanied by a reduction in the cost per unit of output. That is my view.  I do not object to more production.  I am not terrified by the fact that we have 20,000 tons of butter for sale overseas.  There is a balance of payments question and if we sell it at 3/- per lb., it will make a very valuable contribution to our economy.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to have two loyalties.  I agree we should have many more agricultural advisers, but I do not intend to put an end to, or extend the proposal of Deputy Dillon.  I hope the time will come when a method will be found whereby the men so appointed will have their services fully utilised, but I am a believer that the county committee of agriculture is the best method of securing the ends desired.  Deputies will excuse me if I have to neglect some aspects of the debate, but there are a few important points to which I must refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk of wheat. Deputy Rooney is not alone in his <Col N="393" /> desire to elucidate my views on wheat and to point to the fact that Fianna Fáil has been entirely delinquent in regard to any wheat policy.  The attitude of the Opposition to the growing of wheat has suffered a sad sea change.  We on this side of the House are quite accustomed to listen to the story that the growing of wheat destroyed the fertility of the land, that farmers who undertook its production had transmuted themselves into miners and that the terror of this green island becoming a dust bowl was imminent if the Fianna Fáil policy of growing wheat was continued.</P>
    <P>I remember a very famous expression by my predecessor.  I shall not repeat it.  All the Dismal Jemmies have disappeared. We hear no more the jeremiads.  Now the concern is for a 100 per cent.  Irish loaf and, as a concomitant, a price for wheat that will remove all incentive for good husbandry.  That will result merely in agricultural depression and an economic sanction on all sections of the community.  Modern conditions and standards of living ensure that no country can be entirely self-sufficient if it is to meet the demands of its nationals.  The disadvantage of living in an economically air-tight compartment was brought home to us ten or 12 years ago.  International trade may impose many disabilities but it has operated, on the whole, to the benefit of mankind.  But a nation ought to be self-sufficient in the material things, the production of which its resources permit.</P>
    <P>I am a believer in the 100 per cent. Irish loaf.  Our increased production, of which Deputy Dillon speaks so joyously, comes as a result of the broadening of our field of production, not because we have in general made spectacular advances in any field.  We have not.  We are on our way, I think, but we have not done it so far.  When I saw the possibility of a 20,000 ton surplus of butter, to take Deputy Rooney's figures, I attributed the fact to a very substantial increase in milk production. There is not such an increase.</P>
    <P>The fact is that we have 100,000 more cows supplying milk to creameries now than we had, say, 20 years ago.  The sad fact still is that the increase in <Col N="394" /> milk production as delivered to creameries has gone up by fewer than 30 gallons per cow.  Will Deputies agree with me that if we could produce cows that would give us 600 or 700 gallons our problems about the disposal of butter in a foreign market would be much easier?</P>
    <P>Worthwhile and permanent achievement is always an objective that is slowly reached.  I think we are tending towards a higher production in milk yearly, but it will not be revolutionary in one year or two.  We shall not in any sphere secure an achievement by merely gazing at the picture of the accomplished fact but as the result of a wisely considered policy and of an undeviating and concentrated effort towards its fulfilment.  A new venture, if it is to succeed, must take into consideration existing conditions. We must realise that changing conditions may result in losses for which the resultant benefits of the effort do not compensate.  Everyone concerned with such a venture must examine it in the cold light of reason and, if we preserve the wheat market entirely for the Irish farmer, we shall ensure a vast expansion of production.</P>
    <P>What price is the nation prepared to pay for that very specific advantage? What concession is the farmer prepared to make to the rest of the community for the advantage offered?  Let us not swop punches about who does what.  Let us, instead, get down and see what can be done.  The production of the 100 per cent.  Irish loaf is not merely a question of agricultural policy.  It is also a question of research, of good husbandry and of national goodwill.  I am prepared to discuss it in all its details with all the interests involved.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with making political points.  I am not concerned with my political future&mdash;I have not any.  Questions have been raised about marketing.  I confess that, at the moment, I do not know how the money provided or any part of it can effectively be spent.  I can assure Deputies that none of it will be spent unless there are reasonable grounds for believing the expenditure will result in national benefit.  Deputies know <Col N="395" /> that the greatest financial return to the country comes from our cattle trade.  Some people whose views are obscured by other considerations or who are affected by historical statements involving a denial of the rights of the Irish people cannot appreciate its value.  But cold, hard and bitter economic facts insist on acceptance of its value.</P>
    <P>It is a trade with a long history. Those engaged in it have garnered a world of knowledge and trading experience. In my opinion, it could be very well left alone&mdash;in the hands of those who have proved their capacity for handling it.  We should not attempt to introduce any system alternative to or detrimental to it.  Of course, nothing remains static, and change is inevitable. It may be possible, and it may be necessary, to introduce methods supplemental to it.  In the meantime, it seems to me that the handling of the cattle export trade is sufficiently satisfactory.</P>
    <P>An all-important factor in the development of marketing is continuity of supply.  The sale of a periodic surplus can hardly be regarded as marketing.  If we are to market our goods with effect, our first step is an assurance to ourselves of our capacity to provide goods for that market in continuity or on seasonal demand.</P>
    <P>I have had made to me a number of proposals in regard to this question of marketing.  I assume and believe that the proposals I have had are genuine proposals.  Of course, there will always be the outside lunatic fringe who will provide us with a certain amount of irritation and possible amusement in the Department.  However, I propose to investigate all these proposals and try to weigh their worth.</P>
    <P>In pointing out the hopelessness of Fianna Fáil policy and the delinquencies of the Minister, Deputies rightly refrained from criticising the service.  I come into the Department of Agriculture with a rather open mind. I am not easily pushed around intellectually.  I have heard so many assertions that the Department was the subject of demoniac possession that I <Col N="396" /> was rather fearful on my unsatanic way in.  I find, after a very short period, that the officials of the Department are as deeply concerned for the welfare of agriculture as anyone could be anywhere. I have no doubt that, in assessing the value of any proposals, the advice, experience and goodwill of all the officials will be worth while bringing to bear on those problems.</P>
    <P>This year I hope we shall have an Institute of Agriculture.  I confess that I am not entirely happy about the terms of the Bill as introduced.  It seems to me that the approach to the final decision has been, in the words of Deputy Dillon, bedevilled by the pseudo-experts who float around this country.  It was better expressed than that by the Deputy, naturally, but that is the meaning of it.</P>
    <P>In the Department of Agriculture the problem of full employment for a Minister was solved many years ago. He cannot at a moment's notice or at his own convenience set aside adequate time for the serious consideration of important matters.  The setting up of the institute is a matter of exceptional importance to this State.  It is incumbent on me to give it the closest scrutiny and examination.  I am determined, as far as I can compass it, to ensure that it shall serve its purpose, the improvement and progress of Irish agriculture, that it shall be an independent body pursuing its own purpose and that it shall not become an appendage to any existing institutions.  I do not intend to read into the words of my predecessor in this regard anything other than the fact that he believes, as I believe, that the paramount purpose of the institute must be the promotion of progress in that sphere which is of such importance in our economic life.</P>
    <P>I am not without experience of various kinds and I am not entirely devoid of the capacity for thought or for the consideration of views opposed to mine and an assessment of their value.  I have a very good sense of duty, particularly of the duty which devolves on me in this regard.  I am more than grateful to Deputy Dillon for the attitude he has adopted in regard to me.  I hope that he and I <Col N="397" /> and the members of the Dáil will succeed courageously and independently in fashioning that instrument of progress of which our agriculture is sadly in need.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked me if the counties mentioned in my speech, for inclusion in the tuberculosis scheme, will be treated in the same fashion as Sligo and Clare.  He may be assured that they will be treated exactly the same.  He spoke about the problem of tuberculosis in the dairying districts.  I am well aware how much more difficult and how much more intricate the problem is in those dairy districts. Without reflection on the people of the West, I am much more familar with the Munster mind.  I think that where Deputy Dillon might fail to appreciate the psychology of the South, I would be in a better position to do so.</P>
    <P>The problem of the dairy districts must be faced soon and resolutely.  If this problem of bovine tuberculosis is not solved, it will mean a complete disruption of our economics.  I trust that anything Deputies can do to popularise the idea and prevent any unfair criticism or objections will be done by them.</P>
    <P>Again, as a stranger among you, I would say that Deputy Rooney need not be too worried about the mentality of the people in the dairy area.  We will pull out.  We know what the difficulties are and what the problems are, far better than any visiting politician.  Like Deputy O'Sullivan, I have always a horror during an election of getting any help from Dublin.  Of course, that applies all round.  I do not think that Deputy Rooney need be worried about the future of the dairy industry. I am full of hope and confidence about agriculture.  The fact that we have begun to move in regard to better production is only an initial step.  We can and will go further.  I find that Deputy Rooney and a lot of these Dublin City men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>By proxy.  I find that all these people have peculiar ideas about the free trade area.  They seem to regard it as an <i>El Dorado.</i>  They tell us that there are 250,000,000 people waiting for the Irish Department of Agriculture to go over and feed them. How have they been living all the years?  How have they been trading?</P>
      <P>Deputies would want to realise that, even in regard to the things we can sell on the Continent now, we have great difficulty.  Deputy Dillon spoke a few times on our trade with France in regard to that.  He is perfectly right, but that difficulty is not confined to France.  It also applies to any other continental country in respect of which our exports are small and our imports are much larger.  Every country produces its own food in some fashion or its own shelter.</P>
      <P>I think that the future expansion of our export trade demands the highest quality product attractively marketed. People like Deputy Rooney, Dublin people of course, standing outside the cattle market are lost in admiration and amazement at the sight of a bullock which weighs about a ton and consider it the greatest achievement of bovine progress in this country of ours.  They should be horrified.  If we are to produce beef, we might as well try to sell the five year old bullock as horse meat to Belgium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not true that all that is wanting is the high quality small joint from the early mature beast?  Grass has a particular part to play in the production of such a beast.  I think the Department is quite guiltless in relation to any delay in producing that beast.  If anybody is guilty, it is Deputy Rooney's colleagues.  From 1934 up to 1948, when things changed, we used to hear from those opposite that if you ploughed the field, you would never get a cover of grass on it for 20 years and that this was the most valuable permanent pasture in the world.  There may be permanent pasture&mdash;I do not know.  Does the grass not need renewal to get us a crop?  The whole aim of the Department <Col N="399" /> of Agriculture and of the advisory services is to get appreciation of the fact that grass is a crop and the most valuable you can produce.</P>

I suggest that the veterinary section of the Department of Agriculture might appeal to the Ceann Comhairle to close down some afternoon during the Dublin Show and have an exhibit there such as was prepared for the <Col N="400" /> last show&mdash;an exhibit of grass, an exhibit of this famous aphosphoratic cow and let Deputies understand what is the result of the famous grass Deputy Dillon's colleagues suggested was O.K. while he was trying, God help him, to drive into their unfortunate thick heads the idea that there was something other than bent grass and weeds.</P>
