    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That for the purpose of any Act of the present session to charge and impose certain duties of customs and inland revenue (including excise), to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provisions in connection with finance, it is expedient to authorise that to redeem borrowings, and interest thereon, in respect of capital services there shall be charged annually on the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof a sum of £498,294 in the 29 successive <Col N="3" /> financial years and a sum of £598,588 in the 30 successive financial years commencing in each case with the financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Money Resolution is for the purpose of obtaining the finance necessary both in relation to the capital needs of the Exchequer and in relation to current needs until such time as current taxation flows in in the ordinary way at the end of the year&mdash; in January and February particularly, when the vast bulk of income-tax becomes payable.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I want to refer for a moment to the issue of Exchequer Bills which the Minister announced the other day, the issue which will close on next Friday.  I want to make it abundantly clear&mdash;speaking for myself and for this Party&mdash;that we hope the issue will be a success.  As was indicated in the statement made by the Minister from his Department when the issue was announced, it is an innovation. It is an innovation which I discussed frankly on more than one occasion and one which I would like to have introduced.</P>
      <P>This is an innovation which it would be quite impossible to introduce, unless the balance of payments was in order, as it is, and while the British Treasury Bills rate was at the very high rate at which it stood up to some time ago. The auguries are now set properly for the introduction of such an innovation. I hope sincerely that it will be a success and that those who have short term money available will take advantage of the opportunity offered by the Minister to invest in these Exchequer Bills, for their own benefit and for the benefit of the State and its development. The Minister has indicated that he will be prepared to accept tenders up to a maximum rate of 4¾ per cent. That is an upward limit, not a minimum limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the present yield of British Treasury Bills, it is to be hoped that the offer will be a success. Those who have short-term money available have a duty to avail of it.  It is absolutely gilt-edged.  I would say <Col N="4" /> particularly that any person resident here&mdash;or any company operating in this country&mdash;who may at the present time have money in British Treasury Bills, has not merely an opportunity but a duty to exchange those Bills for the Bills of the Irish Government.  I hope that the Minister's innovation will be a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the goodwill expressed by the Deputy and that of the other Parties.  I have every hope that the issue will be successful. It is experimental on this occasion.  If the experiment proves successful, we may expect to get a fair amount of finance by this method in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  Having got the non-political part of the matter away, I should like to speak on this as it affects the Bill and is strictly relevant to the Bill.  The funds which will be raised by this Money Resolution and the moneys which are produced as a result of this Finance Bill are, of course, the product of the Budget which the Minister introduced some six weeks ago.  I do not think there is anything to be gained at this stage by going over all the ground which was covered in the Budget debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when concluding the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, dealt with certain aspects of the position, and in some respects was inaccurate in his statements.  I think time will show quite adequately, without taking up the time of the House, that the prognostications of the Minister and certain of the criticisms he levelled at certain steps taken by the previous Government were entirely without <Col N="5" /> justification or foundation.  Accordingly, I shall not delay the House further in pointing out how inaccurate these statements were.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Finance Bill, 1957&mdash;Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section I stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 is the section that imposes both income-tax and surtax for the current year.  Many people would like to hear from the Minister why it is that he and his advisers consider it impossible to deal with this question of income-tax and surtax by a single return.  I know there are certain administrative difficulties and that it is not for me, at the moment, to point out those difficulties. That is for the Minister.</P>
      <P>Everybody with whom the Minister will discuss this problem outside will say he finds it impossible to realise why one must make one return to the income-tax inspector and then make a return of exactly the same income to the Commissioners of Surtax.  It seems to me that it should be possible to deal with the two on the one basis.  There was, I know, an objection raised some years ago that surtax payers did not want their incomes known by the ordinary income-tax inspectors.  I think that type of objection, certainly valid some time ago, is no longer valid.</P>
      <P>There is also the objection that surtax and income-tax are not always assessed in exactly the same way, but I think it would ease considerably the task of administration and might bring down the administrative costs about which the Minister spoke during the Budget debate, if he were able, in the course of the current year, to arrive at a basis by which we could have such an assessment for income-tax and surtax and that the one statement of total income would be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position here is different from that which obtains in Britain.  I know that in Britain in this respect there <Col N="6" /> has been some considerable discussion on this subject.  However, we are in an entirely different position, having regard to the size of our country and the size of incomes generally.  Therefore, I think the Minister would be well advised in the year that lies ahead to give some critical examination to the problem and to ensure that this problem, if nothing else were examined by the Income-Tax Commission, would be treated as a matter of urgency so that a recommendation by the commission might be forthcoming in time for next year's Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does appear, looking at this from the outside, that it would be very much more convenient for a person to pay both his income-tax and surtax together&mdash;maybe not together, but at any rate it would be much more convenient if he were assessed on the two on the one form.  It would look as if there could be a saving in administration if both assessments were dealt with by the same person.</P>
      <P>However, the matter is very complicated indeed, as the Deputy will agree.  It is being considered by the Income-Tax Commission and I hope the commission will, in time, make recommendations on the matter which can be accepted and which will, in many other ways, make the whole scheme more convenient and more understandable to the person paying income-tax.  At the same time, it might be possible to make savings in administration. What I feel sure Deputy Sweetman will realise and will agree with is that all these things which appear simple might make for very much more complicated administration. I know the commission are bearing this matter in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister thought of asking the commission to issue an interim report on any aspects of their deliberations?  The final report will obviously take a very considerable time.  In the meantime, there are certain pressing problems with which it might be possible they could deal on an interim basis.  I should like to know whether the Minister has considered putting these specific problems to the commission, with a request that they might issue an interim report on <Col N="7" /> them.  I do not think it would be advisable or possible for them to make comprehensive reports until they had completely reviewed the entire tax code, but it might be worth while asking them to deal with specific problems on an interim basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be difficult to get them to report on such matters specifically.  As I have pointed out, they must consider the whole question of the tax code.  In fact, they may recommend that income-tax be abolished altogether and that we find our money by some other means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that likely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not likely, but they may do it.  That being the case, it is difficult to see how an interim report could be got from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister travel as far with me as to indicate to the commission that, if they wish to make an interim report on specific matters, he will have no objection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>2.  Any self-employed person assessable under Cases (1) and (2) of Schedule D who pays any sum, not exceeding 5 per cent. of his income so assessable, to an insurance company or to any co-operative or friendly society for the purpose of securing a pension for himself on retirement, shall have the amount of any such payment deducted from his assessment in having his liability to income-tax determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is, of course, not drafted in anything like an adequate manner.  It is put down in that form only for the purpose of giving an indication of my views and of giving the Minister a proper chance of understanding <Col N="8" /> the case I am making.  Any proper section dealing with a self-employed person would require very many pages of drafting.  The case of the self-employed person is one that has been the subject of considerable correspondence between the Revenue Commissioners and whoever has been the holder of the position of Minister for Finance, on the one hand, and those affected or their professional associations, on the other.</P>
    <P>The legislation required to give individual relief might be very difficult to draft and I could understand the Minister taking the view that individual deductions must await the report of the commission.  Apart from that, there is another method of dealing with this problem and it is the method to which I have adverted very briefly in this amendment.  At present we have income-tax relief for the person who pays a premium for life assurance to cover the payment of a capital sum on the death of the person assured or, if it is an endowment assurance, at the end of a fixed time.  We have, however, nothing comparable in relation to tax relief for the individual who wishes, not to provide a lump sum on death but to provide an annual pension where that individual is self-employed.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which hits perhaps more than anyone else the professional middle-class.  I would have thought it a comparatively simple matter to introduce legislation in this Finance Bill to provide that payments to an insurance company or to a co-operative society for the purpose of securing a pension would be entitled to relief in the same way as payment for life assurance. Certain bodies of persons who cater for the self-employed, the accountants' institution, certainly the Incorporated Law Society, and other bodies have been considering for some time setting up a group society to deal with pensions of this kind.  It would obviously be useless for them to set up any such group scheme unless it was going to have recognition for tax purposes in legislation.  Our primary aim must be&mdash;and whatever else the Minister disagrees with me on he will not disagree with me on this&mdash;to ensure that our people save a small <Col N="9" /> part of their income for future capital development.  Any type of tax incentive towards saving, therefore, should be considered as sympathetically as possible.  The provision of a tax incentive for the self-employed in the manner that I have indicated in this amendment would give considerable inducement towards saving and would, in that way, contribute to national development.</P>
    <P>I have no figures available to me in relation to the cost of any such scheme. Presumably it must come out of the yield from Schedule D tax which has been running over the years at approximately 60 per cent. of the general income-tax yield.  The last year in respect of which I have percentages in front of me is 1953-54.  In that year when £20,819,000 was collected in income-tax £1,512,000, or 7.3 per cent., came from Schedule A; only £104,000, or .5 per cent. from Schedule B; £606,000 from Schedule C, which is 2.9 per cent.; £12,974,000, which is 62.3 per cent., from Schedule D; and £5,623,000, which is 27 per cent., from Schedule E.</P>
    <P>Of course, in respect of the Schedule D tax, not all of it by a long way would be referable to profits for the self-employed, that is, payment to the self-employed for his own work.  It would include the yield from dividends and the direct profits of companies, which are, of course, far the greatest thing.  I hope the Minister would not quarrel with me if I said that the yield from the self-employed assessment there in Schedule D is probably somewhere between £2,000,000 and £2,500,000.  I think the break-up in the year I am quoting was that between professional earnings and individual traders it would have been about £2.1 million.  Professional earnings were, I think, £600,000 and the profits of individual traders £1,700,000.</P>
    <P>If I have correctly understood the figures and the total yield from the self-employed, out of that 60 per cent. as approximately £2,100,000, then it would seem to me that the cost of granting this concession would be very small relatively to our £100,000,000 of current revenue and expenditure. Certainly, the Minister will agree with <Col N="10" /> me that it is impossible in any estimate of yield to be completely accurate. The Budget any Minister for Finance brings in at the beginning of the year is intended to be the best estimate he can make of how revenue will come in and how expenditure will turn out.  It could not be completely accurate.  There has to be variation both ways.  On that account, I hope the Minister will not meet me with the facile but empty method of replying that this would unbalance the Budget and, therefore, he could not consider it.  The amount would not be of such proportions as would throw out the Estimates and, in any event, it would probably not have much effect until the following financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me make it clear that there is a scheme for the employed person where the contributions are exempt from income-tax and where the fund which is properly applied towards retirement pensions is also exempt from income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only for an employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is also, as Deputies are aware, relief on insurance premiums if people wish to provide for their old age in that way.  It is fairly substantial relief and they can have their retirement pensions made out in their own way, but there is not complete exemption from income-tax in that case.</P>
      <P>I must confess I did not give this matter very much thought because there was not time.  However, I did see two British reports and the cost estimated appeared to be extremely high. It was really a frightening figure.  If applied here or if it cost us the same amount in proportion, it would be very substantial, I am afraid, but of course it is only an estimate in England and I might be told, if I investigated circumstances here, it would not cost as much, or maybe it would cost more in proportion.  All I can say is that I have not given it very much thought, but I am certainly sympathetic to it, if I thought it could be done and were satisfied as to how it could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" /> The Deputy is quite right in saying that the legislation would be difficult and involved and I am told it would take several clauses in the Finance Bill to deal with it.  It might therefore have to be done by a separate Bill because it is a big subject and all I can promise&mdash;even though the Deputy thinks it is a facile way of getting out of it&mdash;is that it will be considered next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We will postpone our row for 12 months.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6)  In the case of any business being assessed as a trade for the first time in the year commencing on 6th April, 1957, then notwithstanding the words &ldquo;on or after the 6th day of April, 1958&rdquo;, the provisions of this section shall apply to such initial assessment.</P>
      <P>This arises on a point I made on the Second Stage, and again I have not drafted the amendment in the exact technical language that would be required but merely for the purpose of giving the Minister an indication of what was in my mind.  As I understand the position, the provisions of Section 2 would mean that a person buying machinery for a new business first coming to be charged under Schedule D this year would not get the benefit of the increase in Section 2 by way of depreciation for that machinery for the current year.  I freely admit to the Minister that it is an extremely technical matter, but that was my opinion when I read the Bill first, and I asked another person about it and he confirmed that that was his interpretation of it also.  If our interpretation of the section is wrong, then the amendment is unnecessary.  If, therefore, the Minister would like to give a little exposition on the technical aspects of the section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are exactly in the same position.  A new business starting, <Col N="12" /> let us say, on 1st June, would be in exactly the same position as an existing business.  They would get the existing rate of wear and tear allowances, plus, of course, the initial allowance as the other firm.  They would get these this year and then be assessed next year on this year's business. They would get the same as existing firms, five-fourths of wear and tear, with 25 per cent. added on.  I think, as the section stands, the Deputy may accept that the company starting off is not in any worse position than the existing company and that, therefore, an amendment of this section would put them in a better position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>My anxiety is not to put them in a better position, but it would seem that a new company starting off must be assessed on current profits for this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For this year, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And that therefore when anybody is asked whether it is desirable for the new company to buy machinery or not, they would have to advise that it would be deferred until after 6th April, because otherwise the company would not get the benefit of this provision?  If that is the situation, it is an invidious one, and, as I see it, the new company starting off and wanting to buy machinery worth £10,000, shall we say, would be told it would be better advised to defer that modernisation until after 6th April and that if it did, it would earn more in tax relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no; that is not the way at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no inducement whatever for them to wait until next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But why?  Is it not correct that the new company will be assessed on profits in this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is right, but that applies to existing companies also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No; existing <Col N="13" /> companies this year are assessed on last year's profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But they get the 25 per cent. next year all the same.  They will both get it next year, with 25 per cent. added on in any case.</P>

      <P>This is the section that I indicated I would like to introduce when the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was going through the House last November, but it was not within the scope of that Long Title. I have read the wording of the section several times and I am not quite clear as to what the Minister means by &ldquo;college&rdquo;.  Does he intend &ldquo;college&rdquo; there to be solely a college that is a constituent college of a university or does he mean any college, whether it is part of a university or not.  We have two universities and one has three constituent colleges, while one has one constituent college.  National University has Dublin, Cork and Galway, while Trinity is the constituent college <Col N="14" /> of Dublin University.  Is &ldquo;college&rdquo; intended to be restricted to those, or is it intended to cover anything other than that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 26, to delete &ldquo;the passing of the Act&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1st May, 1923.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is for the purpose of ensuring that, where there is a benefit that is uncovenanted going to shareholders, it will start from the inception of this State, not from a date half-way through.</P>
      <P>I made some reference to this on the Second Stage.  I noted that the Minister when replying&mdash;perhaps because he was dealing with broader aspects of the matter&mdash;made no reference to the points I raised.  I do not intend to discuss the subject this morning on the political plane and I shall not be so unkind as to remind the Minister of all the things the Minister for Industry and Commerce said about Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, when he was on these benches.  Rather do I rejoice in the fact that the Minister has been able to convert him to my point of view, that these provisions had merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Candidly, I cannot see what the Minister hopes to get from this section. It will give a benefit to new shareholders in Irish securities and I am glad new shareholders are getting such a benefit.  When I received the report on capital for industry from the Industrial <Col N="15" /> Credit Company I failed completely to understand what they believed this step would bring.  They indicated that a bold step of this nature would be desirable, but they gave no reasons as to why it would be desirable.  They merely indicated that it would be a bold step.</P>
    <P>There was a very clear reason why I brought in the amendment I made last year.  Without that amendment issues of various companies would be subdivided, and in fact were subdivided, in such a way as to make them far less readily marketable.  I cannot see how this section will increase the marketability of any particular issue.  If the Minister's case for the section is that there are certain issues in which the shares are still divided into (a) and (b) and that this section will enable those shares to be amalgamated, I would like him to quote those issues.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this section gives a completely uncovenanted benefit.  If that is so, it is irrebuttable that the fair thing to do is to go back to the inception of the State.  I think I am right in saying that 1st May, 1923, was the transfer date from the British in so far as financial matters were concerned. I do not know what issues were made between 1st May, 1923, and the passing of the 1932 Finance Act. Whatever they were, whether they were large or small, the holders of those shares have in justice and in equity equally as good a case for the preferential treatment it is proposed to give by this section as those who invested since 1932.  Whether an investor put his money into Irish development in the period from 1923 to 1932, or in the period since 1932, matters little when considering the position from the point of view of the development of the country and I would seriously press the Minister to accept this amendment because, if he does not do so, there will be a feeling of differentiation and hardship which will impinge on prospective investors and make them perhaps less likely in the future to invest in Irish industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The year 1932 happened to be a year in which a new Government <Col N="16" /> came into office but, leaving that out of the question completely, the object at that time was to give an incentive to invest in new industries or in new companies that might be formed.  If we look at this purely as a matter of incentive I do not think there would be any justification whatever for going back before 1932 because, obviously, those who had invested in companies before 1932 had already invested and giving them this concession would, therefore, have been giving them a present from the point of view of incentive. If an investor were to argue that he merited some reward for supporting industry before 1932, then I do not think we could even stop at 1923 or 1922 because it could be argued that companies formed here before 1922 deserved great credit for their action in trying to build up industry here under the British régime.  But that is not the point.</P>
      <P>We should look on this as a division of benefits for those who invested under one Government or another.  The object really at the time was to give an incentive to Irish people to put their money into Irish industry.  When one goes back to that time, one will find in the debates that everybody here agreed, irrespective of Party, that the Irish people with money to invest were not Irish-industrially minded.  If they were putting their money into industry, they were putting it into industry in England.  They had no great confidence in new industries starting here and, from that point of view, it was felt that some incentive was necessary.</P>
      <P>If we look at it entirely from the point of view of incentive, there is no justification for going back further on the date.  I do not know what it would cost to go back from 1932 to 1923 and I would not like to resist it on the basis of cost if I felt there was an injustice being done to those who invested their money from 1923 to 1932.  Every Deputy must agree that they invested their money at that time in the expectation that they would have to pay full income-tax on any dividends they might receive and there is not, therefore, a very good case to be made for putting the date back, as the Deputy has proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="17" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made exactly the case I wanted him to make.  I agree there must never be any question of giving a present by legislation to past investors.  Incentive is the one thing that must be considered. But this section is giving a present.  There is nothing whatever of incentive in this section.  There is nothing whatever in Section 4 which will induce one penny piece extra to be invested in Irish industry.  If there was in Section 4 an incentive for future investment, then the case the Minister has made would have been a perfect case.  But there is no incentive.  The sole reason for Section 4 is to put the shares of Irish industries already subscribed, already provided and already utilised into a different category from those of other countries.  There is a strong case for doing that but it is a case that must be administered with complete fairness, complete justice and complete equity.</P>
      <P>There is no case whatever for giving a present to people who subscribed to Irish industry since 1932 and not giving the same treatment to those who subscribed in the 1923-32 period.  If there was any element of justice in Section 4 as it stands, I could understand the Minister's viewpoint.  But that is not the case.  Section 4 will do exactly what the Minister said a few minutes ago should not be done.  If that is to be done, and the Minister is going to do it, then it should be done fairly in relation to all concerned. When I was speaking a moment ago I never mentioned anything about one Government or another Government, and it would be a very sorry day if anybody got the impression that Exchequer benefits would go according as to whether legislation was introduced by one particular Government or another.  It should be considered on a much broader basis.  There is, undoubtedly, therefore, from that aspect also, every argument in favour of my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case the Minister made, that we will have to go back behind 1923 to the days when we were controlled by the British, is not one that will bear any real examination.  The Minister knows as well as I do that that is a <Col N="18" /> very flimsy argument.  I thought the Minister would reject any argument of that sort that might come to his hand. We have done many things since the inception of this State which we would never have done if that argument were accepted.  We must all agree that a new set of circumstances arose with the transfer of our financial powers from the British on 1st May, 1923.  If any date is chosen for giving what amounts to a present, for giving something not merely from an incentive point of view&mdash;and Section 4 has not an incentive point of view&mdash;the operative date and the date that should be given, in all responsibility, is the date of the inception of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will have to admit that there is a great difference between a change of legislation back to pre-1932 and, as it were, an improvement of the legislation that was passed in 1932.  The Minister who brought in that Act in 1932 purported to give relief in income-tax to those who put their money into Irish industry. He did put in certain safeguards which he thought were necessary.  Certain of these safeguards have proved to be cumbersome and, I suppose, some people would argue, even unjust. Some of these safeguards were removed by my predecessor last year and I am now removing others.</P>
      <P>The recommendations were made by the Industrial Credit Company who put it very strongly that some of the companies whose shares are affected by this clause that was passed in 1932 have actually suffered disabilities that other companies did not suffer.  It was really an attempt, if you like, to give equity to all under the clause that was passed in 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not a great deal as far as cost goes in this section.  It is to remove certain anomalies that exist and to try to get the scheme that was thought out in 1932 to work smoothly and equitably as between all the companies concerned.  I feel that that is a very different matter from going back to before 1932.  The Minister in 1932 who was concerned with this held out incentives to those who would invest in Irish companies.  Since that, some <Col N="19" /> people found that they did not get the benefit that was held out at the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, of course, that in certain of these issues they knew that they would not get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It has, in effect, however, worked out rather inequitably between one company and another, and it is for that reason, I presume, that the Minister last year tried to remove some of these anomalies and that I am trying to remove some of the others now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me correct the Minister at once.  First of all, I am absolutely positive that no company which published in its prospectus that it was getting the relief was denied that relief by any Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  Of course, some applied who did not get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Application is one thing.  The investors would judge by the prospectus.  I removed certain disabilities last year for one sole purpose&mdash;I think I made it quite clear in the House at the time&mdash;that certain issues of Irish companies, because of the restriction on &ldquo;rights&rdquo; and bonus issues, had to be subdivided, that the fact of their subdivision made their shares far less marketable and that the general marketability of shares of Irish industries was a good point in favouring new investment in Irish industry. I do not think this section does provide for any increase in that marketability, nor do I think it provides the incentive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, if I may say so, certain points arising on this amendment that really arise on the section itself and what I propose to do, therefore, is to deal with them more fully on the section. I do not know whether the Minister considers that the report of the Industrial Credit Company is a confidential document or not.  If it is a confidential document, I would not <Col N="20" /> dream of quoting any part of it here. If it is not, I would ask the Minister to quote where in that report it is stated that this will act as an incentive for future investment.  I do not think it is so stated.  It is stated, certainly, that the subdivision of shares acts against marketability.  That subdivision of shares was removed last year.  There is no other argument, to my recollection, utilised for this.  The only case that can be made for it is that it is desirable to put Irish industry in a different category for investors from foreign industry.  I agree, but it should be all Irish industry, not a selection.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I explained already.  For future issues, there may be some incentive if an investor in Irish industrial securities sees a new company coming along and, if he is a very keen person, he may say that the passage of this section will give him a better chance, but I am not relying very much on that.  As I explained in answer to the Deputy's case for his amendment, it is not that there is an incentive in this section, but that it irons out certain difficulties that arose out of the incentive section of 1932.  I do not think it is claimed that it gives any further incentive.  After all, the Deputy, as Minister last year, did iron out some of these difficulties himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would not mind explaining what the difficulties are.  I thought I ironed out last year all the difficulties that remained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one perhaps I could mention.  The public issue is one <Col N="21" /> of the things that have given some trouble.  Now it will be sufficient to quote it on the stock exchange.  I think that is one of the questions that remain in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was raised on the Finance Bill last year. I gave an assurance that it had always been dealt with administratively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I am not saying the Deputy did not say so but I do not think it is being dealt with administratively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have got that advice had it not been true.  The difficulty that arose about the words &ldquo;public issue&rdquo; was in the case of shares which went to the Industrial Credit Company and were subsequently offered for sale by them.  The question was whether that was a public issue or not.  That has always been treated as a public issue.  I was so assured and I am quite certain that the assurances I got were accurate.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister is not correct when he says there is any difficulty in relation to public issues.  Let us look to what Section 4 does.  Sub-section (1) merely acts as the vehicle for inserting a new section into the original section.  It does one good thing&mdash;it changes the issue of the certificate from the Minister for Finance to the Revenue Commissioners.  Any Minister for Finance will give such a certificate on the recommendation of the Revenue Commissioners.  In its original form it was adding unnecessary administrative trouble.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I think it is undesirable that in tax legislation there should be any suggestion that the political head of the Department had any power to give or withhold benefits.  That would be highly undesirable.  Therefore, I welcome the change that the persons to give the certificate are now the Revenue Commissioners rather than the Minister for Finance.  As far as the remainder of the section is concerned, I think it follows, by and large, the original section.  I cannot see any difficulty that is removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to sub-section (2), that <Col N="22" /> has the effect of withdrawing certain conditions that were included in the Finance Act, 1935, in the analogy of the Control of Manufactures Acts, 1932 and 1934.  I do not know whether I am to take from sub-section (2) of this section that, when the Government have enacted this, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will repeal the Control of Manufactures Acts?  Certainly, those Acts require amendment I hope that the fact that the Government as a whole have approved sub-section (2) of Section 4 of this Bill means that they will seek the amendment of the Control of Manufactures Acts as well.</P>
    <P>As far as sub-section (3) is concerned, that is merely a saver because we are granting with retrospective effect.  Sub-section (4) is also a saver. I cannot see anywhere in which the operative sub-section which is sub-section (1), removes any difficulty.  I am always willing to learn and I am waiting now to learn a little more from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps there is only a very small difference at first sight but the important thing in this section is to bring shares in that are quoted on the stock exchange.  Of course, there is the other change&mdash;it may be small but I think it is overdue&mdash;that the Revenue Commissioners should deal with this rather than the Minister.</P>
      <P>With regard to this question of incentive, I think Deputies will have to admit that when most difficulties in regard to shares and interest on shares qualifying for relief of income-tax have been removed, it should improve the marketability generally of Irish industrial shares.  That was the aim of this section and I am sure it was the aim of the section the Deputy brought in last year: to improve marketability generally.</P>

That is the aim.  It was put very strongly to us by the Industrial Credit <Col N="23" /> Company.  I should like to have time to look it over again.

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem, Sir, to have put down an amendment indicating that I was opposing Section 11 but of course it is Section 10 that deals with petrol duty, not Section 11.  I only mention that because courtesy requires that I give notice to the Minister.  I am afraid I must have given notice of the wrong section.  However, I think the Minister was pretty well aware of what was in my mind when I indicated that I was going to oppose the section.</P>
      <P>Under the existing legislation the Minister has administrative power, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to repay any duty that is charged on mineral hydrocarbon light oil.  When petrol duties were increased in August, 1948, a provision was introduced administratively to ensure that farmers using tractors which worked on petrol would not have to pay the additional increase.  The purpose of course was to ensure that there would not be any brake on production. The figure fixing the duty in 1948 was 1/2 per gallon and as a result of the licensing provision made at that time, operating under the 1938 Act, repayment was made at the rate of 6d. per gallon in respect of petrol used in agricultural tractors and stationary engines used for agricultural purposes. That repayment rate was increased to 8d. per gallon when the duty was increased in May, 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those two occasions of course were occasions on which the inter-Party <Col N="26" /> Government was in power and on each of those occasions we deemed it desirable and necessary in the national interest that there should be no brake on production and that therefore nothing should be done which might in any way deter farmers from using petrol driven tractors.  The Minister's Party came into power in 1951 and in the Budget of 1952 the petrol duty was increased from 1/4 to 1/9½ a gallon. On this occasion when Fianna Fáil got into power there was no remission for production on the land.  Last year I found it necessary to increase the petrol duty but I operated the administrative provisions.  I indicated in my Budget speech that I would operate the administrative provisions virtually to offset the entire increase in petrol duty where it was used for that productive purpose.  I think it was purely a round figure of ¼d. that was included because the duty was brought up by 5¾d. and it was impossible to operate it in farthings from the repayment point of view.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister has again deemed it necessary&mdash;we have had long discussions on the question of petrol duty and I do not intend to go into the matter again&mdash;to increase the duties but again he has followed the pattern of his predecessor in 1952. Again the Fianna Fáil Party have indicated that they are not prepared to give a rebate for production.  There are not many petrol driven tractors in the country but there are a certain number and it seems to me that the cost of any such remission in favour of the farmer who uses such a tractor can amount only to a trifling sum.  At the same time it is a rotten principle to reject the practice which existed before of exempting this productive work.  The Minister and his colleagues correctly called for more production from the land but as soon as the Fianna Fáil Party get into office, if the opportunity arises, they do their utmost, through this type of imposition, to prevent production.  That is what this section is doing, without the administrative provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another principle which I should like to mention and that is the principle of giving a rebate <Col N="27" /> on certain taxes.  When the amount of rebate gets too high and when the margin between the price of petrol to any particular class and to the ordinary person becomes too great, there is always the danger of the abuse of the rebate.  I may say that is one of the principal reasons why I thought it would be unwise to give this rebate, because the margin would become very big.</P>
      <P>We all know, I am sure, that these things are being used only by a few people.  The great majority of the farmers work the scheme honestly and squarely, and there is no abuse, but we must keep our eyes on the small minority, or few, who abuse the privileges they got, and that abuse is likely to increase as the gap becomes bigger.  The amount involved would not be an insurmountable difficulty for the Minister.  The number of farmers who have petrol tractors is falling, as is shown by the amount paid out in rebate over the past two or three years.  I think, generally speaking, these rebates are bad and we should try to do away with them as far as possible.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Brennan had been in the House, he would have <Col N="28" /> realised there was no necessity for any of the Opposition to be present for this section because our record is completely clear.  For the benefit of Deputies, I should like to repeat some of it.  The situation in relation to petrol duties was that, in 1948 and 1951, when there was a question of increasing them, provisions were made by virtue of which the increased taxation was not passed on to a farmer using a petrol tractor for production.  Fianna Fáil in 1952 found it necessary to increase petrol duties.  Did they give the same benefits to farmers using petrol tractors?  No, they did not.  In 1956, I found it necessary to increase petrol duties, but I provided that there would not be a similar increase in relation to petrol fuel utilised for production on the land.  Fianna Fáil came on again in 1957 and did the same thing.  In 1952 and in 1957, when Fianna Fáil were the Government on both occasions, and when they increased petrol duties, they allowed no remission for farmers producing from the land with petrol tractors.  In 1948, 1951 and 1956 the inter-Party Government in power gave a rebate in each case. With that history there, Deputy Brennan will easily understand why it was not necessary for any Deputies on this side of the House to be in on the discussion of this section.</P>

They gave the rebate only on their own taxes and if they felt it was just, they should have given a rebate on the Fianna Fáil taxation also.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 15, to delete &ldquo;new.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment and amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are all cognate.  Provisions <Col N="30" /> in respect of investment allowances apply only to new shipping under this section.  There are many companies&mdash; perhaps not so many, but there are companies&mdash;which are small and which frankly have not got the funds to buy new ships.  Last year, when I was introducing the additional allowances for shipping, after representations had been made to me, I provided that the payment of an initial allowance or an additional allowance for ships should cover not merely new ships but secondhand ships.  In his provisions in Part V, the Minister has deliberately restricted the investment allowance to new ships.  He has deliberately excluded secondhand ships.</P>
    <P>I think that is a mistake.  Certain small companies cannot buy new ships and should be assisted to buy more modern ships than the ones they have at present, even though those ships may have been once used.  The cost of any such amendment could only be trifling. I accept that if there were not some restriction in it, there might be a series of sales between some companies which would mean that a fraudulent company could get more than one allowance of tax.  That can easily be covered in the manner I have dealt with in sub-section (4).  Alternately, I should be quite happy if the Minister would treat as new a secondhand ship coming from another country.</P>
    <P>Our aim should be to get increased shipping on our register.  The smaller companies, more often than not, buy secondhand ships from other countries. There is a difference in relation to ships being bought secondhand and anything else which is bought secondhand, inasmuch as a certificate is available for them.  The purchaser of any ordinary machine has no way of knowing whether or not it is good or bad, except his own knowledge and also that of any experts he may employ. However, Lloyds' experts are to be found all over the world.  When buying a secondhand ship, it is easy for the purchaser to ensure that it is in suitable order because the ship will be certified by an independent body&mdash; a body which has to be very accurate and exact in its requirements as <Col N="31" /> otherwise it would not be adequate for insurance risks.  I think the Minister should accept this amendment&mdash;either that or without the provision that the ships must have come on to the Irish register for the first time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question at issue is the initial allowance and the investment allowance.  Deputies are probably aware that machines ordinarily used by factories get the initial allowance only when they are new.  The exception was made last year in regard to ships.  A ship need not be new to get the initial allowance when it comes into the hands of an Irish owner.  We are now bringing in further relief, that is, an investment allowance for a new ship.  The investment allowance is a more valuable concession.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman is arguing that we should give the investment allowance to the purchaser of a secondhand ship as well as to the purchaser of a new ship and thus put the purchaser of the secondhand ship on the same level as the person buying a new ship.  As the Bill stands, the purchaser of the new ship gets the investment allowance and the person buying the secondhand ship will get the initial allowance.  It is better to leave it that way.  We should give more encouragement to those who are buying new ships as they are more valuable, not only to the buyer but to the country generally.</P>
      <P>I urge that the Dáil agree to leave things as proposed in the Bill and at least let us see how things work out for a few years.  It is always possible to make amendments for the improvement of people, but it is not so easy to face them with a disimprovement. It is always possible to make amendments to improve the lot of the beneficiary.  I urge, therefore, that the Dáil agree to leave things as they are for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's last amendment, I do not know how he would view that amendment if the Dáil were to decide not to make any change in regard to the new ship.  If it were accepted with his other amendments, I think it would mean that the first buyer would get the investment allowance <Col N="32" /> and that subsequent buyers would get the initial allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I can say what I want to say now as, quite frankly, I was looking at a subsequent amendment when Section 14 was passed.  I intended to speak about the levies and the confirmation of the amendments made in Section 14.  I do not know whether or not they really come under Section 28: I suppose they do not, strictly speaking. Perhaps I might just say I was glad the Minister, on the Second Stage, confirmed what I said in relation to motor cars.  He confirmed that it was only when his Government changed the provisions of the previous levies that it was necessary to have regard to the provisions of the 1938 and 1948 Trade Agreements with Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be wrong if I did not say that, when we found ourselves in balance of payments difficulties, we made it clear that it was necessary for us to take certain steps, of a temporary nature, notwithstanding the provisions of those trade agreements, and that that necessity was undoubtedly appreciated.  When the Minister changed the temporary character of the levies and brought in the amendments under permanent customs duties, he got himself into difficulties.  I was glad that, somewhat inadvertently, the Minister let the cat out of the bag <Col N="33" /> when replying on the Second Stage.  He made it clear that what I had said on the earlier stages was correct and not what Deputy Lemass said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night we were talking about the attitude which is beginning to be fostered, I think, in the country that we are spending rather too much money on hospital buildings and on health services generally, and that we have done so for the past few years.  I very much hope that the Minister will not listen to those suggestions or be in any way influenced by them.  It would be a very sad and unfortunate thing were the people to be frightened into cutting down on the Minister's policy or the Party's policy in relation to health services generally in the years gone by.  I think it would be wrong if we allowed ourselves to be panicked into a sort of persecution mania or complex by the cost of health services.</P>
      <P>The Minister's opening statement contained his best vindication&mdash;I think he recognised that himself&mdash;for the policy of the Department of Health over the past ten or 15 years or even longer.  He gave the proposed expenditure in this Estimate on hospital services.  Then he gave the very striking morbidity and mortality figures over the past few years.  Since pre-war days the morbidity and mortality rates in respect of children and infants and the maternity and tuberculosis mortality rates have shown quite a remarkable fall.  The Minister has every reason to be satisfied with the return which the public have received for the moneys laid out over the years.  In his statement I think he conceded that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure on health is not really any more extravagant than that in any of the other Departments of State.  We cannot expect to run our health services at a profit.  If we want to save lives, reduce disease rates and the disability associated with disease, then we have to pay for it.  We have, as I have said, the additional considerable comfort from the taxpayers' and rate-payers' point of view that over the past 20 or 30 years they have been saved by the Hospitals Sweep Fund to <Col N="35" /> the extent of about £30,000,000 which they would normally have to provide themselves.  We would have had to seek it in the form of rates paid or in the form of taxation.</P>
    <P>If we are coming to the stage at which it is considered necessary to call upon the taxpayer to start paying the full or a greater percentage of the costs of providing hospitals after almost 30 years of relief from such impositions, then I do not think the Government should be unduly concerned. The people generally&mdash;there is none I know of at any rate&mdash;have no regret at all for the moneys we have spent to create the present position of greatly reduced morbidity and mortality rates amongst all sections of our people.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the humanitarian point of view altogether, the existence of preventable disease is a very costly thing.  The maintenance of our sanatoria or fever hospitals in the old days was an extremely costly business for the people both from the point of view of rates and taxation.  I do not know what the present cost of sanatorium treatment is per patient but I suppose it is £8, £9 or £10 per week.  That is because of the existence of preventable disease, a disease which, by the provision of proper diagnostic and treatment facilities, can be and I believe will be, in the very reasonably near future, practically totally eliminated.</P>
    <P>From the hard-hearted actuarial point of view, that will be a very considerable saving to the community generally.  When we proceed to reduce the cost of those institutions throughout the country, as they progressively become redundant, we will find less and less demand on central funds for their maintenance.  Then we will be able to concentrate all the funds at our disposal on the provision of really first-class services for the diagnosis and treatment of unavoidable disease in well-staffed, well-equipped hospitals and institutions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins was speculating on whether we had spent the money wisely or fruitfully or not, and the Minister also speculated in the same way.  At this stage, we can only <Col N="36" /> wonder whether we have expended the money to the best possible advantage over the past 30 years.  I have read where we have been criticised by outsiders because of the number of hospitals we have built here and the number of beds which are available. I have equally read in a French hospital journal where we have received the highest praise indeed for the very intelligent way in which the money has been laid out in the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>My attitude to both these opinions is that, while it is very pleasant to have these people take an interest, cursory or otherwise, in our affairs, we are the best judges of what we want for our people and what we intend to give them.  Consequently, I feel we should not be in any way moved by either the praise or criticism of these people.  In so far as we are close to the problem, we know the needs of our people; we know their attitudes of mind; we know the pattern of life of our people better than others.  We know what we started from and what is required.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins criticised the arrangement of the local government system which ordained that we should have only county hospitals or by which in one way or another, it worked out that we would have county hospitals. He questioned the desirability of the positioning of hospitals by the county. I myself have often wondered whether that was wise.  At the same time, one has to remember that we were and we are at all times servants of public opinion in these things.  We have to bear in mind the local pattern of life in each small area in our society.  The attitude to the county boundaries has become too deeply ingrained in our people, I think, to override their wishes in that regard.  If they want a hospital in their own county area, the Hospital Commission, the authority which in the past dealt with these matters, was wise, I think, in its decision to provide us with the county hospitals.</P>
    <P>Ideally, if one were a dictator&mdash;I am not suggesting in the slightest that Deputy O'Higgins had any inclinations towards dictatorship&mdash;and if one had dictatorial powers, presumably one <Col N="37" /> could work out an ideal pattern or plan or blueprint on paper, which would follow certain demographic patterns which would, according to different theories, suit the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>I think it was wiser for the commission to accept the pattern of living of people in a county and to accept the necessity for a county hospital, leaving the county as the regional area.  I agree that anomalies occurred in Athlone, which is a very unfortunate case.  It is an exception where they have not got a hospital and which is an ideal centre, one would think, for a county hospital.  Again, Wicklow is another area where it would be very difficult to find a suitable site for a county hospital, because of the mountains running down the centre, which divide the county into two separate areas from the point of view of transport and accessibility.</P>
    <P>Transport and accessibility are important considerations in the positioning of hospitals.  Where possible, there should be accessibility from the point of view of the patients, in the first instance, and visitors to the patients, in the second instance.  That is, so I should imagine, a very important consideration in deciding or framing the general overall pattern for the distribution of hospitals in the country as a whole.  The hospital service should be based on the district hospital, with the rather more difficult case going to the county hospital and then the complicated case, for the specialist care, going to the regional hospital.  That is all based on the general practitioner, who should have at his disposal the county clinics, which would tour round at various intervals with the various specialists&mdash;the orthopaedic specialist, the ear, nose and throat specialist, the gynaecologist and the radiologist&mdash;so that the general practitioner would have these at his disposal in the county clinics as a first-class service which would decide what type of hospital care is required by his patient, either the county hospital at one level or the regional hospital service at another.</P>
    <P>I think that was, broadly, the pattern they had in mind and which I am glad to say appears to be transpiring, in spite of the different vicissitudes <Col N="38" /> of the Department of Health over the years.  It seems that, broadly, there is this decentralisation of our medical services which was always, in my view, a very desirable thing indeed. At one stage, nearly all roads led to Dublin.  Any worthwhile medicine available was to be found in Dublin. Broadly speaking, that was true. Galway and Cork had their centres, but there was too much centralisation in the Dublin area.  Now that has been broken up, not without a certain amount of heart-searching on the part of the Dublin practitioners, no doubt. At the same time, from the point of view of the patient, there is now a greater availability of high level specialist, diagnostic and treatment service becoming available throughout the whole length and breadth of the country.  That is a most desirable feature, which I hope the Minister will continue to develop in the years of his office.</P>
    <P>Some references were made to the quality or, it was said, the unnecessarily high standard of the building which has gone on.  I do not think the Minister should have any remorse or recrimination about the quality of building which we have indulged in during the years.  We were all faced, when in office, with the problem as to whether we should cut our standards or build of the highest possible quality that money could buy.  I know all about &ldquo;cutting one's cloth according to one's measure,&rdquo; but there is a very practical consideration in building well.  First of all one could depend upon the local authorities to raise the money for the maintenance of the buildings once they were provided in each area.  Of course there is great reluctance to do that.  There are other demands on the rates besides the maintenance of buildings already provided for the different areas.</P>
    <P>In consequence, one of the important considerations is to provide buildings which will continue to give good service with the minimum possible maintenance.  The result is that one does find a considerable amount of terrazzo and very high quality timbers with first quality steel in many local authority institutions.  I am completely <Col N="39" /> unrepentant in regard to any decisions for which I was responsible in that regard.  If you give low quality buildings they will fall to pieces in a very short time.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have seen the attempts of medical people, of nurses and others, to work in what 20 or 30 years ago were called temporary buildings.  They go on being called temporary buildings long after attempts have been made to provide good satisfactory services in them.  On a modern building which was provided during the period of office of a previous Minister, a unit which was the prototype of the big regional sanatorium, superlatively built and equipped, nothing but a negligible sum was spent on maintenance in the nine or ten years during which I have had knowledge of it.  At the same time, other temporary buildings which I have known continue to be repaired and repainted in order to maintain something like reasonable conditions.</P>
    <P>There is another side to this big bill for our hospitals.  Remember that our hospitals are not being built for this year or next year.  They are being built with an expectation of life of presumably 20 or 30 years or more.  Consequently, one must take that into consideration in adding up the cost.  The cost should be spread over a period of 20, 30 or 40 years which is, I think, the reasonable expectation of life of the average hospital, particularly the general hospital.  The other types of hospital which Deputy T.F. O'Higgins mentioned, hospitals which are likely to become redundant after some few years, can be readapted in other directions. I doubt very much, when one looks at the overall picture of expenditure on hospitals and takes into consideration the expectation of life of these institutions, whether one could regard the initial expenditure on them as very unreasonable.  I believe that the money should be spent in providing high quality institutions.  Such expenditure would be, in my opinion, a first class investment.</P>
    <P>There is only one point on which I have any doubt and that is in relation to sanatoria.  If I had been responsible <Col N="40" /> for the early planning of sanatoria I think I would not have accepted the pavilion system.  I would have preferred to provide the multi-storey type of building on the assumption that sanatoria were meant to be closed, or ultimately to become redundant.  I do not want to over-simplify the matter but buildings for the treatment of such diseases as tuberculosis should be provided with a view to becoming redundant and that these institutions would later be redirected towards some other aspects of one's health campaign.</P>
    <P>However, the institutions that have been built are performing a very useful function and, as I have said, I think they will be needed for the best part of their expectation of life.  I refer particularly to the national regional institutions.  We have not yet completely overcome tuberculosis, though the end is in sight.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy T. F. O'Higgins on the question of priority for the city hospitals.  He referred to three&mdash;the Coombe, St. Laurence's, and St. Vincent's.  He asked for priority for the Coombe Hospital. From what I can gather from people who know about these things, there is a tremendous need for the maternity type of hospital, and if it be possible at all for the Minister to provide such a hospital I hope he will come down on the side of trying to relieve the tremendous pressure on the Rotunda, the Coombe Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital.</P>
    <P>It is a pity in many ways that in the very big building programme that has gone on we did not get round to providing a new voluntary general hospital in the city.  I do not think the fault for that lies entirely with the Department of Health.  There was a considerable amount of difficulty in coming to agreement on many matters among the authorities concerned.  That, I believe, led to considerable delay.  I, personally, was very glad to press ahead with the provision of what I had hoped would be a magnificent municipal hospital&mdash;St. Kevin's.  With the expenditure of a considerable amount of money the Department has been able to bring it to a very high pitch <Col N="41" /> of efficiency as a result of the alterations that have taken place over the last ten years or so.</P>
    <P>May I bring in the name of Mr. Seamus Murphy in that regard?  He has worked with great dedication over the years and, may I say, with a considerable amount of frustration.  It was one of my main ambitions to see a first class, well-staffed, well-equipped municipal hospital in the city.  I felt it would be good for the voluntary hospitals to find some competition, some pace-setter.  The pace is being set by local authority hospitals.  It is a great tribute to the whole principle of the local authority health services that in such a short time they have been able to exorcise the appalling reputation which the whole state of these institutions had up to a very short time ago.</P>
    <P>It is a great tribute to the staff there, to the Department of Health, to Mr. Seamus Murphy and those others associated with him, that they have been able to create there a reputation for a very high standard of care and attention and of medicine.  I have nothing to do with the hospital itself, but I understand, from talking to patients who go there, that the position now is that many people would prefer to go to St. Kevin's than to some of our voluntary hospitals.  I do not get any great pleasure out of that, but I do think it is useful to have an example of a municipal hospital that can be competently run.  That hospital is now available to the citizens of Dublin at St. Kevin's.</P>
    <P>We have had to spend a fabulous amount of money, for a small country, I suppose, in the past two years on providing hospitals and health services. However, I do not think that anybody could suggest that there was any flagrant misuse of the money or any spending for spending's sake, or building up hospitals just for the fun of it.  These hospitals, these institutions, these services were all provided and paid for, for the simple reason that they were very badly needed.</P>
    <P>As regards the voluntary institutions, which no doubt worked as hard and as enthusiastically as they could out of the resources available to them, the amount of money we have had to pay <Col N="42" /> in the past 20 years is a measure of their inability to meet the real need for hospital services.  There is no reason in the world why the two services should not go on, one with the other.  It is only right to remember, however, that the municipal health services generally do a vastly greater scope of work, taking all our services into consideration&mdash;mental hospitals, tuberculosis and fever hospitals, general hospitals and medical services.  It is the State that provides the greater part of our health services in the community.</P>
    <P>I am always surprised, therefore, when I hear the criticism from the proponents of the voluntary system of medicine who criticise what they call State intervention or State interference. If the State do not do it, nobody else will do it.  The work has been there for 30, 40 and 50 years to be done and it has not been done.  The State had no alternative, in my view, but to take the steps it has taken over the years to provide services which the voluntary organisations, who have done good work in this regard, could not do.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I am surprised whenever I hear any criticism of the State coming to the aid of the voluntary institutions.  Why should they resent this?  Why should they not welcome this?  If their main concern is the care of the sick and the aged, the nursing of the sick and the aged, the prevention of disease, the elimination of pain and the suffering associated with pain, why should they not welcome any agency, any interest, that chooses to relieve their burden?  Why are they critical of services which are provided, and so excellently provided, on the whole, by the local authority?</P>
    <P>As regards the quality of the building undertaken, one of the finest complaints I have ever listened to is that our sick are too well housed.  That I had a tiny part in housing them in that way is a matter of great pleasure to me.  It is about time that, in regard to something, our people should feel they are getting as good as, if not better than, what people get in similar conditions in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Another point with which I wish to <Col N="43" /> deal is the death rate and the moroidity rate in relation to tuberculosis. I only make the point in order to make a further point about extended health services generally.  There is a feeling that if we had not spent money on one big thing or another, B.C.G., mass radiography, sanatoria, infectious diseases regulations and the magnificent Fianna Fáil 1947 Health Act, on the free, no means test treatment of tuberculosis under that Act, if we had not provided all those things over the years, the death rate and the morbidity rate would have fallen anyway.  The suggestion has been put around that the death rate and the disease rate have fallen simply because new drugs and new medicines have become available.</P>
    <P>It was put about in the beginning by people who merely wanted to denigrate the activities of the Department of Health in their drive to get rid of tuberculosis.  That is unimportant, however, as long as people do not accept it as being true.  There are no doubt magnificent drugs available which have revolutionised the treatment of tuberculosis and made it a relatively simple thing to treat the consumptive when he does fall sick and make him well again.  The important thing is that we could not get these drugs, he could not be brought to treatment by these drugs, unless all these other ancillaries were there, unless there was a free diagnostic radiological service, unless there was a B.C.G. preventive vaccination service, unless there was a free treatment service in our sanatoria, unless there were infectious disease regulations for the dependents of people who went into sanatoria.</P>
    <P>Unless these institutions had been built throughout the country the drugs could not be made available, the services of thoracic surgeons could not have been made available and these lives could not have been saved.  Our disease statistics, our morbidity and mortality statistics to-day would be on a par with what they were prior to the 1947 Health Act, or on a par with what they are in many other countries in the world to-day, many undeveloped <Col N="44" /> countries, countries subjected to exploitation and colonialism of one kind or another, such as Africa, Egypt, Sudan, Indo-China or the Philippines. There are many others I could mention in which the incidence of T.B. and the death rate from T.B. are still outrageously high.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, it would be wrong for people to go away with the idea or to suggest that all this would have happened anyway; we have the drugs and they kill the tubercle for us.  I merely resent it from this point of view.  I believe that the early diagnosis, the free, no means test idea incorporated in the 1947 Health Act&mdash;as far as I can recollect, it was the present Minister's Health Act or Deputy Dr. Ryan's Health Act&mdash;the infectious disease regulations, and all the other powers it gave to his successor to develop and expand health services in particular in relation to T.B., were more important factors in putting the Minister and so many of our people in a position to say to-day: &ldquo;We have seen a remarkable and gratifying reduction in disease and death rates from T.B.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is because I believe that the free, no means test principle has been the cause of this drop in disease and death rate figures that I earnestly advocate it and recommend it again to the Minister as being the ideal or the only principle under which it is possible to provide not only equitable health services but health services which will work effectively, and which will give results. The proof is here and that is why I make this point.  All this nonsense about local authorities, health authorities and municipal authorities being unable to provide the health services is exploded.  It is all finished.  It was disproved years ago when the fever hospitals ended fever in this country.  I hope it is now exploded for the second time. That aspect of health services through the free, no means test principle is the way in which the best possible service can be given to the people.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister suggest, or hint rather in his speech, that he is concerned with mental diseases and with doing something for the mentally-diseased generally.  With <Col N="45" /> Deputy O'Higgins, I completely concur with this apparent decision of the Minister and I only hope that it is so.  I was concerned with the mental hospitals and mental hospital services generally when I was in the Department and I had some experience of them.  My own professional experience, of course, on this subject is nil and I am speaking merely as a layman now.  My only mental unrest or discomfort came from the tour that I did at one time of many of our mental hospitals.  I was left with the impression that a tremendous amount remains to be done in regard to them.</P>
    <P>As far as the treatment of mental disease is concerned, it is lagging a little bit behind, say, T.B., but I think that at last a changed attitude to mental illness is becoming evident.  We have moved away from the days of Bedlam when they locked them in, beat them and punished them, to the stage where there is a very much more understanding attitude of mind about the person whose mind is ill.  At the same time, we are unfortunately left with the old barrack-like, prison-like buildings in which these people are housed.  Equally, there is the rather appalling fact that the problem is a colossal one in relation to numbers. There are a large number of persons in our mental hospitals, so that I do not envy the Minister in any attempts he may make to deal with the question in a really effective way because it seems to me that to deal with it in such a way will cost a very considerable amount of money.</P>
    <P>I think there are various aspects of mental health which could be looked into.  First of all, there is the question of staffing.  It is possible that by staff changes and by legislation some alteration could be effected which would improve the present position in our mental hospitals.  The present medical superintendent of a mental institution seems to me to occupy a completely impossible position&mdash;that is, any that I have known anything about.  They were all men, to my own knowledge, any that I have known, who were extremely conscientious and hardworking, but the work they have to do is so completely diversified and so <Col N="46" /> completely varied in most cases, so completely remote from their profession, that it is difficult to believe that one is justified in making a doctor a medical superintendent of a mental hospital at all.</P>
    <P>Would it not be worth while considering the appointment of a lay administrative head of a mental hospital and allowing the medical head of that hospital, the medical superintendent, to occupy himself entirely with the purely medical duties of the hospital?  Certainly the men I knew had a certain amount of responsibility for the farm, for the medical side, for the domestic department, for the nursing side, together with the general overall administrative care of the institution itself.  There is no man who could cope with all these duties competently or efficiently at one and the same time.</P>
    <P>The pity of it is that a man becomes medical superintendent of such an institution only when he reaches his professional prime, having spent years of training and experience in subordinate positions.  It is at that stage then that he becomes superintendent of a mental hospital, part farmer and part everything else.  He is asked to look after a small village and he simply has not the time to use the knowledge and experience he has gained all through his professional life up to that stage for the benefit of those under his care. Would the Minister consider the desirability of arranging that the medical head of these institutions is left entirely free to concentrate on the purely medical work of the hospital?</P>
    <P>Mental illness can sometimes be prevented from becoming either serious or chronic.  The Act of 1945 marked an advance here in mental care.  The idea of the voluntary patient was fostered. That was an important development and it would be an excellent development if it were likely to expand.  If one wants to encourage patients to enter hospitals for voluntary treatment, one will have to make sure that, when they enter, they are not frightened out of it again or driven out of it because of the substandard conditions prevailing, the poor sanitary accommodation, <Col N="47" /> the poor dining facilities, the unsatisfactory kitchen arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have seen these things in some of our mental hospitals.  I concede that they do not exist in all of them.  There are some excellent hospitals in which the standard of care, equipment and accommodation is very high indeed. That is particularly so in the case of the newer hospitals.  In the older ones, possibly through nobody's fault, there is the appalling atmosphere of incarceration, the horribly drab surroundings, the drab clothes, the very primitive serving arrangements, the unsatisfactory kitchens, cooking facilities, dining halls and dormitories in which there is serious overcrowding.</P>
    <P>If that position were changed, I am certain that more people would seek voluntary treatment.  While such conditions persist, it is fruitless to expect patients to enter such hospitals voluntarily or to remain voluntarily in them. Where such conditions exist, the intentions of the 1945 Act are completely stultified and that Act was designed to encourage people to receive early treatment.</P>
    <P>That is again the humanitarian approach.  There is then the hardheaded actuarial consideration.  If admission to a mental hospital is delayed, the treatment of the patient is delayed.  If treatment is delayed, the patient progresses from subacute to acute and then to chronic.  When he reaches the chronic stage, he enters the hospital and will remain in it for the rest of his life, a burden on the taxpayer and the ratepayer.  If there is any hope at all of reducing the incidence of chronic mental illness by facilitating early and easy treatment, everything possible should be done to achieve that object.  Some attempt should be made to ensure that patients will find it less difficult to avail of out-patient facilities wherever they may require them.  There has been an extension in that direction, but there is still a certain lacuna in that regard.</P>
    <P>Recently I read a report to the effect that a number of old people are dumped into mental hospitals, not because they are mentally sick but because their relations do not want to <Col N="48" /> keep them at home any longer.  They are not difficult.  They are not dangerously sick mentally.  They are slightly troublesome.  The situation seems to me a very serious comment on our attitude towards our aged.</P>
    <P>I have received serious complaints about overcrowding in Grangegorman. I shall be glad to let the Minister have the facts.  There are too many beds in the wards and there is no room for lockers.  Food has to be carried around or kept under pillows.  There are inadequate seating facilities in the dayrooms. The nurses have to care for too many patients and they cannot therefore give the patients the best possible attention.  I do not suppose there is a more difficult form of nursing than that of nursing the mentally ill. It calls for a high degree of tolerance, understanding and patience.  It is indeed a great tribute to them that one hears so little complaint, remembering the difficult circumstances in which they find themselves.  At the same time, it would be well not to over-try them and to ensure that the number of patients under their care is reduced to the minimum.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the case of the mental defective.  There is no more pathetic or tragic illness than that of mental defectiveness.  It is bad enough for the child.  It is an appalling dilemma for the parent who is faced with the problem of deciding as between keeping the child at home, where it will be well treated, or consigning it to the care of strangers in some home or colony.  The tragedy, of course, from the parents' point of view is that if they keep the child at home, if the child is a low-grade mental defective, it will remain a low-grade mental defective.  If, on the other hand, they can trust the mental defective home or institution, it is possible that a low-grade mental defective can be educated into becoming a high-grade mental defective, closer to the normal mind, as a result of care and attention and education.</P>
    <P>That is the dilemma of many unfortunate parents.  They fear for the impatience which a stranger may visit on their children for one reason or another, these terribly difficult children <Col N="49" /> to care for and to nurse and, consequently, they fear letting them go away and they keep them at home.  In doing that, they do the children a terrible disservice because, of course, the time may come when the parent dies and the child then has to face going to an institution without any supervision at all.</P>
    <P>In that regard I should like to pay a particular tribute to the Brothers of St. John of God.  One of the greatest pleasures I had in the Department was in providing, as far as I could, any money for which the Brothers of St. John of God asked for the care of mental defectives.  I do not think that there is any section of our society caring for the sick which does greater, finer or nobler work than do these men in the care of mentally defective children.  I would urge on the Minister that, if he has any moneys at all at his disposal, he should do whatever he can to advance and further the opportunities for these men to expand and to continue to do the magnificent work which they are doing for children throughout the country at the present time.  It is a most wonderful thing indeed to visit the houses of the Brothers of St. John of God and to witness the care and love which they give to the children and the dedicated way in which they do their work in these very trying circumstances.</P>
    <P>I understand that in other countries, in Britain and elsewhere, it is accepted that the care of mental defectives is work which calls for men with a vocation, that very few lay people can tolerate mental defectives.  Consequently, people like the Brothers of St. John of God are welcomed in any country to which they go and most health authorities in other countries are only too delighted to get them and give them every possible facility to do this work.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bear that point in mind and give them every possible opportunity to create the institutions, to run, organise and to maintain them and that he will give them every possible facility to do their work under the best possible circumstances, that is, to have the smallest possible number of patients to each <Col N="50" /> brother and in that way relieve the minds of the parents and ensure that the highest possible number of low-grade mental defectives shall be given whatever opportunity medical science and care can give them to improve their chance in life and to become less burdened by the appalling cross of being mentally defective.</P>
    <P>There is one other work which these brothers do which I wish the Minister would bear in mind, that is, the treatment of the difficult child.  They have some clinics in the city here.  I do not know very much about them, I am afraid, except what I have read in the papers but it seems to me that it is a very fine idea that they should be given facilities for the out-patient examination of the difficult or the recalcitrant child.  A tremendous amount can be done for children such as these who are emotionally disturbed, who have a difficult home background or home circumstances, parents who do not understand the difficult emotional make-up of many children and who get into difficulties in rearing those children.  A tremendous amount can be done by psychiatrists for these children in their early years.</P>
    <P>I do not want to intrude something that possibly is not the Minister's concern but my whole case against the corporal punishment of children is that I feel the recalcitrant child is not a bad child but merely a child who is emotionally disturbed or who has some emotional disfunction in the background, in its home or in its own personal make-up, and that that should be treated, and treated by a medical person, and certainly not by beating or flogging.  However, I do not want to deal with that point at this stage but I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the importance of having these clinics throughout the larger city centres so that parents who have difficult children&mdash;and there are such children&mdash;will be in a position to bring them to experts for examination and advice in order to try to overcome the difficulties with which they are presented and which they cannot overcome themselves.</P>
    <P>I am a little disturbed to see the very small amount of money spent on <Col N="51" /> the county homes.  Would the Minister say whether very much has been done in relation to county homes over the last ten years?  Again, this is a vast problem, a very costly problem, but, again, it is one which we have to face. It is a measure of our civilisation, a measure of our Christian attitude, our Christian way of life.  How do we feel about the aged?  How should they exist?  How should they spend their last years?  Are we content with the type of county home in which many of them at present find themselves?</P>
    <P>I know that this comes back to the old idea that we must cut our cloth according to our measure but there are other expenses in which we indulge that we could cut down in order to meet what I consider are the primary needs of any civilised and Christian society, that is, in the first instance, the needs of the sick and then the needs of the aged.  Should we not see that the places in which the aged live are places in which we ourselves would not be ashamed or afraid to spend our last years?  The only criterion, the only standard, that I can understand, whether it be with regard to health, old age, education or anything else is what I would like for myself or my own children.</P>
    <P>I know some of the homes for the aged are all right.  There have been some very active local authorities and managers. There is one in Tipperary that is very good and one in Limerick that is very good also.  There is a magnificent home in Mallow that is run by an order of nuns in which there are simply superb conditions for the aged.  There is also the home run by the sisters in Kilmainham and a number of others. Generally speaking, the county homes, in my experience, leave a lot to be desired in relation to sanitary accommodation, service of food, cooking, buildings and the simple comforts of central heating or heating of some kind, club rooms, amenities for the winter months and the winter nights.  At any rate, I found they were grievously lacking.  They may have been improved since that time to the position that the Minister is now satisfied.  I wonder, if he has time, would he consider going <Col N="52" /> around, looking at these county homes and seeing if he is satisfied with the conditions in which the old people are living?</P>
    <P>Another point in relation to county homes is the regulations, which struck me as being terribly primitive.  One was the separation of husband and wife and the separation of children from the family when families were in there, which, fortunately, is very rare now.  Does the separation of husband and wife go on still?</P>
    <P>A further point was the type of clothes provided.  I was struck by the dreadfully prison-like clothes which I remember seeing in St. Kevin's some years ago.  I was slightly irate at the type of clothes until I was told that the combined purchasing section of the Department of Local Government made available a magnificent stock of clothes of all kinds for local authorities if they would care to call on them.  There was no need for the prison-like clothes at all.  It was merely a matter for the local health authority to call on the combined purchasing section of the Department of Local Government for this selection of clothes in order not to have our people in these county homes in uniform, as they seemed to me to be.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like the Minister to bear in mind is to try to give these people more freedom to go out walking and to go into the local villages if they wish, not to treat them as if they were in a remand home. They are our old people, who have grown old in the service of the State and of the community.  They have educated and brought up families. Surely they have the right to live as if they were at home?  As far as I can gather, St. Kevin's has become a headline for other local authorities in that matter.  Very considerable improvement has been made in relation to the provision of living conditions and comforts of one kind or another for the old people there.  I wonder would the Minister bear that in mind in his years in the Department and not forget the county homes which, to a certain extent, are part of his responsibility?</P>
    <P>A few words about deficits.  The deficits of the voluntary hospitals are <Col N="53" /> apparently quite a problem for the Minister.  They have grown very considerably since before the war.  In 1935, they were £73,000 and in 1955, about £1,000,000.  They have risen even more than the cost of living.  We cannot say it is all due to the cost of food and the cost of living.  I wonder if the Minister has come to any decision at all about these voluntary hospitals? What will be their position in our future health services?  As the Minister said himself, the pattern of our health services must change.  Changing diseases will change the pattern of our health services, and the pattern of our voluntary hospitals' association with our health services, it seems to me at any rate, must be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The position is that they have changed very fundamentally since Professor Cunningham, in the Seanad on one occasion, said that a voluntary hospital is one mainly run by voluntary subscription and in which the doctors operate on their patients without charge.  If it ever were true, that has now changed very much.  Is it not a fact now that, because of the expansion of our health services and because of the expenditure of the Hospitals Trust Fund, we are now paying our doctors, and voluntary subscriptions are negligible for the running of these institutions?  We are paying our doctors, and I think quite rightly.  It is about time we stopped the silly, snob notion of so called free treatment in these institutions.  It is a heritage from the days of talking down to the poor and so on.  I think it is a silly affectation.  It is going out rapidly now, and it is a good thing that it should do so.  If the labourer is worthy of his hire, so is the doctor.  Pay him whatever he is worth and you are under no compliment to him.  I think that is the correct attitude.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, therefore, that we are no longer running our hospitals on voluntary subscription, with the exception of the Adelaide in this city.  They are being run either from the Hospitals Fund or from central Exchequer taxation and rates, because of local authority payments.  Are we to allow <Col N="54" /> them go on that way, expending very considerable sums of public money without any detailed supervision on our part, and by &ldquo;our&rdquo; I mean the public?</P>
    <P>The boards of these voluntary hospitals are not nominated nor, in the majority of cases, are they elected by any known democratic system.  They do not represent any group or section of our society, any mass cross-section of our society.  I do not know if they represent anybody at all.  Is it not about time we reconsidered that position?  Would the Minister consider extending the idea we introduced in the Meath Hospital Bill, through which some measure of democratic control over these institutions might be achieved?  The question is not so much the democratic control of these institutions as the democratic control of the expenditure of very vast sums of public money in the form of taxes and rates paid.</P>
    <P>Everybody is worried about the growth of the increase in the deficits. I believe it is due, on the whole, to the expansion of the services we have provided for the public, the improvement in many cases of equipment and the renewal of equipment after years of starvation in that regard.  I think that the increase in wages of one kind or another and the increase in fees are all factors which have increased the postwar costs and are partly to blame for the increase in the deficits.  But for those who are not satisfied that there is a justifiable and legitimate explanation for the increase, for those who are not satisfied that there has been reasonable, intelligent and careful spending of moneys in our voluntary hospitals, what do they propose to do about it?  Will successive Ministers come back here year after year telling us: &ldquo;That is the bill, pay it and smile&rdquo; and at the same time leave us in the position that we cannot ask any questions or ask for any details?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if it is his intention to continue tourist development in such areas as Bray, County <Col N="57" /> Wicklow, at the rate prevailing in 1952-1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The development scheme to which the Deputy refers was submitted to Bord Fáilte Éireann in February, 1955, and included works estimated at the time to cost £134,000 which would not be of a revenue earning character and which the promoters contemplated should be financed by way of a State grant.  The remainder of the scheme consisted of works of a revenue earning character estimated to cost £196,000 and it was proposed that a loan should be raised for which the guarantee of the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be sought under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.  The second part of the scheme could not, however, be undertaken until the works contemplated in the first part of the scheme had been done.</P>
      <P>In the course of a reply to a Dáil question by Deputy P. Brennan on the 8th May last year concerning the Bray development scheme, my predecessor stated that he was not in a position to indicate whether it would be possible to make provision for State grants towards meeting part of the cost of non-revenue earning works at tourist resorts.  In fact, it was decided in May of last year by the then Minister for Finance that grants for such a purpose could not be made until such time as national expenditure and savings had come more closely into accord.</P>
      <P>It is my aim to ensure the maximum possible exploitation of our potentialities in the field of tourism; and I have asked Bord Fáilte Éireann to review the provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts and submit proposals to me for the amendment of these Acts in any respects that seem to be necessary or desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attach great importance to the improvement of amenities at our tourist resorts, and, since assuming office, I have had consultations on the subject with Bord Fáilte Éireann, but I am not yet in a position to indicate what steps it may prove to be practicable to take <Col N="58" /> to stimulate the undertaking of such development works by local interests.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bray project is concerned, I am informed that, with the assistance of Bord Fáilte Éireann, it is hoped to undertake some minor improvement works at Bray this year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, for the purpose of reassuring the public on the question, he will state (1) whether the anterior poliomyelitis vaccine now being used here is of American or British origin, (2) if he can give reasonable guarantees of its efficacy in preventing anterior poliomyelitis, (3) if he can reassure the public as to its absolute safety in all cases, (4) if there are any exceptions which contra-indicate its use, (5) if unlimited supplies are available, and (6) up to what age it is desirable to use it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Replies to the queries put by the Deputy are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The poliomyelitis vaccine which is being used is of British origin, as recommended by the Medical Research Council of Ireland.</P>
      <P>(2)  I am advised that the vaccine represents a most useful protection against poliomyelitis and this advice is supported by the experience gained where it has been extensively used. While no absolute guarantee can be given that a vaccinated individual will not subsequently contract the disease, it can be taken that vaccination reduces this risk very appreciably.</P>
      <P>(3)  The vaccine used here is subject to most rigid tests both by the manufacturer and by the British Medical Research Council and no vaccine is released for use unless it successfully passes all the safety tests.  I understand that, since the introduction of the vaccine now being used here, there has been no case of poliomyelitis infection which could be definitely attributed to the use of the vaccine.</P>
      <P>(4)  Poliomyelitis vaccine, like other immunising agents, should not be given in certain circumstances, e.g., to a child who is temporarily unwell, whose general health is poor or who is suffering from any acute illness.  In particular, it should not be given where a case of poliomyelitis has recently occurred in the household.</P>
      <P>(5)  Limited supplies only are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6)  If supplies permitted, it would be <Col N="60" /> desirable to use the vaccine for all age groups susceptible to poliomyelitis. Experience in this country shows that the younger age groups contain the highest proportion of susceptible persons, and the Medical Research Council has advised that we should aim at vaccinating children up to ten years of age.</P>

Bíodh gur ghéill an Páirtí thall an Aireacht nua a chur ar bun, dúirt mórán acu ná raibh gá leis agus go raibh an córas oibre a bhí ann cheanna sách maith don obair a bhí le déanamh. <Col N="67" /> Bíodh is gurb í sin an tuairim a bhí acu thall, ghéill siad do bhunú na hAireachta.</P>
      <P>I mí Deireadh Fomhair seo caite, nuair a cheap mé Aire Stáit lán-aimsire d'obair na Gaeltachta, bhí cáineadh agus gearáin ag na Teachtaí thall ná raibh aon ghá le hAire lán-aimsire chun an obair a dhéanamh. Dúirt siad ná raibh gá le hAire nua a cheapadh don Rialtas le haghaidh an méid oibre a bhí le déanamh.

      <P>Anois, tá athrú meoin ann.  Tá athrú meoin tagtha ar an Rialtas seo agus ar an bPáirti thall.  Dúirt an Taoiseach nach bhfuil aon ghá le haon rud a rá faoin gceapachán nua seo. Ach, ón gcaint a rinne siad agus do réir na dtuairmí a nocht roinnt Teachtaí thall ag an am sin, bheadh níos mó iontaoibhe againn anois dá mba rud é go míneodh an Taoiseach dúinn cad é an t-athru aigne atá tagtha ar an Rialtas seo chun duine sa mbreis a chur isteach sa Rialtas agus duine áirithe a ceapadh agus a chur go lán-aimsearach i mbun obair na Gaeltachta.

Dá bhrí sin, déarfainn go mba chóir don Taoiseach an scéal a mhíniú níos fearr dúinn.  Ba cheart go dtuigfeadh sé go bhfuil gach aoinne sa Tigh seo i ndáiríre chun pé rud agus gach rud is féidir a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeilge a choimeád mar ghnáth-theanga na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht.

      <P>I do not want to be taken as objecting to the appointment of Deputy Moran as a member of the Government under any circumstances. I have nothing but the greatest sympathy for him in the arduous task he will have to undertake.</P>
      <P>The type of speech delivered in Irish by Deputy Mulcahy is the type of speech which is killing or helping to finish off the Irish language.  To my mind, to attempt at this stage to restore what is practically a dead language is like locking the stable door when the horse has gone.  Deputy Mulcahy has been a member of this House since its foundation and he helped in great measure, in setting up this House.  He has had all that time&mdash; the last 37 years&mdash;to see the mistakes that have been made in connection with the whole problem of the Irish language. The only solution he found at the end of the 37 years was the appointment of a Minister for the Gaeltacht to restore a language which, over the past 37 years, has gradually been dying away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to repeat anything which was said here yesterday by certain speakers, but it should be <Col N="69" /> brought home to the people that there are a number of cranks inside and outside this House and that it is on behalf of those cranks, and to appease those cranks, that this appointment of a Minister for the Gaeltacht has been made although all of us who have any common sense left realise that it is not a course that will revive the Irish language. Therefore, I have nothing but the greatest sympathy for a young man like Deputy Moran who, for the future, will be blamed if this revival does not take place.</P>

      <P>On the 24th October last, the then Taoiseach, Deputy J.A. Costello, appointed Deputy P. Lindsay to the position of Minister for the Gaeltacht.  The present Taoiseach, who was then the Leader of the Opposition, is reported at column 76 of the Official Report of that day as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are against this appointment. We think it should not be necessary to introduce a further member into the Government in order to get this work of the Gaeltacht done.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The nomination of a Minister for the Gaeltacht to-day seems to indicate a complete about-turn in the mind of the present Taoiseach compared with the views he expressed a few short months ago.</P>
      <P>I should be glad if the Taoiseach would tell us why he has now decided to appoint a Minister for the Gaeltacht in view of the fact that, when the inter-Party Government decided to appoint one, he indicated it was totally against his wishes as he did not think there was any need for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the boycott of Connacht by the present Taoiseach has at last ended.  In days gone by when Cromwell was here there was an old cry of &ldquo;To Hell or to Connacht.&rdquo;  Since the 20th March last, when the present Government was formed, the policy of that Government appeared to be &ldquo;To Hell with Connacht&rdquo;.  While I think the Taoiseach could possibly have got a better Minister, nevertheless, I am glad that at last Connacht, and particularly my own County Mayo, has one Minister.  Connacht was entitled to be granted that if there is to be any kind <Col N="70" /> of decent representation on the Government, as there was in the two inter-Party Governments.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity of saying that I think Connacht was entitled to better treatment, and, if Fianna Fáil suffered political defeats in the past at elections, it is due to their policy of leaving Connacht always outside the closed door.  I am not relying too much on their faithfulness to the present Taoiseach.  I am glad that boycott has ended.  As far as I and my Party are concerned, we will support the new Minister for the Gaeltacht in every way in regard to anything he can do towards reviving the language and bringing prosperity to the Gaeltacht.  I should like to know from the Taoiseach why he about-faced since last October in regard to the question of the appointment of a Minister.</P>

      <P>Mar gheall ar churam na Gaeltachta a chur ar Aire, cuid den difir a bhí idir mo thuairimse agus tuairim an Teachta Ua Maolchatha agus daoine eile gur cheap mise gurbh bhfear Rúnaí Parlaiminte don Rialtas a bheith ann.  Sin é an post a bhí ag an Teachta Ó Loingsigh nuair a bhí sé ina Rúnaí Parlaiminte nuair a bhí an Rialtas seo in oifig an t-am deireannach. Duirt mé gurbh fhearr é ná Aire.  Nuair a cuireadh an Aireacht nua ar bun cheapas gurbh fhearr deis a thabhairt don Aire nua an obair a dhéanamh dá mb'fhéidir leis é.  Ní dóigh liom gur ceart domsa, nuair atá an Aireacht curtha ar bun, í a scriosadh anois.  Mar sin, cheapas gurbh é rud <Col N="71" /> ab fhearr a dhéanamh leanúint leis an rud a bhí déanta agus Aire a cheapadh.</P>
      <P>Aireacht an deacair is ea í.  Tá ag teastáil, ní hamháin duine a chuirfeadh suim sa Ghaeilge agus i gcultúr na Gaeilge agus duine a chuirfeadh an teanga ar aghaidh agus a choimeadfadh beo í, ach go mbeadh fear gnótha ann.  Ceist eacnamaíoch is ea í chomh maith le ceist teanga.  Mar sin, cheapas gurb é an rud ab fhearr a dhéanamh duine a raibh eolas aige ar chúrsaí gnótha, chomh maith le bheith i ndon an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus suim a bheith aige sa Ghaeilge, a cheapadh. Sin é an fáth gur thoghas an duine atá luaite sa Rún.</P>
      <P>Mar gheall ar chúis na teanga agus an Ghaeilge a choimeád beo, tá a lán daoine a cheapann nach bhfuil an tsuim chéanna ag muintir na tíre sa teanga agus a bhí.  Ba mhaith liom go gcuirfí an cheist sin os comhair na ndaoine, mar ní hé sin an tuairim atá agamsa. Ceapadh gurbh fhéidir an teanga d'athbheochaint i gceann tamaill bhig, ach na daoine a thuig a dheacracht a bhí an cheist sin, ní raibh an tuairim sin acu.</P>
      <P>Ní féidir le haon Aire amháin an obair a dhéanamh mura bhfaighe sé ó gach Aire eile an cúnamh atá ag teastáil.  Sin é an rud a gheobhaidh an tAire nua.  Beidh sé ina bhall den Rialtas agus nuair a thiocfaidh sé os ár gcomhair le ceist ar bith a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht nó leis an teanga, is féidir leis na smaointe atá aige ar aon cheist a chur os ár gcomhair.</P>

      <P>With regard to the voluntary hospitals, the definition I gave, which appeared to fit, was that a voluntary hospital is one which is run mainly by subscriptions.  Those <Col N="72" /> conditions in relation to the voluntary nature of the hospitals do not seem to me to exist any longer.  I was inquiring from the Minister whether he is prepared to review the position of the voluntary hospitals.  As far as I can see, there is no democratic system of election to those boards which seem to me to represent nobody very much&mdash; possibly the Knights of Columbanus or the Freemasons, but as far as the mass of the people are concerned, they have no popular foundation.  They have no power, as far as I can see anyway, to be the final arbiters in the decision as to how public money is spent.</P>
      <P>It is clear because of Exchequer subventions which have increased very considerably over the years and because of the expenditure of the Hospitals Sweep funds on hospital buildings, that more and more demands will be made on the Exchequer and more and more payments will come from the local authorities in the form of rates and from individual taxation for services rendered in these hospitals.</P>
      <P>There is a reasonable explanation on the whole for the very considerable increase in expenditure in voluntary hospitals since pre-war years.  I do not know whether it is the complete explanation. That would be impossible to say without a more detailed knowledge of the methods of expenditure and a detailed understanding of the manner in which these hospitals keep their accounts.  I was suggesting that if there is some disquiet&mdash;and if one reads the papers and listens to people talking, there seems to be uncertainty about these hospitals&mdash;would it not be some help if there was public representation on these boards, in view of the increased public expenditure on such hospitals?</P>
      <P>I do not see anything wrong in that suggestion.  It is already in operation in the Meath hospital and seems to work well.  Public representatives, taken by and large, are conscientious, are more conversant with public affairs as we know them and as we wish to see them operated, are more conversant with the needs of our people in relation to health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question which I <Col N="73" /> would recommend to the Minister, that is the possibility of trying to get for the Department of Health some right of inspection in relation to the voluntary hospitals.  Again, where considerable sums of public money are being spent, I believe there should be some right of inspection by officers, either of the Department of Health or of the local authorities&mdash;some right of access in the ordinary way which these officers have in the case of local authority hospitals.</P>
    <P>I think that suggestion, if adopted, could be of great benefit.  As well as ensuring that the maximum possible efficiency would be achieved in the supervision of these institutions, it would also ensure that the public, who are paying the piper, would have watchdogs both in the Department of Health and in the local authority to assure them that the running methods of these institutions are as competent, as efficient and as administratively economical as they can possibly be.</P>
    <P>It is not generally realised that the Minister for Health has, as far as I am aware, in the majority of these hospitals no right of access whatsoever. As more and more of our public authority patients continue to go to these hospitals in the future, and as the Minister has no right of inquiry, if the patient is dissatisfied with the standard of treatment he gets, I think some effort should be made to give the Minister the right of access to these hospitals.  I am not saying that the standard of treatment in such institutions is bad.  It is as good as it is possible to get in this country, but I think the principle should be established that a patient who feels he has any sort of complaint or any grievance against the hospital authorities should be able to air or voice that grievance where it will be considered and where he can have a reasonable assurance of getting some satisfaction.</P>
    <P>At the moment, it seems to me that these hospitals are carried on in the old tradition, where a patient was treated as a sort of charity, charity in its worst possible meaning, and where, if he did not feel he had been treated as well as he should have been, he had no right of appeal whatsoever, the idea <Col N="74" /> being that he was very lucky to get treated at all.  That, in my opinion, is all wrong.  I think there should be an alteration in our attitude in this respect; people being treated in such hospitals should be able to emphasise that it is they who are footing the bill for the maintenance and the running of these hospitals and for the services available to all other sick people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not dwell upon it.  It must be possible for the municipal hospitals and the voluntary hospitals, side by side, to give the same standard of treatment to the sick.</P>
      <P>The subvention of £20,000 for the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme is an item of importance in this Estimate. I wonder if the Minister would reconsider this question of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and the decision to go ahead with this scheme.  I feel sure the Minister who proposed this idea was <i>bona fide</i> in his anxiety to try to provide a suitable health service for a particular group&mdash;the middle income group, I think he had in mind&mdash; and that this Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme was proposed to aid that group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me, it seems that if we go ahead, we are just introducing another complication into an already very complex and complicated situation in the country in relation to health services. A voluntary health insurance scheme seems to be damned from the start by the fact that it is impossible to operate satisfactorily, that it must envisage the <Col N="75" /> setting up and the development of administrative machinery which is already there, either in the voluntary side of the health services or in the local authority health services.</P>
    <P>There are a number of anomalies and disabilities which must arise and which will render the scheme devoid of any real value in meeting the needs of the middle income group.  These will mean, too, that proper health services will not be readily available to the people in this group, when they fall ill.  I have discussed this with experts on insurance and I cannot see how one can devise an overall comprehensive scheme, actuarially sound, on an insurance basis, without the assistance of a vast expenditure from central funds.</P>
    <P>The only alternative to that is to provide for a very limited scheme.  If the scheme is to run on insurance contributions exclusively, it must necessarily be a very limited one.  On the other hand, if we decide that there must be a subsidy in order to provide the best possible scheme, giving full cover in respect of all forms of sickness, medical preparations, medical appliances, equipment and so forth, then we shall have to provide a vast subsidy in order to keep the contributions at a reasonable level.  If we so decide, I have no great quarrel with that proposition, though I would prefer a scheme such as that laid down in the 1947 Act.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the decision is to provide a limited scheme with limited cover for a limited group, as is envisaged under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, it seems unfair that any taxation should be asked from those who may not be permitted to benefit under the scheme.  Chronic sick persons will not be covered by this scheme; the old will not be covered because they are regarded as a bad risk.  I do not see why they should be asked to pay taxation in order to subsidise a service of which they cannot avail.  Unless the scheme is available to all sections in the middle income group, irrespective of age, medical history or any of the other disabilities I have mentioned, it is unfair to ask these people to pay taxation to subsidise <Col N="76" /> a scheme of which they will not be permitted to avail.</P>
    <P>There is then a point in relation to contributions.  If a person has to pay a certain number of contributions&mdash;16, 17 or 18 contributions&mdash; and he has not paid them and falls ill, what kind of service will you give him?  Will you give him any kind of service?  You obviously cannot let such people into the scheme because, if you do, they will not pay their contributions any more.  If they can get the scheme without paying contributions, then they will not pay contributions. What scheme then will you give such people?  What kind of service will you provide for them?  Will you provide a less satisfactory service, because they have not paid their contributions? Will you provide a less efficient service?  Assume you have an improvident man with a family who does not keep up his contributions and takes no interest in the scheme at all, will you victimise his children by subjecting them to a lower standard of health service when they fall ill because of their parent's disinterest? Surely that is in principle unsound ethically.</P>
    <P>I have gone into this question of a comprehensive insurance scheme.  I have here a commercial insurance scheme which is presumably run as efficiently as private enterprise can run such schemes.  Presumably, it offers both the optimum and the maximum benefits it is possible to offer under this type of scheme.  There is a note saying that this insurance scheme does not render assistance in respect of (a) maternity treatment; (b) congenital mental deficiency, senility or illnesses in respect of which claims have been paid; (c) dental diagnosis, treatment and dentures; (d) examination of the eyes by an ophthalmic surgeon; (e) any injury or illness caused by or arising out of an accident; (f) any illness, disability or injury self-inflicted or arising out of war, invasion, etc.; (g) cost of medicines and drugs separately charged in private wards, or ordered for private out-patients, or surgical appliances and spectacles; (h) medical cases normally treated by the patient's own doctor, including vaccination, inoculation, and other <Col N="77" /> treatment undertaken as a preventive measure.  It would have been easier if they had put in a list of the things they do cover.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that there is a vast sphere of medical treatment and care which cannot and will not be covered by any insurance this Voluntary Health Insurance Board can provide.  There are all the other disadvantages to which I have referred&mdash;the bad risks, the person in the bad health category, the aged.  They cannot cover those people and it would be unfair to ask them to provide cover if the scheme is to be run on an actuarial basis and not as a scheme catering for the overall needs of the individual.  But has not the person with the bad medical record a perfect right to any treatment or care he or she may need when he or she falls ill?  Who needs such a scheme more?  Who needs protection more?  The aged will be excluded. Surely the old person is in greatest need of medical care and attention.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, when considering the desirability of going ahead with this type of scheme, to bear in mind the fact that he must either ask us to provide such subsidy as to make it an overall scheme in return for contributions within the capacity of the individual to pay or, alternatively, let the board run the scheme without the help of any subvention from the central authority at all.  I think that would be the fairest solution of the problem, but I cannot for the life of me see why it is necessary to confuse the already fairly confused health service situation by introducing this voluntary health insurance.</P>
    <P>It is not as if we were pioneers in health legislation; we have plenty of examples of how to do this properly at home and abroad, to justify our carrying on with a scheme which we know does work well such as our T.B. or Fever Hospital Scheme or the Maternity Scheme on the free, no means test principle, in a simple uncomplicated way without all the frustrating anomalies to which the blue ticket is subject, and to which the Voluntary Health Scheme will also be subject, if put into operation.</P>
    <P>Could I also ask the Minister to consider <Col N="78" /> again the problem of those people admired by him, I think, and by Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;the thrifty type of individual, the conscientious parent or father in the middle income group who, through the years, has paid contributions to a group scheme for himself and his family and who, I understand, will no longer be able to contribute to such a scheme.  I do not know whether the new idea or proposals will have retrospective effect in the coming year.  Will anybody insured at present be forced to give up any insurance scheme in which he is engaged, or will it merely concern those who intend to insure in the years ahead? If the Minister would clarify the position in regard to that point, I should be glad of it.  My own feeling is that if there are people who have been far-sighted and enterprising enough to engage in such schemes, their enterprise should be rewarded by allowing them to carry on in a scheme which is as good as, or possibly better than, anything proposed by the new board.</P>
    <P>May I recommend one small point to the Minister in relation to a matter raised by Deputy O'Higgins in regard to medical education?  Of course it would be a terribly serious thing if what Deputy O'Higgins referred to&mdash;and it is possible; I suppose he would know more about it than I do because of his position in recent years&mdash;were so, that our medical practitioners were to be excluded in the years ahead from the British hospitals and health services. I understand that there are serious suggestions on those lines.  I hope it will be possible for the medical schools to make the necessary alterations in order to comply with the provisions which the British Medical Association has apparently laid down and I hope the Minister will find it possible to help them to do this.</P>
    <P>While it is true that we produce far too many doctors in this country, it is, at the same time, very important from the point of view of the young men themselves and also from the point of view of the standard of our medicine generally, that there should be free interchange of medical practitioners as between here and Great Britain and that there should be no curtailment in <Col N="79" /> any way.  I wonder would the Minister consider a proposal I once put forward and which did not materialise or mature, in relation to St. Kevin's Hospital.  Is there any likelihood that there could be any direct association established between St. Kevin's and the city medical schools?  Is there any possibility that a university college hospital could be established, in association between the professors of the universities and St. Kevin's?</P>
    <P>St. Kevin's has now become, as I said, a magnificent municipal hospital and a vast amount of clinical knowledge is available there.  I think both sides would gain from any amalgamation of interests, if that could be devised.  I found it too difficult to do; I found the difficulties insuperable. But the Minister may be able to overcome the difficulties.  I think it would be of advantage to St. Kevin's and of great advantage to the medical schools themselves.  It would enhance the status of the hospital and provide increased opportunities for students to see more and more of the medical conditions which are to be found in St. Kevin's and would be of great benefit to them as part of their training. I wonder would the Minister consider that idea?  He may consider it too thorny a problem, but I think it is something very desirable.</P>
    <P>I want to make only one further point in conclusion.  The Minister is not responsible for these Estimates, but he will be forming his policy in the years ahead, and I should like him to consider an argument of Deputy O'Higgins which I thought was a good one in regard to the attempt to give a free choice of doctor to all sick people.  Deputy O'Higgins is quite right&mdash;that is a very important element in creating an equitable and efficient health service from the patients' point of view.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some confusion in people's minds on this question of the persistence of people like myself in asking for uniformity of treatment in relation to health services generally. I assume that the Minister for Health was perfectly honest in his contention recently when he said, on <Col N="80" /> the Health and Mental Treatment Bill, 1957, that he did not think a statement of mine was true to the effect that people who do not pay in dispensaries or hospitals are not treated as well as they would be, if they were in a position to pay.  It is quite possible for somebody to hold that view, but it is a very undesirable view for a Health Minister to hold, in the light of the tremendous influence which he has in shaping the pattern of our health services.</P>
    <P>He must bear with those of us who still hold that there is only one way to achieve equal opportunity and an equal standard of health service all round and that is to organise them as they are organised in our own T.B. services and fever hospital services and as they are organised in Great Britain under the National Health Service so that a person who falls sick has the right to go to a doctor of his own choice and get treatment, with whatever medicine is required until he is well again and that he pays&mdash;it is worth emphasising that he pays&mdash;in-directly through taxation.  I emphasise the point that he pays, that everybody pays, because it is suggested that one of the undesirable aspects of this so-called free health service is that people do not like others to get something for nothing.</P>
    <P>I have never understood why this has related only to health services.  It does not appear to relate to children's allowances, to housing grants, fertiliser or lime grants, land rehabilitation grants or to free primary schooling. They are all permissible, but why is there a ban on carrying out exactly the same principle in relation to our health services?</P>
    <P>Of course, everybody pays for these things to the extent of which he is capable in the form of taxation. Everybody contributes to the Central Fund and that is disbursed by the Minister to pay for health services provided in different ways.  I do not think it is a valid contention that people get something for nothing and that their attitude in this respect is undesirable. If it is undesirable in health why is it not undesirable in all the other aspects of our life in which we observe exactly the same principle?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> Equally, I have never heard any medical argument put forward against the free no means test principle in the provision of health services.  If there are any such arguments, I should like to hear them.  Indeed all the arguments are on the other side.  All the arguments were made last night by the Minister when he read out the statistics in relation to the tuberculosis scheme in which it has been fairly demonstrated that it is possible to use this free no means test principle and provide a highly efficient health service. There are no medical arguments against it.  We have seen the British health service in operation.  The patients are satisfied with it.  The doctors, while they have occasional financial objections&mdash;and I think it would be agreed that it is the right of any professional union to question the amount of money its members are paid &mdash;have no other objections to the principle of running a scheme on this basis.</P>
    <P>The principle is accepted in the case of our mother and infant scheme, our tuberculosis and fever schemes.  It seems to me there can be no other valid arguments.  Many obscure and curious arguments have been put forward in the last five, six, seven or eight years, but it seems to me they are blown sky high by the very fact that this principle exists already throughout our legislation in the provision by the State for the community in relation to all aspects of our life and, in particular, to our health services.</P>
    <P>There are no medical arguments against it.  There are no professional or medical ethical arguments against it.  There are no statistical arguments against it.  There are no what you might call behind-closed-doors arguments that could stand any examination, as far as I can see, against it.  Why then is it that where it is a question of saving lives, preventing preventable pain and avoiding the hardship that illness brings to any family, we do not use the method readiest to our hand as shown to us in the different schemes which we have operating already?</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there is no difference between the two types of scheme, the scheme where the person <Col N="82" /> pays and the scheme where the person does not pay.  If that is a true argument then there can be no justification for my persistent attitude over the years.  There can be little justification, possibly, for the tremendous expense of introducing the British National Health Service.  But I contend it is not a valid argument and it is not in accordance with the facts.  To support that point of view, I should like to give a couple of quotations which show that there is an important and significant difference between the standard of care and treatment given to different people, a higher standard to those who pay, and a less high standard of service to those who do not pay.</P>
    <P>There is an article here by Fr. Coyne in the March, 1953, issue of <i>Studies, the Irish Quarterly Review</i>, in which he deals in great detail with the 1952 Health Bill.  I hope I am not in any way misinterpreting what he says.  I would not wish to do that in the slightest.  This is merely a statement which he conscientiously holds and seems to believe.  He is perfectly welcome to hold that point of view and I am not quarrelling with it at all in that regard.  I am merely quoting the attitude of one intelligent, highly-educated individual who has considered this matter in very great detail and who says this at page 7 of this publication:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Will the type of hospital or nursing home service for mothers be uniform all through where the service is free?  There is a type of service that women of this middle income group and still more those in higher income groups, desire and have been accustomed to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He talks about private rooms, special nurses, a different type of cooking and general amenities:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Presumably these will not be supplied free to mothers in the middle income group.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think he is quite right.  I believe there is a quite different standard of service available to those who pay.  I am not attempting to controvert that in any way but I do say that it helps to show that at least one person who has given a lot of thought to this matter does share my point of view that there <Col N="83" /> are different standards for those who pay and those who do not.</P>
    <P>Again, it is only one aspect of the problem, but I would refer the Minister to his own statement about the means test in relation to the middle income group person.  I do not know what word he used&mdash;&ldquo;inquisition&rdquo;, or some such word.  However, the general impression given by the Minister was that he recognised that means test medicine had an undesirable content, that it did bring some degree of humiliation or degradation on the person who availed of it.  It seems to me that that is a reasonable interpretation of his suggestion that a means test is something which an ordinary person who could avoid it would not undergo.</P>
    <P>There is another witness in this regard, a particularly valuable witness and a particularly competent witness, a man of very great and wide experience in this question of health services, particularly in relation to the city, that is, the former Senator Professor Dr. Cunningham who, in the debate in the Seanad on the Health Bill, 1952, as reported at column 1074, Volume 42 of the Official Report, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The whole theme in this Bill has been a levelling down of services. What is being offered to everybody is the out-patient department of the hospitals and the public wards of the hospitals; in other words, the type of service which is given to poor people...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, he is quite right&mdash;the service that is given to poor people&mdash;and he was objecting to what he called the levelling down of the service for the middle income group to the level which he saw all round him.  He is a man of considerable experience and wide knowledge.  I know him to be right.  I agree with him.  He knew well the service that was being provided in the out-patients' departments, in the dispensaries and in the public wards of our hospitals.</P>
    <P>Dr. Cunningham was in no way anxious, I have no doubt, to help my case.  At the same time, that was a frank admission of the fact which seems to me to leave little doubt, if there is <Col N="84" /> any real doubt in view of the evidence of our own eyes, that there is a considerable disparity between the standard of care given to the poor and to those who can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>The simplest test is this: if you really believe that there is no difference between the non-paying and the paying patient, will those who hold that view tell me that when they next fall ill&mdash;I hope that will be very long delayed&mdash; they will go to a dispensary and queue in the dispensary or the out-patients' department, or will they find their way into the public ward of a public hospital in the ordinary way, or will they go to a nursing home or get a private bed in a private ward or semi-private ward, or go to the doctor's consulting rooms?  Which do they intend to do and why do they intend to do it?</P>
    <P>It is about time that we ended this double thinking in this country in relation to our people.  I cannot see any difference at all between one man and another when he gets sick.  If he is sick, he should get the best possible care that medical science can provide. There should be no discrimination between the wealthy and the not so wealthy and the poor.  The community has a responsibility to provide from its resources to ensure that this equally high standard of care shall be made available to all.  We know that this standard is not being made available to all at present.  I have shown that it is not made available to all and it cannot be made available equally to all of our people until we get to the stage of accepting the principles of the 1947 Health Act, which have not been bettered since and I think you would have to go a long way to better those principles, that is, the free, no means test principle of treatment and care in our general practitioner service, in our hospital services and in the whole gamut of services for sick people in the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would be happier if Deputies were honest about this question, if we could get rid of the many red herrings that have been introduced over the years by the profession, by the politicians and by other sections of our society, in order to deprive our people of what is their just right.  I believe also that <Col N="85" /> the medical profession would gain from proper rationalisation of our health services.  I believe, indeed, that the majority of general practitioners would be delighted to be in a comparable position with their fellow practitioners in Great Britain, where they would have some sort of assured income, where they would be in a position to engage in group practice, if they wanted to, which would give them an opportunity to take holidays, to go on study leave, to fall sick without feeling that their practice was disappearing.</P>
    <P>There is no trade union which would tolerate the conditions of work which an unfortunate general practitioner has to endure, the 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days in the year, which the majority have to put in because of the absurd medical system which is in operation in this country at the moment.  There are tired overworked doctors, with no security of tenure, who have to face difficulties when they fall ill and lack peace of mind, if they go on holidays. The patient loses and the doctor loses by our present health scheme.</P>
    <P>Any objections to that proposition, of course, come from a very limited, small, extremely wealthy group of specialists who, in the ordinary way of democratic centralisation which they operate, control what is a so-called democratic organisation.  I would prefer that Deputies who oppose equal opportunity in our health services should say that they oppose it for the simple reason that they will not pay, that they do not want to pay, that if they can prevent illness, disease, pain and sickness, they will not do it, if it costs them too much or if they have to pay for it.  Let them be open and honest.  Let us have an end to the humbug of these digressional arguments that are introduced in order to try to pretend that we are not like the rest of men, that we are more Christian than our neighbours who have provided what I believe is the ideal in Christian medical services.  I would prefer if the plain blunt argument were put to me: &ldquo;We think we can reduce the death rate; we think we can reduce the disease rate; but we will not do it <Col N="86" /> because we will not ask the people to pay the taxes or the rates which we feel it would mean.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would say this for the people that if one were to go to them now and say: &ldquo;We can take away the free services&mdash; and they are costing you a lot&mdash;and we can give you back the money that you are paying in taxes and rates for those services,&rdquo; I do not think that they would thank you for that.  I hope I do not misjudge our people; I should be sorry to think I was doing so.  I think they are proud of the fact that they have provided these excellent health services; I think they are proud of the fact they made it possible for the Minister&mdash;and it is their money made it possible for the Minister&mdash;to come in here and claim the magnificent figures which he claimed last night.  This is a tribute to the generosity of the people. I feel they are just as generous as the people of the Six Counties and of Great Britain, and if asked to make sacrifices in the name of the sick people, the people in pain and suffering, the people who may die from preventable disease, I feel they would do it gladly, and I would be very surprised indeed if they would not.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bear in mind some of the points I have made or will try to recall the great ideals which it was clear he and those of his colleagues in Fianna Fáil must have had in 1947 when they introduced the magnificent health charter of 1947, the Health Act. It was greatly needed and it has done wonderful work, but its major work has been due to the fact that it has made it possible for the medical profession generally and the nursing profession generally to seek out, to find and to treat without any difficulty the diseases which had affected our people, particularly tuberculosis and the fevers of one kind or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies are also members of local health authorities and, as a result, get a fairly good knowledge of the health services and the operation of the Health Act.  One of the most important features of the Health Act was the establishment of consultative health committees in each area to advise the local authority on the operation of the services.  By <Col N="87" /> regulation, the Minister decided upon the people who were to have representation on these committees.  I think it would be very wise if the new Minister were to widen the representation on such a committee by allowing for representation of dentists, nurses and chemists.</P>
      <P>Members of these ancillary medical services rather resent the fact that they have been excluded.  Of course a reply I am sure the Minister or his officials will make is that they are not excluded, that members of the local authority may resign in their favour; but I think the Minister should make it a statutory obligation on the health authorities to allow these people representation.  I know in my own area that the dentists, nurses and chemists claim, and rightly claim, they should be represented on the consultative health committee.</P>
      <P>I understand that this committee was set up to advise the local authority on the operation of the health services. An extraordinary situation has arisen in County Galway.  Our county manager, when given advice by members of our health authority with which he does not agree, has threatened to leave the meeting of the consultative health committee.  He did that on Saturday last when every single member of the committee, as it is constituted, gave him specific advice with which he could not agree.  I do not know whether or not he was within his rights in deciding he would not stay on at the meeting, but I think that point should be clarified by the Minister.  If the county manager is to be advised, he must listen to those who have been deputed by statutory instrument to advise him; and if the advice is not the advice he was expecting, at least he should be forced to remain and listen to it.</P>

      <P>Because of our membership of the consultative health committee, many of us have acquired a certain knowledge of the health services.  There is one service that is gravely perturbing the people in my county.  It is the application of the <Col N="88" /> regulations with regard to the disabled persons' maintenance allowance.  That allowance is usually called the disability allowance.  In my county, we feel that neither the Minister nor the Department has the right to invest our county medical officer of health with absolute infallibility in medical matters so that he can decide whether or not a man is substantially handicapped, in the teeth of advice given to him by competent and eminent medical specialists.</P>
      <P>This has led to a High Court case and the High Court judgment has cost Galway County Council nearly £800.  I do not think that either the Minister for Health at the time, whoever he was, or his advisers, ever contemplated that one man should have absolute medical infallibility and decide on his own opinion whether an applicant was substantially handicapped or not for the purpose of granting or withholding a disability allowance.</P>
      <P>I may tell Deputies that Mr. Justice Davitt, when he gave judgment in the High Court, commented on the fact that county medical officers of health, by reason of the office they hold, have very little knowledge of clinical medicine and very little experience of dealing with patients in the ordinary sense of the word.  I appeal to the Minister to review the regulations with regard to these allowances, to set up some kind of appeal machinery and to afford some protection to people, other than the High Court, against the tyranny of these autocratic administrators, whether they be medical or lay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which has concerned us in my county is the failure of the county manager to give effect to a recommendation of the Minister's predecessor. He recommended, and, I think, rightly, that those who were in receipt of the maximum old age pension and the widow's non-controbutory pension should be entitled automatically to free institutional treatment. Deputy O'Higgins, when Minister for Health, addressed a meeting of the Galway County Council and of doctors in the county on the health services, shortly after the Health Act came into operation.  In reply to a question put <Col N="89" /> by me, he said that he had made that recommendation and that he had sent a circular to all health authorities.  The Galway county manager, for reasons best known to himself, refused to carry out that recommendation.  The county council directed him by an ordinary resolution to give effect to the recommendation, but he stated that he would not do so.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, we summoned a special meeting of the county council and directed him under the County Management Act to give effect to the Minister's recommendation.  Every member of the council voted for the resolution.  No later than last Saturday, a member of the Galway County Council showed me a hospital bill which had been served on an old age pensioner.  I do not know the law with regard to this, but I think if a county manager refuses to give effect to a resolution of his county council, which is right and proper, that the county manager should be suspended.  It is the Minister's wish and the unanimous wish of the local authority of which I am a member that old age pensioners and widows in receipt of the maximum allowances should be entitled to these free institutional services.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, before full pensions are granted, a trained investigator from the Department of Social Welfare visits the applicant.  He has authority to inspect premises and property and, I think, to inquire minutely into the financial status of the applicant.  When that trained investigator decides that a person is entitled to the maximum old age pension or the maximum widow's noncontributory pension, is it not very stupid to send out a home assistance officer, who is well qualified for his own job but who cannot claim to be a trained investigator like a civil servant from the Department of Social Welfare, to reassess the means of an applicant and to decide whether or not he or she is able to pay a hospital bill. I ask the Minister to have that matter looked into.</P>
    <P>We have in our county very fine hospitals and excellent services, but there is just one fault that I find with them.  When the Department of Health <Col N="90" /> and its advisers decided to build these hospitals, they should have had some idea of the expense involved.  We have an excellent regional hospital, but many people comment on the fact that it is too grandiose and more than the people can afford and they point to institutions in other parts of the country built by medical and nursing orders at a lower cost.  In my opinion, our regional sanatorium was very badly designed because buildings are scattered all over the place and the nurses rightly complained that they could not operate a cafeteria system because these units where they work are scattered over 15 or 20 acres.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister, if he has to commit himself to any future hospital building programme, not to be guided or unduly influenced by these advisers or architects who take no account of cost or how long the sanatoria will be used as such.  As everybody knows, thank God, tuberculosis, thanks to medical science, is on the way out and I hope that it will be possible to convert these sanatoria for the treatment of diseases other than tuberculosis for which they were originally designed.  Looking at those buildings and the way they were originally planned, it is very difficult now to understand to what use they can be converted.</P>
    <P>In the very fine Merlin Park institution, they have about 12 or 14 units. Each unit has an Aga cooker which is never used because there is a central kitchen which serves the whole hospital. It is very hard to understand why there should be an Aga cooker going full blast to keep a couple of kettles on the boil, having regard to the high cost of fuel and the high cost of installing these cookers.  People ask themselves have the architects and specialists who advised the Minister any regard at all for reality when they plan in that fashion.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that a man like the present Minister, who is a realist, is now in charge of the Department of Health.  He is a man who will keep an eye on these things and who from his vast experience in the Department of Finance and other Departments will realise that people who give him advice <Col N="91" /> should be checked and counter-checked so that the conditions which have obtained in regard to hospital planning and design will not be allowed to continue in the future in further hospital building schemes.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister to investigate the right of a county manager to direct patients to particular hospitals.  In my county, we have a regional hospital and another hospital in the east of the county which has made arrangements with the health authority.  The Galway county manager has taken it upon himself to direct doctors in certain areas to send patients to certain hospitals against the wishes of the patient and against the wishes of the doctor.  It should be left to the doctor to decide what hospital can best cater for the ailment of his patient and not to the county manager. It is a rather extraordinary state of affairs and one that has caused much comment.</P>
    <P>I have always regarded the medical officer of health, the general practitioner, as the most important man in the health services.  He is the only one who stands between the patient and the local authority.  He is more often than not the friend and counsellor of the patient and if he is to be directed as to what he is to do with his patient or where he is to send him, then I am afraid the fine relationship that has existed between doctors and patients in this country will be greatly impaired, much to the detriment of the patient.</P>
    <P>I have particular knowledge of the school medical service, as I am a teacher, and I ask the Minister to make some radical change in that service.  He should place the school medical service under the care of the local medical officer of health and not under the county medical officer of health or his assistants.  Who knows more about the patients in his area and their children than their family doctor?  The Department of Health and the Minister can advance the argument that the local doctor cannot arrange to visit a school on a particular date because he might be called away.  But he is entrusted with the immunisation scheme and the <Col N="92" /> vaccination scheme and all the other schemes operated by the local authority and if he is considered good enough to carry out these, why should he not be good enough to visit the school and carry out the medical examinations?</P>
    <P>The medical examination, as we know, is carried out yearly as a result of the 1953 Act.  New entrants to the school must be examined before the end of the school year, but what about the children who have not been examined for three years previously? Who will see that any of the defects that have cropped up in the meantime will be remedied?  How can you claim to have a school medical service when children are seen by a doctor only once every three years?  Is it the duty of the teacher to notify the county medical officer of health that one child appears to have defective vision and another child has something else wrong with it? If it was arranged that the local doctor would visit the school periodically, once every six months or once every year, it would be a far better system and a less costly one.</P>
    <P>In my county, a great number of the schools are up to 50 miles from Galway. As far as I can see, a lot of the doctor's time is taken up with travelling from Galway to the school itself.  Generally a doctor does not arrive at the school before 11 o'clock and he has to go again at 3 o'clock.</P>
    <P>The defects I have mentioned in relation to the school medical service are also relevant to the dental services. I have to laugh when I hear people claiming that we have a school dental service.  I think most of the teacher Deputies in the House are familiar with the pattern.  The school dentist arrives at a school once every three years or so and the children know what is going to take place.  No teeth will be filled, but a lot of teeth will be extracted and the younger children dread the visit of the school dentist. I am not alleging that the dentists are incompetent, but by virtue of the fact that they have to devote most of their time to extracting teeth rather than doing preservation work, there is established in the children of Ireland to-day a dread of dentists that lasts through their whole lives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> This once in three years visit of the school dentist is not a dental service at all, nor is it any substitute for a school dental service.  I know the Minister has decided that priority must be given to the school dental service and I agree wholeheartedly with that, if it is found not possible to extend the service to the lower income group or middle income group for financial reasons.  If it has been decided to concentrate on the schools, the Minister should consider giving a proper service to the school children.  If necessary, the services of local dentists should be employed and an arrangement made with them whereby a child can go into the local dentist's congenial and comfortable surgery and have done whatever work is deemed necessary.  This would be better than having the work carried out sometimes in a cold school and often in the hearing of other children, of little tots.  I have seen the school grounds and the schoolroom covered with blood which has a serious effect on the minds of young impressionable children.</P>
    <P>I respectfully ask the Minister to attack this matter now and save the local authorities the expense of supplying expensive dentures later on by having the preservation work done now and teeth filled as required.  If proper dental services are carried out in the schools, the local authorities and the Exchequer will be relieved of large expenditure in later years.</P>
    <P>I must refer to another matter that has cropped up in my county.  It is the supply of surgical and orthopaedic appliances.  I was listening to Deputy Dr. Browne some time ago when he maintained that different standards of service obtain for people who are unable to pay and for those who are able to pay.  From my experience of the supply of surgical and orthopaedic appliances in my county, I believe that what Deputy Dr. Browne said is a fact.  I am not exaggerating when I say this, and I can give the names to the Minister or his Department of people who have been examined and certified for surgical and orthopaedic appliances, such as limbs, and who had to wait in my county for periods in excess of two years.  Why?  Because <Col N="94" /> they were in the dispensary class and I make that statement advisedly, because if they were able to pay, they would have been supplied with these appliances.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious allegation to make, but I am prepared to substantiate it.  I know a girl working in my town who was examined for an artificial limb.  She had to give up her work and go into the county home in Loughrea and await the arrival of the limb.  She was 486 days there and still the appliance has not arrived and the local authority is responsible for the cost of her maintenance in St. Brendan's Home at Loughrea at a cost of about £2 a week.  She lost her job also and, all in all, the cost amounted to something about £220 and when that is added to whatever the actual cost of the artificial limb will be, I put it to the House that it will be a very dear limb.</P>
    <P>There is another case.  I know of a man who applied for an artificial limb and he was two years and three months waiting for it.  When he made his application for the artificial limb, he also applied for a disability allowance. The county medical officer of health stated that if this man had a proper artificial limb, he would not be substantially handicapped.  The limb arrived after a period of two years and three months. The man was advised that he should then make retrospective application for the disability allowance to the local health authority because of its failure to supply him with the leg.  The local authority will pay him and will have to pay him.</P>
    <P>These are matters which the Minister for Health and the Department should investigate with a view to having them remedied.  In my county, we have had at our consultative health committee meetings many complaints about drugs, In the first place, it has been complained that there is a delay in supplying the drugs and then there is the more serious complaint which was made by a doctor, that very often the drugs were of inferior quality and not up to B.P. standards.</P>
    <P>I have seen a demonstration myself <Col N="95" /> and nothing is more effective than an actual demonstration of these things. A doctor came into our meeting with a pill that was supplied to dispensary patients or to the holders of medical cards.  The pill was supposed to dissolve in water in fifteen minutes.  The doctor had a glass containing water and the pill in question.  He assured us the pill had been in the water over a fortnight and that, as yet, there was no sign of its dissolving.  The doctor stated he believed the drugs supplied through the combined purchasing section were inferior to those that could be obtained in the local chemist's shop. He made that allegation seriously.  I understand that some of the drugs in question were sent for analysis by the public analyst.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that in this year's Estimate the Minister has provided for the expenditure of more money on county homes.  The care of the aged sick should not be neglected.  Money should be spent and is being spent on big improvements in our county homes and I hope the Minister will be able to continue that good work.  I have not the Book of Estimates before me, but I think the figure has gone up from £5,000 to £7,500.  Any money spent on these homes is money well spent.  In my county, very fine work has been done on improving the amenities of our county home, on making it a better and a more pleasant place for the aged who spend the last years of their lives there.</P>
    <P>Last night, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins referred to medical education.  That question has been agitating our minds on the county council for the past 18 months, by virtue of the fact that we must ensure that we keep the services in the regional hospital which is a teaching hospital, up to standard.  The previous Minister made us see things according to his light by sending us down a sealed Order.  I hope the necessity will not arise for the present Minister to indulge in the same tactics.  If the Department can work in harmony with a local authority, it should strive to do so, rather than antagonise the members of the local authority by sending down sealed Orders to do something <Col N="96" /> which the local authority think should not be done.</P>
    <P>My council has always been eager and willing to preserve the link that existed between our regional hospital and the university, but we deplore and will deplore any highhanded action taken by any Minister or the Department of Health.  The sealed Orders of the former Minister were particularly repugnant to us, because, at the time the sealed Order was sent down to us, the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Local Government, was making a grand tour of the country promising us that democracy was around the corner and that the county manager would be curbed in his powers and functions.  He assured us that no office would be created except by the members of the local authority; it was a reserved function of the members of the local authority.  Hard on his heels came the sealed Order of his colleague, the Minister for Health.  I hope the harmony and good relations which have always existed between the Minister for Health, the Department and the council in my county will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, when we speak on the Health Estimate, I, as a Labour representative, have to deal in the main with the 1953 Health Act as one of the important Acts.  That Act contained many good features.  It has served a very useful purpose but certain flaws, which I think can be mended by regulations, are developing or have developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy cannot discuss the merits of the Act.  He can refer to administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the administration I have in mind.  The last speaker put his finger on one of the flaws in the Act and advocated a change in it.  I had that point down, but I realised that a change would involve legislation and so I decided not to go ahead.  However, county managers have the right to decide on medical cards.  Normally, and rightly so, I suppose, they fix a certain income level from all sources in the family that comes within the Act.  That is all right should the breadwinner, the <Col N="97" /> person who is the main source of income, remain well.  Should he, however, become ill, the income level which formerly deprived him of a card automatically drops and, instead of being in receipt of £7 or £8 a week while he is ill, he must depend on National Health Insurance.  Automatically, that puts him below the income level which, if he had been on it prior to his illness, would have entitled him to the medical card.</P>
      <P>Some Cork Deputies, speaking on the Health and Mental Treatment Bill, said that, in County Cork, that is adjusted the following week.  That is certainly not the case in my constituency. Once you get ill, if you have not got a medical card, you have to pay for whatever treatment you get from whatever doctor you employ and for whatever medicines you need.  Some adjustment should be made if either the breadwinner himself or somebody who is bringing in an income becomes ill.  It is all right, I suppose, if one of his children gets ill who is not providing an income, but if it is someone who contributes to the house and if his wages drop to such an extent that it interferes with the amount of money they would normally have, then I suggest the case should be revised on the second week of illness.  If the Minister would recommend such action to county managers, it might be of assistance.</P>
      <P>There is one point in relation to administration where the Minister could help.  It concerns the hours worked by attendants in our county hospitals and homes.  Unlike the nurses, these attendants have to work for as long as 60 and 70 hours per week.  They do not get any recognised period of time even for meals.  I feel it is scandalous in this year of the Lord that local authorities should expect of and demand from their servants such periods of employment as 60 and 70 hours per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency, we have made representations to the county manager that that system should be changed and that the attendant should enjoy the same working hours as nurses, that is, a 48-hour week.  We even had an inspector from the Department of Health down to arbitrate between the <Col N="98" /> county manager and the trade union involved.  Notwithstanding his intervention and the application of the union, I regret to say that we have got very little satisfaction.  In fact, a recommendation made by the county manager to employ extra attendants so as to permit a period of 48 hours per week being worked was turned down by the Minister's Department.  I would suggest that a 48-hour week should be sanctioned by the Minister in all our county hospitals and county homes.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in which I am interested, that is, the difficulty of getting admission to suitable hospitals or homes for mentally deficient children.  Whether or not the same difficulties exist in all the counties as exist in Waterford, I do not know.  It has come to my knowledge that very often periods of from six to eight years have to be waited before places can be found in homes for mentally deficient children.  Something should be done to change that position.</P>
    <P>It is often absolutely essential that these children should be sent away to be trained at as early a date as possible. Both in their own interests and in the interests of the parents and the other children in the house, these mentally deficient children should be segregated from the normally balanced children so that too great an attachment will not grow up and so that when separation has to come later it will not have an effect both on the mentally deficient child and the other children.</P>
    <P>That is pretty well all I have to say on this Estimate, except one or two things with particular emphasis in regard to County Waterford.  One of these matters concerns the dental service as carried out under the Health Act.  While we have some 500 people who got their teeth extracted under the Health Act, we are unable to get permission from the Department to employ, even on a temporary basis, a part-time dentist for one year.  It is shocking that 500 people will probably have to remain for the rest of their lives without any dentures because of the fact that some economies have to be made in a Department.  It is not the particular Minister who is in office <Col N="99" /> at present who made that decision.  It was made by the previous Minister and was endorsed.  I disagreed with the former Minister and I disagree with the present decision.  While economies must be made&mdash;and that is quite understandable&mdash;it is only reasonable to say that those whose teeth were extracted on promise of replacement should be entitled to these replacements.  If economies have to be made, let it be clearly made known beforehand that if you do avail of these medical services, you avail of them at the risk of never getting any dentures supplied by any board at all.  I ask the Minister to give his earnest consideration to the question of giving temporary sanction to enable the waiting list of 500 people to be caught up with.  From that on, we would be satisfied to have teeth extracted on the understanding that it might be in years to come that any dentures would be supplied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, when introducing his Estimate, gave us some very interesting information and the figures he quoted are well worth recording because they dispel many of our misgivings about the health services.</P>
      <P>We are all edified to hear that there was a significant drop in infant mortality in recent years.  We are equally edified to hear that our birth rate and our natural increase in population here is higher than in Great Britain.  That is some compensation for our losses through emigration.  We were also very pleased to learn from the Minister that there was a drop of approximately 25 per cent. in the numbers notified as suffering from tuberculosis in the past six years.  Whoever contributed to that success are to be congratulated and it is some compensation for those who worked so zealously to achieve these results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Minister mentioned with a certain amount of misgiving the fact that he is seeking approximately £16,500,000 for health services in respect of this financial year.  He posed the question, which it is natural for anybody to pose: Are we getting the proper results from that vast expenditure? <Col N="100" /> Let us go further and ask: Can we continue to meet that vast commitment in this small island of ours, with our limited resources?</P>
    <P>Personally, I think that we have made a fetish of health in recent years. We all realise the health services are necessary, but, in our anxiety to provide these health services, have we lost sight of the basic factors that go to ensure good health?  I think that a good house and remunerative employment for the breadwinner in that house are the prerequisites of good health in any ordered State.  Had we these, the other benefits would follow in course of time.  Any money that we could have spared over the years should have been devoted to these two fundamental matters.</P>
    <P>Again, while we talk about hospital-isation and health services, we lack knowledge on the question of foods. Personally, I think our lack of knowledge is appalling.  We have no idea at all of the value of foods or of the constituents necessary for the building up of our bodies.  Science has now taught that scientific feeding for animals is indispensable to a vigorous growth and the development of bone and health in the animal world.  I doubt if we, too, should not have a balanced diet.  While we have no conventional meals of any kind and while we have variety in our foods, I wonder if we consume the food necessary to build up bone and muscle.  These are factors which would counteract a tendency towards disease.  History records that we were a very healthy race up to the time of the Famine, but because of the ill-nourishment in the Famine days, the health of our people began to deteriorate.  I do not know if we are any worse than any other nation, but we would like to maintain our traditional standards in that respect.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we have had any research at all on the cause of premature dental decay.  I had recently contact for some weeks with a clerical student from Spain, who was here doing a course. I could not help admiring his magnificent teeth&mdash;they were just perfect. He never had a filling of any kind, or an extraction.  He told me that in Spain and in the adjacent countries <Col N="101" /> they have very little dental trouble. Theorists tell us that dental decay is traceable to our over-consumption of soft food or cooked food.  I do not know whether that is correct or not, but surely something could be done to provide some check on the premature dental decay which is so very common amongst our people, especially amongst our young people.  It is a national loss to our people to have to suffer these disadvantages.  I put it to the Minister that he should advocate some research in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to-day in a position to propagate a doctrine for the health of our people in a vigorous way, that is, to lay emphasis on the consumption of milk.  Milk, we are told, is the greatest food of all.  It is the product of our own cattle, from our own soil. Increased consumption of milk would have a double advantage.  Now that we are faced with a surplus of milk, it would be one way of disposing of that surplus.  In the last analysis, it is the cheapest food of all.  Our consumption of milk per head of the population is phenomenally low, which is extraordinary in a milk-producing country like Ireland.  Our people waste money on patent foods and foods which have no comparable value with milk.  Now is the opportune time, when faced with this situation, to make our people realise that there is no better food than milk.  It can be supplied now in the purest and most uncontaminated form.</P>
    <P>The question of drugs, which was raised during this debate, was very forcibly brought home to me when I visited a friend of mine in his own home.  He was being treated by his own doctor.  He was not a health patient at all.  He showed me on the table in his room a little box of pills costing ten guineas for 50 pills.  He took six per day, so that 50 would last a little over a week.  There were other bottles of drugs on the table as well. Even a man with the most remunerative or most lucrative source of income cannot now provide himself with these amenities, even if they are indispensable.  Drugs which are so indispensable to the preservation of life should be under some sort of international control.  I respectfully suggest <Col N="102" /> to the Minister that he take up this question.  I do not know how that can be done.  Perhaps the Red Cross might be of some help.  If these drugs are available for the use of mankind, they should be within the reach of all, so that they would get the necessary drugs in time of illness.</P>
    <P>Hospitals have been mentioned here. I disagree entirely with the ex-Minister about the Cork Regional Hospital.  I am perfectly convinced and state quite emphatically that it is not necessary.  It is 20 years since that hospital was spoken of first.  In the interim, the people have got all the hospitalisation they need in Cork City and County.  Since that hospital was first spoken of, a new orthopaedic hospital has been erected in Cork City; a very spacious sanatorium has been erected in Glanmire, six miles from Cork; the Erinville hospital in Cork has been extended; at present a maternity wing is being built on the Bon Secours Home in Cork; and minor adjustments are being made in the voluntary hospitals.  All that goes to prove that the sick needs of Cork City and County are already very well cared for.</P>
    <P>On the question of the voluntary hospitals, we have three of these in Cork.  I believe they have given great service over the years.  Long before any health services were thought of, those hospitals served a very useful purpose.  If they had the fees from every patient who was treated in those hospitals, they would not have to-day to go to any Hospitals Trust Fund for moneys to expand or extend their own hospitals.  Some of them are run by voluntary boards and some are under the care of communities.  Considering they gave such service in the past and considering that, with little minor extensions now, they would cater assuredly for any emergency which might arise in the sick needs of Cork City and County, it would be nothing but downright discourtesy and gross ingratitude if they were not thought of and if a new regional hospital were erected in Cork in competition with those hospitals, which gave such valuable and faithful service over the years.  I hope the Minister <Col N="103" /> will see that those hospitals will be properly thought of in the future.</P>
    <P>Even to-day, in this midsummer period, if a survey of the hospital beds were made in Cork, it would reveal that there are beds vacant in every hospital in Cork City at this moment&mdash; and not alone in every hospital, but in some of the wards in every hospital. That bed accommodation is never exhausted, except in the depth of winter and then only when there are minor epidemics in the respective localities.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention anything about the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme.  I hope that, in winding up, he will refer to it.  Deputy Browne&mdash;or some other Deputy&mdash;mentioned that it was doomed from the start.  I feel it was doomed from the start because it did not take precedence of the Health Act which we had in recent years.  Had it got a fair chance, I believe it would have succeeded, as benevolent health services through vocational bodies in this country have succeeded.</P>
    <P>I was amazed recently in a particular case regarding an organisation here which has its own private health service. It costs nothing to anyone except the participants in that service. For the small sum of £2 3s. a year, when a breadwinner in the family dies the widow is able to get £50 mortality benefit and practically all the cost of a major operation, on that small contribution. There is no service as valuable as a voluntary health service, when done through a vocational group or through organised trade unions.  It is a pity we did not rely more on that, before we embarked on this expensive health service we have now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne mentioned, time and again in his remarks, the British National Health services.  It is a pity we do not rely on ourselves.  I fail to see why we should ape so slavishly the types of legislation provided in other countries.  Have we not enough initiative and genius to work out our own salvation according to our own means? When the health services were first announced in Great Britain the annual <Col N="104" /> cost envisaged was £80,000,000.  To-day I believe the cost if £500,000,000 a year. Of course, Great Britain can afford that, but we, in our limited circumstances, cannot.  When the Health Act was introduced nobody here foresaw the ultimate cost and I think there is much disappointment to-day in regard to that Act.  I am an unrepentant critic of it because I believe it created injustices for the people.</P>

How can we pay for them?  He mentioned grants of various kinds.  We have to bear in mind that State grants are made only to help the economy of the country, only to help persons to build up their individual economies so that ultimately they will be independent.</P>
      <P>The question of disability allowances was raised.  At the moment county managers have the very unpleasant duty of sitting in judgment on those who apply for these allowances. Nobody likes that and nobody is more upset about it than the city managers and county managers.  Many people who suffer from paralysis, particularly from the effects of polio, are not qualified for allowances.  I know a man of 35 years of age, the victim of an attack of polio when four years of age. The disease was not known at that time.  This man is a complete cripple but, because he lives with his brother who is in fairly good circumstances, he is deprived of an allowance.  I think polio victims should be placed in a special category for the purposes of disability allowances.</P>

    <P>The Minister is new to his Department. He has a very formidable task. The Department of Health is one which has been severely criticised over the years.  It was, accordingly, refreshing to listen to the debate and to appreciate the calm tenor of the discussion and the objective way the points were put.  We should all be <Col N="105" /> very pleased with that.  I wish the Minister every success in his new office. I believe he knows that the more care and the more reserve he shows the greater will be the success and the better will be the results he will achieve during his term of office.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I do not know how to deal with the statement made by Deputy Manley in connection with the hospital position in Cork.  I do not know whether Deputy Manley has the same access to the people of his constituuency as I have in mine.  I would be slow to think that he has not, but I should like to let him know that at the present moment it is impossible to get a bed in St. Finbarr's Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say as much about the others.  I handed to the Minister a hospital bill while we were discussing a Bill amending the Health Act.  I do not know what his findings were on this question of hospital charges.  At some of the hospitals to which Deputy Manley has referred you are told there are no beds except in semi-private wards.  If you agree to go into one of these wards you enable the hospital authorities to tack on to you the type of bill I gave the Minister when I cited the case of an unfortunate widow with 25 acres of land.  She was sent a hospital bill for £77, £25 of which was paid by the health authority.  She was faced with a bill for £52.  Of course that woman had never seen £52 together in her life.</P>
      <P>I had to remain in Cork yesterday for the purpose of endeavouring to get from the tuberculosis committee accommodation for patients in the Orthopaedic Hospital.  We have 400 such patients on a waiting list and we succeeded in relieving the pressure only slightly.  Looking at the Estimate for the Department of Defence, I noticed a figure of £105,000 for the payment of 112 doctors and 100 nurses to look after 11,000 men.</P>

      <P>The point I am bringing to the notice of the Minister for Health is that those men have also got medical cards and are entitled to the health services available outside the Army.  I do not believe there should be such a duplication of services&mdash;that those 11,000 men should be thrown as a burden again on the ratepayers and taxpayers of this country.  I am asking the Minister to look into this matter. One of the two Estimates must be wrong.  If we are paying doctors to look after Army personnel, we should not have the added burden of providing for those men in our ordinary health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have before me a notification in regard to the dispensary site in the South Cork Board of Assistance area.  It seems now that every dispensary site taken over by the South Cork Board of Public Assistance since 1953 was illegally taken over.  The South Cork Board of Assistance is an autonomous body made up of members of the Cork County Council and the Cork Corporation.  If that joint body want to get a site to build a dispensary they must go to the county council and the corporation who must get the site. All the sites that were taken over in the past were illegally acquired.  That is the information I have here from our county solicitor, Mr. John Carr.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had in South Cork area a considerable number of dispensaries that were outdated and we have been endeavouring for the past ten or 12 years to get from the Department some ruling on this so that we could go ahead.  We were told that they were regrouping the dispensary areas.  That <Col N="107" /> caused a delay of three or four years. Anyway the position is that somebody else must look for the site for us and the board of assistance can then operat as the agent for the health authority.  I say that is bringing bureaucracy a little bit too far.  Three men are doing the work of one in every Department and under every instruction sent down by each Department of State to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>First of all the board of assistance must decide on a suitable site.  Their secretary must then write to the secretary of the county council and the corporation. Following that, either singly or jointly, we go to see whether the site is suitable and then somebody is bound to condemn it.  That is the manner in which time, labour and money are wasted under one heading alone.</P>
    <P>In looking over this Estimate I find there is a provision of £7,000 for local authorities in respect of the improvement of county homes, and for the provision of alternative accommodation for certain classes hitherto maintained therein.  If the Minister expects to cover that item with £7,000, I can tell him that he could give us ten times that amount in Cork and it would not do. We have endeavoured for a long time in Cork to get suitable places to which we could send those aged and infirm. We picked out the Kinsale Hospital which was under our control.  We went down ourselves with our engineer, inspected it and found it a suitable place.  The brass hats from the Department of Health then came down and said it would not do, that we would have to build a new one.  We went down to Youghal, where there is the fine bracing air of a seaside resort. The brass hats again came down and said that would not do either.</P>
    <P>We have frequent visits from officials of the Minister's Department. We have always found them courteous. They are all right until they get back to the Department and then the old story starts.  This change and that change has to be made and that goes on for about 12 months with nothing being done.  If we could get the aged and infirm removed from St. Finbarr's <Col N="108" /> Hospital in Cork and the premises that is occupied by these people reconstructed a little, which would not cost so much, we would not want any regional hospital in Cork.  Thanks to the generosity of Deputy Dr. Browne we had a guarantee of £2,000,000 for that hospital.  The building of this regional hospital has been under consideration for about 25 years.  In 1948 Deputy Dr. Browne met the county manager and myself as chairman of the board.  We got a guarantee for the cash and that is a very treasured document.  I think we nearly framed it.</P>

      <P>The only people who have succeeded in drawing any money from the regional hospital scheme are those who drew up the plans.  I think they have received about £50,000. Many plans were discussed.  At various times we got a message from the Department that a new move was being made, and each time it turned out to be a false alarm.  Every five years the whole aspect of hospitalisation here is changed.  Therefore, the plans which cost about £20,000 are paid for and thrown away and a new plan is produced. At any rate, in respect of Cork regional hospital the designers and the architects have already collected in the neighbourhood of £50,000.  That is the only bill against it.  Under the former Minister, I think, we got another move on, and we started digging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree that the regional hospital is not required if common sense is used, but there must be common sense in this matter.  It would not cost an enormous amount of money to convert either Kinsale, Youghal or Midleton hospital to hold practically the whole of our aged and infirm people at present in Cork City.  I am certain that the whole job would be done in any one of the three for less than £100,000.  That would leave St. Finbarr's free to be used as a hospital and treated as a hospital.  But every <Col N="109" /> time we endeavoured to do anything in St. Finbarr's during the last 20 years we were immediately told by the Minister's Department: &ldquo;Stop&mdash;the new regional hospital will be going ahead.&rdquo;  The £2,000,000 carrot was dangled before our noses whenever we endeavoured to make any improvements which we considered absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>The nurses' home, God save the mark, at St. Finbarr's to-day is something into which you would not like to put anybody for whom you had any respect.  For the past 12 years we have been endeavouring to get the Department to agree on a nurses' home.  On the last occasion on which the officials were down we mentioned the regional hospital and they told us to forget all about it for the next couple of years because there was no money.  When we asked for £25,000 or £30,000 out of the £2,250,000 or £2,500,000 that was tied up in regard to the regional hospital, they did not have that either and we do not know where we are.</P>
    <P>If the job I suggest were done I believe that for less than £500,000&mdash;I would nearly be prepared to settle with the Minister to-morrow for £500,000 of that £2,500,000 that was promised&mdash;we would get what we want done in the way it should be done, considering that the palaces that are being built in that line are such that the ratepayers will not be able to keep them going.  I hope the Minister realises that.</P>
    <P>I want to pay Deputy Dr. Browne this tribute.  He did succeed in handling the situation as regards tuberculosis in County Cork.  He did a powerful job of work there.  He went around, not looking for new hospitals, but he begged from North Cork Board, from the South Cork Board and from the West Cork Board, the hospitals that were lying idle, and he used them before we succeeded in getting St. Stephen's at Glanmire.  Tuberculosis is well on the wane so far as Cork County is concerned, thank God.  As a matter of fact the position now is that some three months ago we were considering closing down two of the hospitals we had taken over and handing them back to the local authorities.  We have handed over the tuberculosis hospital <Col N="110" /> at Doneraile to the Mental Hospital Board and it has room for a couple of hundred patients.  Yesterday we agreed to hand over another one.  We were able to do all that and still take a number of patients from Limerick in our tuberculosis hospital as it stands at present.</P>
    <P>My personal opinion is that there will be several blocks of that hospital idle within the next ten years and that is a shorter period than it would take to build a good regional hospital.  Why then come along and build a new regional hospital in Cork at a cost of £2,500,000?  Mark you, that estimate is fairly old; I think it is a 1948 estimate, and I do not know how far things have climbed since then.  The guarantee given was that it would be built and equipped without one penny cost to the ratepayers.  We hold that written guarantee and I think that guarantee would have a pretty good bargaining power with the Department even at present.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should send down some of his officials to Cork and let us go into the whole question of the position in Cork County and thrash it out.  But before he sends such officials I want a guarantee that something will be done as a result of their visit.  I want some guarantee that if we look for money for a nurses' home&mdash;his officials know the present condition of the nurses' home at St. Finbarr's and they can come there and go through it again&mdash;and if we look for a home for our aged and infirm patients who are at present occupying at least two or three blocks of St. Finbarr's, and seek alternative accommodation for them, we do not want to be told that it cannot be done and that we must build new premises.  The times for building new premises here are gone.  There is no money.  Whatever ha'pennies are left in the Treasury or can be gathered in, have not only been spent but have been pledged by the boys who had a spree over six years.  We now have to settle down and see what can be done with the resources we have available.</P>
    <P>We have to come to a decision and see how far those resources can be used now, and not in ten or 20 years' time. <Col N="111" /> It is now these things are required. We have spent something over £500,000 on St. Finbarr's over a period of years. It is a first-class hospital, a fine hospital, in many respects.  If we could convert the balance of it into a hospital, and it would not cost an enormous sum, the major problem as regards hospitalisation in Cork would be solved.  In a very short time, we will have two vacant hospitals, one in Skibbereen and the other in Macroom. These are at present being used for tuberculosis patients.  Unfortunately these hospitals are too small for the purpose we had in mind, namely, a home for the aged and infirm.  In the three towns I mentioned&mdash;Youghal, Midleton and Kinsale&mdash;there is plenty of space and there are buildings which could be converted very easily and very cheaply for that purpose.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Department telling me something to the contrary. We have our own engineers and I think as highly of their opinion as I do of anybody else's.  The Minister will have a difficult task.  I believe he will make a success of it if he can bring his Department to stop thinking in millions and come down to thousands.  If he can do that, we shall get somewhere. He must put a stop to this procrastination and see to it that when a local authority makes up its mind that something is required, it will not be put off with a wave of the hand and &ldquo;Oh yes, that is all right; but we will be putting up a regional hospital&rdquo;.  That game is played out.  It has been played on the people of Cork for the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>One individual benefits.  It is not the man wielding the spade or the shovel; it is not the man handling the mortar and the bricks.  It is the fellow who draws little lines with a pencil on paper.  He gets his haul and, if things go on as they are going at present, he will have three or four more hauls without the day coming any nearer when the people of Cork will have a regional hospital.</P>
    <P>I have given the facts as I know them.  I should like the Minister to let me know what he has found out in connection with the bill I gave him. <Col N="112" /> When I say that our health services are open to abuse, I could add that these services have, in my opinion, been availed of especially by medical practitioners to draw double pay and double salaries.  They are drawing salaries under the Health Act from the local authority, which is reimbursed to the extent of 50 per cent. by the State, and they are drawing again from the unfortunate private patient before he ever gets out the door.</P>

      <P>As one who is very keen on the operation of the Health Act, I was very pleased to hear earlier speakers state that tuberculosis is almost wiped out.  It was pleasant to hear that we are within sight of closing down some of our sanatoria.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently, I discovered that it costs close on £10 10s. to maintain <Col N="113" /> a patient in a sanatorium.  When a patient is discharged, however, the allowance is only £1 10s. per week. One can imagine the position of a discharged patient trying to live on 30/- per week, maintaining himself, paying rent and everything else.  Does any Deputy believe that that man can get back his strength to go out and earn a week's wages?</P>
      <P>The money spent in sanatorium treatment should be followed up by more generous allowances to ex-patients in the convalescent stage. That is a matter mainly for county councils but when there are members of county councils who, like some Deputies, are not in full agreement with the Health Act and who are not too anxious to grant money for these purposes, the State should step in and provide that people who are discharged from sanatoria should receive sufficient for their maintenance over a certain period so that they may regain their strength and go into the labour market.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Health Act, many people, school children and so on are now attending clinics.  Increased accommodation has not been provided, with the result that people come long distances by bus and wait all day at the clinics, only to be told to go home and to come back the following week. Facilities should be provided in hospitals to ensure that people will receive attention when they attend.</P>
      <P>Prior to the enactment of the Health Act, an insured worker got free hospital service.  His insurance paid for his treatment.  Under the Health Act, such a worker has to pay £3 10s. per week.  The Minister is not responsible for that but I would ask him to look into it very carefully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Over a long period. Now the treatment is not free for any period.  He has to pay £3 10s. a week. I want it to be quite clear that I am not blaming the Minister for that.  It is a matter that the House should consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Deputies suggest that <Col N="114" /> there are too many hospitals.  I do not subscribe to that view.  I remember a time when there were more hospitals in North Tipperary than there are now.  There was a hospital in Borrisokane.  It is my view that a system of additional cottage hospitals with one or two big hospitals where surgical treatment would be provided would give a better service.  In North Tipperary there is a waiting list of 30 to 50 people for Nenagh hospital.  It is a new hospital but apparently there was more bed accommodation in the old hospital.  Only the most urgent cases have been called in and some patients have been waiting for eight months.</P>
    <P>On the question of medical cards, I find that people who, prior to the Health Act coming into operation, received free medical treatment, have to pay the medical doctor.  I speak on behalf of people who are not able to pay.  I know cases of labourers living in cottages who, because they have sons earning, have been refused medical cards.  Possibly the father may be above the age at which he would be entitled to the maximum agricultural rate of wages and the son may not hand up even one-quarter of his earnings but the county managers assess the full rate of wages for the father and the son and the medical card is refused.  When these old people fall sick they have no medical card.  The doctors, in their generosity, have attended those people but payment is demanded.</P>
    <P>As far as workers and small farmers are concerned, the Health Act is not working in the way I anticipated.  A small farmer whose valuation is under £50 is supposed to be entitled to free medical service but that is not the case.  Farmers whose valuations are £9, £10, £11 and £12 have been refused medical cards and are getting no service whatever except what they can pay for.  Deputy Corry stated the case of a poor widow who had to pay £75. There is a case of a farmer in North Tipperary who has to pay £2,500, in respect of his brother, for whom he had no responsibility.  I went to the former Minister in regard to that case and was told that the Minister could do nothing <Col N="115" /> about it, that it was a matter for the county manager.  Can any Deputy imagine that anyone could be liable, in respect of a member of his family for whom he had no legal responsibility&mdash; he may have had a moral liability&mdash;to pay hospital expenses amounting to £2,500?  The result is that that man is selling his farm and house in order to try to pay that bill.</P>
    <P>There is a case of a blind pensioner who is drawing 24/- a week blind pension and who has been refused a medical card.  I went to the Minister about that case and was told that there was no appeal from the manager's decision.  When this man was very young his father died and willed him a small farm.  He lost his sight some years after that.  One of the family married into the farm and when the person concerned applied for the blind pension, the maximum pension of 24/- was awarded.  When he applied for a medical card the local authorities carried out an investigation and discovered that on paper he was the owner of this small farm and, consequently, was not entitled to a medical card.</P>
    <P>I believe that there should be available to Deputies and members of the general public an appeal from a decision of a county manager.  There are cases in which a county manager may make a mistake, but members of the House have no right to appeal to the Minister.  I think that is bad law.  I can assure the Minister that if members had such a right of appeal from a county manager's decision, it would not be abused.  I have already given to the previous Minister the cases of the man who has to pay £2,500 and the man with a blind pension, and I will give them to the present Minister to see if he, in his generosity, can do anything to help those people.</P>
    <P>Personally, I believe the Minister has no power to do anything because the Dáil, in their wisdom or otherwise, allowed the Health Act to go through without putting in a clause providing for the right of appeal for members of the House or the general public against a decision of a county manager. I ask the Minister to go into <Col N="116" /> this matter very carefully and see if it would be possible to have an appeal to someone when a wrong decision is made.</P>
    <P>I find that in many parts of the country our hospitals are understaffed. I do not know whether or not this is due to the fact that we think the Health Act is costing too much and we try to make a saving, such as in the case I mentioned of the tuberculosis allowance of only 30/-, or that we try to make a saving by understaffing our hospitals.  In any event, I find that, on the whole, our hospitals are understaffed. The result is that many nurses are leaving our hospital service and going across the water where they can get better conditions, both as regards salary and working hours.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I want to make this point also.  We were all delighted to read about the Health Act, but perhaps we are not so pleased with it when we see it working.  The white collar worker and the farmer up to £50 valuation and over now have to pay up to £9 9s. when they go into hospital.  In addition, they also have to pay the amount carried by the rates in respect of the people who qualify for treatment under the Health Act.  I believe there is an injustice there. Their children are entitled to free service while going to school, but if those people become ill themselves, or if it is a case of their wives and children of 16 and over becoming ill, they have to pay the full rate of £9 10s.  I believe there should be a little more elasticity. I know farmers under £50 valuation&mdash; not many, I admit&mdash;who could afford to pay, and I know farmers of over £50 valuation who are a lot poorer.  It all depends on the family conditions. So long as we pass legislation giving power to one man, and one man only, and allowing no appeal from his decisions, we will always have complaints and always have injustice.</P>

      <P>The last speaker made some remarks that prompted me to intervene, perhaps only to ask a couple of questions.  This subject has been thrashed out in considerable detail over the years.  The question I would like to ask is this.  Here is a Deputy from the far side who says <Col N="117" /> that the situation, from the point of view of the community, in regard to getting health services freely, is worse now than before the passing of these Health Acts.  If that Deputy were to make that statement in an isolated way, or if any other Deputy were to do so, he would be immediately challenged, but the reason I intervened is simply this.  We have frequently heard similar remarks in other places about the futility in many directions of legislating for health and about the difficulties that have come out of the new legislation rather than the reliefs. I would like to ask the Minister would he sometime at a favourable opportunity be able to give us some authentic information about the working of the Health Act?</P>
      <P>I know that practically all Deputies &mdash;certainly very many of them&mdash;have got a number of complaints about the operation of the Health Act.  It is very frequently said that the situation is worse now in certain directions, from the point of view of people seeking service, than it was before.  It is very difficult to assess the value of such complaints because the people who make them are making them from a particular point of view.  I would welcome a comprehensive statement sometime from the Minister as to how the Health Acts&mdash;the legislation over the last ten years in regard to health&mdash;have been working.</P>
      <P>I have absolutely no doubt myself that in certain directions there has been a considerable and favourable advance.  I think another Deputy mentioned earlier on&mdash;and it is a good point&mdash;that fevers were eliminated by the organisation of health services in the past and that, to-day, tuberculosis has been to a great extent eliminated by similar concerted action.  I have no difficulty, personally, in accepting that case.  There are specific problems to be solved and specific tasks to be done in regard to health, as there are in regard to other matters. I have no difficulty in accepting the proposition that a specific attack on a well organised line will give results. What I do query is this purported blanket provision for all contingencies which seems to inspire some of the approaches to health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> In the light of what the last Deputy said and in the light of what other Deputies have said, I question whether what I might call a completely socialised State service will give the advantages that are claimed for it.  I know that at present, apart from things such as those mentioned by the last Deputy, there are services which were available and which are not so readily available now.  I know, for instance, that the voluntary hospitals are in difficulties in regard to funds and in regard to the provision of services which they gave heretofore.  I know that a logical argument can be put up on the grounds that there are certain disbalances in these things.  But the fact remains that in the past, particularly in the City of Dublin, services were given, and there are now complaints that it is becoming increasingly difficult to give these services.  I am talking about general illness, not about specific diseases such as tuberculosis. Our efforts heretofore and our efforts recently to amend that situation do not seem to have given general satisfaction.</P>
    <P>When I pose these questions, I do so as a layman and merely to ascertain the answers to them.  Is it a fact that by and large, as far as the public is concerned in regard to what I might call general dispensary services and general health services, they are, say, in the City of Dublin, getting as good, better or worse services than they were before the Health Act?  In saying that, there is no questioning the good work done in certain specified directions.  Is it a fact, perhaps because of hesitant thinking, that the services which are at present being given, and have been given efficiently in the past, by voluntary institutions are in jeopardy because their capacity to give these services is not what it was?  One would naturally also ask the question&mdash;as a layman, I cannot answer it&mdash;what are the repercussions in regard to the service given by the medical profession in the past, is it the same, better or worse?  I pose these questions, first of all, because of the remarks of the last speaker, who stimulated me to remembering a number of things which have been said to me in my capacity as a Deputy and, secondly, because of <Col N="119" /> representations which have been made to me over the past six years.</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We all realise the important connection between health services and the everyday life of our people.  Because of that, I consider this Estimate is one of the very important Estimates to be discussed. I think it is fair for me to pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor because during his period as Minister, he approached these problems&mdash;it is true that many of them were individual cases&mdash;in a manner befitting a Minister for Health.  The first problem I should like to concentrate on is the whole problem of the dispensaries, whether in rural areas or built-up areas.  One of the most noticeable failures we have to recognise is the very bad dispensaries in every part of the country and it is a fact that in other areas there is much too great a distance between these buildings.  In answer to a question which I put a few weeks ago, the Minister stated that during the past four or five years, about £5,000 was allocated to a very large county like Cork for the erection of dispensaries. I consider that it is most important that we should concentrate on the erection of many dispensaries to replace some of the existing ones which are at present in a disgraceful condition.</P>
      <P>I also deplore the fact that, of late, the tendency seems to be to hold up the building of dispensaries in many areas already earmarked for them.  I would ask the Minister to speed up the erection of these buildings and to have the claims of the various local authorities, including Cork, who have submitted plans for sanction, dealt with at the earliest possible moment. Many of us, whether we are in favour of regional hospitals or not, realise that the outstanding difficulty seems to be the reluctance of many people, particularly in rural areas, to visit the local dispensaries because of the terrible conditions of those buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ultimate result seems to be that <Col N="120" /> the patient, instead of calling on the local doctor in the dispensary in the early stages of illness, waits until the doctor has to be sent for and the next step of course is the patient's admission into the local hospital.  Possibly at that stage the patient's illness has gone too far for anything to be done for him.  I believe that with a proper dispensary service and with understanding and co-operation between the local dispensary doctor and the people, such a service being offered in proper buildings would automatically result in fewer admissions to the hospitals of cases that could have been treated if dealt with in the early stages.</P>
    <P>Coupled with that is another point which I believe must have a direct bearing on the services of local dispensaries and that is having the services of a general trained nurse available in every dispensary district.  For many years, we have been striving to have this system put into operation and while it has been in operation for the past four or five years, it is only to a limited extent.  It is not alone necessary to have a qualified doctor attending in a well-constructed dispensary, but also to have a general trained nurse at the disposal of the people, particularly for those who, having spent a short period in hospital, return home to find it necessary to have medical treatment there.  It is essential I believe to have a general trained nurse in the district so that this service can be placed at the disposal of isolated cases.  It will mean giving a health service in rural areas where at the present time facilities are not available for transport to towns for medical purposes. It will give to outlying rural areas an advantage from a medical point of view which is most important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tierney, Deputy Major de Valera and many other Deputies spoke on the question of medical cards.  My view is the same as that of the other speakers.  We did support the Health Act.  I am sure every one of us believed that in doing that it would provide certain advantages but, unfortunately, one of the problems still remaining is that of medical cards.  I shall not bore the House with individual cases except to say that in my constituency road <Col N="121" /> workers with families, who had no difficulty in the past in getting the local dispensary doctor's services free, or having the local dispensary doctor call to their homes if necessary, in a large number of cases now can point out to public representatives of all Parties that, whereas under the old system they had certain benefits, these benefits at present seem to be denied to them.  The only suggestion I would offer to the Minister is to have this whole question examined from an angle different from that which members have already suggested.</P>
    <P>When the Health Act was put into operation conferences of the county managers' association were held and the figures submitted by them seem to have been accepted by the Minister and the Department.  Unfortunately the schemes that were to have been put into operation were based on the views of a number of men, which while perhaps well-intentioned, were not elastic enough to give benefits to those people who should get them.  I would suggest to the Minister to have this whole matter reinvestigated, in view of the fact that members on all sides of the House are finding difficulty in relation to the rights of some people to secure medical cards and the refusal of the local authorities to give them to other people.  That shows, that though we may have advanced our medical services under the Health Act, in this particular instance we seem to have gone backwards.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that Deputy Corry spoke so long and so ably about one problem in Cork this evening, I suppose most Deputies would like to hear no more about it.  However, I think it is but fair for me to ask the Minister for Health to have immediate attention given to the problem of the nurses' home at St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork.  It is true to say that these girls, probationers trained in this hospital by an excellent staff, are compelled to live under appalling conditions.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corry rightly said, the problem is well known to the officials of the Department.  The situation was well known to Deputy O'Higgins when he was Minister and he examined this <Col N="122" /> particular case.  When we are discussing an Estimate like this it is more important that we approach it from a humanitarian, rather than a political point of view.  I would ask the Minister not to be misled by any suggestion in relation to the possibility or probability of the erection of a regional hospital in Cork, in dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>The danger is that if the present situation is allowed to continue at the nurses' home in St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork Deputies will find, not alone to their disappointment but to the great expense of the ratepayers of Cork, that they will not be able to get probationers trained there, or nurses to enter the medical service in Cork, owing to the fact that their parents will not allow their daughters to live in such conditions.  I hope that by this time 12 months, not alone will the Minister have something to report on this particular item, but that a start will have been made, long before the 12 months has expired, on the erection at that hospital of something that can be called a proper nurses' home.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should like to pay tribute to the officials of the Department who attended conferences in Cork. They brought back to the Department a clear, concise picture of conditions there.  I shall not go as far as Deputy Corry in laying blame on the officials of the Department, though perhaps he did so unwittingly.  I would ask the Minister to get the views of the officials on this matter and proceed with the erection of this important new structure.</P>
    <P>I should also like to direct the Minister's attention to the appalling conditions in Cork Mental Hospital.  All the facts in relation to the requests of the Cork Mental Hospital Committee seeking sanction to proceed with the erection of additional buildings at that institution are in the Department. Therefore, there is no need for me to say anything except to ask the Minister for Health to concentrate on dealing with this problem of terrible overcrowding in that hospital.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is not surprising that there is something upon which I disagree <Col N="123" /> with Deputy Corry.  In this case, Deputy Corry had the support of a Deputy on my left.  Whether it is a case of the just man being between two thieves or not I cannot say, but I do not agree with his views in relation to the regional hospital in Cork.  I know regional hospitals cost a lot of money to build.  I know that no matter what priority new hospitals may have there is always the problem of finance.  It may be an important problem but, unfortunately, the situation in Cork is a very old and very bad one.</P>
    <P>I took very little notice of Deputy Corry's remarks about &ldquo;All the boys&rdquo;, to use his own words, spending all the money.  It is his belief that a considerable sum of money was spent, but some of us saw very little of it going into our constituencies.  In spite of Deputy Corry's remarks, the position is that it is impossible at the present time to get a patient into any of the hospitals in Cork, be it a general hospital, cottage hospital, Cork City hospital or the voluntary hospitals, because of overcrowding.  If anyone here is to advance an argument against the erection of a regional hospital in Cork he must be prepared to have a long waiting list either at the local authority hospitals or at the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>Again, this is to be a regional hospital and not meant solely for the benefit either of Cork City or Cork County.  It being a regional hospital, Cork City and Cork County can get only a proportion of the beds.  If Deputy Corry wishes to say there is no necessity for the regional hospital, I would point out that, as well as condemning the people of Cork City and County to an inadequacy of beds, he is also condeming the people of other cities and counties who, not having a regional hospital of their own, would also be able to benefit by the erection of a regional hospital.  Already we have gone too far and spent too much money, whether by way of architects' fees, and so forth, to go back.  A very fine site has been acquired.  It would be very poor consolation, after the expenditure of thousands of pounds, to drop the whole thing now.  I do not believe it would be the right step.  The <Col N="124" /> erection of the regional hospital is essential.  I know colleagues of Deputy Corry who are on the local board, as I am, and who have expressed views exactly similar to the views which I now express.</P>
    <P>In the voluntary hospitals as well as in the local authority hospitals in Cork City and County, there is unfortunately complete overcrowding at present.  The only remedy is the erection of the regional hospital.  We should give the people the benefits which can undoubtedly be made available of an up-to-date system with an excellent staff of Irish doctors and Irish nurses who are continuously proving their ability, whether here in Ireland or in other countries.</P>
    <P>Speaking of staff, I think we should mention the outstanding ability of the nurses in the voluntary and the local authority hospitals.  Very briefly, I suggest the Minister should consider their present position in relation not just to their working hours but to their salaries.  Their working hours are a matter for their union, but the Minister should consider their salaries in consultation with their organisation.  It may be possible for him to improve their present financial situation.  Many of us know that the bargaining power of the doctors is such that they are never left with the wrong end of the stick.  They are never in the position of looking for a few &ldquo;bob&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, the practice in this country always seems to have been that, while the medical staff were well able to protect themselves, the nurses in these hospitals who do trojan work always seem to be left out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry mentioned St. Finbarr's Hospital.  I agree that a large amount of money must be spent on its improvement.  I fear the present Minister may be inclined to follow a line, which undoubtedly would be dangerous, in relation to the continuation of the services in St. Finbarr's Hospital <i>versus</i> the erection of a regional hospital.  I believe, as many members of the local authority believe (1) that it is essential that we should get the regional hospital and (2) that St. Finbarr's Hospital must still be maintained.  It is on the records of the <Col N="125" /> Department that there is the danger that St. Finbarr's Hospital cannot be recognised as a teaching hospital. Should that happen, probationers cannot be there.  The hospital would have to employ a fully qualified staff.  There would, of necessity, have to be a higher number of fully qualified nurses who would have to receive their appropriate salaries.</P>
    <P>There is the further point that at present St. Finbarr's are offering the benefit of technical advances in medical services which have been so noticeable over the past six or seven or eight years and even since the war.  It is essential that these services should continue, not, naturally, on the basis of regionalisation, but on the basis of providing in the future for the people of South Cork&mdash;which includes the South Cork area and Cork City&mdash;the services which they have found helpful in the past.</P>
    <P>Some people have stated that we have too many hospitals.  This theme seems to be spreading from different angles.  It seems to be more an individual claim than the line of any particular Party.  It is strange that when people tell us we have too many hospitals, they seem to forget the appalling conditions of mental defectives in this country.  If we have too many hospitals, why not use some of them for homes for those little boys? Those of us who have visited, for instance, the Brothers of Charity Hospital in Cork, can realise the tragedy of the life of those children. The conditions under which these religious brothers must labour day after day are appalling.  If we have too many hospitals, why not offer better facilities to these religious brothers and to the religious community in Cabra whose institution I have not had an opportunity of visiting, but about whose work I know a great deal?  If conditions can be made a little easier for these children by placing homes or hospitals at their disposal&mdash;buildings which some people now allege are not needed&mdash;then perhaps, after that, we may consider where we shall go.  With the present position in relation (1) to overcrowding in the few homes we have and (2) to the impossibility of <Col N="126" /> permitting many children to enter these homes, owing to their already overcrowded state, it ill-behoves any member of any Party in this House or any member of the general public to tell us we are spending too much on medical services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry and Deputy O'Higgins apparently crossed swords on the question of charges.  I will not condemn all the practitioners, but it is essential that we should speak plainly and that we should say what we know to be true.  If one compares the position in different hospitals with the conditions prevailing in them some few years ago before the introduction of the Health Act, one must wonder why extra private beds have been made available in so many hospitals compared with some years ago.  The answer, at least as far as Deputy Corry and myself are concerned, as well as many other members, is that we believe the practice is growing all the time of a local doctor, when treating a local patient, suggesting that, instead of going to the clinic where the patient can get not alone advice but, if necessary, admission to hospital under the medical services, the patient should go to the home of a private consultant.</P>
    <P>What happens very often is that the doctor will send the patient up to the home of a private consultant.  As soon as the patient shows his nose inside the room of the consultant, he is treated as a private patient.  The next move is to send him into a private room in a hospital.  That is not good enough.  While we may differ on many points in this House, the one thing upon which we did not differ in the 1952-53 period was the question of giving better health services.  Did any member of the Labour Party, when trying to provide that service in 1953, ever visualise the day when advantage would be taken of an Act to send people to a private consultant's room and into a private room in a hospital?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have this matter investigated, to consider the overall picture in relation to the number of private beds being made available in hospitals since the introduction of the Health Act and to compare it <Col N="127" /> with the position prior to that.  That does not apply to all medical practitioners, but even if it applies only to a minority, it is essential that the matter be investigated and the result made known to the members of this House and the community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point I want to deal with fairly briefly on this Estimate.  It is a question of the machinery for payment by local authorities of payments under the Health Act.  I asked the Minister some questions on this subject and he gave me his replies to them.  I do not want to trespass by being taken as advocating legislation, but I do want to recommend to the Minister that it might be well worth while making a comparatively slight change in administration, with a view to assisting him and his officials in whatever inquiry or review they may be undertaking in connection with these payments.</P>
      <P>The Minister may recollect that the point I wanted to bring to his attention was the fact that where patients are treated in a hospital following injuries sustained as a result of an accident and where, subsequently, the local authority accept responsibility for the institutional services provided for that person, if the injured party at a later date recovers damages against the insured person, the present position is that, although the local authority will have paid out for the institutional services provided for the injured person, the local authority, through the machinery which exists under the Health Act, have no way of recouping themselves for the amount paid out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no idea what the total cost to local authorities of such payments over the past 12 months would have amounted to.  Apparently the Minister is not in a position to give that figure to the House.  The reason he is not in a position to do that is given in a reply to a question which I asked him last week or the week before.  I asked the Minister if he would state in relation to the City and County of Dublin, the amount paid under the Health Act, 1953, by the appropriate health authorities for hospitalisation for <Col N="128" /> persons injured in accidents during the 12 months ended 31st May, 1957 or the nearest convenient 12 month period. The Minister's reply was that the information requested by the Deputy was not available in his Department. The form of application for services did not disclose the nature of the complaint, nor did it indicate that the patient met with an accident.  It was not, therefore, possible to ascertain the amount paid by health authorities to hospitals in respect of services provided for persons who had been injured in accidents.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to misunderstand me.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the particular form of application for services which is used now should be altered in such a way as to disclose the nature of the patient's complaint, but, without disclosing the nature of the patient's complaint, I think it would be quite proper and prudent that local authorities should be asked to make provision in the application form for ascertaining whether or not the services are being sought by reason of an injury following an accident.</P>
    <P>The reason I think that information should be obtained is, as I have indicated in my questions to the Minister, that, as the matter stands at the moment, it seems there is no machinery whereby the local authority can recoup themselves.  In cases where a third party has been proved before the courts to have been guilty of negligence and an award of damages is made, in such cases I do not think there is any point in not speaking quite freely about it.  Most of such cases will arise because of road accidents and, in most of such cases, some unfortunate insurance company will ultimately pay out the damages that are awarded.  So long as the present system is allowed to remain unaltered, it seems to me, in any event&mdash;and I think I am quite correct in this&mdash;that the local authority can be said to be subsidising to a certain extent the insurance companies, because the local authorities are obliged, under the health scheme as it is at the moment, to provide these institutional services, and it is left at that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> No machinery is provided whereby they can be recouped in the circumstances which I have outlined where there is a successful litigant who secures an award for damages in court.  The Minister was good enough to indicate, in reply to the first question I asked, that this matter was one which is being kept under review.  The alteration I suggest should be made is simply for the purpose of enabling the Minister and his Department to find out to what extent payments are being made by local authorities in respect of accident cases, because it is a fair bet that quite a large amount of money paid out by them in respect of accident cases is money which could and, I think, should be recouped.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be very necessary in connection with any review or any consideration which the Minister and his Department are giving to the subject that he should at the earliest moment ensure there will be some system whereby that information can be made available to the local authority.  The only system that I can think of is that the question should be asked on whatever form of application or questionnaire that has to be completed when these institutional services are being requested.  I would ask the Minister to give that point his earnest consideration.</P>
    <P>It is only a matter of a few days or at most a few weeks since the Minister was in the position of coming to this House to increase charges for patients under the Health Act and the total saving&mdash;put it that way&mdash;it was hoped to make as a result of that increase was somewhere in the region of £180,000.  For all the Minister knows, for all the information he has given to me, the suggestion I am now making to him might result in a saving of a very substantial amount and might, if it were operated at an early date, make possible a reduction in the charges which the Government found it necessary to increase recently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should not do less than express my appreciation of the way in which this Estimate has been received by the House.  In that connection, I mention particularly the speech made <Col N="130" /> by my predecessor, Deputy O'Higgins, and the speech made by an earlier predecessor, Deputy Dr. Browne.  The tone of the debate indicates that the question of health services has risen now above the range of political polemics.  That is not to say, of course, that a Minister's policy will be above criticism or that a Minister's administration will be above criticism; but it is clear that a greal deal of common ground has been established between those who have spoken in this debate.</P>
      <P>We are all concerned to ensure that the health of our people is preserved, that if they should be stricken by illness, we will see that the best treatment within the power of the community is made available to them and that those who are born into this country will be able to grow to manhood and enjoy a long and fruitful life. We may, of course, have some reservations as to the manner in which this can be accomplished.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne devoted a large part of the latter portion of his speech to a statement of his position in relation to the means test&mdash;or, as he said, a free-for-all medical service.  I have given a great deal of consideration to that and I still feel that Deputy Dr. Browne's logic is not impeccable.  He argues that if a person pays, he gets better treatment and service than if he does not pay; and as a consequence of that, he suggests that nobody should be allowed to pay.  It seems to me that the logical conclusion should be that, if you want everybody to have the best medical service obtainable, then everybody should be asked to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the fundamental weakness in Deputy Dr. Browne's argument is that he confuses, I think, the question of medical treatment proper with the surroundings and the amenities which patients may enjoy.  It is undeniable that those who can afford to go to private nursing homes, retain the services of private nurses and so on, will endure their illness in surroundings which are more comfortable than the surroundings of those who have to go to a public ward and cannot enjoy the seclusion, the privacy and the quiet of a private ward.  I do not think it is contended that it will be within the <Col N="131" /> means of any community, let alone this community, to provide every patient with a private nurse, a private ward and all the comfort which usually goes therewith.</P>
    <P>What we can do and what we are endeavouring to do is to ensure that the greatest possible measure of high medical skill will be available to everyone, whether he is rich or poor.  Even there again, we cannot all have equal treatment, as not even the highest qualified practitioners are equally efficacious as medical attendants.  There are questions of personality, as well as of skill, which make one doctor more acceptable to a patient than another. No matter what one does, one cannot give equal treatment to everyone, whether they are asked to pay or not. What we should aim at ensuring is that those who, by reason of the fact that their own resources do not permit them to do otherwise, have to avail of public assistance&mdash;and I use that term in a general way and I am not using it in the sense in which it is used in the public assistance code&mdash;that is, those who have to ask for such services as the community can provide for them, will get the best that is within the power of the community to afford. That is what we can do.</P>
    <P>We are striving to do that and we allow those who cannot afford to pay anything to secure the services free. In the case of those who can afford to contribute something, I think it is only right, just, fair and equitable that they should contribute.  In the case of those who can afford to pay the whole cost of treatment, I think it is also only just, fair and equitable that they should pay the whole cost, so as to lighten the burden on the general community and make those services more readily available to those who are in dire need of them.  That is my position, at any rate.  I do not think we need continue the controversy which has been going on for such a considerable time on this question of a means test.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any analogy or any true parallel between what is done in relation to tuberculosis, infectious diseases, mother and child <Col N="132" /> services and the services which are provided in treating acute illnesses; nor can we say, as Deputy Dr. Browne has argued, that the reason why tuberculosis services have been so efficacious is that they are provided <i>gratls.</i>  To assume that is to ignore the other very great factors&mdash;the improvement in housing to which Deputy Manley referred, the rising standard of living, the development of new treatments and of course the better diagnostic and preventive treatments which are readily available.  These all have combined to reduce the mortality and the incidence of tuberculosis amongst us.</P>
    <P>I think that we cannot ascribe, as Deputy Dr. Browne seems continually to do, the progress which is being made in overcoming infectious diseases merely to the single circumstance that the community, for its own protection, has made the preventive services available free of charge.  It may be a factor but I, for one, do not think it is the predominant factor; I do not think, if we were to make all our medical services free of charge to everyone, that we would secure the general improvement in those services which Deputy Dr. Browne is so anxious to secure.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which he referred was the opinion I expressed that we can no longer afford to maintain the same lavish use of space and materials as characterised the hospital building programme since in fact the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes were first established. I would very strongly deny that my approach to this problem of providing hospital accommodation for all those who are in need of it is that the sick are too well housed.  I want to say that as far as I am concerned there is no justification for the innuendo in that statement.</P>
    <P>I think we can provide hospital accommodation by using space economically and by reducing, generally, unnecessary and unessential frills and adornments without imperilling high standards of treatment and reasonable standards of accommodation. Deputy Dr. Browne said that if he had been in on the early planning of sanatoria he would not have accepted the pavilion idea, that he would have preferred multi-storey hospitals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> I was in at the early planning stages of the sanatoria.  I have to admit that I was responsible, in the ultimate analysis, for accepting the general pavilion plan upon which the regional sanatoria were built.  They were, of course, in a very early stage of planning then.  The initial planning was initiated under the Department of Local Government and Public Health. I may say that, having regard to the position in which we now find ourselves in relation to the problem of providing hospital accommodation, I very bitterly regret that I was not sufficiently farsighted to foresee what the ultimate result of this very spacious, very elaborate, highly desirable planning from a monumental viewpoint might be.</P>
    <P>If I had to do it all over again and try to set a headline I certainly would not have encouraged the erection of buildings which would endure for many generations, because during the past ten or 12 years there have been such striking advances made in chemotherapy and medical treatment that it is very questionable whether we should build hospitals that would last for several lifetimes ahead.  It is quite possible that within a couple of generations some of these large hospital structures will be standing as deserted as some of the big houses are.</P>
    <P>I have not come to a definite decision in this regard.  It would be folly to do so after only three months in the Department. I should like to consider the problem at greater length, to let it ferment in my mind.  I have not even seen some of the institutions mentioned here to-day, but my general feeling is that there is such an urgent demand for accommodation that it would be better for us if we could build very much more cheaply, not to last two or three generations but 20 or 30 years.  That might be the best approach to finding an early solution for our difficulties.  If we build to last, we build slowly and expensively.  The position we find ourselves in now is that our resources do not permit us to build expensively.</P>
    <P>To come back to some of the detailed points raised in the course of the debate, perhaps I had better deal <Col N="134" /> with a question raised by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.  He asked the very important question as to what was the present position in relation to poliomyelitis and the extent to which the preventive measures have been availed of since the vaccination campaign began.  The age groups included in the scheme are, as I said in reply to a parliamentary question by Deputy Dr. Browne to-day, from one to three years as at 30th June, 1957.  The number in that age group is about 125,000 children, approximately.  The number of eligible applications for vaccination which have been received is about 10 per cent. of that figure, 12,299.  We are about to undertake an extension of the scheme to the three to five age group.  We are, in fact, seeking financial authority in that matter and I feel sure it will be readily granted.  The number of eligible persons to which this extension applies is 124,000.</P>
    <P>I cannot add anything to what I have already said as to the general acceptance of the view that vaccination against poliomyelitis is a very valuable precautionary measure and that it should be generally availed of, particularly by those responsible for the upbringing and care of children and, indeed, by adults as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We had £20,000 available altogether.  I do not think it will be necessary for us to ask for more until we see that the scheme is being availed of.  I suppose the people are naturally hesitant.  It might appear to those who are not fully informed as to the actual results elsewhere, that in view of certain incidents which occurred some years ago, they had better wait and see how the vaccination goes with others before they submit their children to it.  Out of 100,000,000 vaccinations which have taken place elsewhere there has not <Col N="135" /> been a known case of the occurrence of poliomyelitis as a result of the vaccine treatment.  I think that is the position and it should be very reassuring to us.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins also mentioned the question of the Ardkeen dispensary. We have been trying to persuade the Waterford County Council to accept it as a general hospital, but while they have accepted our proposal in principle, they have attached conditions to that acceptance which will be very difficult for us to agree to.  I do hope they will agree to take our point of view in the matter because if they do not it will mean they will be without a general hospital for a very long time.  There is a very fine building there which could be readily adapted and which would give them, within a very short space of time, the institution which they require to meet their needs.  It would be better for them to take it as it is offered to them and at least allow those who require hospital treatment to have the benefit of its use.</P>
      <P>In regard to the few questions which Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Dr. Browne put to me as to the institutions within the provisional programme upon which work would begin at an early date, I have not come to any decision in that matter for the reason that the financial position is so uncertain that I want to see quite clearly that it will be possible for us to complete these institutions once they have begun and that there will not be any unnecessary hold up.  That means we must have a certain amount of cash reserve in the Hospital Trust Fund before we can start any building operations.  There are preliminary works which could be done and which would not cost a lot, but then the undertaking of preliminary work generally involves a commitment which it is not always possible to fulfil.  I want to make quite certain that once we give sanction to any of these schemes, they will go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the question of medical education, and so also, indirectly, did Deputy Carty.  This, of course, is primarily a matter for the <Col N="136" /> medical schools themselves.  We are very interested naturally because we wish to see that the medical qualifications of our practitioners are very high.  We wish to see that they are properly educated for their job, but the law provides that universities come within the purview of the Minister for Education and, in addition to that, as I have said, the question of medical education is really one for the medical schools themselves.</P>
    <P>So far as the utilisation of institutions like St. Kevin's is concerned, if any suggestion is put forward to associate St. Kevin's with the medical schools, I certainly shall be prepared to consider it very sympathetically in so far as I have any control.  However, I want at the same time to make it quite clear that no arrangement which would jeopardise the independence of St. Kevin's would be acceptable.  Great progress has been made with that institution in the past ten years, progress that has been made very largely because the institution has been free and independent of any other consideration except its responsibility for providing institutional treatment for the poor of Dublin.  I wish that position to be preserved and maintained.</P>
    <P>I cannot join with Deputy Carty in his criticism of the Order which my predecessor made in relation to the Galway institution.  I must say if I had been in that position and the responsibility was conferred upon me as was conferred on my predecessor, Deputy Thomas O'Higgins, when he was Minister for Health, I should have made precisely the same Order.  I would have felt that it was in the national interest that the Galway Medical School should be preserved, and that is what was in issue.  We must not shut our eyes to the fact that reports of certain visitors to our medical schools contained very severe strictures upon the clinical accommodation and facilities which are afforded to our medical students, and those reports contained also a fair warning that unless conditions were considerably improved in the very near future, our medical degrees would not be recognised in Great Britain.  That would have a very serious effect upon <Col N="137" /> the economy of a great many families in this country who, at considerable sacrifice to themselves, are trying to equip their sons and their daughters for the medical profession.  We cannot allow the position of these schools to be jeopardised merely because of local considerations.  Galway Regional Hospital was provided at great expense to the rest of the community and it was provided with the idea, among others of course, of ensuring that the Galway Medical School would have adequate clinical facilities.  We must make certain that that objective is not lost sight of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the position of the mental hospitals and of the inadequacy of beds for mental defectives.  I have that very much in mind.  It is clear from developments which have been made in this sphere of medicine in recent years that a great deal can be done to alleviate, and perhaps to cure, the condition of many people who were formerly regarded as hopeless mental cases.  In that connection, we have been urging health authorities and mental hospital authorities to provide greater facilities, more clinics to afford preventive and early curative treatment in cases of mental disorder.  The importance of these clinics for early treatment is very well recognised and I am glad to say that I think considerable progress has been made in developing the out-patient service for mental cases.</P>
    <P>In 1944-45, 75 clinics were in operation in various centres such as county hospitals and county clinics and the attendances totalled 4,800.  In addition, my predecessor recommended in 1956 the establishment of a psychiatric consultant service so as to ensure that elderly patients would not be required to enter mental hospitals, unless it was established that they required institutional care.</P>
    <P>We have had the same approach to the question of accommodation for mental defectives.  All of us in the Department&mdash;I mean the officials of my Department as well as myself&mdash;are very conscious of our deficiencies in that regard.  Much progress has been made in that direction in recent years, although it cannot be said that the <Col N="138" /> position is satisfactory.  In 1949, at the start of the post-war building programme, 1,317 beds have been provided this type of case.  As part of that programme, 1.317 beds have been provided and accommodation for a further 240 beds is in course of construction.  Our bed provision, therefore, under this head, has been more than doubled since 1948.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne paid a very well deserved tribute to the work of the Brothers of St. John of God and nothing that I am about to say should be taken as detracting in any way from that tribute, but I think also we should mention that excellent work is being done elsewhere for mental defectives by other Orders, such as the Brothers of Charity at Lota, Cork, and at Kilcornan, Galway; by the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul at Cabra, by the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary at Dalgan, County Westmeath, and at Moore Abbey, and by 'La Sagerse at Sligo.  All this is of comparatively recent development, so that I think the House may rest assured that everything we can do within our resources&mdash;not everything we should like to do&mdash;is being done to try to cope with this very distressing problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne also referred to the position of resident medical superintendents in mental hospitals and asked why should we not bring in a lay administrator and leave the resident medical superintendent to do medical work.  One would say, in theory, that this procedure has very much to recommend it.  I think, many years ago, we did try to introduce lay administrators into certain larger hospitals, but they were not always received with open arms.  Some degree of prejudice and resentment on the part of medical and nursing staffs at the prospect of a layman interfering with them made the experiment rather difficult.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, naturally two different schools of thought as to the best form of hospital administration, both in relation to mental hospitals and hospitals generally.  It is true that there is a very heavy burden upon the medical superintendents of these <Col N="139" /> institutions, but a great deal has been done, I think, in varous ways in recent years to lessen the burden upon them. Without making any very drastic change, for instance, the appointment of land stewards has gone far to relieve medical superintendents of duties in relation to the farms.  More recently, the duties of chief clerk have been expanded with the effect, I think of relieving medical superintendents of a great deal of clerical administrative work.</P>
    <P>There may be other things which could be done, but in any event I think that Deputy Dr. Browne may rest assured that we are very conscious of the position of resident medical superintendents of these large institutions. The changes which have taken place in the general approach to the question of institutional management have, I think, made it much easier and will make it easier as time goes on, to remedy many of the present difficulties in what was the old system.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say that we are all greatly aware of the fact that many of the mental hospitals are very much overcrowded and one of the things we hope to be able to do is, by the adaptation of some of the buildings which may become vacant, to convert them into homes for aged and infirm which will, perhaps, enable us to withdraw many patients from the mental hospitals with benefit to the hospitals and the patients who will be removed to more suitable surroundings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry referred to sub-head I, and said that the £7,000 for county homes would not go very far.  I agree with him that £7,000 would not go very far, but if he reads the sub-head carefully, he will see that the provision is in respect of recouping over 50 per cent. of the loan charges on moneys already borrowed for county homes.  It has no relevance in connection with future borrowings.  If the money was in the Local Loans Fund and if Deputy Corry's board of assistance wished to borrow it and if he could get sanction for borrowing it for the purpose of improving county homes, then no doubt the £7,000 would be considerably greater next year; but it is only in <Col N="140" /> relation to past borrowings that the money is provided and it is not any indication of what the situation is likely to be in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera&mdash;I did not have the advantage of hearing his speech&mdash; suggested there were many complaints about the working of the health services. I should be very agreeably surprised if there were not, in the course of a debate on an Estimate which ranges so widely as this, some complaints about the administration of some of the services and particularly of the services which were introduced under the Health Act of 1953.  After all, some of them have only been a very, very short time, comparatively speaking, in operation, and it is only when one actually tries the machine out that one discovers whether or not it can be improved.  But, taking it by and large, I think there cannot be any foundation for the suggestion that the general public are worse off in relation to the health services under the 1953 Act than they were before its introduction.  Every fact that one examines in relation to the position prior to the 1953 Act and in relation to the present position indicates the contrary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tierney referred to the position of tuberculosis patients in County Tipperary.  He said that when a patient leaves the sanatorium he is granted an allowance of only 30/- per week.  That, of course, is the infectious diseases maintenance allowance and the rate of that allowance depends on the circumstances of the individual.  The allowance can, in certain circumstances, be substantially more than 30/- per week.  I might mention that the cost of these allowances last year amounted to, roughly, £600,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to accommodation and overcrowding in Grangegorman, that situation has been relieved somewhat by the provision of new units for about 250 patients in Portrane.  We are also trying to persuade the Dublin Board of Assistance to take over Crooksling for senile patients from Grangegorman. That should make accommodation in Grangegorman for about a further 250 mental patients proper.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Dr. <Col N="141" /> Browne referred to a choice of doctor. Deputy O'Higgins suggested that he would like, particularly in the Cities of Dublin and Cork and the larger centres of population generally, to give Section 14 patients a free choice of doctor. That would be very desirable but it would cost a great deal of money so far as we have been able to ascertain or estimate as to what the actual cost might be.  Until our financial position becomes more secure and the Minister for Finance and the public generally are able to afford more money for health services, we shall have to defer doing anything to give effect to the suggestion which Deputy T.F. O'Higgins and Deputy Dr. Browne put forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. He appeared to be under some misapprehension as to what is the actual position in regard to that board.  First of all, the board was set up by statute. It was set up under an Act passed by this House for the purpose of having a specific job done.  That Act was passed quite recently.  The board has been constituted.  A technical task has been imposed upon it and, so far as I am concerned, I would not propose to interfere with the experiment which is being tried.  It may prove to be a very valuable one.  I should like to say that such moneys as have been placed at the disposal of the board have been advanced to it by way of loan and in due course, if the members are able to produce a workable and practicable scheme, I assume that loan will be repaid and nobody will be any worse off for the fact that this experiment is being tried.</P>
    <P>With regard to difficult children, there is, as Deputy Dr. Browne mentioned, an officially sponsored child guidance clinic in Dublin, run again by the Brothers of St. John of God.  It is a new service and I should like it to be fully tested before I could permit myself to a decision that we should go further.  I have little doubt in my own mind that the results will be satisfactory but it is better to await the actual outcome of the experiment which is being tried.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by <Col N="142" /> Deputy Carty as to the supply of surgical and medical appliances, I do not understand how the position to which he referred wherein long delays have taken place could have arisen.  There does not seem to be any valid reason why a person should have to wait for such prolonged periods and there is no information in my Department as to why that position exists in Galway.  If Deputy Carty would be good enough to give me details of the cases to which he has referred, I shall have them investigated.</P>
    <P>On the issue of medical cards to old age pensioners, the position is that my predecessor recommended that all old persons in receipt of full pensions should be given medical service cards, but that recommendation is not binding on county managers.  Some have accepted it and some have rejected it. It is entirely a matter within the responsibility and discretion of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Another point which Deputy Carty raised was the right of the county manager to direct patients to a particular hospital.  The county manager acts in this matter for the local authority and it is incumbent on him to make the best use possible of such hospital accommodation as may be available to him.  The Act provides that patients will be sent to recognised hospitals, that is, hospitals with which there is an arrangement for keeping such patients.  I understand there are two such hospitals in County Galway and the manager must make the best and most economic use of the accommodation in both of these institutions. He is bound to do that and, if he does not do that, he may find himself in serious trouble with the Local Government auditor.  Therefore, as I say, it is his responsibility and it is he who has the duty of ensuring that the beds which are available to him will be utilised in the most advantageous way possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the attendance of the county manager at meetings of the consultative health council, to which Deputy Carty referred, there is no statutory obligation on the manager to attend any meeting of the consultative health council.  He can get the advice <Col N="143" /> through the record of the proceedings at the council meeting, as, indeed, the Minister himself does in relation to the National Health Council.  There is something, I think, to be said for the Minister and the manager not being present on these occasions.  There can be freer discussion.  Charges and counter-charges, unpleasant controversies cannot arise if the person who has the ultimate responsibility for accepting or rejecting recommendations does not happen to be present.  All I have to say is that the question of attendance or non-attendance is entirely one for the county manager.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carty mentioned that a doctor had suggested that the drugs which are supplied through the combined purchasing section are not up to standard.  If there is any complaint in this regard, I should be glad if the matter were reported to the Department, which will take action.</P>
    <P>On the question of the local consultative health council&mdash;Deputy Carty also raised a point in that connection&mdash; the position there is that there must be at least four members of county councils on the local consultative health councils.  Then the county medical officer of health must be a member. The county surgeon or a senior medical officer of a health institution must be a member also, and two other practitioners nominated by a body representative of the doctors of the county. This gives a total of eight members altogether and the other two members may be nurses, chemists or anyone else.</P>
    <P>In fact, it is believed in the Department that in many cases the members of the council are appointing their own members to the other two vacancies. If it is desired to give representation to nurses or other members of the ancillary hospital services, it is a matter for the county councils to arrange this among themselves.  It is obligatory upon them to appoint eight members drawn from certain sources, but they have discretion in relation to the two remaining members of the council.  Accordingly, it is a matter for those who have the power of <Col N="144" /> nomination to come together and decide whether they will give representation on the councils to nurses or chemists or other members of the hospital staff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne raised the question of hospital attendants.  The position there is that we are looking into that matter but we must look into it from the point of view which I stressed in my opening speech, that is, that we cannot afford to increase in any substantial way the existing costs of hospital services and, until the financial position rectifies itself, I shall be very reluctant to concede anything to hospital staffs as a body which would significantly increase the cost of the services. What would be done in the case of one institution would have to be done in the case of all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carty, who made, from my point of view, a very useful speech because he directed my attention to many details which normally might not come before me, suggested that the school medical examination should be conducted by the local dispensary doctor.  That has something to recommend it, undoubtedly, but there is just the difficulty that in many dispensary districts there is more than one doctor. Not all the school children would go normally as patients to the dispensary doctor.  Thus under Deputy Carty's suggestion we might have a practitioner in a particular area inspecting in school the children of families who would be patients of other doctors.</P>
    <P>Taking it all in all, even though it does mean a longer interval between inspections, I think it may be better on the whole that an outsider should come in and inspect all the children, without any bias in favour of those who might be his own patients as against those who might be his rival's patients&mdash;shall we put it this way?&mdash; examining with a more lenient eye when he is looking upon his own patient and a more searching eye when he is looking on the patients of his rival practitioners.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carty also raised the question of school dental service.  Let me say again, quite frankly, there are many imperfections in our health <Col N="145" /> services.  They are imperfections which we are gradually remedying but the progress has to be gradual.  If I were to give effect to the various suggestions that have been made here for improving these services, the Minister for Finance would have to find roughly a couple of million pounds extra in next year's Budget and I do not think any of us is prepared to face up to that.  That is the position.  We have to carry on all the services of the State as a whole.  We have a limited amount of money at our disposal and it has to be spread over many Departments.  It cannot all come into the Department of Health, no matter how desirable the activities of that Department may appear to be to us all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manley made a very useful speech.  He suggested that we should try to do a little bit more to induce people to take care of their teeth.  It was not the only suggestion he made. He made a great many others but he will forgive me if I do not deal with them all because I have, perhaps, touched in a general way on the topics which he raised.</P>
    <P>On the question of the preservation of teeth, the Department did produce a film some years ago on the care of teeth and school dentists are instructed to advise children on the care of their teeth.  There is a committee to advise on the fluorinisation of water supplies in the interests of the preservation of teeth, particularly children's teeth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond suggested that there should be a speeding up of the building of new dispensaries.  This is a matter rather for the local authorities themselves.  Once the purchase of a site has been approved, I understand, no further approach to the Department is necessary.  A special system of grants, designed to encourage local authorities to build dispensaries, was in operation for a number of years.  At least 220 new dispensaries have been built and about 20 more are under construction.</P>
    <P>The question of the nurses' home at St. Finbarr's is under consideration. Regarding the regional hospital, I think the best thing for me to do is to get all the Cork Deputies together in <Col N="146" /> one room in my absence and let them settle the question.</P>

      <P>I think I have dealt with everything except Deputy Corry's reference to the Defence Vote.  It may be that we misunderstand the Estimate, but it is a useful thing to have drawn my attention to it and I will look into it.  With reference to the other matter which the Deputy raised in connection with the general Mental Hospitals Act, about a patient being presented with a bill for 25 guineas for surgical attendance, I have written to the Deputy on that matter and I have explained the circumstances. The patient was a Section 25 patient who was sent to a private nursing home, had a private room there and was charged accordingly.  If the Deputy will look up his correspondence&mdash;he may not have reached it yet&mdash;he will find there is a letter from me to that effect.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to Dundrum Asylum, which I think is the only hospital owned by the Minister for Health, can become, and I think it is, rather anomalous.  Speaking entirely from recollection, I think there are more nurses and persons in charge in Dundrum than there are, in fact, patients and inmates in the hospital.  I know some consideration was given to the question whether the continuation of Dundrum as a criminal lunatic asylum was justified.  I do not know whether the Minister has given any thought to that matter.  Certainly, if the number of inmates continues to decrease, while the number of nurses required in accordance with the nursing conditions continues to increase, then it is a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> which should not be tolerated.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,042,950 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1958, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>Deputies will observe that the Estimate as originally printed in the Book of Estimates has been revised and that the net total, or the sum required for the service of the year, has been reduced from the original figure of £8,387,950 to £6,837,950&mdash;a decrease of £1,550,000.  The revision follows upon the decisions announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement of the 8th May last to withdraw the dairy produce subsidies as from the 9th May, 1957, resulting in a decrease under this sub-head of £1,900,000 and to provide a sum of £250,000 for the general purpose of improving the marketing of agricultural produce.  In addition a further sum of £100,000 is being provided to enable compensation at the full market value to be paid for all cows slaughtered under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order, 1926, in those counties which are not scheduled for intensive treatment under the existing scheme in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>I have assumed office only very recently and I do not think that, at this stage, it is necessary or desirable to indicate in any detail my policy in regard to the multiple activities of my Department.  It is my view that, in spite of ministerial changes, there ought to be a certain coherence and continuity of agricultural policy.  If I see the necessity for making policy changes, I shall act with caution and circumspection, giving full consideration to the results and consequences of any proposed change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the White Paper which has been <Col N="149" /> issued to Deputies and entitled &ldquo;Notes on Some Activities of the Department&rdquo;, a factual account will be found of the various schemes and activities of the Department of Agriculture and of recent trends in production and export.  The White Paper, I think, gives all the figures that will be required by Deputies and I do not now intend to go into statistical detail. What I propose to do is to mention what I believe to be the most important and urgent agricultural problems.</P>
    <P>Reading, for anybody concerned with agriculture, is nowadays a dismal occupation.  The difficulties of other countries, as portrayed in agricultural magazine and newspapers, are not dissimilar to our own and tend to intensify our problem.  But we have laid one agricultural bogy, the doubt about our capacity to produce.  Better methods of husbandry, a more generous use of fertiliser, reasonable mechanisation have substantially increased our production and given guarantee of future increase.</P>
    <P>We have for the moment in some commodities an embarrassment of riches, a new problem, a challenge to our capacity.  Our most serious difficulty now is that any surplus, which we are agreed is necessary, has to face unsatisfactory conditions, particularly in regard to price, in the export market. But facing that difficulty, I am convinced that it is of national advantage that the quantity of milk delivered to creameries in 1956 was the greatest since creameries were established. All indications are that 1957 will bring us new records.  Continuing increase is necessary if we are to be placed in a position to meet our competitors on level terms and to place our dairy industry in a secure position.</P>
    <P>An aim of ours must be to substitute feeding barley for imported maize. This must be produced at a cost that enables pig production to be an economic venture.  This year's crop will eliminate the need for imports or at least bring them to that minimum required for special rations.</P>
    <P>This year's wheat crop promises to be a record also and the problem of the 100 per cent. Irish loaf looms nearer.  Here again, we must move <Col N="150" /> with caution, sifting objection and ascertaining fully all the facts before coming to a final decision.  There is no easy solution of our problem but we must face one ineluctable fact, increased production is valueless if it is not accompanied by a reduction of cost per unit of output.  I believe that we are swiftly arriving at the position where this may be achieved.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that a sum of £250,000 has been set aside by the Government for the purpose of improving our marketing methods.  I have had a number of proposals for the expenditure of this money, proposals which my officials are now examining. I am hopeful of the development of ideas which will be of value to this country economically.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of our problem is the effect of Britain's policy on our agricultural production and exports; this is a matter which is of concern also to such countries as New Zealand, the Netherlands and Denmark.  The extremely high prices guaranteed to farmers in Britain for eggs, pigs and milk have stimulated production of these to a level well in excess of prewar figures, which in turn has led to a weakening of prices on the free market, so that almost all countries which export have been finding it necessary in one way or other to subsidise their exports.  In our case the most serious results have been felt in the case of the egg industry whose exports are now only about 7 per cent. of what they were in 1938, and we have also been rather seriously affected in the case of milk products and bacon.</P>
    <P>In fairness, I should say immediately that in the case of store cattle and store sheep and lambs we have a valuable link with the price guarantee paid to British farmers on British bred stock.  This has provided a very important support for our most important export trade though it has had repercussions on the fatstock and particularly the carcase meat export trade.  In general, it would be my hope that arrangements could be made between the two countries which would enable us to expand our exports of eggs, milk products and pig meat to the British market as was intended <Col N="151" /> under the various trade agreements between the two countries and in particular the provisions of those agreements in regard to free entry and preferential treatment.  If we are to continue to be one of Britain's most important European customers, it seems to me to be essential to place our exports to Britain on a more long-term and secure basis than is the case at present.</P>
    <P>Our trade with some countries results in heavy imports and minimum exports.  I am not at all satisfied with this state of affairs.  Mutual trade should bring mutual benefit, otherwise it cannot continue.</P>
    <P>A matter of really vital importance is the eradication of Bovine Tuberculosis. As Deputies know, the future of our export trade in cattle is bound up with this.  We started only towards the end of 1954 whereas the first measures in Britain were introduced in 1935.  We of course had much more formidable financial and personnel questions to face than the British had, but an all out effort is necessary during the next five years.  Good progress has already been made in the intensive areas of County Sligo and County Clare and it is intended that the whole of the Western Counties from Donegal to Kerry, together with Leitrim and Monaghan will be included in the intensive areas within the next year.  In addition, special measures are now being introduced in the non-intensive areas with a view to expediting the removal of open or clinical cases.</P>
    <P>It is believed that these measures will in themselves have an appreciable influence in reducing the incidence of tuberculosis in those areas and that complete eradication will therefore be easier when these areas become intensive, as they all will in due course. Local authorities are accordingly being authorised to pay, for such cases removed under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order, the full market value instead of a fraction as at present and the cost will be recouped in full by my Department. I have introduced a Bill dealing with tuberculosis eradication and I am actively studying the means whereby <Col N="152" /> it is hoped we could speed up the work. Here I would like to say that the co-operation of farmers, veterinary practitioners, transport and shipping companies and all other interests concerned is essential and I am sure that I can count on their active help.</P>
    <P>A new factor of importance for our future emerges in the proposals for the European Free Market.  We must of course do everything in our power to develop our existing continental markets in a satisfactory manner and we are therefore closely following the discussions that are now taking place on the arrangements for the Free Trade Area.  But let us not be so optimistic about the matter as to forget that entry for us into the Free Trade Area, if established, will mean entry on a competitive basis <i>vis-a-vis</i> agriculturists who have survived the rigours of strenuous competition.</P>
    <P>An improvement in our trade relations with Britain will not be less important for us because of any development of our European trade.</P>
    <P>I have left to the end a word on education in agriculture to emphasise its importance; future progress in agriculture is entirely dependent on it.</P>
    <P>I understand that there has been a considerable increase in the number of agricultural instructors and I am sure that all county committees of agriculture are alive to the fact that many more are required.</P>
    <P>Higher education and research are the background of the advisory services. These stand in need of reorganisation and development.  We have been sufficiently fortunate as to receive, from the Government of the United States, a grant for the creation of an agricultural institute.  Certain discussions have taken place and a Bill has been introduced in this House to give effect to decisions made.  I shall not comment on the matter except to say that the success of such an institute must be judged by both the immediate and long-term development it promotes. We must expect it to provide a marked increase in agricultural output, effective economic direction and close contact for the farmer with the latest developments in agricultural science.</P>
    <P>I have so recently publicised our <Col N="153" /> problem in relation to swine fever that I am sure all Deputies are familiar with the danger of allowing it to continue as it is.  We have introduced, specially, rather harsh measures and I am hopeful that these will be successful, but, if they are to be successful, we shall need the co-operation of all people closely, or at a distance, associated with the pig industry.</P>
    <P>In the past dozen years, there has been a vast change in the agricultural outlook.  There is no doubt that the years of educational travail have borne fruit.  I am therefore optimistic about the future of Irish farming.  Having an almost chauvinistic belief in my own people I look to the future with confidence and hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin the observations I have to make, which I trust will be modelled on the succinct example of the Minister, by offering him my sincere best wishes for his success in what I consider to be the most important Ministry in the Government. There are certain things I want to comment on and I trust I will be excused if I begin by recording some measure of satisfaction that in this year we can rejoice over the greatest production ever in the history of the agricultural industry in Ireland, in milk, wheat, barley, cattle and sheep. I am a great believer in the proposition that the best test of policy is results.  Those are the results of a policy we have been following recently in this country and I think they are results of which we may be justly proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we remember that in the past ten years the gross agricultural output of the agricultural industry of this country has increased by between 30 and 32 per cent., and that, in the first quarter of this year, the months of January, February and March, we exported more cattle from Ireland than at any corresponding period in our recorded history, I think we would be well advised to share the Minister's expression of confidence in the future, without in any sense underestimating the formidable difficulties that confront the industry and that must confront the Minister now responsible for it. I want to pay the Minister this tribute, <Col N="154" /> that I welcome from his lips the last paragraph of his statement here today. I am sick listening to all the dismal jennies that infest this country, who spend their time wringing their hands and groaning about the sufferings of our people, and of some of the so-called economic advisers who would not be fit to advise a chandler's shop, never mind the agricultural industry of this country.</P>
    <P>It should be a matter for rejoicing that if we have to have&mdash;and it is a sore trial&mdash;a Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, at least we have one who has some faith in the agricultural community and the agricultural industry itself.  I fully appreciate that it would be unreasonable to press the Minister to go into any great detail, on this occasion of the introduction of the first Estimate for which he is responsible, but I think he might, in concluding this debate, give us some more information as to the proposals that are submitted to him for the expenditure of £250,000 on market research.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of research and there is no proposal too radical to command my support, if it is designed to produce results, but there are some pseudo-experts floating around this country and they would most cheerfully think up some daft, crazy notion which represents the consequences of their burning of midnight oil, studying textbooks, plus a smattering of a few cheap trips to Denmark, Holland, Sweden and Peru, and foist on us some daft notions and in the process wipe out valuable existing marketing procedures that have stood the test of time.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise that there is no institution so venerable in this country that we should not be prepared to terminate it, if its usefulness has ceased, but it was Gilbert Keith Chesterton who first reminded people that they should be very slow to abolish even an ancient usage, the meaning of which we had ceased to understand until we found out what originally gave rise to it, because that ancient usage may have been formulated prior to the memory of man to abate some serious evil.  It may have done its work so well that the evil it was originally designed to remedy has <Col N="155" /> gone completely from the mind of man, but, suspend that usage, and the evil may manifest itself again and we have no guarantee that our generation may be as wise as those who went before, and we may not evolve a remedy as wise as that which worked so well that we forgot the problem.</P>
    <P>There may be marketing methods in this country that appear cumbersome to some of the experts and that some of the experts would like to streamline. I would like to see their streamlined methods functioning side by side with the old methods, before discarding the old to depend exclusively on the new. Certainly it is true in business that those who best know how to trade are those who make their living in it.  I have been a shopkeeper a long time in my life, and if I listened to all the advice that was tendered to me on how I was to run my shop, I would be resident in the Union in James's Street.  That does not mean that everything we are doing is perfect. Far from it; there is plenty of room for improvement, but I rejoice to hear the Minister say that every step he takes will be taken with due deliberation and that he refuses to permit himself to be dazzled by every daft suggestion which pours in through the door of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>As I said in this House once before, the Department of Agriculture has one unique feature.  Every dafty in Ireland finds his way in through the doorway of the Department of Agriculture and the industry of agriculture has one strange facet, that is, that every solicitor, every barrister, every professional man, every unemployed man, artisan or unskilled labourer thinks he can run every man's farm better than the farmer himself and at the same time none of them will welcome the arrival of a farmer to tell him how to run his business.  Most Ministers for Agriculture spend much more of their time than they ought to be asked to spend handing off cranks, male and female.  I can assure the Minister that, certainly from my side, he will receive all the support he wants in running the cranks out of the Department of Agriculture when they come in to infest it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="156" /> I fully sympathise with the Minister in the difficulties that confront him in connection with the arrest of the present epidemic of swine fever.  It is certain that many of the Draconian steps he may deem it his duty to take will be unpopular.  I want to assure him that so long as he proceeds with the circumspection and care that his reference to this matter suggests it is his intention to employ, he will receive the fullest support from this side of the House for such measures as it may be requisite to take to terminate this plague.  I have noted he is not unconscious of the hardship that some of these measures may involve for people in the country and that his desire is to suspend them as soon as circumstances permit.  With that assurance, I offer him the counter assurance that he may look to us for full support for whatever measures are requisite to control this matter.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the Minister that it is right and reasonable that we should direct the attention of the British Government to the fact that if we are to continue to be one of Britain's most important European markets, it is essential to place our exports to Britain on a more long-term and secure basis than is the case at present. I want to say quite deliberately to him that when the 1948 Trade Agreement was negotiated, I am satisfied there was a clear collateral understanding that, over and above the written word of the agreement, our mutual purpose was to expand Irish agricultural exports to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly true that the domestic policy of Great Britain, by the employment of heroic subsidies on domestic production, has operated to saturate the British market, for instance, in eggs up to the point where she is actually exporting eggs herself now.  While it is no violation of the letter of the agreement, it seems a clear departure, to my mind, from the spirit of the agreement which envisaged there being a market for Irish eggs in Great Britain which has disappeared as a result of a domestic policy which has evoked, on a wholly uneconomic basis, a supply of eggs in Great Britain in excess of her home <Col N="157" /> capacity to consume.  It is neither our right, nor I feel sure our desire, to comment on or criticise or attempt to dictate domestic policy in Britain. However, we have an agreement in which both sides enjoy an advantage.</P>
    <P>We have a mutual trade in which Great Britain enjoys very great advantages. We are entitled, I think, to emphasise what the Minister said here, that if we are to continue to be one of Britains most important European customers, it is essential to place our exports to Britain on a more long-term and secure basis than is the case at present.  I entirely agree with the Minister when he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our trade with some countries results in heavy imports and minimum exports.  I am not at all satisfied with this state of affairs. Mutual trade should bring mutual benefit, otherwise it cannot continue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that connection, while fully sympathising with the difficulties of France, I think I am entitled to say that when the question arose of restricting her exports of cheese to this country&mdash; which was a matter to which she attached some importance although the monetary value may not have been very great&mdash;the Government of this country, with some considerable difficulty, preserved France's right to continue those exports to this country and continued to do so even in the light of formidable exchange problems with which we had to contend at the end of last year and at the beginning of this year.  I am at a loss to understand how that attitude on our part is appropriately reciprocated by the recent French decision to exclude our lamb exports from France altogether.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that France can continue to claim the right to impose restrictions of that character without any prior consultation with us unless she is prepared to face the fact that there is a pretty wide range of exports in the sphere of wines and spirits, agricultural produce and horticultural produce to which Ireland must have regard if the principles referred to in that paragraph of the Minister's speech which speaks of mutual trade bringing mutual benefit are to be lived up to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> I have noted what the Minister says about the bovine tuberculosis position. I am fully aware of the difficulties there.  I think the Minister would have done himself a service if he had perhaps been a little more frank with the House in that regard.  There is not a doubt that in the country there are a good many people who are inclined to say: &ldquo;What is all the delay about? Why do they not travel faster?&rdquo;  So far as I am aware, the principal limiting factor is the availability of veterinary staff.  Is that not so?  I think it is.</P>
    <P>I understand the Department of Agriculture is at present busy about the task of substituting, in so far as is permissible, lay inspectors for certain work in the meat and bacon factories so as to release veterinary personnel for this essential work of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  The Minister would be well advised to tell us more, though it may be that, inasmuch as it is his intention to introduce the Bovine Tuberculosis (Eradication) Bill to-morrow, possibly he prefers to reserve for that occasion a more detailed statement on this problem.  If that is his purpose, I am quite prepared to wait for that occasion, too.</P>
    <P>I direct the Minister's attention to the fact that recently there appeared in the <i>Farmers' Weekly</i> in Great Britain what appeared to me to be an extremely mischievous article upon which I felt it my duty to comment. Fortunately, it was not difficult to dispose of the nonsense that was written in that article.  Anyone who understood the situation would know that the article was written for domestic consumption in Great Britain and that the writer was shaking his gory locks at Mr. Heathcoat Amory to warn him not to reduce the £450,000,000 in subsidy given to British farmers or this dreadful picture he drew of Ireland would manifest itself in Britain.  I have considerable sympathy with somebody who wanted to shake his own gory locks at his own Minister for Agriculture and particularly at his own Minister for Finance in Britain but I did not think it fortunate he should have chosen Ireland as the horrible example which he wanted to hold out to Mr. Heathcoat Amory in order to chasten him for any bad thoughts he <Col N="159" /> might have about the subsidies in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The burden of the article was that there was no progress being made in Ireland with the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  That is wrong.  That is untrue but I think we have got to do more than we have been doing. If we have got the staff the country is prepared to accept a more radical approach than that which we have been pursuing heretofore.  I think, since we have got the staff, we ought to deal with the counties mentioned in the Minister's statement on the same basis as we propose to deal with Sligo and Clare.  We ought to go all out now to eradicate every reactor in these counties.</P>
    <P>I frankly wonder what we are going to do when we tackle Limerick, east Tipperary and north Cork.  I think that is something the Minister will have to consider and try to make up his mind about at an early date.  The incidence of reactors amongst cows in that area is running between 40 per cent. or 50 per cent.  It has to be faced but I think the Minister would want time to formulate the plan for that.  I think he ought to be somewhat more explicit if his intention is to deal with this matter in greater detail when introducing the Bill about bovine tuberculosis. Could the Minister say whether it is to-morrow that the Bovine Tuberculosis Bill will be introduced.</P>

I want to assure him in that case that he is guaranteed the support of this House for such measures as he deems it expedient to take and he need have no fears that any complaints which may arise will be inflated from this side of the House or that factious criticism will be directed against him in connection with this urgent work.</P>

      <P>I note the Minister's reference to the Agricultural Institute Bill.  I should be glad to know whether the Minister considered this matter.  What does he intend to do about it?  I said earlier that there is no approach to any problem relative to agriculture in this country too radical if it should prove to be the right one.  I hope that in regard to <Col N="161" /> this matter the Minister will not hesitate to be radical if he believes it to be his duty and I hope he would bear in mind most emphatically my declaration of loyalty to the radical principle if justice can best be served thereby.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister for Agriculture, when in regard to the Department of Agriculture he says it is desirable that, in spite of ministerial changes, there ought to be certain coherence and continuity of policy.  I tried to put that principle in practice and I am glad that the Minister for Agriculture expresses the same intention.</P>
      <P>I remember on the occasion of introducing my first Estimate for Agriculture my predecessor in that responsible office conceived it to be his duty to speak for six hours on the Estimate. What purpose he hoped to serve by doing that God only knows.  Deputies are in possession of an informative White Paper which will give them a very fair review of the activities of the Department of Agriculture.  If they want any confirmation they can go down and look at the photographs outside the Library in Leinster House and they will see there further evidence of the useful work the Department has done and is doing.  If that fails to convince them, they can repair to the countryside and look on close on 1,000,000 acres of land which a few years ago was producing little or nothing and which to-day is almost all producing abundant crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I think it is time for the Minister to lay one ghost. Deputy Allen from time to time intervenes in our debates and rejoices in saying that money was wasted in the land rehabilitation project, that on some land £500 an acre was spent.  I do not believe that is true, but I know there was one farm in Wexford on which the Department of Agriculture entered during the administration of my predecessor, the late lamented Deputy Walsh.  I know that on that farm unexpected circumstances arose which involved the Department in expenditure which they would never have undertaken had they foreseen the nature of the problem that lay before <Col N="162" /> them.  Had I been Minister for Agriculture at the time, exactly the same mistake would have occurred, because it was the kind of error that no vigilance on the part of the Minister or on the part of the supervisory officers of the Department could have avoided.</P>
    <P>But I have always made this boast: never, while I was Minister for Agriculture did I make the claim that we would make no mistakes.  We made many.  But I did claim&mdash;and I challenge anyone to disprove this&mdash;we never made the same mistake twice. That is the measure of my boasting and remember this, and mark it well: if each great project in this country is to be rendered absolutely watertight against all possibility of mistake before it is launched, nothing will ever be launched in this country.  You could sit down forever in contemplation of some formidable enterprise and listen to the possibilities of error that could arise and never get anywhere.</P>
    <P>I was never afraid of making a mistake once.  I would have been ashamed to make it twice.  I was always prepared to avow that anyone in this country could put his finger in my eye once.  If he did it twice, he was a better man than I was, Gunga Din.  A lot of people make the fatal error of trying it on.  I rejoice to think that none of them ever came back a third time.</P>
    <P>There is no use concealing the fact that I am very proud of the Department of Agriculture in this country.  I once drove the know-alls in this country, the boys who never earned an honest day's pay in their lives, almost daft, by saying that I thought our Department of Agriculture was the best in the world.  Every agricultural expert in Ireland who never grew a dandelion in his life nearly burst a blood vessel.  I have seen more of the world than any of them.</P>
    <P>I have seen the work the Department does, has done and is doing and I want to say quite deliberately again that, while the Irish Department of Agriculture is not proof against mistakes&mdash; and I have never claimed it was&mdash;the experts notwithstanding, I consider it to be one of the best Departments of Agriculture in the <Col N="163" /> world.  I want to rejoice again in the recollection I have during last year and many years before in representing this country at international conferences that the very officials of my Department, as at the time it was, who in their own country were derided by some of the numskulls they had to listen to with patience as incompetent, were sought eagerly by every international organisation that I attended.</P>
    <P>They were sought to co-operate in the work of O.E.E.C., F.A.O. and many other international organisations of that kind.  My embarrassment was that, as Minister, I had frequently to inform international agencies that I could not give them the services of some of the men they wanted from our Department of Agriculture because we had not got the staff to permit of their release from the work they were doing for their own country.</P>
    <P>I do think it is time&mdash;and I do not doubt that the present Minister substantially agrees with me&mdash;that we should get out of the habit of belittling our own.  It is a great mistake to overestimate our own importance, our own competence, our own efficiency, but at least we should not cry down that which is Irish and that which is esteemed all the world over.  Self-criticism is a very useful thing, but it can be carried too far; it can be carried to the point when it can undermine the devotion and the enthusiasm of the best of men.</P>
    <P>We have something of incalculable value in this country.  That is a devoted and competent body of public servants who have a great tradition of service. Whatever Government may be in office, their sole concern has been to find out the Minister's policy and faithfully to carry it out to the best of their ability.  They are not always right or perfect, but I think they are about as good as any country can boast about.  We have every right to be proud of them and it does no harm occasionally to say so.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on this Estimate this year.  It may be that it will appear that I have erred on the side of refraining from criticism.  There is a very simple explanation for that. <Col N="164" /> I prepared this Estimate and the Minister has been very circumspect in his speech introducing it; he gave me very few pegs on which to hang my hat.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt he will be in office for 12 months.  That is one of these sad facts which, being a realist in politics, I reconcile myself to.  When I see his first year of administration, we may find ourselves differing more emphatically than we may appear to do now.  Politically, that may be a blessing to the Minister; but, in the meantime, I simply want to reiterate at the end what I said in the beginning: I wish him the best of luck.  I hope he will be a most successful Minister for Agriculture.  If I had to pass over the Department to any member of his Party&mdash;which I did with great reluctance&mdash;I have the least anxiety in passing it to him.</P>

      <P>I, too, consider that the Department of Agriculture is a great Department.  I think any Department of State that survived two trips under Deputy Dillon's control is a great Department.  I often heard farmers in my constituency say that they, first of all, survived the Minister and then survived the Department.</P>

      <P>In considering this Estimate which has been prepared by the previous Minister, I am personally anxious that the mistakes made, not once but several times, by the previous Minister, in his policy would not be repeated.  In page 2 of this document, giving details of the Department's activities, we are informed that although the acreage of wheat dropped &mdash;as it always dropped under Deputy Dillon's leadership&mdash;we got 344,616 tons of wheat.  On that 344,000 tons the Irish farmer had to pay £1,500,000 tax.  That was a tax imposed by the Minister for Agriculture on the Irish farmer who dared to grow wheat.  In the first year it was 12/6 a barrel; it was roughly 10/- a barrel last year, and <Col N="165" /> 10/- a barrel on the 344,000 tons of Irish wheat.</P>
      <P>Does anybody here consider that, with the rise in costs on the agricultural community which has taken place each year the Irish tillage farmer could afford to pay that amount of tax because he dared to grow wheat?  I do not think so.  Neither is there a Deputy present who would dare stand up and say that costs have been reduced and that costs of production have not gone up.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon alluded to the increased acreage of wheat and barley this year.  There was an increase.  I saw farmers blessing themselves and thanking God that now that there was going to be a change of Government they could till again with an easy heart.  That is the sole reason why you have an increased acreage in wheat and barley this year.  I am asking the Minister not to take advantage of the confidence that has been reposed in this Government.  Those farmers ploughed and tilled their land, and put in an extra quantity of wheat in the belief that the tax would be removed. I know the financial mess in which the Government have been left.  I know the bills that have to be met, but I do not think that the confidence which those farmers reposed in the Government they were putting in should be misplaced.  The farmers are entitled to the removal of that tax.  The price of wheat for this harvest should be the price fixed by the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Tom Walsh, God rest his soul.</P>
      <P>Changes have come about.  The days are gone when a former Minister of State stood up here and said: &ldquo;I had recently the experience of eating bread made from Irish wheat.  I took it in my hand.  I kneaded it and squeezed the water out of it.  I looked at it again and wondered whether it was boot polish or bread.&rdquo;  Experiments which have been carried out recently have proved that we can produce the perfect loaf from purely Irish wheat.  I believe our present Minister had an opportunity of eating a little of that loaf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they do not send the previous Minister any of it.  It might choke him.  I am suggesting that the time has arrived when we can save the export of £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 a year to the foreigner for the staff of life, namely, wheat, which the farmer will be able to grow here in increasing quantities.</P>
      <P>The Minister informed me last week in reply to a question that further experiments were being carried out.  I hope they will expedite them and that as a result of those experiments we will be able, after the coming harvest, to prepare a programme of laying down sufficient wheat in order to supply the Irish people with bread.  I do not think we would be going beyond the bounds in that.  It will be a means of reducing our adverse trade balance and of producing something in our own country for which we can pay.  If the money remains here it will circulate; it generally finds it way back into the coffers of the State in one way or another.</P>
      <P>We are in the same position as regards feeding barley.  I note that this report says that farmers were paid 43/- per barrel for feeding barley last year.  They were not, at least not in County Cork, or that price was not paid until the farmers had it all sold. Somebody else got it, but the farmers did not.  I suggest to the Minister that he would be wise in fixing a minimum price of 43/- and let us start at that.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is the wrong time to talk about pigs, but I do not think anyone can claim that the present unfortunate situation in the pig industry is responsible for the reduction in the number of pigs in this country for the past two years.  We had a reduction of 155,000 pigs in the year 1955.  That was 20 per cent. of our previous pig population and it was followed up last year by a further reduction of 58,000 pigs Deputy Dillon sat as mute as a mouse while his brother-in-arms, Deputy Norton, proceeded to wipe out the pig industry.  In some 28 months during which the game was carried on, the Government gained, according to the reply given to me by the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently, £1,091,000.  That is the amount the Government extracted from the pig feeders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first time in five years, the price of wheat offals was increased from £20 a ton to £25 10s. There is no excuse for it.  It was home-produced offal, produced from wheat, the price of which had been artificially reduced by Deputy Dillon by £5 a ton. If the economic price of wheat offal was £20 when wheat was 82/6 a barrel, what should be the economic price of wheat offal when wheat was 70/- a barrel?  That is a fair question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sole excuse given for this increase <Col N="168" /> is given here in page 4 of this document, which I will call the agricultural budget.  It says that our net imports of offals for 1956 amounted to 26,000 tons.  In order to get an excuse for charging the farmer the difference between the economic price of £18 10s. and the £25 10s. that was charged, there were imported 26,000 tons of foreign offals.  That quantity of foreign offals, according to the figures given to me by the Minister for Industry and Commerce the other day, cost £25 10s. per ton and the millers were immediately instructed to increase the price of home offals from £18 10s., which was the economic price, to £25 10s. a ton, with the result that 25 per cent. of the sows went in one year, with a resultant loss of some £3,000,000 worth of bacon in 12 months, all in order to collar a tax of something like £700,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Speaking on this matter about a fortnight ago, I said I did not believe that any Minister for Agriculture worth his salt would allow the Minister for Industry and Commerce to get away with that, and neither do I believe it. I say that here, straight and above board.  It was deliberate robbery of the small farmers for whom I have seen Deputy Dillon weeping salty tears when I went to him for a price for feeding barley.  He told me that the small farmer in the West with a wife and ten children feeds barley to the pigs on which he depends for his livelihood, and he said: &ldquo;Am I to increase the price of his raw materials when the big farmer down in East Cork with 100 acres and two motor cars wants to benefit?&rdquo;  That same gentleman, when put into a position of authority, allowed the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tax that small farmer in the West, with the wife and the six children.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He allowed the Minister for industry and Commerce to tax <Col N="169" /> every cwt. of wheat offals which he had to buy to feed his pigs.  Let us be clear on this.  Despite swine fever and everything else, so long as that tax remains on the raw material of the small farmer, the most industrious farmer we have, so long will the pig population continue to decline.</P>
      <P>I notice on page two of these notes the following statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Following the decision of the Government that Irish superphosphate should be made available to farmers at world prices and following the suspension subsequently of the customs duty on superphosphate, provision has been made for payment to the Irish manufacturers of a subsidy representing the difference between the competitive price ex-quay at main ports of imported superphosphate and the price at which the home manufacturers can economically sell their product ex-factory.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to the statements made at the Prices Advisory Body by Messrs. Gouldings.  Messrs. Gouldings alleged that they were selling their superphosphate cheaper than superphosphate was being sold in Britain.  They went before the Prices Advisory Body looking for an economic price, and they got it.  What is the subsidy for?  If manufacturers here feel they are not getting enough for their produce, unlike the farmer who has nobody before whom he can go when his wheat offals are taxed, they can go before the Prices Advisory Body and make their case; and that body, having examined all the facts, gives an increase in price and that increase is passed on to the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the justification for a subsidy? I want to know what it is.  I hold there is no justification.  There can be no justification except that these people want to put their hands into two pockets at the one time and extract from both.  I cannot see the slightest justification for the statement I have read.  I do not know what the amount of the subsidy is, but I advise the Minister that that is some place where he will find money if he goes to <Col N="170" /> look for it.  These people are entitled to nothing&mdash;not to one brass farthing. They went before the Prices Advisory Body, put up their case and got their price.</P>

      <P>No, we are straightening things up.  When we have them all paid, we shall let you know.  Deputy Dillon spoke of the Minister's advisers. I wonder what adviser put this into page 2 here.  I hope the Minister will explain to us when he is concluding what is meant by this payment of a subsidy to the manufacturers of superphosphate. The second half of this note reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Irish superphosphate is also being made available at any given centre of the country on terms competitive with imported superphosphate. In some areas remote from the factories the subsidy payable on the ex-factory basis is not sufficient to make this possible...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would call the Minister's attention to that.  It would be very advisable for the Minister to have&mdash;I am sure it is in his Department; if not, it should be &mdash;a copy of the full statements made to the Prices Advisory Body by the two firms concerned, MacDonaghs of Galway and Gouldings.  Some extraordinary statements were made and the Minister would be well advised to examine these statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that under the Grain Storage Loans Act of 1951 the Minister for Agriculture, with the consent of the <Col N="171" /> Minister for Finance, made provision for loans up to £2,500,000 and of that amount £497,000 has already been given. Increased facilities for storage are very badly needed particularly by our co-operative societies and organisations. They are the only protection the farmer has to save him from being robbed.  The one hope the grain grower has is competition and there is no hope of competition when the only buyer is the miller.  It is only by having co-operative associations with their own storage facilities that we can hope to get anything like a fair price at harvest time.</P>
    <P>For example, take the 43/- shown in the notes.  The millers started at 40/- and when you took them a sample at 40/-, they looked at it, squeezed it, and turned it nine or ten times and nearly burned it and talked about excess moisture, before they bought it, even at 40/-.  The co-operative society in my district started in 1942 and it was not until they started that the millers budged from the 40/-.  Co-operatives are essential and the more of them we have, the better.  I hope that whatever sparing the Minister may do, he will spare no money in that direction.  If we are to increase production of grain, we require, first, somebody to buy it and, secondly, some place to store it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the position as regards malting barley is satisfactory. It is as satisfactory as it could be considering the conditions brought about by the previous Government in regard to grain during their years of office.  The price of malting barley did not fall: it continued to go up.  With hope in our hearts, we are anxiously awaiting the Minister's decision as to whether we will get a few more shillings onto the price of wheat which will enable us to extract a few shillings more from Arthur Guinness in the price of malting barley.  The two are tied together.  Previously we tied the price to the price of British malting barley and in one famous year succeeded in extracting from Arthur Guinness a bonus of close on £2,000,000 on that basis alone.  Unfortunately, owing to the change in the British method of payment, we had to depart <Col N="172" /> from that and the only other anchor we could find was the price of wheat. James reduced the price&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>For fear that somebody would not know who had done it, I am glad to inform the House that it was Deputy James Dillon.  Deputy Dillon, having reduced the price of wheat as low as it could possibly go, we said: &ldquo;We cannot be worse off,&rdquo; and we tied our anchor to wheat.  There was an improvement last year and we are anxiously awaiting the big jump. I hope it will come.</P>
      <P>I am glad to inform the Minister that I am hoping for some pretty big developments in the line of the production of malt for export.  We are on that work at present and hope to make a success of it.</P>
      <P>I notice that we have introduced new breeds of turkeys from the U.S.A. I have seen a few of them.  They are something like the magpie; they are black and white, white feathers sticking out here and there, and a grey back.  With £25 10s. for offals, it would not pay to give too much of them to a turkey, even if it were a white turkey or a piebald turkey, such as we have now, if turkeys are to be only 1/- a 1b. again this year.  That is a further reason why the Minister should restore the price of wheat affals. A predecessor of his, Deputy Walsh, God rest his soul, succeeded in holding the price from 1951 to 1954 at £20 a ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know what exactly is the position in regard to water supplies to farm-houses.  We are told here that, due to the number of applications, that has been held up.  What is the position?  Can a man apply now for a water supply to his house and, if so, will he get the money?  I know that the former Government had no money and the scheme had to be stopped.  I am wondering whether the <Col N="173" /> financial position has sufficiently improved to enable that scheme to be continued.  There are some anxious inquirers in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I take it there is no hold-up in the farm building scheme.  There is a note to the effect that acceptance of fresh applications has been deferred until further notice.  I should like the Minister to state definitely how long more that ban will be in operation and when farmers concerned may go ahead with the work.</P>
    <P>In regard to the scheme of loans for increased agricultural production, is that a separate scheme from the scheme administered by the Agricultural Credit Corporation?  If it is, there might be some hope that somebody would get a few bob.</P>
    <P>I hope to get here as soon as possible the total amount of money paid in loans by the Agricultural Credit Corporation during the past 12 months and the total amount paid in salaries.  I am sure that is far more than the 10 per cent. of the amount of loans issued.</P>
    <P>In view of the increase in milk production I need not advocate Friesian cows for milk.  The Pekinese breeds seemed to move ahead under the blessing of the previous Minister.  I would suggest to the Minister that it is high time that the bar on Friesians be taken off.  It is an extraordinary thing that a county committee of agriculture can give a premium for a Shorthorn bull, for a Hereford bull and for an Aberdeen-Angus bull, but will not be allowed to give any premium for a Friesian bull.</P>
    <P>Surely the object of a premium is to improve the breed?  What improvement can the Department expect from a premium on a Hereford bull?  How many of his progeny will be kept for bulls?  In the ordinary course you cannot keep any unless you have pure bred Hereford cows.  The heifers cannot be kept for breeding purposes either.  In the name of common sense, for what is the premium on the Hereford bull meant?  What is the reason for the Department's consistent refusal to give premiums for Friesian bulls?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> Compare the effects of the two premiums.  The premium on the Friesian will undoubtedly give you a better milking heifer and will give you some improved stock to carry on with. If you get a Friesian, you can keep the bulls.  What can you hope for from the Hereford?  What lasting influence will the giving of that premium have on live stock?  None.  Therefore, in my opinion, there is no justification for continuing a premium for a Hereford bull and refusing a premium to a Friesian.</P>
    <P>As I said, this Estimate was prepared by the previous Minister.  We must wait for a while before we see a new policy develop.  There is one other matter to which I would like to draw attention.  I note here that amongst the activities of the Department last year was an agricultural production council.  Is it the Minister's intention to continue that council?  Since we lost my dearly beloved friend, Deputy Dillon, they have not met.  I would suggest to the Minister that, when he is calling the next meeting, he would make my friend, Deputy Dillon, an honorary member and bring him in.</P>

      <P>I regret that I was not in the House when the Minister made his statement, but having glanced through it, I must say I was gratified by the expression and tone of that statement.  In the closing part, he expresses a chauvinistic belief in his own people and he looks to the future with confidence and with hope. There are so many people weeping about the future of this country that we could do with a few more people with a chauvinistic outlook.  If he continues the attitude of the last Minister for Agriculture, as he has in this statement, in looking to the future with confidence and with hope, as a consequence of the developments in agriculture in recent years, then all of us may look to the future with confidence and with hope.</P>
      <P>In his statement, he expresses gratification at the progess made in increasing production in the agricultural sphere.  I must inject a comment that that progress would have been far greater if politics, and Party politics, had not been dragged through the programme of the last Government which resulted in this increased output and increased production.  Every embarrassment, whether it occurred in the Argentine, whether it occurred in Denmark or whether it occurred in Britain was availed of by the Party now in office at every crossroads and every chapel gate when there was political gain to be derived from it and levelled against the man then in the Department of Agriculture.  They have now, in a matter of a few months in office, put on record in this statement recognition of the achievements of the last Government in securing increased production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only worry the present Government is faced with is its surpluses in agricultural produce.  The fact that it has a surplus in any category is remarkable when one considers the forebodings of that Party and every member of it over the past few years. We have achieved this record number of cattle and it was not achieved without the initiation of a positive policy designed to produce those results.  Is it not a good thing that we have those <Col N="176" /> cattle stocks in the country?  What now do we hear of the doleful prognostications of the Fianna Fáil Party when they sat on this side of the House and when the price of cattle was temporarily affected on the British market?</P>
    <P>How many people were told, down the country, that they would never again see the day when they would get a fair price for their cattle?  Is it not a good thing that that trade has now recovered and is in the happy position in which it is to-day?  Is it not a direct consequence of the effects of the 1948 Trade Agreement and the improvement of our veterinary services?  Is it not a direct result of the return of confidence in that industry?  No longer can it be said that there was something unnatural in being associated with agriculture.</P>
    <P>To-day industry and every group of people in the country, whether they are professional people, workers or in any other walk of life, realise, after the troubles of last year, how much everyone depends on agriculture, the part of our economy contributing most to our exports, which are so valuable in these times.  The Estimates this year were prepared by the last Government and consequently have not invited much criticism.  This Estimate, however, we find has been singled out by the Government for the most dramatic reduction, a reduction of £1,900,000.</P>
    <P>The point I want to dwell on is that in one single branch of agriculture, the dairying industry, the reduction of £1,900,000 in the subsidy&mdash;which was announced recently and endorsed here in this Estimate&mdash;represents a challenge to the dairying area in the country. We realise, as the Minister points out, that last year there was a record production in milk and he also forecasts still greater production this year. We agree completely that the increase in production this year may be of quite formidable proportions, a consequence again of the better farming methods and advances made in recent times in improving the lot of our agriculturists.</P>
    <P>A still greater increase could have been effected if the organisation that was set up to represent the creamery <Col N="177" /> milk suppliers was not encouraged in the belief that all that was required for every member of the organisation to get an extra 3d. per gallon for milk delivered to the creameries was for one Party to change over from one side of the House to the other.</P>
    <P>That organisation was used as a political weapon by the Party now in office.  During all that troubled period, that organisation sought one thing, that is, the production of the Milk Costings Report and how often was it claimed that the last Minister had some ulterior motive in relation to the report and that it was in some way embarrassing to him?  Consequently, he was accused of delaying the publication of that report.  It is for that reason that I put down questions to the Minister, and to the Minister before him, to indicate that that report was not presented to any Minister for Agriculture so far.</P>
    <P>The members of the organisation were drawn from different political Parties and also had members with no political affiliations whatever, but that did not prevent its posters from being used in North Kerry for political motives in a by-election, nor from being used and availed of on every opportunity to embarrass the interParty Government during their period of office.  It is a remarkable thing that the moment there was a change of Government, so many officers of that organisation tendered their resignations, including a very prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Cork County Council who did not delay in tendering his resignation within a few days of the change of Government.</P>
    <P>We are now entitled to ask the Minister, and the Government, what increase they are going to give the farmers in the price of milk this year. We are entitled to suggest that if, as they claimed in West Limerick&mdash; Deputy Collins's constituency&mdash;nothing less than 3d. a gallon would satisfy the producers at that time, with the increased costs which have arisen since the Budget this year, surely 3d. cannot now satisfy Deputy Collins's supporters. Perhaps the Minister will give us an indication of what the price will <Col N="178" /> be this year and next year.  It is important that the dairy farmers should know what the price will be in the coming year.  At present, the committees of the creameries in the South of Ireland are very perturbed by the drop in the sales of butter owing to the removal, in its entirety, of the butter subsidy.</P>
    <P>Last year, the then Government had an acute problem to face in marketing the surplus production of butter.  That position has been very much aggravated by the increased production of milk.  In case the position was not serious enough this Government, with the authority of the House, decided to reduce native consumption of Irish creamery butter.  There is no provision so far for the subsidy that must be paid to enable the British consumer to eat Irish butter that we would not subsidise for consumption at home.  It cost £750,000 to subsidise it for export last year.  What will it cost this year? Will it cost £2,000,000?  Those engaged in the dairying industry would like to have an answer to that question.  It is a pertinent one.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the opening paragraph of his statement said that he was a new Minister and, in consequence it was not necessary or desirable to indicate the policy of the Government in detail in relation to agriculture.  We realise he is new to office.  We realise the difficulty he has to contend with but his Party were extremely active when in Opposition in suggesting that they had a policy for agriculture, as well as for every other aspect of life in this country.  Where is there a reference to a single departure from the policy of the last Government in relation to agriculture in that statement?  I challenge any Deputy to indicate a paragraph, a line, or a word in that statement which is in contradiction, even in the most minute way, of the policy pursued in relation to agriculture by the last Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the developments over the last 12 months had laid the bogey about our capacity to produce.  Would the Minister, when he has time, take his colleague, the Minister for Lands, into some quiet corner and read that over to him 100 times if necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to see if he could bring it home to him that, in fact there is a section of our people increasing production and that is capable, as the Minister points out, of producing still more?  We are very pleased to know the bogey has been laid but we are afraid that there are a few Ministers in the Government who still do not believe it.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to ask the Government what they propose to do about the price of wheat.  The price of wheat was a very important and relevant subject when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition. It was one which they bandied around every townland in the country where wheat was grown, but which they carefully avoided in the areas where it was not feasible for people to grow wheat.  We are entitled to ask why this Government has not increased the price of wheat since they assumed office.  After all, they increased the price of wheat once before on assuming office, even though the seed was already in the ground.  At that time they increased the price of wheat by 5/- a barrel.  Why did they not increase it this time?  The lack of validity in their argument is exposed when we remember that there was an occasion when, in response to certain pressure, it was increased.  Deputy Corry can provide the Minister with sufficient references to that occasion.  Deputy Corry asked to-night, very significantly, what increase will be made in the price of wheat and when will the increase be effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has, in fact, expressed the view that we have at the moment too much wheat.  That is an extraordinary statement for a responsible Minister in a Fianna Fáil Government to make concerning a crop that was sown during the office of his predecessor.  We have referred in earlier debates to the action of the Minister in deciding that a certain amount of grain which was accepted at the mills last year for milling into flour has now been subsidised for use as pig feed.  We think that an improper thing to do because it weakens the Minister's bargaining powers with the pretty active organisations that are <Col N="180" /> engaged in the buying and processing of wheat in this country.</P>
    <P>It would have been far better if he had realised, that in the difficulties of last year his predecessor had achieved a magnificent result in organising the various points of intake, under the extremely adverse weather conditions that obtained in getting last year's crop taken in.  It is unfortunate that there was some reversal by the decision to subsidise this wheat for animal consumption.</P>
    <P>The Minister also points out that this year's wheat crop promises to be another record.  He does not commit himself any more in relation to the 100 per cent.  Irish loaf other than to say that the problem looms nearer.  He is certainly wise in saying that and in declaring that it is his intention to move with caution, sifting all observations and ascertaining all the facts before coming to a final decision. Some of his colleagues are quicker to advance a final decision and they do not seem to have taken the pains to ascertain all the facts.</P>
    <P>In relation to feeding barley, we have now in this country a remarkable development in its production.  It is true to say that this year there will be a record crop and the purchasing, storing and drying of it will present difficulties as the harvest approaches, but we must realise that there was no development in agriculture since the State was founded which has made a greater contribution to rendering us independent of outside supplies of foodstuffs, than the development in relation to the growing of feeding barley.  It is a very happy situation to have reached.  No doubt it will be reflected, as it is already reflected, in the increased number of sows in this country.  This will effect a return to higher productivity in relation to pigs and bacon.  It will give to our small farmers a source of feeding readily available in this country and will make them independent of the vagaries of external prices.  At the same time it will provide many of our grain growers with a reasonably remunerative income.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately it is true that much haulage is entailed in getting the feeding <Col N="181" /> barley from the areas in which it is grown intensively to the parts of the country where it is later fed to pigs. In that respect, perhaps an improvement could be effected in bringing home to the growers the advisability of going in for more intensive pig rearing and thus saving, to a great extent, some of the profits that now go to people engaged between the grower and the ultimate consumer.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to indicate the position relating to the future of the Agricultural Advisory Body.  There is not a single word about it in his opening statement.  No doubt some questions will be asked as to the attitude of the Government and the Minister in relation to the setting-up of an organisation representing all the farming bodies of this country, providing an opportunity for frequent consultation between the Minister and these freely nominated representatives. The absence of any comment in the Minister's introductory statement may not have been intentional but there is no doubt that those members whose numbers have gratifyingly grown so much in recent years in the various voluntary organisations that now represent agriculture will be very interested in knowing whether, in the view of this Government, that body serves a useful purpose and, if so, whether it is the intention of the Government to resort to those councils on any questions that may arise from time to time between the Minister and the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry was anxious about the future of the water supply scheme and the farm buildings scheme.  He did not advert to the fact that these schemes were waiting for a long time to be initiated.  No doubt the Minister can point out to Deputy Corry that, last year, in all outdoor work an exceptional amount of work was performed in a very short time.  Notwithstanding the fact that huge sums were allocated from the Exchequer towards these schemes, they were exhausted in the shortest time since the foundation of the State.  That goes for all outdoor work by all Departments in the past year.</P>
    <P>Many people have yet to avail of the <Col N="182" /> splendid facilities for the provision of a water supply and the erection of out-offices. They will now look for a firm statement from the Minister as to his intention in regard to the future of these schemes.  In recent years the agricultural community have made considerable progress.  They have made a tremendous investment in their land, in their farm buildings, in their farm-houses and in improving the lot of the people who have to work on the land and in the farmyard.  That tremendous capital investment is now to the credit of the country.</P>
    <P>When people criticise our agricultural community I wonder whether they themselves, in their own avocations, have made the same contribution, proportionally, as the agricultural community in modernisation and mechanisation, in improving their knowledge of the science of farming and in supplementing, to a very great extent, the valuable State assistance that has been forthcoming to encourage them to brighten up their homesteads and in that way to make it possible for people engaged in the most important activity in the State to do so, secure in the knowledge that they can have in their farm houses the amenities which people in villages and towns have by availing of rural electrification, improving their housing and their land and by availing of the facilities under the land project.  Very considerable progress has been made in these directions in the past eight or nine years.</P>
    <P>The agricultural industry is now geared to the point, as the Minister mentions, where we can look with considerable satisfaction at the situation now prevailing of a record number of gallons of milk being delivered to the creameries, of record stocks of cattle on the land, of a record crop of wheat and a record crop of barley in the ground.  Having had that work done before he took office, the Minister is now greatly concerned, as he points out, to cope with whatever difficulties he will have to face in disposing of the surplus which will exist this year. In that respect, it is regrettable that the dairying industry, the foundation of our cattle industry, should, in view of the difficulties it has to face, have to <Col N="183" /> meet the reduction of subsidy on butter which is creating such concern in the industry and which no doubt will present this Government in the coming 12 months with a charge on the Exchequer of the extent of which, possibly, they may not have any idea.</P>
    <P>It was foolish to take away the subsidy on Irish creamery butter. Indeed, grave feelings of discontent are developing among creamery suppliers at the way in which they have been fobbed off by the setting up of a commission which was set up only to stave off the day when the Government would have to answer the demands made by the creamery milk suppliers.  They now look to the Party which gained office to some extent by the assurances they gave at the chapel gates and when canvassing at farmers' doors that, if another Government were in office, a far higher price could be obtained for the milk delivered at creameries.  It is in these circumstances that the Party now in office will have to face the farmers in the months to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a lot has been done by both Governments, since we got our freedom, for the agricultural community.  Notwithstanding that fact, there is quite a lot more to be done before agriculture will be on the solid foundation on which it should rest in this country.  As we know, the farmers <Col N="184" /> are producing 75 per cent. of our exports. According to the White Paper, we sent agricultural produce to England, France, Western Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Norway, Italy, the U.S.A., Canada and Ceylon.  The income from our agricultural produce must be a wonderful asset to the nation.  Despite the fact that our agricultural produce is bringing in the most of the wealth of this country, it is remarkable that only 10 per cent. of that income is directed towards the development of agriculture.  The Irish farmer has seen lean times and, as a farmer, I admit that in recent years he has seen better times.  However, Irish farmers are not yet in a position to say they are independent, because the money they made in the good times has been ploughed back into the land for the development of their farms and the provision of amenities.  That has been done to increase production, to instal electricity and to provide water in the homes as well as to improve the homestead, the out-offices and the land.  The result is that the holdings of the Irish farmers to-day are very much ahead of what they were 25 years ago.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
