      <P>Domestic exports are brought to account by reference to the commodity descriptions specified in the Official Export List.  This list does not distinguish salted fish and smoked fish as such and so, I regret, the exact particulars required are not available.  &ldquo;Fish, dried, salted or smoked, not canned&rdquo; is the nearest description shown in the list: domestic exports of these amounted to £38,896 in the year 1956, and in the first quarter of 1957 they amounted to £43,173 compared with £20,647 in the first quarter of 1956.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared ordinarily to answer Dáil Questions regarding the activities of private commercial concerns.</P>
      <P>I recognise that it may be contended that there are special circumstances relating to the Avoca concern which may justify some departure from this rule, but I ask Deputies to appreciate the undesirability of pressing for information about it which would not be disclosed about any other concern.</P>
      <P>On this understanding, I can tell the Deputy that there are at present 261 persons employed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that one of these mines, which had been operating for seven years, is now closed and the employees have been dismissed?  Is he further aware that a considerable number of the miners have already emigrated and the rest are likely to emigrate unless they are re-employed in the near future?  Taking this serious situation into account, would the Minister not consider doing something about it or suggesting that it is the duty of a foreign company, taking over a mine here, at least to work that mine properly and, if it is not prepared to do so, to hand it back to those who originally owned it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGalvin" hpid="Mr. Galvin Mr. Galvin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Galvin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether a permanent hospital attendant with two and a half years' service is entitled to sick pay, and, if so, for what length of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to hospital attendants employed by local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Officers) Regulations, 1943, provide that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the Manager may grant sick leave to an officer who is incapable of performing his duties owing to illness or physical injury if and only if the Manager is satisfied that there is a reasonable expectation that such officer will be able to resume the performance of his duties.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The normal sick leave granted by local authorities to permanent officers is six months on full pay and six months on half pay except in the case of officers who are suffering from T.B. when the sick leave granted is normally six months' full pay, six months on three-quarters pay and six months on half pay.  The grant of sick leave with pay to officers other than those suffering from T.B. is subject to the limitation that no salary shall be paid to an officer when the sick leave granted to such officer during any continuous period of four years exceeds, in the aggregate, 365 days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGalvin" hpid="Mr. Galvin Mr. Galvin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Galvin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make it clear to dispensary medical officers that holders of general medical register cards, who are <Col N="1250" /> unable to make a personal attendance, are entitled to secure the service of a doctor by telephoning him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Duties of District Medical Officers) Order, 1954, directs that it shall be a duty of a district medical officer to afford adequate medical care and advice at a dispensary or elsewhere as the case may require to any person resident in the dispensary district whose name is entered in the General Medical Services Register and to the dependents of such person.</P>
      <P>The onus of satisfying the doctor that an applicant for his services is on the Register rests on the applicant. Normally the doctor is so satisfied by the production to him of the medical services card issued by the health authority; but in cases represented as urgent, district medical officers normally attend on receipt of a telephone request.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be reasonable to require a doctor to attend in every case where the request is made by telephone, as it would expose him to the undue risk of wasting time and effort in dealing with non-urgent or bogus calls or in visiting ineligible persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGalvin" hpid="Mr. Galvin Mr. Galvin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Galvin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that applicants for medical assistance who attend Grattan Street Dispensary, Cork, are kept waiting in the open street pending the arrival of the medical officer; and if, in view of the fact that seating accommodation is available in the dispensary, he will ascertain whether it is proposed to discontinue the existing practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The dispensary doctors attend at the Grattan Street Dispensary, Cork, at 11 a.m.  On inquiry, following receipt of the Deputy's question, I have been informed by the health authority that on a recent occasion a large number of people attended the dispensary at around 9.30 a.m. accompanied by children who were playing about in the waiting room and that in view of the noise they were advised to come back <Col N="1251" /> when the doctors were in attendance. It is denied that they were told to wait outside in the street.  I am also informed that the Assistant County Manager, when his attention was drawn to the matter, issued instructions that in future persons attending at the dispensary are to be permitted to wait in the waiting room.</P>

      <P>The only institution under the control of my Department is Dundrum Asylum.  Until the revised contract prices arising out of the Budget proposals become known, it will not be possible to furnish the desired information.</P>
      <P>I have not in my Department data which would enable me to make the calculations in respect of the other institutions mentioned in the question even if the revised contract prices were known, and I do not feel that I would be justified in approaching every health authority with a view to their compiling it in respect of every institution under their control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that many applications for the provision of dentures have been made to Wexford County Council by persons in the lower income group.  Dental services for that group are made available at one clinic a week at the County Hospital and one at New Ross&mdash;for extractions only, dentures not being provided so far.</P>
      <P>Existing staffs and services are not adequate to provide a fully comprehensive dental service and I am advised that in such circumstances it is preferable to give priority to services for school children.  Health authorities have been informed accordingly.  I understand that Wexford County Council, in common with health authorities elsewhere, have, up to the present, been concentrating on improving the services for children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is accepted that medical and other officers of health authorities should normally be afforded facilities to keep abreast of developments in their professions through attendance, when appropriate, at post-graduate courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> Having regard to the prevailing economic circumstances, it was found necessary, as an economy measure, to announce that such facilities could not, as a general proposition, be granted where they involved public expenditure. I am keeping the matter under review and when the financial position improves, I hope that it will be possible to resume the former practice.</P>

      <P>It would be over-venturesome for me to attempt to predict the actual course of live-stock prices in the future.  As to the general trends, however, it would seem that cattle prices this year are, on the whole, tending to follow the normal pattern of other years, that is, a relatively steady rise in prices from the time the autumn and early winter flush of supplies has passed to a peak price in the late spring, followed by a relatively gradual decline as increased supplies of grass-fed cattle tend to reach the market.  In the case of store cattle, there is, of course, the price link between our stores fattened in Britain and British home-bred fat stock.  The changes made this year in the British system of guarantee payments, by providing an increased measure of stability for British producers, should react advantageously to producers here.</P>
      <P>Sheep and lamb prices this year have, so far, been showing improved rates as compared with the past few years.  It is hoped that this trend will be maintained. As in the case of store cattle, our store sheep fattened in the Six Counties or Britain have the benefit of the link with the guaranteed prices under the British fat-stock scheme.</P>
      <P>While pig prices continue to fluctuate, producers have the assurance that, no matter what variations may occur, prices of top quality pigs cannot fall below the minimum rates prescribed for such classes.</P>

      <P>I think my reply to that question would be better answered in connection with the Estimate.  In actual fact, I am informed that the minimum operating capacity for this plant to enable it to operate economically is 25 tons.  At the moment, 20 tons are being brought ashore to be processed.  We hope to reach the figure of the extra five tons shortly when the plant will prove to be of economic value.</P>

The collection of the information in question would require a very great amount of time and labour on the part of the authorities of almost 5,000 national schools and of the Department's officials, and the expenditure of such an amount of time and labour would not, I feel, be warranted.</P>

      <P>The answers to (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Deputy's question are in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of An Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As regards (e) the position is that the Land Commission has intimated that with one exception, the lettings in question do not appear to constitute tenancies to which the provisions of the Land Acts for the purchase of tenanted land apply.</P>
      <P>I am, however, in communication with the Land Commission as to whether there is any alternative method by which these tenants might be brought within the provisions of the Land Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I spoke with regard to the effect of the abolition of food subsidies and the general situation arising from that. To-day, I want to make a few remarks with regard to the Government decision to increase the price of petrol by 6d. a gallon.  Deputy Booth, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, indicated yesterday evening that as far as he was concerned he would condemn the Minister and the Government in connection with the increase in the price of petrol if he could find any alternative tax which might be applied.  My heart bleeds for Deputy Booth when I think of how he could have spread himself if he had been in this House just a year ago when the Fianna Fáil Party were occupying these benches.</P>
      <P>Deputies will remember that a tax of 6d. a gallon was put on petrol in the 1956 Budget and a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies put on record their reactions to that tax.  We had contributions on that occasion from Deputy Lemass, as he then was, the present Tánaiste, from the present Minister for Justice, Deputy Traynor as he then was, and from other Fianna Fáil Deputies.  For the edification of Deputy Booth, I propose to show him what he missed, how he could have spread himself if he had been over here just 12 months ago, holding the views which apparently he holds in connection with the petrol tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to start with Deputy Cunningham, who contributed his views on the Budget Resolutions on 8th May, 1956.  As reported in the Official Report for 8th May, 1956, at column 70, Deputy Cunningham had <Col N="1276" /> this to say&mdash;I do not know how Deputy McQuillan put his foot in it, but this is not my remark, I want to assure Deputy McQuillan in advance; I am simply quoting:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Surely Deputy McQuillan is not so innocent as to think that an increase of 6d. a gallon on the price of petrol is not going to increase the cost of production on farms and that it is not going to affect the agricultural community?  Every Deputy knows that farm production, or a great part of it, is hauled by petroldriven lorries and other vehicles of that kind.  Accordingly, an increase in the price of petrol must affect the cost of agricultural production and will be passed on to the consumer. The new tax will also affect hackney owners about whom there was such wailing and moaning in 1952.  It will be a serious blow to these people. Although tractor oil is exempted, still a large part of farm produce will be affected by the increased price of petrol.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies speaking from these benches in May, 1956.  That Deputy is now occupying a seat behind the Minister and the only result of that change so far as petrol is concerned is that another 6d. a gallon goes on petrol.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, when he was over here, spoke on the General Financial Resolution on 17th May, 1956, and in the Official Report for that date, at columns 624 and 625, he also recorded his view.  Apparently, it is too much to hope that he was recording his views for the guidance of future Ministers for Finance.  This is what he had to say at that time:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The extent to which petrol is used for purely recreational purposes is quite small, and probably would not represent 10 per cent. of the total consumption of petrol annually here. If the Minister had in mind, therefore, the getting in of additional revenue from a luxury, he has hit a great deal more than those who use petrol as a luxury.  He has hit every business in the country which requires to use road transport.  He has made another addition to our industrial <Col N="1277" /> costs, and, goodness knows, they are high enough.  It is certain that, to some extent, every price in the country will have to be adjusted upwards because of this additional charge.  But, over and above that tax on petrol used for transport, the Minister has imposed another tax on industrial fuel oil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Tánaiste in May, 1956, when petrol was being priced at 6d. a gallon less than it is being priced under the Fianna Fail Budget of this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, then Deputy Traynor, spoke here on the 23rd May, 1956.  He had certain remarks to make with regard to the increase in the price of petrol.  Again, I would ask Deputies to bear in mind that petrol was then being priced at 6d. less than it is being priced by the Fianna Fáil Budget of this year.  When I made some remarks regarding the abolition of food subsidies, I pointed out that the abolition of those subsidies would probably lead to increased charges in hotels and that that would not suit the tourist industry. The Minister for Justice, Deputy Traynor, when he was in the Opposition Benches, was thinking along similar lines in connection with the price of petrol and on 23rd May, at columns 832 and 833 of the Official Report, he left his record behind him.  He told us of a discussion he had had with an Englishman a few days before the Budget of 1956 was introduced.  He told us that this Englishman knew that he, Deputy Traynor, was a parliamentary representative and he said the Englishman thought he would have some influence in the framing of the Budget.  Deputy Traynor gave his recommendation to this man as being a good friend of Ireland.  I quote now from Deputy Traynor's speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He asked me if I would be good enough to use my influence to see that the petrol tax was not raised. I replied that the petrol tax here was not nearly as high as it is in England.  He said that he knew all about that, but that was not the point, that the point he wanted to impress on me was that, if we want to get English visitors to this country, we must offer them a cheap <Col N="1278" /> means of touring the country in their own cars&mdash;for instance, cheap petrol&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Traynor then gave a further account of his discussion with this English friend and finished up by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I assured him that I had no influence in framing the Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in May, 1956.  Deputy Traynor is now Minister for Justice and I assume that he has some influence in framing the Budget.  Apparently, so far as English visitors and other tourists are concerned, so far as the ordinary people of this country, the farmers, the hackney owners and taxi drivers, for whom Deputy Cunningham spoke 12 months ago, are concerned, the only result of Deputy Traynor's translation to the other side of the House and his influence in framing the Budget is that an additional 6d. goes on to the price of a gallon of petrol. I do not want to weary the House with further quotations from Fianna Fáil Deputies when they were on this side of the House.  I think it was Deputy Booth who issued an invitation, I thought very reasonably, to those who were participating in this discussion to make some constructive suggestions as to how the position might be dealt with.</P>
    <P>When I finished speaking yesterday evening I was referring to the suggestion made by Deputy Costello regarding the levies.  I think that is an eminently sensible suggestion and one which would have relieved the position in a full year to the extent of something like £4,250,000.  The suggestion was that the proceeds of the import levies should be put into revenue rather than into capital account.  I think that could be done and I think it should be done.  I am quite well aware of the fact that when Deputy Sweetman was Minister for Finance and was announcing the imposition of these levies that he made it clear that he intended devoting the proceeds of the levies for capital purposes.  That was a decision taken in particular circumstances.  If those circumstances altered to make it desirable to use the proceeds of the levies for current purposes, purposes of current revenue, I do not see why <Col N="1279" /> the proceeds should not go into revenue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello also suggested the examination of the question of capital gains tax.  I do not see why that suggestion could not be taken up.  I do not know to what extent a tax of that nature would raise funds for the Minister for Finance, but I assume that it would at least make some impression. I pointed out yesterday that both in the 1952 Budget, when Fianna Fáil increased the price of the loaf, and in the present Budget when Fianna Fáil are again increasing the price of the loaf, on each occasion the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance in his Budget statement took the opportunity of referring to the entertainments duty position.  As far as I am concerned, I see no reason, if a choice has to be made on the one hand between the price of essential foodstuffs and entertainment duty on the other, why the price of entertainments should not be increased.  The Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance might well have been able to secure additional finance in the present year by further impositions of entertainments duty.  At least it can be said for the inter-Party Government that during their period of office they did their utmost to see to it that they would prevent the price of essential commodities rising.</P>
    <P>There are many people, particularly those who by neglecting to vote in the general election brought about the situation whereby Fianna Fáil were returned as the Government, who will to-day feel sorry for their neglect and for the fact that they did not prevent Fianna Fáil regaining office.  Those people will now appreciate that the work of the inter-Party Government was work which was being done for the people of this country.  They will appreciate that they endeavoured to keep down costs and that the interParty Government were sincere in their endeavours in that direction.  I am not claiming that they succeeded entirely, but we can say that the interParty Government did not, by deliberate action, shove up prices particularly of essential commodities.  There was that distinction there.  The approach <Col N="1280" /> of the inter-Party Government, if money had to be found, was to tax non-essential and luxury type of goods. As far as I am concerned, if a choice has to be made and if money has to be found, I shall support the Government that will adopt that policy of taxing non-essentials and luxuries rather than taxing people's foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion I would make is that it might be possible by some adjustment in the administration of children's allowances to see to it that those allowances are not paid to people who do not require them.  I think a saving could be made there and quite possibly a very substantial one.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Board of Works mentioned the other day, and I think he referred to it yesterday also, the difficulty of finding productive employment in the City of Dublin.  Deputy Murphy asked a question yesterday in regard to the allocation of the additional £250,000 which is to be provided for employment and he inquired how much of that was to be devoted to employment in Dublin.  There is no doubt in my mind that having regard to the size of the unemployment problem in Dublin the Government should devote a very substantial share of that money to alleviating the position in Dublin. The Parliamentary Secretary has expressed the view that it is difficult to find productive employment in Dublin and I appreciate the position and what he has in mind.  I think he gave a figure of something in the neighbourhood of £25 a week as the cost of putting a person into employment in Dublin and paying him a wage of about £7 or £8 a week.</P>
    <P>I want seriously to suggest that the Government could save money and at the same time help to reduce unemployment in the City of Dublin by approaching the matter from an entirely different point of view.  I believe that the Government could put into operation some system of a remission of income-tax to employers who would give employment, on the basis of receiving a bonus for each person, over a given number, taken into employment.  If that bonus were allowed by way of remission of income-tax, I believe very <Col N="1281" /> many employers in this city would respond to that gesture by the Government. I believe they would endeavour to give employment and the Government would be able to save some of the moneys which they are allocating for relief schemes.</P>
    <P>There is one other suggestion I want to make.  I would like to make it clear that it is purely a personal suggestion. If it would ease the position in any substantial way, I certainly would not be opposed to the reintroduction of some system of bread rationing on the basis of giving a liberal ration of subsidised bread to those who need it and allowing the system to obtain, very much as it did during the days of the first inter-Party Government, in which the wealthy, those who could afford it and who wanted to get bread of a particular type over, above and outside the ration, were required to pay the full economic price for it.  In that way, money was secured which enabled those who needed it most to obtain their bread at a subsidised price.  I certainly would have no objection to the Government re-examining that position, if that would ease the situation.</P>
    <P>I understood from a speech which the Taoiseach made over the week-end &mdash;I think it was at Mitchelstown&mdash;that his view was that the Government had not abolished food subsidies because of any doctrinaire economic principles, but because they felt it was a matter of necessity.  I think that was the line the Tánaiste took on this matter also when speaking here yesterday.  I believe it is true to say that some members of the Fianna Fáil Party, and at least one member of the Fianna Fáil Government, have put themselves on record as being hostile to the principle of subsidies.  I am referring particularly to the Minister for Lands. Discussing the General Financial Resolution on the 12th May, 1955, in the Dáil Debates of that date at column 1470, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have never yet had any explanation from the members of the present Government either when in opposition or at the present time, of how it was possible for other <Col N="1282" /> countries with socialist administrations&mdash;not conservative administrations&mdash;some of which had been neutral during the war and had made fortunes during the war, to reduce or abolish their subsidies for exactly the same reason as here and what could make it possible for us to retain the full panoply of subsidies when rationing ended and when, quite obviously, it was essential that there should be an adjustment in the standard of wages and salaries rather than a continuation of subsidies, because to a certain extent they had become unreal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think is the only time the Minister for Lands went on record on the question of subsidies.  However, I understand from my reading of the Taoiseach's speech over the week-end that the Government did not take their decision to abolish the food subsidies on grounds of doctrinaire economics, but because they felt it was a necessity in the present financial position.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting to them that there were other avenues which could and should have been explored.  I believe, if the Government took a formal decision to get rid of the subsidies and believed it was the right financial policy to pursue, a lot might be said in favour of that; but if that decision was based on financial and economic grounds, they should not have put it into operation all in one year.  They should have announced their decision and operated it gradually over a period of three or four years, rather than do it in the manner they have done it, which is bound to be a shock and a jolt for the entire economy of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have anything further to say other than to remind the Government again that they will have to render an account of their stewardship to the people.  It is a great pity that it is not possible, by reason of the majority they have succeeded in obtaining in the House&mdash;due mainly, I think, to the number of people refraining from voting in the last general election&mdash;that the people's judgment on this first Fianna Fáil Budget cannot now be obtained, but it will be obtained sooner or later.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins appears to think that the people believe they made a mistake in returning Fianna Fáil as a Government and that they would now like to change that decision and bring the Coalition back.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in tackling the situation that was left for them to solve by the previous Government.  The people certainly were in no doubt during the last election campaign that we in Fianna Fáil believed there was a serious situation existing in regard to the country's finances.  I am sure there is no Deputy to-day who does not believe that the finances of the country were in a pretty critical condition when we took over.  We have been attacked by members of the previous Government for this Budget, but nobody knows better than they that immediate action on the lines we have taken was essential, if the country was to survive.</P>
      <P>I am not impressed in the least by the speeches I have heard, making forecasts as to what Opposition Deputies think the people would do if they got the chance in another election in a short period.  As I have said, in the election two months ago, the people knew, in so far as we were able to tell them, that there was a serious position existing and we endeavoured to impress upon the people that drastic action was needed if we were to halt the drift to disaster that was going on under the Coalition Government.  It was because we succeeded in bringing that to the people's attention, that this serious situation existed, that Fianna Fáil were given an overwhelming majority in the last election and it is because of that we are in the position to tackle that situation to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, and in the opinion of any fair-minded person who even now <Col N="1284" /> goes back and looks over the speeches made in the election campaign, it is beyond all doubt that we were put in here as a Government to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation of mass unemployment and emigration brought about by the previous Government. It is useless for the Opposition now to try to pretend that the action we have taken has come as a shock to the people.  The people definitely realised that it was necessary to take decisive and tough action and it was because Fianna Fáil were the only Party who could be trusted to do this that we were put back into office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that decisive action was needed.  I shall come to the question of the subsidies later.  Deputy Norton referred to this Budget as a near relation of the 1952 Budget. Apparently he could think of no worse description to apply to this Budget. As far as I am concerned, I accept that description of it.  The action we took in 1952 was taken to deal with the somewhat similar situation to that which existed when we came back to office on this occasion, and it was only natural we should deal with that similar situation in the manner that proved effective in 1952.</P>
      <P>During the election campaign, we made no secret of the fact that we intended to tackle the situation and resolve the difficulties that confronted the country.  Deputies on the opposite side referred to the fact that we did not announce our intention of removing the subsidies.  We could not forecast in exact detail what steps would be necessary.  We could not do this because we did not know the full extent of the ravages that had been wrought by the Coalition; but we did know it was obvious from the situation that existed in the country that the position was one of the utmost gravity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that in the 1954 election <Col N="1285" /> the Budget of 1952 was made an issue by the Coalition Parties and that it was largely on that issue the Fianna Fáil Party were defeated in that election. However, during all the time since 1952 we have never admitted that what the Coalition said was right&mdash; that we had acted wrongly on that occasion.  On the contrary, we have consistenly pointed out that the action we took in 1952 was necessary to rectify the position bequeathed to us by the Coalition.  We also consistently pointed out, particularly during the 1954 election campaign, that if the people were so foolish as to return again a Coalition Government who would obviously act again in the same irresponsible way, it was probable we would have to take action similar to that taken in 1952.  If that Budget of 1952 was an issue in the election of 1954, it was also an issue in 1957 and by the time 1957 came around, the people had had a second experience of Coalition Government and had realised that Fianna Fáil policy was right.</P>
    <P>That policy was endorsed by the people in 1957 because the people were convinced it was necessary to have the financial affairs of the nation handled in a responsible manner.  It was due to that that we were given an overall majority, and if we had tackled the question in the fainthearted manner Deputy O'Higgins suggested in his speech, we would have been letting down the people who elected us for the purpose of remedying the situation.  I have no qualms about facing the people who voted for me, because in my election campaign I told the people that I believed stern and prompt action was needed to remedy the situation.  I also told them I had faith in the resilience of the country to overcome the difficulty and that I believed that, with the backing of the people, the job could be done.</P>
    <P>It is true I did not forecast, nor did anyone else in the Fianna Fáil Party, the effective steps that would have to be taken, and when Deputies opposite say we did not announce that subsidies were to be removed or that these new taxes were necessary, they are quite right.  We did not know the full details of the situation at that time; we had <Col N="1286" /> not got the information, for instance, that was available to the members of the previous Government.  We did not know that the Committee on Capital Investment which was set up by the previous Government had advised that it was necessary, if the nation were to recover from its economic crisis, that these subsidies would be abolished.</P>
    <P>Neither did we know at that time the magnitude of the bill that had to be faced in the coming Budget.  The members of the out-going Government had prepared the Estimates.  They knew that the Estimates for the coming year would exceed those for the previous year by £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>We did not know, as they did, that revenue for the past year was deficient by £6,000,000 in relation to expenditure. We did not know of the gap of £11,000,000 that had to be bridged. Not knowing these things, we were unable to outline the steps necessary in order that they might be overcome; but the members of the previous Government who have spoken here &mdash;Deputies Norton, Sweetman and Costello&mdash;knew of these things. Knowing them, they were in a position to attempt these forecasts as to what a responsibly-minded Fianna Fáil Government would do if put into a position to do it as a result of the election.  It was easy for them to forecast these things.  We were not, as I have stated, in the same position, not knowing the facts.</P>
    <P>We were quite right then, in my opinion, in denying it was our intention to remove the food subsidies.  We had no such intention then because we did not know of the situation with which we had to deal.  The decisions embodied in this Budget were made since we came into office.  They were made, as the Taoiseach said last Sunday, for the sole purpose of dealing with the situation as we found it.  We were left with this bill and we had to face up to the task of meeting it.  I am satisfied we have done that in the best possible manner, in a manner which will have the best possible effect on the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>I have heard no definite suggestion as to what other way we could have dealt with the situation.  Not alone <Col N="1287" /> have we balanced the Budget, but we have succeeded in including in it provisions to encourage increased industrial and agricultural production.  These things are essential if we are to make any progress from the position as we found it.  It is a realistic Budget, a Budget which will establish an atmosphere of confidence in the people&mdash; confidence that during this Government's period of office the financial affairs of the State will be handled in a responsible manner, in a manner that will make economic progress possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton has boasted that the Coalition Government succeeded in keeping prices down.  The fact is that the cost of living increased considerably during the Coalition's period of office.  When Deputy O'Higgins was amusing himself reading some of the literature published by Fianna Fáil for the series of by-elections which took place during the previous Government's period of office, he consistently referred to the statements in that literature of increases which had taken place in the cost of living.  He did that, of course, for the purpose of comparing that with the fact that increases are taking place now as a result of this Budget; but he did not deny that those increases had taken place and it is a fact, then, that increases did take place during the Coalition's period of office.  It is a fact, of course, that these subsidies were retained and that therefore the two items to which food subsidies refer, bread and butter, were kept at an artificially low level during the Coalition's period of office; but the question is at what price to the community in general were those commodities kept down and the subsidies retained? I think it was at a price which the community were not prepared to pay.</P>
    <P>People realise now&mdash;and they showed they realised it by voting for Fianna Fáil at the last election&mdash;that there was no ultimate advantage to the workers in having low prices and no work.  That is what the policy of the Coalition Government produced during the past three years.  They succeeded in keeping down the prices of those two items, but at the expense of putting <Col N="1288" /> people out of employment.  The housewives whose husbands have had to emigrate because of unemployment realise now that it would have been better to have had slightly higher prices and to have been able to keep their husbands at home.</P>
    <P>It is all right for Deputy Norton to speak, as he did when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, of the advantage of having &ldquo;the safety valve of emigration.&rdquo; It is all right for him to ask, as he asked a deputation from the representatives of trade unions here in Dublin, why should they worry about unemployment in the categories they cater for, when the people were leaving the country and not remaining as a liability to them?  The wives whose husbands have had to emigrate, the children whose fathers have had to emigrate, cannot regard emigration in that complacent light, as a safety valve.  To them, it is a real tragedy.</P>
    <P>The people who have been affected by that unemployment and resulting emigration have put their faith in Fianna Fáil to remedy this situation, in the full knowledge that there would probably be a period of comparative austerity before progress towards remedying the situation became apparent.  The people know that although in 1952 Fianna Fáil had to do some unpopular things, they did succeed in establishing sound economic conditions here before they left office in 1954.  They also realised two months ago in the general election that it was because they had allowed themselves to be fooled by the promises made by the Coalition&mdash;by the Coalition catchcry of &ldquo;lower prices, lower taxes and better times&rdquo;&mdash;that this present crisis has developed.  It is my belief that the people are just as determined as we are to see this thing through now and that on this occasion all the incitement the Opposition Deputies can give to the people will fall on deaf ears. They are determined to see it through.</P>
    <P>We made no false promises to them on this occasion, no promises that good times were to be secured merely by voting for us.  We did tell them in all our election speeches that there was a tough period ahead in which hard work would be necessary, but that the job <Col N="1289" /> could be done.  The people took us at our word and put us in to do the job, to rectify that position.  They are certainly not going to pull out now, when we have only started.  The people have dug their heels in this time and are determined to weather the storm. I think it is a pity at this juncture that Coalition speakers should adopt such an irresponsible attitude by their speeches here and attempt to incite people to take action which they know would be detrimental to the nation's interest.</P>
    <P>The whole tenor of the speeches here has been to exaggerate the effect of the Budget on the cost of living.  The actual fact is that, as regards the two items affected by the withdrawal of the subsidies, the increased cost per head of the population will be no more than twopence per day&mdash;in fact, something less than twopence per day.  That is a small increase; I am fully aware that it is a serious matter and that it will be quite a difficult thing for people of modest means, but it is certainly not of the serious proportions which the Coalition would have us believe.</P>
    <P>No serious effort has been made here to suggest to us any alternative way in which we could have bridged this gap which we found when we came into office.  Will the Coalition speakers even now tell us what they would have done?  Would they once again have budgeted for a deficit and thereby have deprived capital investment of that amount of money and created more unemployment? Deputy O'Higgins did say that the Coalition would have kept the subsidies in existence, but he did not tell us the method by which they would have raised the additional money which it would have been necessary to raise in order to do so. It seems it was the intention once again to budget for a deficit, which would have had the effect of taking this money, which would otherwise be available for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>As far as we were concerned, we decided straight away as soon as we came in that we would balance the Budget.  We believed that was the first thing which was necessary as a preliminary, in order to produce stabilised <Col N="1290" /> economic conditions here again and conditions in which the money necessary for capital works and for investment in industry would be made available. Our problem, therefore, was how we were to bridge the gap.  We had to decide whether we could do that completely by imposing new taxes or by cutting expenditure.  The hard fact about raising the money by means of taxes was that we were advised that there was no system of taxation which could be devised which would succeed in raising the amount necessary.  The gap to be bridged was £11,000,000.  We were told&mdash;and it appears to be right&mdash; that the imposition of taxes could not succeed in raising that amount. Instead, if taxes were increased to too great an extent, we would actually secure less revenue from them.  Therefore, the only way in which it could be done was by cutting the expenditure and I am satisfied that the method we adopted was the only way which was open to the Government.</P>
    <P>We decided that, having withdrawn the food subsidies, it was desirable that we should as far as possible cushion the effect of that withdrawal on the weaker sections of the community; and so we gave increases which went a long way towards doing that for the people in receipt of social assistance.  We also increased children's allowances for the second and each subsequent child, by an amount which would eliminate the increase in the cost of living caused by removing the subsidies.</P>
    <P>In order to provide the money for these things, it was found that additional taxation was necessary and that is the reason for the increased taxes. Again, with regard to the increased taxes, I do not think that there were any other items&mdash;certainly we could not discover any other items&mdash;which, if they were taxed, would produce the same revenue.  It is not that we wanted to penalise the man who drinks a pint or who smokes cigarettes, or the private motorist, the public transport companies or the owners of hackney vehicles.  It was not for any of those reasons that we imposed the taxes but simply because it was necessary to raise the money to give increases to <Col N="1291" /> people in receipt of social assistance and increases in children's allowances.</P>
    <P>Because we succeeded in lessening the effect on the people who were less well able to bear it, particularly people with large families, there should not now be any necessity for increased wage demands by workers, arising directly from the Budget at any rate.  It is very regrettable that the Opposition should attempt to negative the good effect which this Budget will have by making inflammatory speeches such as they have made here attempting to incite people to take action which they know would be to the detriment of the country.</P>
    <P>Our other problem in addition to balancing the Budget was to arrest the high incidence of unemployment and emigration and to get increased production, both industrial and agricultural. To do that it was necessary to create conditions in which capital would be likely to be made available for national development and also for the expansion of industry.  In this Budget we have gone a good way towards creating those conditions.  We inherited a position from the previous Government in which there were 90,000 people unemployed.  We realise that it is vital that we should do everything possible to remedy that position If we do not create conditions in which capital will be available for the purposes I have mentioned, then we shall not succeed in doing anything about the unemployment position, and anybody who takes action to negative the effect of this Budget is certainly not doing anything to help in the solution of that problem.</P>
    <P>While it is true perhaps that the only thing that will have an immediate effect on the unemployment situation is schemes of public works, housing, and so on, the problem is a long-term one inherently, and it would not be satisfactory to deal with the problem entirely by attempting to provide immediate employment for everybody.  We must try to remedy the situation as quickly as possible but in future capital expenditure should, as far as <Col N="1292" /> possible, be on work of a productive nature, work which is likely to continue because it is productive.</P>
    <P>We have included in the Budget proposals which should have the effect of inducing more investment in industry, and thereby increased the possibilities of employment on productive work. Work of that nature is more likely to be permanent.  If we had gone on an all-out scale for stop-gap employment schemes, that would only result in increased unemployment in future, because we have reached the position where capital cannot be obtained indefinitely unless there is some return for it, and it would be a disservice to the cause of the unemployed to divert all the capital to schemes of that nature.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we have included in the Budget £250,000 for the creation of improved marketing arrangements for agricultural products.  We believe this is essential towards securing increased agricultural production.  The future of the country is bound up with the future of agriculture and by comparison with other countries it is obvious that there is great scope for increased agricultural production here.</P>
    <P>The joint effect of our proposals, therefore, should be to increase employment both in industry and agriculture and in national development work, and thereby bring about an expansion in credit facilities and a general improvement in trade and employment. It is because we believe that that is the real remedy for unemployment that we have taken the action we have taken in this Budget.  The real remedy is to get people, as far as possible, into productive occupations, either producing goods to replace goods that are at present imported for the home market or producing goods for export in exchange for goods which we shall have to continue to import.</P>
    <P>If there is a series of demands for wage increases at this juncture when we are in a critical position, it will lead to increased costs of production and fewer possibilities for export and for increasing employment.  Surely the people who are concerned with the welfare of the workers realise that, if they set about making increased wage <Col N="1293" /> demands now, the only result will be to put the brakes on the reduction of the numbers of unemployed.  Surely it is a net advantage to the workers in general to have a greater number of people employed at present wage rates rather than to have an ever-decreasing number at slightly higher rates, which will be the position if the Government's policy is not allowed a fair chance to create the conditions we believe to be necessary.</P>
    <P>It is unthinkable that workers' organisations should take the line that some Opposition speakers are trying to incite them into taking, that is, to treat this Budget as having had a greater effect on the cost of living than it actually has, thereby frustrating the Government's policy for securing a reduction in unemployment.  I believe this Government is laying the foundation for the solution of these problems that were left to us by the Coalition Parties.  I believe the people are accepting them as such.  I believe that while they did not know, or could not forecast, the exact steps which we would take, they certainly expected us to take decisive action.  They were not as shocked as Deputies opposite would have you believe.  They were determined to stand by the Government in the action they have taken to limit the sacrifices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy" hpid="Mr. J. Murphy Mr. J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my unemployed colleagues, I want to make it quite clear that we are opposed completely to this Budget, firstly, because it does nothing to relieve unemployment and there is no indication of any plans by the Government to bring about increased employment.  In fact, this Budget will worsen the unemployment position by reducing the purchasing power of the people.  Secondly, we are opposed to it because it inflicts a greater hardship on the suffering unemployed, old age pensioners, widows and the lower income groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demands of the unemployed are quite simple and realistic: that the Government should immediately take what measures it intends taking to alleviate unemployment.  We do not want merely words and paper proposals; we want action based on con <Col N="1294" /> crete proposals.  We believe that the Government should support the provisional trades union organisation on its 11-point programme and relieve unemployment. We believe also that there should be a further increase in the benefits to social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>As a result of this Budget, two men have gone on hunger strike, and I have joined them.  When I came into this House, I warned the Government that the unemployed will no longer suffer in silence, and I repeat that warning now.  If the Minister believes that this is a fair and just Budget, I would ask him to do one thing&mdash;to come out on a public platform and meet the people who have to make these sacrifices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just heard the maiden speech of the Minister for Defence in this House and I felicitate him on the occasion, on the form and the substance of his speech, with not a word of which I found myself in agreement.  The purpose of this House is to afford the opportunity of various points of view being made so that they may be fully debated.  I do not think the Minister for Defence can hope to have it both ways.  I am going to submit to the House that this Budget represents the pole-axe economics of the slaughterhouse.  I do not think there is any use in the Minister for Defence protesting to the House in one breath that the people knew what was coming and were longing for it and were determined to stick their heels in and see it through, and then in another breath, saying, after all, what is 2d, a day and why should anyone complain about it?  He should make up his mind.  What did he think he was doing when he agreed to this Budget?  Did he agree that it was only 2d. a day and that nobody had any cause for legitimate complaint, or did he believe that, on the mandate of the Irish people, he was imposing a staggering burden which the people were strongly resolved to bear so that Fianna Fáil policy could be seen to blossom in triumph?  One story must be true; both stories cannot be true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister for Defence is working himself, and some of his colleagues <Col N="1295" /> are working themselves into the happy state when they are going to repeat the query of Marie Antoinette that has echoed down the corridors of history&mdash;&ldquo;If the people cannot get bread, why do they not eat cake?&rdquo; Do the Government realise what they themselves have done?  When the Minister for Defence is talking of only 2d. a day, does he realise that where a 10-acre farmer comes in to buy a bag of flour to-day, the bag of flour that cost him 40/&ndash; a week ago is going to cost him from 70/&ndash; to 72/&ndash; now?  Does the Government realise that the person with a family of children coming in to buy loaves of bread for which they used to pay 9d. must now pay 1/&ndash; or 1/1d?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence I fully appreciate is a junior member of the Government, and while I do not doubt that his views are sought and listened to respectfully, he cannot have the same responsibility as his senior colleagues, but while I listened to him, I began to ask myself do they know what they are doing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They knew they had to find £11,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what interests me about the Minister for Defence.  He has been so staggered by the stories told to him since he became Minister that he is beginning to persuade himself that this problem of debt has an inherent trend to grow.  It began with £8,000,000 and then it began to grow. He said that would not do and then he made it £9,000,000.  Then he had another look at what he was doing and now he is suggesting £11,000,000.  If the Government is in that state of mind, they are in a state of mind which is not unprecedented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the British Government getting into a &ldquo;flap&rdquo; something like this.  In those halcyon days, the British Government of Ramsay MacDonald, fortified by Mr. Baldwin, Sir John Simon and a few other stalwarts, set up the May Committee, which warned the British Government in 1931 that if they did not cut down unemployment allowances, if they did not cut down on social services, if they did <Col N="1296" /> not tax foodstuffs, the whole economy of Britain would come clattering down around their ears.  In 1931, the whole of England was thrown into unemployment and the whole economic welfare of England was disrupted.  Then, in 1939, Hitler invaded Poland and while you could crack a match, the Government that was shaking in its shoes lest it be brought down in ruins by the financial demands made on it in 1931 found, I think, £3,000,000,000 to grapple with Hitler.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, and the members of the Government especially, why is it&mdash;when we are all agreed that it is a desirable thing to balance the Budget and that, to do that, taxation must be raised&mdash;that they think it desirable or expedient, from any point of view, to raise the revenue for the purpose of balancing the Budget by taxing bread and butter, at the same time as they proceed to remove the tax from this list of commodities: private motor cars, on which the tax has been halved; radio and television sets, on which the tax has been abolished; radio gramophones, on which the tax has been abolished; gramophones, record players, umbrellas and sunshades, spices, fur skins&mdash;lest anybody should get a chill for the want of a fur coat&mdash;toilet paper, imitation parchment, essential oils, newsprint&mdash; now, newsprint had a corresponding tax put on&mdash;other printing paper, fire bricks, gas combustion appliances, weighing machines and scales, and ice cream powder?  Do I exaggerate when I say that this bespeaks a mentality which asks the question: &ldquo;If they cannot buy bread, what about spices, or ice cream powder?&rdquo; They have also remitted the taxes on plastic materials in sheets, glue adhesives, gums and beeswax.</P>
    <P>All these are available, with the added amenity now that they can be consumed instead of bread to the strains of the gramophone, the radio or the television.  Is it not reasonable to ask why, if you were so strained for revenue, did you take the tax off motor cars, television and radio sets and umbrellas on the same day that you put 32/&ndash; on the ten stone of flour and <Col N="1297" /> 3d. to 3½d. on the loaf of bread, not to speak of 7d. on the lb. of butter? Remember, this Government decided to do the job in a handsome way and, when they were taking off the subsidy of 5d. per lb. that we paid on butter they put on another little 2d. that nobody knew about, by withdrawing the production allowance, by withdrawing the cold storage allowance and telling the creameries to let the consumers pay that, if they wanted to.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the Minister for Defence begins to feel that the justification for these proceedings must be a good deal bigger than at first appeared to him&mdash;£7,000,000, £8,000,000 and now he is grappling frantically with £11,000,000, he says.  Mark you, I sympathise with him.  I was astonished when I went home last week-end to discern the incredulous stupefaction of people at the result of this Budget and I asked myself: &ldquo;Why are they so amazed?  What did they expect of these fellows?&rdquo; I knew perfectly well what this Government would do.  But, then, I suddenly remembered that I had been listening to them for a quarter of a century and I had never known them to tell the truth about their intentions in the whole of that time.  It is for me quite sufficient assurance of what will be done to hear Fianna Fáil protest most energetically that they never intend to do it.  I forgot that, when the people expressed astonishment to me that these events had transpired, they had justification for their astonishment.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I read, but I certainly never heeded, the protestations of the then Deputy Lemass, now Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce in this Government.  Let us listen to what he said on the eve of the poll:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some Coalition leaders are threatening the country with all sorts of unpleasant things if Fianna Fáil becomes the Government&mdash;compulsory tillage, wage control, cuts in Civil Service salaries, higher food prices, and a lot more besides.</P>
    <P>A Fianna Fáil Government does not intend to do any of these things, because we do not believe in them. How definite can we make our denial <Col N="1298" /> of these stupid allegations?  They are all falsehoods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So said Deputy Lemass in a speech he delivered at Waterford on the 28th February, 1957, and that speech was reported&mdash;I need hardly tell Deputies where&mdash;in <i>Pravda</i> on March 1st, 1957. Now, picture the feelings of the poor dupe who buys <i>Pravda</i>, day in and day out, who, on the eve of the poll, read that categorical undertaking from the Deputy Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, went out and voted for that Party and a month after the election results, went in to buy ten stone of flour and found that what had cost 40/&ndash; had gone up by 32/&ndash; to 72/&ndash;.  Did the Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce get up here in sack-cloth and ashes to apologise for thus misleading the people?  Not a bit of him.  He was as gay as a thrush.  And the Minister for Defence said to-day: &ldquo;Oh, it is only 2d.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But wait until I read the Old Performer at Belmullet.  Listen to this because, when you have listened to this, you will have heard a statement in which there is no positive affirmation, good, bad or indifferent and, yet, I dare any Deputy to say that he will not go away, after listening to this proclamation, with a calm certainty that the Chief does not intend to increase the price of food.  But wait until we parse it and you will find that he does not say so.</P>
    <P>You remember the Leader of the Opposition speaking here yesterday. He spoke of the student of <i>Machiavelli</i>, but he forgot a subsequent paragraph in <i>Machiavelli</i> in which he advised Prime Ministers for all time to be careful to have the appearance of benignity, magnanimity, honesty and absolute truth, but always with a mind to be the exact reverse, if the necessity should ever arise, because it was to be borne in mind that it was given to all to hear and see us but few to know us and, therefore, it is what one appears to be that matters and not what one truly is.  Bear that in mind and then listen to this, because it is good:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Coalition parties....are urging the people not to vote for <Col N="1299" /> Fianna Fáil because there was hell around the Fianna Fáil corner.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You know the record of Fianna Fáil in the past.  You know that we have never done the things they said we would do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have never done the things they said we would do.  Now listen!:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They have...told you that you would be paying more for your bread.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark you, he does not go on to say: &ldquo;But you will not be paying more for your bread.&rdquo; But he has just told them: &ldquo;We have never done the things they said we would do.&rdquo; Now he says: &ldquo;They have also told you that you would be paying more for your bread,&rdquo; not that &ldquo;we will make you pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If you were standing in Belmullet and heard him say that, would you not believe he was telling you he did not intend doing anything to make you pay more for your bread?  Is not that what you would think?  You would be wrong.  He said that in the past they never did.  Now he said they are telling you this.  He was very careful not to give any undertaking as to their future performance.  It is a beautiful performance of the most dishonest man in the political life of any country in the known civilised world.</P>
    <P>Let me read it again:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You know the record of Fianna Fáil in the past.  You know that we have never done the things they said we would do... They have also told you that you would be paying more for your bread.  They do not say that it was as a result of a legacy in the shape of a £62,000,000 deficit in our international balance of payments and a Budget deficit of £15,000,000 from them that bread was increased before.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not at all.  This contains two falsehoods. We have not realised the skill of this yet.  It goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On that occasion, if we had cut out all the food subsidies, we would have found that necessary £15,000,000.  We did not cut them all out because we did not want the price of bread&mdash;so important an <Col N="1300" /> article of diet for the poor&mdash;to be increased. We left on several million pounds as a subsidy for bread.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Cross your heart and hope to die.  If you were standing in Belmullet and heard him make that speech on the 28th February, when the Tánaiste was making the other speech on the same day at the same hour in Waterford&mdash; and both of them were printed side by side in <i>Pravda</i> on March 1st&mdash;would you not have sworn that he had given a pledge not to increase the price of bread?  He did not and I venture to say that before this debate is over he will intervene and will read that paragraph and say: &ldquo;Move the comma from here to there and you will see I never meant that,&rdquo; and when you move the comma you will find he did not say it.  That is his genius.  He can get up in public and make an affirmation that any man in Christendom would think was crystal clear and when it is demonstrated to be at direct variance with what everybody believed, he will shed bitter tears and say that <i>Pravda</i> put the comma in the wrong place but that if the comma is moved over a couple of words it will be seen what it means.  And lo, you discover its meaning!</P>
    <P>There was not a creature in Belmullet who did not believe that was an explicit undertaking not to raise the price of bread and there is not a Deputy in this House who heard me read it who does not know that that is what it was meant to convey to the people.  I want to read, however, for the benefit of the Minister for Defence another extract.  Deputy Traynor, as he then was, now the Minister for Justice, with his eyes bound and the scales of Justice in one hand and the sword of execution in the other, an adornment to his office, had this to say. Listen, for there is significance in this. He was out on the same day as Deputy de Valera in Belmullet and Deputy Lemass in Waterford.  But Deputy Traynor, being a nice, plain, neighbourly man, went no farther than Doyle's Corner and addressed the assembled citizens of Dublin on the same night as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Oscar Traynor at a Fianna Fáil meeting at Doyle's Corner, North Circular Road, described as a <Col N="1301" />&lsquo;bloodcurdling&rsquo; story a warning by Mr. Norton that a Fianna Fáil Government would withdraw the food subsidies.  Mr. Traynor said the Coalition groups, having no further promises to make for themselves, had switched to making sinister promises on behalf of Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remember the Minister for Defence says to-day that the people well knew what Fianna Fáil were going to do, had their heels dug in and were going to support them to the death but the wise old campaigner, when he was up at Doyle's Corner, said that a blood-curdling story and a sinister promise had been made on their behalf by the Opposition.  He did not deny it.  Not at all.  He has been soldiering for the past 35 years.  He never denied it.  He said it was a bloodcurdling story and a sinister promise.  There is one thing he did not say and that is the simple truth that, &ldquo;if you vote for us this is what you will get.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Mrs. Lynch, as if to put the stamp of verisimilitude on all the doubtful allegations made by the politicians of her Party, addressed the housewives and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Fianna Fáil Government is the housewives' choice.  It must be; there is no alternative.  The housewife, the mother of a family, has been the greatest victim of Coalition bungling.  Housewives, use your intelligence, your practical experience and your sound reasoning.  Vote in strength for the Fianna Fáil candidates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They did and they are paying 72/&ndash; for the ten-stone bag of flour, 4/4 for a lb. of butter and 1/1 for a loaf of bread.</P>

I can assure him it will not.  For the individual family it will do anything but that.  It is creating for them difficulties the solution of which is almost impossible because they simply have not got the money to pay for these things.  The solution which some of them have already adopted is to forgo butter altogether and reduce their intake of bread.</P>

      <P>They believed a country was better run by professional economists than by us, the chosen representatives of the people.  You see, we never did believe that it was our duty to abrogate the obligations laid upon us when we accepted the task of government and to come to Dáil Eireann subsequently and say: &ldquo;This is what we were told to do.  We were told there was not any other way of doing it and we had to do it this way&rdquo;. The Government of which I was a member listened to economic advisers and then determined, in the light of our duty as the Government chosen by the people, what it was in the best interests of the country to do.  They did not concede that it was the policy of Mellon, Poincaré and Norman that should dominate the lives of our people.  If you remember, in France, <Col N="1304" /> America and Great Britain, adherence to that kind of advice brought in its train terrible catastrophe but those who gave that advice honestly and sincerely believed it was the only advice to give at the time they gave it.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence, simple enough, to-day said: &ldquo;Our predecessors set up a Commission to investigate the capital resources of the country and told us to take off the food subsidies.&rdquo; They did, but they did a hell of a sight more than that&mdash;but, of course, the Minister for Defence has never read the Report.  They told them to take off the food subsidies as a first instalment and, having taken them off and devoted their proceeds to capital expenditure, they advised them by increased taxation over and above that to balance the Budget or, preferably, to budget for a surplus.  They never told them to take off the food subsidies and stop there.  If he wants to shelter behind the petticoat of the Capital Investment Committee, he ought to tell the House what was the advice they gave.  Their advice was to take off the food subsidies and to budget at least for a balance, but preferably for a surplus.  After the food subsidies are taken off, they said, then take off £5,500,000 of the grant in assistance of agricultural rates.  Let the ratepayers pay that and use the proceeds thereof for some productive purposes such, I think, as subsidising the price of fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quite see that economists following a certain line of thought would feel that that was the ideal course of conduct to pursue.  However, the function of the members of an Irish Government is not to vindicate some abstract economic principle.  The functions of an Irish Government are to run this country in such a way that the maximum number of Irish people can have the best life it is possible for us to get in our own country.  That is our job and it is the job of Parliament to bear in mind in how far the advice of economists can be used to that end. Surely it is a travesty for Ministers of the Government&mdash;and the Minister for Defence was not the only one who said that; I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce said something very <Col N="1305" /> similar&mdash;to say: &ldquo;They told us to do it&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The Government should not always do what they are told.  Of course, Governments should listen with respect to the advice of their trusted advisers. However, having heard them, they should send them on their way and then take counsel one with another within the Government as to what it is best to do for the people as a whole. That is what we did and it is perfectly true.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that for the past three years the Government of which I was a member sweated blood trying to devise ways and means of carrying this country on, securing its prosperity and development, while at the same time not crushing the defenceless sections of our community.  I do not deny, and I make no apology for it, that frequently our Government took not only days but weeks to arrive at an agreed plan for submission to Oireachtas Eireann. Were we wrong to do that?  Was it anything shameful for us to take anxious counsel together after we heard our experts, in order to hammer out the right thing to do before we brought it to Parliament for enactment into law?  Would we have better served the nation if we had walked into Dáil Eireann and said: &ldquo;This is what they told us to do and, because they have told us, we must do it&rdquo;?  Is this to be the fruit of strong government?</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that Fianna Fáil now have a clear majority.  They can hang on for from four to five years and smash anything they like through this House by the force of their majority and there is no power in the land that has a right to query them.  They have got a clear majority in Dáil Eireann and, so long as they act by that authority, there is no power in this country that has a right to challenge their decisions by resistance in any form whatever.  Here is the place to argue the decisions that will be taken on behalf of the sovereign people, and, once these decisions are taken, they must be honoured and respected by all.  Are we faced with the fact that a Government vested in that absolute majority are beginning to forget that <Col N="1306" /> their primary task is to consider the happiness of our own people?  Are they going to start telling the people to like it or lump it, that once they have got the majority they will do what they damn well please?  If they do, they will do great injury to the country because they will give the colour of justification to methods which no responsible person can approve or sanction.</P>
    <P>When we are told that the people should make sacrifices as the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Defence have said, surely there should be some proportion in the kind of sacrifices that are asked.  People may ask: &ldquo;What is the difference?  Why did the inter-Party Government take a different line?&rdquo; I think they are entitled to ask that question.  &ldquo;What was the inter-Party Government struggling to achieve?  What did they achieve?&rdquo; I think the first prerequisite to economic advance in this country was the establishment of economic stability.  That is something worth achieving and we did not achieve it overnight because, during the first year we were in office, the trade unions went for, and got, a round of wage increases.</P>
    <P>The whole object was, by the use of food subsidies and any other devices we could employ, to keep the cost of living stable or as near stable as we could&mdash;to swing the unions in behind us for the purpose of securing stability. Remember, in no country in the world has any Government got away with the proposition that stability is to be one-way traffic, that there is to be stability of wages and no stability of the cost of living.  We accepted that, and neither in Great Britain, in France, in Denmark, in the United States nor in Germany has anybody maintained for a single moment that we could hope to get stability except on the basis of making it two-way traffic.</P>
    <P>I think we had secured the support of the trade unions for the proposition that we would attain the maximum stability which the Government was capable of achieving and that they, on their part, would exercise the strongest possible restraint upon their members <Col N="1307" /> so long as the cost of living was kept down, from all-round general demands for increases in wages and that from that stable situation we could engage upon an expanding programme of investment for the purpose of multiplying jobs.  I think we had achieved that, and that we were getting places on that basis.  I think this Budget has irrevocably wrecked that.  It has certainly smashed the policy for which we stood, and one of the reasons why I recoil from this Budget is that I do not believe that can be undone, and I do not know what is going to happen consequent on the reversal of the policy for which we stood.</P>
    <P>Mark you, I believed our policy was right, and I would not have sweated blood for the last two or three years for £1,550 subject to income-tax, unless I did believe it was right.  I think it is a great catastrophe for the country that that policy has been jettisoned because I think we are back now in a state of flux out of which I do not know what will come.</P>
    <P>Inflation, in our circumstances, can have two manifestations, and that is a thing that is often forgotten.  It can mean an internal price rise consequent on too much money chasing too few goods, or, so long as we have external assets available, it can manifest itself by a steep upturn in our imports of foreign goods with a consequent decline in our accumulated external assets.  We were determined to stop that; we took measures to stop the evil manifestation of inflation that we discerned in the economy 15 months ago when the balance of trade appeared to be out of control and when our imports were rising steeply. We imposed the levies to correct that and we did correct it.  It is important to dwell on the extent to which we corrected it, and it is important to dwell on how we corrected it, because while it was essential to reduce imports there was very little use in doing that if, at the same time, we could not demonstrate our capacity to expand exports.</P>
    <P>Let us see what degree of success attended our efforts.  In January, 1956, <Col N="1308" /> our exports amounted to £6.89 million; in January of this year they were £10.73 million.  In February, 1956, they were £7.62 million; £10.04 million in 1957.  In March, 1956, they were £8.47 million; £11.27 million this year.  In April, 1956, they were £7.5 million; £10.9 million this year.  Now, listen to the balance of trade and bear in mind this is not the balance of payments&mdash;&mdash;it is the balance of visible trade.  Last year, in the month of January, it was £11,000,000 against us; this year, in January, it was £4.86 million.  Last year, in February, it was £10.02 million against us; this year it was £5.18 million.  Last year, in March, it was £7.47 million against us; in March this year, £4.48 million.  Last year in April, it was £6.78 million against us; this year £2.93 million.  Bear in mind that our invisible exports fluctuate around £60,000,000 a year and taking an average of £5,000,000 a month credit for invisible exports, then, for the first four months of this year it is true to say we have a credit on our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>That was the correction in one form in the economy, but if at the same time we could not swing our people round to a savings policy which would draw out of the current pool of consumption spending a sufficient sum to prevent the recurrence of the adverse trade balance, or what would be worse, an internal price inflation, our efforts would have failed.  But did we not succeed?  The savings habit in the country seemed to be dead; we brought it to life and we found that the small savings of the people in the post office, in savings certificates and prize bonds, had begun to revive and provide the capital necessary for the Government to carry out the supplementary capital projects requisite to provide employment over and above what private enterprise could do.</P>
    <P>Tell me, where are these small savings going to come from in the household which is now paying 72/&ndash; for the sack of flour for which they previously paid 40/&ndash;; now paying 4/4 for the lb. of butter that previously cost 3/9; now paying 1/&ndash; or 1/1 for the loaf that previously cost 9d.&mdash; never mind the increased tax on <Col N="1309" /> tobacco and beer?  Where are the small savings going to come from?  If we do not get them where are we to get the money wherewith to finance the expansion in enterprise that the Government speaks of as being their prime objective?  I think you have thrown all that into the melting pot; I think you have closed up many sources of revenue which the nation most urgently requires; and I think, at the same time, you have wrecked a programme which has produced the dramatic trade results that I have referred to in the figures I have read out.</P>
    <P>However, that is not all.  I want to turn for a moment to the Deputies here representing agriculture.  I have listened with dismay and alarm to some of the things Ministers have said in the course of this debate.  They have all been guilty of utterances, the true meaning of which it is not easy to discern.  What is the Government's policy on agricultural production? What do they propose to do about milk?  The present position is that they have swept away the subsidy; they have swept away the Government responsibility for making any contribution to the maintenance of a firm price for creamery milk or butter; and they have passed that all on to the consumer with the resultant increase of 7d. per lb. in the cost of butter.</P>
    <P>We are producing far more butter in this country at the present time than we are capable of consuming.  Have Deputies forgotten that last year we produced more butter in Ireland than ever was produced before?  What does the Government propose to do in respect of the increased quantity of butter available for export at the present time?  Do Deputies know what the current price of butter is on the world market?  We are paying to our producers in this country a domestic price of approximately 420/&ndash; per cwt. for butter, if not more.  Butter is selling in the London market at from 200/&ndash; to 260/&ndash;.  What is the Government's policy in regard to the exportable surplus of butter?  What is the Government's policy in regard to the price of milk?</P>
    <P>I know what our policy was&mdash;to <Col N="1310" /> maintain a stable price in this country at a level our people could afford to pay and to continue to export the surplus on the most advantageous terms we could command.  I do not know what this Government's position is.  Remember what the consequences of our policy in regard to cattle and live stock and milk have been and remember that, without those consequences to which I am now going to refer you, this country would be in a state of acute crisis.  Do you know what the exports of cattle have been in the first four months of this year&mdash;and I do not think that the most grudging member of the Fianna Fáil Party will deny that these results are very largely the result of the inter-Party Government policy which emphasised the rehabilitation of land and the multiplication of live stock upon it?</P>
    <P>In January of this year&mdash;in the month of January alone&mdash;we exported 97,630 cattle, for which we received £5.17 million.  That compares with 39,391 in the same month last year.  In the month of February, we exported 87,260 cattle, for which we received £4.6 million, as compared with 51,512 cattle in February, 1956.  In March of this year we exported 100,250 cattle, for which we received £5.34 million, as compared with 61,892 in March, 1956.</P>
    <P>That is as far as I can go in respect of the total exports but, in the month of April, in respect of cattle shipped from our ports only and not including those that went to Northern Ireland, we shipped 49,985 cattle by sea alone as against 36,660 last year and in the first fortnight of May, we have shipped 14,231 cattle by sea from this country as compared with 10,556 last year.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it is true to say that we produced more butter last year than ever was produced before, and that in this year we will produce still more.  It is true to say that the policy for which we stood resulted in our having on the land of Ireland on 1st June, 1956, more cattle than ever were on the land of Ireland in the history of this country, at 4,534,200, and it is out of those increased numbers that those increased exports are coming now.  What is Fianna Fáil policy in regard to that?</P>
    <P>I heard with some dismay an <Col N="1311" /> announcement by the Fianna Fáil Minister, tossed off in the course of his Budget speech, and mind you, he himself has been a Minister for Agriculture, that he is providing £150,000 to convert some thousands of tons of last year's crop of wheat into animal feed.  Why?  I want to say most deliberately that there is none of the wheat delivered to the mill which could not be used with propriety in the grist for the manufacture of bread.  We had a very bad experience in the harvest of 1954.  A great deal of the wheat reached the mills in poor condition, but we reclaimed it and it was gradually filtered into the grist in 1955 without detriment to anybody.</P>
    <P>This year, we have been using a 66? home-grown grain to a 33½ foreign grain grist and that means that there will be a carry-over of between 60,000 and 80,000 tons of Irish wheat into next year, but all that wheat was of a quality that could have been used by filtering it into next year's crop as it was brought to grist without detriment to anybody.  Instead of that, we are going to pay the millers £150,000 to convert it into pollard.  If that is the policy, what are you going to do with this year's crop?  We will have from 10 to 20 per cent. more wheat this year than we had last year.  Are we going to operate a policy permanently of converting a high percentage of the annual wheat crop grown in this country into animal feed and pay the millers for doing it, because, if we are, that reaches the nadir of insanity?</P>
    <P>What does the Government intend to do in its agricultural policy?  Are we to have the prices of agricultural produce reduced, because, I want to warn the Government, and I know whereof I speak, the only consequence of doing that will be to reduce the total output from the land and you might as well face that, and I want to warn the House that if the total output of the land declines, this country will go bust. Everybody in our towns and cities and industries is living on the farmers of this country and his standard of living and his capacity to earn is ultimately entirely dependent on the land and the people who live and get their living on the land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> We have reached a stage in this country, and it is as well to face it, that our people will produce on the land when it is profitable to produce and their remedy for an unprofitable out-turn on their crop is to reduce their output.  There is only one way whereby you will get from the land the increasing output which is the absolute essential necessity of economic development of the country and that is to make that output economic, and there is only one way to do that&mdash;to see that the farmers who produce the stuff get an economic price for it.</P>
    <P>To tell you the honest truth, I think that the appropriation of £1,000,000 for market research is eyewash, pure and unadulterated eyewash.  What is vital is that the people who produce the stuff will get the price and any intention the Government have of reversing that policy will bring on us a disaster greater than any other country would face in similar circumstances. Remember that in Great Britain it does not very much matter whether the agricultural output is high or low.  It is, in fact, carried as a charge on industry, but in this country the only way in which we can carry it is to make it profitable for the producers.  Bear in mind that we have this additional problem&mdash;that in respect of our exportable surplus, if it is to be permanent it has to be produced not only at a profit to the producers but to the country as a whole.  The longer we live, the more abundantly clear it will become to all of us that the profitable end of our export trade is going to be live stock on the hoof, whether it be cattle or sheep.</P>
    <P>I hope we will be able to compete in the bacon market and the pork market in time but they have a pretty narrow margin of profit.  Unless we can produce live stock from an ever-improved grass land economy in this country and feed that live stock on grass we will not have the margin of profit which the nation must have if it is to maintain any international trade at all.  It is perfectly true, in respect of the bacon industry, that we must promote to the limit of our capacity the production of barley.  Let us face the fact&mdash;which may be an unpopular fact but it is a true <Col N="1313" /> one&mdash;that the only basis upon which we can promote the production of barley is by the production of that barley by the man who owns the pigs. The shipping of barley all over the country is never going to be profitable for the man who grows it because if it is profitable for him it will not be profitable for the man who uses it.  The man who grows coarse grains must convert them on his own holding and keep all the profits of production and conversion for himself.</P>
    <P>I want to know had the Government considered these matters at all when they started playing ducks and drakes with the price of bread, butter and milk?  Nothing is more disrupting to the economy of a country than a situation of doubt.  Perhaps I might be allowed, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to comment on one point?  Did one ever see a Government with 78 Deputies and they could not get one of them to fill the position of Minister for Agriculture?</P>

I think it is a pity that, with 78 Deputies, Fianna Fáil has no Minister for Agriculture to intervene in this Budget debate, or at least I will say this, no permanent Minister for Agriculture.  They have a Minister who has declared his intention of evacuating the Department of Agriculture as soon as he can get out of it and go back to Stephen's Green.  There is no Minister responsible at present to the House who will still be a Minister for Agriculture in a month or six weeks' time.  I think that is greatly to be deplored.

I cannot remember any representative of Fianna Fáil, who intervened in this debate, who made any statement as to those repercussions.  I do not think the Minister for Finance was very frank when dealing with the removal of the butter subsidy.  Did he honestly tell the House that over and above he proposed to pass on another twopence in the form of other allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might have fairly said that that represented <Col N="1316" /> an additional 1½d. or 2d. on the price of butter.  How many people knew that in addition to putting 5d. on the butter it was proposed to put a further 2d. on it in relief of the Exchequer?  I do not believe that even Deputy Booth did.  That is what I complain of.  If that is to be done, I believe it is a matter of sufficient consequence that the Minister should tell it to us, not <i>a la</i> Belmullet, but in language that we could understand.  I say <i>a la</i> Belmullet because Deputy de Valera, as he then was, made his famous speech about the bread subsidy at Belmullet.  There is no doubt whatever that the text is strictly true, but it was designed to deceive 99 per cent. of the people who heard it.  Does the Minister believe or does the House appreciate that the price of butter is increased, not by 5d., but by 7d.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>That is not fair.  The very substance of my complaint is that we were not told.  To tell you the honest truth, I do not think any of you particularly cared.  I think it is vital to the industry.  The more you raise the price of butter and the more you tend to restrict consumption of butter the bigger the surplus is; and <Col N="1317" /> the bigger the surplus is, the heavier the charge of marketing.  Why not say that the price of butter is in the order of 420/&ndash; per cwt.?  We can control that. The more we are forced into the open markets of the world, the more we will have to take the world price for butter, which, at the moment, is fluctuating between 200/&ndash; and 260/&ndash; per cwt.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Would it not have been better for him to tell us that the allowances would be reduced by 1d. or 1½d?  I suppose he has in mind the 1½d.  It would have helped the public and saved the industry if we had been told that.  Maybe I am wrong.  I give the Minister the chance of correcting me when replying to the debate.  However, I think the Minister meant to conceal that from the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Everybody understands that a certain unknown factor then enters in&mdash;the removal of the production and winter storage allowance.  In fact, that has been interpreted in the retail shops of the country as an additional charge of 2d.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter which, perhaps, I should raise on the Fifth Stage of the Bill, but it might be as convenient to raise it now.  When speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, the Minister referred to the arrangements which had been made by the E.S.B. to utilise turf and said that in consequence of that Bord na Móna had proceeded with the development programme which presumed the consumption of a certain amount of turf each year.  It turned out, after a close examination of the position, that the E.S.B. found they would not require all the turf they had previously given Bord na Móna the impression it would be necessary for the latter organisation to cut in order to fuel the proposed new generating stations.</P>
      <P>The reason the E.S.B. found themselves in that position was the subject of some contention not merely on this Bill but on the departmental Estimates. Because of the Minister's statement on this matter on the last occasion, I want to put my view on record so that it can be read in conjunction with the Minister's view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the E.S.B. in 1955 was that they required a certain sum of money in order to develop their programme, the programme being contained in the White Paper of 1953. At the direction of the Government, the Minister for Finance and I saw the directors of the E.S.B.  At that meeting, their whole programme was discussed, their financial requirements were ascertained and it then transpired, in the course of question and answer between the Ministers and the directors of the board, that in fact the board were planning for a plant development and plant utilisation scheme which, in fact, they would not be able <Col N="1322" /> to use if they adhered to the White Paper programme.</P>
    <P>It was as a result of that statement by the directors and technicians of the board that the Minister for Finance and I said to the board: &ldquo;Look here, if you believe the programme set out in the White Paper is excessive in so far as our national requirements are concerned, if you believe it will give you surplus plant which you cannot use, we suggest that you go back and examine the matter realistically, not in the light of the position in 1953 but of the realities and actualities of 1955&rdquo;.  Having gone back and examined the whole matter, the E.S.B. came back to the Department and said: &ldquo;Here is our estimate as to when we will require the particular plant for which we have got notional provision under the White Paper programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The revised programme of the E.S.B. showed clearly that they could not utilise in the prescribed period the plant for which provision was made in the White Paper.  We said to them then: &ldquo;Why did you embark upon a plant development programme in excess of what you can use?&rdquo; The E.S.B. directors told us they felt themselves committed to the programme set out in the White Paper and did not feel free to depart from it.</P>
    <P>I said to the directors: &ldquo;You have got responsibility as the national electricity generating authority.  It was your responsibility to tell the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the programme envisaged in the White Paper would lead you into a condition of over-planting.&rdquo; The whole defence of the E.S.B. for continuing to embark on the White Paper programme was that they felt themselves committed to it, that the White Paper was not their programme, but one put over on them, that the programme was based on the assumption that the demand for electricity would double itself in every five-year period.</P>
    <P>That was a reasonable enough estimate if you took 1953 when, because of the hunger for fuel during the emergency and post-emergency periods, it was not possible for people to use <Col N="1323" /> electrical equipment as they were able to utilise it when fuel became available. On the figures for 1953, it could have been said, perhaps, that the demand for electricity in that year would double itself in five to five and a half years.  That estimate assumed a substantial and continuing percentage increase in the demand.  As it happened, of course, in 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, the demand did not maintain itself at the 1953 level.  It did not maintain itself here or in any other country in Europe because once you got over the upsurge in the consumption of electricity following the war and acute post-war period, the demand petered off so that our increased demand last year was, I think, in the region of 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>As O.E.E.C. said, that was the average increased demand throughout Western Europe.  As it is increasing only at the rate of 9 per cent. per annum, the demand will not double itself in five years, but in 11 to 12 years, and any planting programme based on the assumption, as the White Paper programme of 1953 was based, that the demand would double itself in five years was completely unrealistic in the light of subsequent developments.  It is because of that that we asked the E.S.B. to review their programme.</P>
    <P>Their reviewed programme showed that the board did not need the stations to which they were committed in the White Paper.  In fact, the board told me, and I put it on record in the Department, that, with the plant now available and in sight, they would have a surplus of electricity generating capacity until 1961 or 1962, and that is allowing them a surplus generating capacity, not in theory but in fact, of about 30 per cent. between now and that year.  Any revision that took place of the board's programme occurred because the board would be committed to an extravagant programme which in fact was not necessary and at a time when money was difficult to get not only here but elsewhere in Western Europe.  Consequently, the correct thing to do is to retard development to our actual needs.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true, as the Minister <Col N="1324" /> said, that at one stage, when I sought to get the E.S.B. to schedule one of the Offaly bogs&mdash;Derrygreena&mdash;so as to enable Board na Móna to erect a turf-briquetting plant there, the E.S.B. said this was required for, I think, a 100 megawatt plant and they did not want to give it up.  Bord na Móna, however, wanted to get it, because the Derrygreena bog was one capable of producing briquettes and every bog cannot produce briquettes.  The E.S.B., however, said they would have to keep the Derrygreena bog.  Subsequently, when they revised their programme they did not intend to provide for the full utilisation of the Derrygreena bog and their proposals&mdash;as the Minister can ascertain from the Department&mdash; involved a postponement of the utilisation of the capacity of both Boora and Derrygreena.  They said: &ldquo;In any case, if you take Derrygreena from us, we will have to put up either a coal or an oil-fired station at a later date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I did not want to see a coal or an oil-fired station erected, if we could manage to keep the E.S.B. down to a programme of utilising our turf deposits. Reluctantly, I had to allow the E.S.B., on the strength of its technical representations, to keep the Derrygreena bog.  That was before the E.S.B. had revised their programme. When they came to revise their programme, they then said that the revised programme did not provide for the fullest utilisation of the Boora and Derrygreena bogs.  Consequently, we gave Bord na Móna rights to operate turf-briquetting plants on those two bogs and Bord na Móna were told to proceed with the erection of turfbriquetting plants on both Boora and Derrygreena.</P>
    <P>The E.S.B. plea, then, that it needed the full production capacity of both bogs was still based on their belief that they were committed to the White Paper programme.  When the shackles of the White Paper programme were taken off, they said: &ldquo;We do not need the two bogs at the moment, we cannot utilise them fully at the moment&rdquo;, and they even dropped the suggestion that the giving of any portion of either Boora or Derrygreena to Bord na Móna would involve the erection of a <Col N="1325" /> coal or an oil plant in lieu of either the Derrygreena or Boora bogs.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts.  Papers in the Department of Industry and Commerce will prove those to be the facts.  The Minister for Finance will, I have no doubt, testify&mdash;the members of the Government to whom the matter was reported can testify&mdash;that the E.S.B. programme as set out in the White Paper was a programme which gave them a capacity which they could not use and that they have to-day generating capacity sufficient to meet all their requirements and provide for a surplus up to 1961-62.  As I say, when the Minister makes the point that the E.S.B. wanted to erect an oil or coal station in lieu of the bog station, when portion of the bog was given to Bord na Móna, all that was part of their belief that they were committed to the White Paper. More than once I said to the directors of the E.S.B. that the responsibility was on them to report to the Department if they felt they were committed to a programme of production which they could not utilise and they were remonstrated with for not having brought those facts to notice.</P>
    <P>Of course, proof that all that was right, that the revision of the programme was right, is to be found in the fact that nobody proposes now to alter the E.S.B. programme for the next five years, because the E.S.B. programme for the next five years is such as to meet our ascertainable demands.  Now, if the present programme meets our demands then the earlier programme would have been excessive.  I am sorry it was excessive, I am sorry the circumstances necessitated a revision of the earlier programme, but it would have been the grossest waste and inefficiency not to have revised the programme, once the demand for electricity did not stand up to the 1953 anticipation&mdash;and that anticipation was, I think, an overoptimistic one.  It was pitched too high and to have continued to try to implement it in circumstances in which money was not easy to get would, I think, have been a most wasteful and unjustifiable course of action.</P>
    <P>Because we wanted to avoid the waste, to avoid having surplus plant <Col N="1326" /> which we could not use, the board were asked to revise the programme to which they felt committed in the White Paper.  The revision of that programme represents a realistic approach to the whole problem of our electricity requirements and I presume &mdash;not having heard anything to the contrary from any member of the Government Front Bench&mdash;that the Government is satisfied now that the present E.S.B. programme is one which takes care of the national electricity requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I shall accept your ruling on that and, having made the point, might I make this inquiry from the Minister?  If the situation I have described briefly to him is due to shortage of money and if this Money Resolution is being given a quick run through the House, will he in the meantime give a direction to Bord na Móna to see that the labour content in that particular area is not reduced as a result of such shortage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a great deal of discussion in this House over the last few months on the question as to who was responsible for the change in plans for electricity expansion in recent times.  In spite of the long speeches which have been made by Deputies of different Parties, I am still no clearer as to who should accept final responsibility for this change of programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that in the 1953 plan it was estimated that the demand would double itself in five years, or a little over that; and that it was then <Col N="1327" /> discovered that the hope or the estimate was too optimistic altogether. As a result of this hope being found too optimistic, instructions were issued to the E.S.B. to make a further revision and, I presume, reduce their programme accordingly.  To bolster up that decision, we are told that demand in Europe was at a certain level for electricity purposes and that this corresponded generally with the figure in Ireland, namely, that the increase last year was only 9 per cent. and that this was somewhat similar to that obtaining in general all over Europe.</P>
    <P>Now, people might get the impression from that, that we are keeping in step, in our expansion in the use of electricity, with European countries. Those people who utilise that excuse, that we are at a similar rate of development now as European countries, omit the fact that most of those European countries were using electricity long before we were.  Most of those countries are highly industrialised and have been using electricity and, consequently, the percentage increase in demand for electricity in those countries could not be anything as great as we should expect it to be here for an undeveloped country like Ireland, which is only in its infancy in industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>It is a very significant feature of our economy at the moment that the demand for electricity is not what we hoped it would be.  It is to my mind the signal of danger in so far as industrial expansion is concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to give money to such undertakings, whether it is the E.S.B. or Bord na Móna, in future this House will have to know whether the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna have dovetailed their plans so that both bodies will know what is expected of them.  It would appear from the information at our disposal that the E.S.B. did not consult Bord na Móna and that Bord na Móna were to be <Col N="1328" /> allowed to go ahead with their plans for development without receiving the necessary information on the reductions likely to take place in the E.S.B. programme.</P>
      <P>If that situation is true, there is something lacking in the direction end and, with all due respect, I think the time is ripe for this Minister to ensure that the closest possible co-operation is made to obtain between these two very important State bodies.  In any future development that takes place through both of these bodies&mdash;I believe the Minister will agree with me in this &mdash;priority must be given to the utilisation of our own resources.</P>

      <P>I understood the former Minister for Industry and Commerce had referred here to the fact that the E.S.B. told him that if they did not get Derrygreena Bog they would be forced to erect an oil-burning or a coal-burning station.  I think I am entitled to reply to that aspect of the argument put forward by the previous Minister.  I say under no circumstances should any such argument from the E.S.B. be even listened to because in the programmes of the past &mdash;in the 1949 programme to begin with &mdash;priority was given by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to oil-burning and coal-burning stations over the native turf-burning stations. I want to make sure that, if my vote goes here to-day to help increase the electricity supply, it is not for the purpose of helping to erect generating stations fired by imported fuel.</P>
      <P>I would prefer at this stage, if there is to be this cut-back, small and all as it may be, on the use of electricity that, in spite of that cut-back, we should go ahead with a programme of erecting generating stations that will use peat and, if necessary, cut down the consumption or the utilisation of the stations already built.</P>

      <P>I shall not elaborate on that.  The question of the expansion <Col N="1329" /> of the briquette industry has been mentioned here.  I welcome the fact that money is to be expended on erecting briquette factories and increasing the output.  A tribute was paid here recently to a particular company for its part in subscribing funds towards this very desirable expansion. I would urge on the Minister to see that no time is lost in getting the necessary construction work done and getting those plans into operation. Every possible effort should be made in that regard for two reasons, first, the actual increase that will be given in employment on construction and, secondly, the importance that will be attached to the fact that it will mean a reduction in our import of foreign fuel.</P>
      <P>As to the use of the briquettes, there is a tremendous demand for them at the present time.  It has been growing for years past and it is a terrible criticism of ourselves as a Parliament that we had to wait to make a decision on this question of briquette expansion until we found that the price of coal was so dear.  I challenge contradiction here when I say that there would have been no decision to expand the briquette output perhaps for years to come were it not for the increase that took place in the price of imported coal.  Perhaps it would be a good thing if coal went up a little bit more so that we could return to the time when we would see the best of our bogs that were closed down reopened for the production of the semiautomatic turf.  I would welcome that day, too.</P>

      <P>Since I resumed office as Minister for Industry and Commerce I have been so preoccupied with the problems of to-day and tomorrow that I have not had time for the exercise of going back over the files of the Department either for the purpose of historical research or to find ammunition with which to reopen the arguments which Deputy Norton and I had when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am more concerned with repairing the position which developed in the past two years rather than to investigate why it happened or <Col N="1330" /> if it could have been prevented.  So far as I am concerned Deputy Norton can slap himself on the back, on the head or anywhere else he likes, because I believe that by the time it again becomes necessary for all of us to consider how we can best present our respective merits to the electorate, all these things will have been forgotton.</P>
      <P>When speaking here on the Second Reading of the Bill I did not find fault with the E.S.B. for revising their generating programme in the light of the circumstances that had arisen.  I think the board were quite right in 1954 in deciding to prepare their programme upon the basis of their experience to that date.  I believe if I had come to the Dáil in 1954 with a Bill which revealed that the board's new generating programme did not provide for an increase in capacity paralleling the increase in demand, as it had been experienced up to then, Deputies would have found serious fault with the programme, and rightly so.  But when by 1956 it had become clear that the growth in the demand for current was falling off, then the position had to be reviewed and the programme revised in accordance therewith.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton was wrong in his statement that I did not indicate an intention of re-examining the programme. In fact, I tried to make it clear that I had that intention.  Even if the growth in the demand for electric power experienced in 1953 and the years before that was higher than it has since become, I do not think that is a reason why we should assume that the 1956 experience is a reliable guide for the future.  I hope it will not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure every Deputy in the House, including Deputy Norton, will join with me in expressing the hope that expansion in industrial activity and improvement in social conditions in the country will involve the stepping up of the generating programme to meet a growing demand for power and the subsequent extension of the board's programme for installing new generating capacity.  It seems to me that there is another reason for having a second look at the board's present programme.  It is true that programme provides for the installation <Col N="1331" /> of new generating capacity at the appropriate time to meet the growth in demand, if the growth in demand is at the 1956 rate.  In our present circumstances I think it is worth while examining whether it would not be justifiable, even on a narrow financial basis, to proceed with the construction of stations to use milled peat in advance of the time at which new stations would be needed in the programme to meet the demand for current even if it involved working to less than full capacity, or putting temporarily out of commission existing stations using imported fuel oil.  I understand the board has had a most favourable experience in the use of milled peat last year.  It was the first year in which milled peat was used on a full scale for the generation of power and the indications are that fuel costs, per unit of energy generated with milled peat, were not very much more than half the present cost of using oil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say.  All I can say is that all the indications are that it would be cheaper to generate electricity by using milled peat than by using oil.  It may be possible for the E.S.B., assuming that the price of oil continues at its present level, to get some milled peat stations into their programme earlier even though it meant carrying some interest on <Col N="1332" /> capital invested in other power stations which might for a time not be in use. I am not attempting to intimate to the Dáil that any decision on that point has been reached, but I shall examine it, and I hope it will be found possible to apply that idea to the revision of the programme.  It would have the further substantial advantage of getting employment increased on those bogs, the early development of which would be essential in any such revision of the programme.</P>
      <P>I think there is some point in the argument advanced by Deputy McQuillan that the figures produced by European countries relating to their experience in the growth of demand for power are not necessarily a reliable guide for us.  They are some guide, but we know we are at a stage in the development of the use of electric power which would make possible a more rapid expansion in the growth of demand than might be realised in some other country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay asked a question&mdash;I am sorry he is not here for the answer &mdash;about the Bangor-Erris bog.  The power station for Bangor-Erris has been dropped from the programme, I mean the programme that is to be completed for 1961.  If that idea I have suggested could lead to the possibility of bringing that station back into the programme, with a view to its completion and its being brought into operation before 1961 then, of course, work on the bog development operations could be resumed very quickly.  In the meantime there is no necessity for bog development work there for power purposes, because the utilisation of the bog for such purposes, as matters now stand, will not arise for some years.  There is at present no fixed date relating to the Bangor-Erris power station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The present programme extends to 1960 and not beyond that.  The preparation of the post-1960 programme will, however, want to start soon.  That is a fact which Deputy McQuillan should <Col N="1333" /> keep in mind in relation to his suggestion that there was some lack of coordination between Bord na Móna and the E.S.B.  I do not think there was. Normally it takes a period of three years from the time a decision is made to erect a new power station of any reasonable size to the getting of that station into commission.  If that station is going to utilise turf, then Bord na Móna must start its development operations some two years before even the construction of the station is begun.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna was proceeding in accordance with the programme prepared in 1954 and had to be in fullscale work on its development activities by 1955-56.  When that programme was revised and amended it was, of course, a considerable upset to Bord na Móna to have to adjust their plans to the new E.S.B. programme. That does not imply any failure on the part of the E.S.B. to notify Bord na Móna of the new situation, and indeed it was, as Deputy McQuillan says, rather fortunate that at that stage the extension of briquette manufacturing became an economic possibility.  It is, of course, quite true that the decision to extend the manufacture of briquettes only became possible when the price of coal had passed the point at which it was to be assumed that people would prefer to buy briquettes at the price at which they could be produced, than the coal at the price ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned before, I had in my previous period of office examined the possibility of increasing briquette production and was advised by Bord na Móna that at the price at which briquettes could be produced they would not be saleable in competition with coal, and we could have had quite a problem on our hands if we had attempted it.  But, as the price of coal kept going up, a stage was reached when Bord na Móna came to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and said: &ldquo;It is now possible to extend our briquette production and we would like to get ahead with doing so. We have a bog which is in process of development for the E.S.B. and which we are proposing should be turned <Col N="1334" /> over to briquette production.&rdquo; The E.S.B. would not part with the particular station then contemplated for that bog and they told the then Minister for Industry and Commerce that, if they had to drop that station, they would have to put up another oil-burning station instead, and the matter was then allowed to stand over.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, as Minister at the time, told Bord na Móna they could not have the bog and he could not approve of their going ahead with plans for putting a briquetting factory on it because the E.S.B. required that station.  In 1956, when the E.S.B. programme was cut down, the position was, of course, different.  It was then considered more advisable to put up two smaller briquetting plants rather than the one large plant the board had originally proposed.  These two plants are being established upon bogs which are being developed for E.S.B. purposes but the full output of which will not be required in the generating stations located near them because the capacity of these stations has been reduced under the programme revision.</P>
    <P>I share with Deputy McQuillan and all other Deputies the desire to see these plans for the completion of the briquetting factories going ahead as rapidly as possible.  This is a very desirable type of development and, so far as I am concerned, I shall give every encouragement to Bord na Móna to get ahead with them.  They certainly are not being impeded in that regard by lack of money, and one of the purposes of this Bill is to enable to be brought into operation arrangements which they have made to procure the necessary funds with which to start.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a machinery Bill, and I ask Deputies not to be misled in any way by the rather elaborate provisions set out.  The main purpose of the Bill is to make some <Col N="1337" /> comparatively minor changes in the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act, 1932, but it was felt that it was preferable to repeal that Act and re-enact it with these changes rather than have people, who might have to refer to it, having to take note of two Acts, one amending the other.</P>
      <P>I will indicate what the changes are. One of the reasons why the Bill is appearing at this time, rather than some other time, is that it is required in order to continue in permanent legislation the power which is now exercisable under the Supplies and Services Act to suspend the operation of customs duties.  It may be asked why customs duty should be kept in a state of suspension, but there is a reason for that.  Quite a number, if not the great majority, of customs duties were suspended during the war and were brought back into operation after the war as circumstances appeared to require; but there are still a number which have not yet been brought back into operation.</P>
      <P>The manufacturers, for whose benefit these duties were imposed, have been able to carry on and develop their businesses without the aid of the duties, but they have said that the knowledge that the duties are there and can be brought into operation is of great assistance to them and, even if they are not asking to have them brought back into force now, they are at the same time not desirous of seeing them repealed altogether.  At any rate, so long as it is considered desirable to keep customs duties of that kind in suspension, it is necessary to have power to do it.  That power will lapse, however, when the Supplies and Services Act ceases to operate at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another change being made, which I think the House will welcome because it has been the subject of discussion here and in the Seanad on previous occasions.  Under the existing law an Order made by the Government imposing a duty of customs has to be confirmed by legislation within a period of eight months.  That seemed a quite reasonable period to allow when the original Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act was being framed <Col N="1338" /> but, in practice, it works out to the disadvantage of due consideration of customs duties by the Legislature. The imposition or amendment of customs duties is a continuing process and at a stage in each year, generally approaching the end of a parliamentary session, it is discovered in the Department of Industry and Commerce that a duty will be due to lapse if it is not confirmed by legislation, some time during the Recess and, therefore, a Bill is hastily produced and rushed into the Dáil to confirm all the duties which are outstanding at the time.</P>
    <P>It has usually been difficult to fit such a Bill into the parliamentary programme and there have been frequent complaints expressed here and in the other House that, because of this need for urgency to prevent the lapsing of a duty under the provisions of the Act, adequate time is not available for its consideration.  The proposal here is that duties and Orders in any year will be confirmed in the next calendar year.  The idea is that there will be one Bill produced each year for the consideration of the Dáil&mdash;a Bill to confirm all the Orders made under the Act in the previous year.  That will enable that piece of legislation to be fitted normally to the legislative programme and there will, therefore, be no element of urgency when it comes before the Dáil for consideration.</P>
    <P>There is another change being made which is also of some importance, although it appears to be a minor matter. The Act gives power to the Government to revoke an Order made under the Act but a number of the customs duties in force were imposed under Finance Acts.  Before the Act of 1932 was passed, all customs duties were imposed in Finance Acts.  By an oversight, power to revoke a customs duty imposed by a Finance Act was not taken in the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act and although the Government has power by Order to revoke customs duties imposed under the Imposition of Duties Act it has not got power to revoke duties imposed by a Finance Act.</P>
    <P>That position is being rectified in this Bill.  These are the only changes, <Col N="1339" /> except the change of name.  The Act of 1932 is called the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act.  The new Act will be known as the Imposition of Duties Act which in our circumstances is more appropriate.</P>

This Bill puts the matter on a much more regular and normal basis from that point of view.  The revocation provision in this Bill is highly desirable because, due to the omission of that power in previous Bills, there was no authority to deal with revocations no matter how desirable they might be.  I think that, on the whole, this tidies up our customs imposition of duties legislation and it has my warm support.</P>

      <P>May I make two submissions? In our present circumstances, is it desirable to maintain this system of suspension of duties with the possibility of reimposition without any reference to Parliament?  It does not matter what Government is in office the imposition of a duty on a particular commodity can be a matter of great consequence.  It is always a check on the administration that if they change something like that they have to come to Parliament and in 999 cases out of 1,000 the thing passes through automatically but the fact that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the annual <Col N="1340" /> thing?  However, that removes that. The only other thing that occurs to me is whether it is desirable to invest the Government with powers to suspend or revoke duties which have been imposed by statute.  I see the convenience of doing it but I think the principle is bad.  In 1932 the Government of that day sought all those extraordinary powers to fight the economic war.</P>

      <P>Then, during wartime it was necessary to have a number of emergency powers in order to enable the administration to be carried on in time of emergency.  I will not press this matter further than to say that I demur to the principle generally of investing the administration, whatever it may be, with the power to revoke statute law by Order.  I see the convenience of it.  I stand for the preservation of a principle.  The Minister would have been justified in going to the trouble of repealing all the statutory duties, if necessary, and reenacting them under this statute rather than introduce in peacetime a precedent for seeking authority from the Oireachtas to permit the administration to revoke a statute by Order. We are all agreed that we should get rid of the Emergency Powers Act and we have all been busy for the past six or seven years, both administrations, in rounding up all the Orders that were in existence in our several Departments, putting them in here and enacting them into permanent legislation on the grounds that legislation by Order was not desirable in times of normalcy.

      <P>Finance duties are in the same position as duties imposed <Col N="1341" /> by Government Order.  While I do not mind being called a purist, I should like to say that the origin of the 1932 Act was not entirely due to the economic war.  The Government that came into office early in March or February of that year were committed to a protectionist programme.  I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, was told that any protection I wanted to bring into operation that year had to be done in the Finance Act in May. I spent two or three frantic months, along with the office staff, drafting out the definitions of the various things that were to be made subject to protective duty of some kind or another. In the Schedule, there are pages and pages of the duties that came into operation for the first time.  I made as many mistakes in regard to definitions and in other respects as the previous Government made last year in preparing their Special Levies Order.</P>
      <P>I was appalled by what I was told, that if mistakes had been made, it was too bad, as they could not be remedied until the Finance Act of 1933.  The fact that we needed power to propose new duties continuously during the year led to the introduction of the original Act and the fact that that Act has been kept in operation ever since is a clear indication that it is a useful piece of machinery.  We just could not get back to the procedure of dealing with customs duties or amendments of customs duties once a year in the Finance Act.  I think it would be undesirable if importers and others felt that the Government was powerless to deal with matters of that kind until the following May.  In that case there would be far more frequent attempts to complicate our industrial problem by abnormal imports but that cannot arise now.  It is the knowledge that the Government can act quickly now which is the main deterrent to attempts to get round definitions.</P>

      <P>When we adjourned we were discussing the impact of the Budget on agriculture.  I was asking the Minister for Finance why he made provision for £150,000 to convert a proportion of the wheat crop into animal feed.  As I understand him, he gave me two separate reasons: (1)  because we had too much wheat and (2) because the 30,000 tons of wheat he proposed to convert into animal feed were bad.</P>

      <P>I think that what happened is that this is wheat which the millers do not want to mill.  They made <Col N="1343" /> the case very strongly to me&mdash;and I saw their point&mdash;that they should not be asked to mill sprouted wheat.  I pressed the view on them that they should, but I said I recognised that if any undue proportion of sprouted wheat was pressed into the grist it would put an unreasonable handicap on them.  I said: &ldquo;We are quite prepared to see that you get a sufficiency of grade A wheat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They got 50 per cent. from September until about October. Then we sent for them again because at that time we did not know what the wheat crop would be like as it came in. The general undertaking was: &ldquo;Whatever it is like, we will see that you get enough Grade A. wheat.&rdquo; When the crop was in and we knew the position we sent for the millers and said: &ldquo;It is not reasonable to look for 50 per cent. with this crop. Try 66?rds.&rdquo; I said to them: &ldquo;I hope you will be able to raise it to 70 but we are going to lean backwards in implementing our undertaking to you that you will have a fair deal inasmuch as you did your duty in taking in the crop.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Some of the millers&mdash;I think quite <i>bona fide</i>&mdash;made the case that they could not mill sprouted wheat.  We suggested: &ldquo;You can.  Try it with 66?rds.&rdquo; Some millers said: &ldquo;That is quite impossible.&rdquo; However, by experience, they discovered that it was not impossible.  Then the point was made to me: &ldquo;That will leave us with a carry over of 20,000 or 30,000 tons.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;It may be even larger but there is no difficulty about filtering that into the grist next year&rdquo;.</P>

It is quite possible to carry forward that wheat and filter it into the incoming wheat next year with such proportion of Manitobas as may be requisite to produce baker's flour.</P>
      <P>I warn the Minister that he is walking straight into a very awkward situation if he once concedes that wheat which has sprouted is unfit for conversion into flour.  He does not realise the land-mine on which he is putting his foot.  The Minister thinks that by &ldquo;sprouted wheat&rdquo; millers mean wheat with visible sprouts upon it.

The next step will be that the millers will explain to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that sprouted wheat does not mean wheat with the sprout on it. They will explain that the maltose content of wheat rises above a certain level before it makes a sprout and that therefore wheat with a maltose content above a certain basic figure is technically <Col N="1346" /> sprouted wheat and must therefore be rejected under the same decision as has apparently been taken this year.</P>
      <P>I want to say most emphatically there is no wheat in storage in this country at the present moment, dry, from last year's crop which is unfit for conversion into flour.  I am not saying that by guessing: I am saying it from certain knowledge, and I am warning the House to watch its step in regard to this matter.  If it is ever conceded that the contention is true on this occasion, it will be widely expanded.

      <P>I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce is right in that it would be foolish to press for a higher percentage than 66?.  He might go to 70, but I would not press it.  I think he would be wrong to force them to use grist higher than 70/30 in this year, but there is no reason whatever for converting the carry-over into animal feed.  That ought to be filtered into the grist next year and the full economic price recovered for it.  It is wrong to charge up to the taxpayers of this country £150,000 for the purpose of enabling that stuff to be converted into feed.  If that principle is once admitted, it will be brought up against the Minister year after year by men who quite honestly believe that they ought to be allowed to have 50 per cent. Manitoba and 50 per cent. native wheat in any grist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think they are wrong, but they honestly believe that, and it is their desire to turn out a first-class product that makes them press that view.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has been out now for an hour and a quarter, having tea, and when he was going out, I was expressing some surprise at the method he employed for informing us that the present Government was going to put on butter not only the 5d. consequent on the withdrawal of the subsidy but something between 1d. and 2d. in additional levy.  He said: &ldquo;I stated that in my Budget speech,&rdquo; and I queried that.  I did not have his Budget speech before me when I was speaking and I said that I did not think any Deputy in the Minister's own Party understood that.  He said that he had stated it most explicitly, but here is what he said, and I quote from Volume 161, No. 8, column 947:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As from to-morrow, 9th May, payment of subsidy to reduce the price of butter to the consumer will cease.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is quite clear: that is the 5d. a lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Control over wholesale and retail prices of butter will be removed. The price to creameries for butter will, however, be supported by the Butter Marketing Committee at a level sufficient to continue the existing price position for milk supplied to creameries and to meet the cost of cold-storing butter for winter requirements.  The appropriate subsidy paid on butter not yet sold to consumers will be recovered, as far as possible, by a levy on existing stocks.  On that account, it <Col N="1349" /> may be expected that the retail price of butter will shortly reflect the withdrawal of the subsidy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark those words: &ldquo;On that account, it may be expected that the retail price of creamery butter will shortly reflect the withdrawal of the subsidy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is there a Deputy who would interpret that as meaning that the price of butter will go up by 7d. a lb.?  In the paragraph dealing with this arrangement, the Minister ends with the words: &ldquo;On that account it may be expected that the retail price of butter will shortly reflect the withdrawal of the subsidy&rdquo;.  Does that not amount to saying, to any man who was listening, to a declaration that the Minister is in fact taking steps which will result in the price of butter going up by the amount of the subsidy, to wit, 5d. a lb.?  It is only when the butter starts being delivered from the creameries to the shops that it transpires that not only has the subsidy been removed, but the production allowance and the cold-storage allowance have been added to the price and the price control removed, with the result that there is an additional impost of 2d. per lb., though the Minister for Finance now says that he thinks 1½d. would be enough.</P>
    <P>We are all conscious of what that means to the consumer, but was there a single member of the Fianna Fáil Party who knew that that additional impost was to be put on butter at the expense of the consumer?</P>

I want to ask the Minister for Finance, now that he is here, does <Col N="1350" /> he think the paragraph in which he announced this did fairly inform the House of his intention, not only to withdraw the subsidy, but to add something between 1d. and 2d. to the charge to be levied on the consumer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not got a copy of the Minister's speech then and I am asking the Minister now if he thinks it was fair to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The appropriate subsidy paid on butter not yet sold to consumers will be recovered, as far as possible, by a levy on existing stocks.  On that account, it may be expected that the retail price of creamery butter will shortly reflect the withdrawal of the subsidy?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Was that not a suggestion that the impact of the Minister's proposals would simply be that prices would go up by the amount of the subsidy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before, I made an hour's speech.  If I had to weigh every word, as the Deputy wants, I would have taken months to prepare the speech.  Everything was included in the subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought the subsidy was generally deemed to be the 5d. subsidy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the Deputy's opinion but the subsidy was there, paid by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly clear. That is the Minister's version.  The House has heard my version.  Which does the House think was the disingenuous <Col N="1351" /> way of approaching them, to communicate that information to them?  Certainly, no newspaper in Ireland, no member of Dáil Eireann, no consumer in Ireland knew until the butter started being delivered that the price was going up by 6½d. or 7d. a lb. All believed, when the Minister sat down, that this referred to 5d.  But, what I am concerned about is this&mdash; there is nothing in the Minister's speech about what is going to happen, now that all subsidisation of the milk and butter industry is withdrawn and all control removed.  There is nothing in the Minister's speech as to what is to become of the surplus.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is going to be in the order of 4/3d or 4/4d.  I reckon that that will result in reduced consumption of butter on the domestic market. There is a clear undertaking here that whatever surplus over and above the domestic market there may be will be exported by the Butter Marketing Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only asking a question.  I can find no provision left in the Estimates, after the Minister's speech, to meet the charge that may come in course of payment if there are exports of surplus butter by the Butter Marketing Committee and where is that going to be provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But, after the Minister's speech and his announcement of his intention to withdraw all subsidies here mentioned, it does not seem to me to leave anything in these Estimates to provide for the contingency of the Butter Marketing Committee having to export surplus butter.  Who is going to pay for the export of surplus butter, if a surplus transpires? I reckon that it will cost about £10 a cwt. to export butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, no&mdash;nothing like it.  We only started exporting butter about January and only the exports for January-March came into that account and in this year, prior to the Budget, in the month of April, the Minister had to export certain butter which will probably be paid for out of the Vote on Account.  It is quite simple.  The Minister can simply say to me now that for any butter the <Col N="1353" /> Butter Marketing Committee have to export the loss will be met by the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  These are two interesting facts that we have extracted: first, that we have too much wheat; and, secondly, that not 5d. a lb. but between 6½d. and 7d. is going on the price of butter, but for the reassurance of the industry, the Minister undertakes to subsidise the export of any surplus that may arise at the price level at present obtaining on the domestic market.</P>
      <P>I want to revert for a moment to the speech of the Minister for Defence.  He wound up by saying: &ldquo;We did not know the ravages wrought by the previous Government.&rdquo; I think I am entitled to ask, what are these ravages?  The total agricultural production of this country increased by over 32 per cent. from 1947 to 1955.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the situation obtaining at the latest date for which we can get the total gross agricultural production, which is the year 1955.  The figure for 1956 has not yet been published by the Central Statistic Office. I have no doubt that it will show a further improvement on what we already know.  It represents an increase of 32 per cent. in the gross production of the agricultural industry in this country, provided you take into account the changes in the numbers of stock on the land.  I have read out for the House the highest figures over recorded in the history of this country for exports of cattle from Ireland in January, February and March of this year, with the trend, so far as we have the figures, appearing to be in the right direction for the months of April and May as well.  We have more cattle on the land of Ireland at the present time than we ever had before in the history of the country.</P>

      <P>Question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely give the figures as published by the Central Statistics Office.  According to those figures, more cattle were reared in 1955 than we ever had, and more sheep, I believe, than we ever had before in our history.  We have twice as many pigs as we had in 1947 and the numbers are going up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not casting any reflections on anyone.  All I am saying to the Minister for Defence is that if these are evidence of ravage, then ravage has a meaning which I never attributed to it before.  We had the biggest wheat crop in terms of yield last year than we ever had and we got as much beet from 340,000 acres last year as we got from 620,000 acres in 1948.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking in terms of abbis or anything else, but I am asking: is it evidence of ravage that we got more wheat than we ever got in any harvest before and from one-half the acreage of land?  Nothing approaching that quantity was produced in Ireland before.  We grew more barley in Ireland last year than at any time since it was first introduced into the country.  Is that evidence of ravage?  On 1st April this year, we had 1,300,000 acres of land rehabilitated, or in the process of rehabilitation, under the land rehabilitation process.</P>

We have carried rural <Col N="1356" /> electrification into almost every area in rural Ireland.  Let us look at the record.  I am looking at what we got for our money and which I am not sorry to have got.  I think it represented good value for all that was spent.  We have also built sufficient hospitals to accommodate every person who requires hospital accommodation at present.  We have provided sanatoria which are adequate for every human creature who may require sanatorium treatment within 48 hours of his medical adviser prescribing it for him.  We have carried the telephone service to every rural post office in Ireland so that there is no farmer in rural Ireland who has not got that amenity within his reach.  Mind you, it has cost us £100,000,000 to provide the houses.  It has cost us £12,000,000 to provide the telephone development and £34,000,000 to carry electricity to rural Ireland.  We have spent £7,000,000 on bogs and as much more on purchasing a fleet of ships to sail the seas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They spent it.  I do not know that we have any reason to regret any of that expenditure. When we begin counting up our assets, I think we should remember that we have all that property now.  We should remember that this country is that much better off that we have it. We also have the extra stocks on the land and extra fertility which we have been putting into the land in the shape of lime and fertilisers that we had not got some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us suspend for a moment the eternal wailing and moaning with which Fianna Fáil seek to justify their present policy.  I know that economists can say with conviction that we are in a state of acute crisis.  I would like to ask Deputies this question: is there any country in the world in which a man can have a better life than in Ireland?  There are a lot of people in this country who believe that living in America is like living in the <Col N="1357" /><i>Saturday Evening Post</i>, but it is not. It is only a very small minority of people in America who live <i>a la Saturday Evening Post</i>.  Most of our people do not labour under such obvious illusions about Great Britain, but a lot of our people believe that to live in America is to live in comparably better conditions than those which obtain here.  I do not think that is true.  I think conditions are different. Some prefer them but a great many of us prefer what this country has to offer.</P>
    <P>Could we not stop wailing and moaning and denigrating this country before the world?  Is it not time for our people to show to the rest of the world that other countries are quite welcome to what they want but that we have what we want here and intend to keep it?  I am sick listening to people bawling and moaning about emigration. There is no living creature who has to leave this country as an emigrant from want, certainly in rural Ireland.  So far as I know, all the people who are going abroad from rural Ireland are going from good employment, but they are going because they believe they can earn more, in terms of money, in Great Britain or America, and that they can live in a freer and less supervised land, and that appears to attract them.  They may be wrong.  Those of us who elect to live here presumably think they are.</P>
    <P>We have got to ask ourselves the question: If they choose to go has anyone a right to stop them?  I do not think anybody has that right.  I think the most sacred liberty our people have, and must retain, is to go where their hearts listeth.  So long as this is a free country some of our people will choose to test their fortunes in the wide world and others will elect to stay at home.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any human creature in rural Ireland who is constrained by want to emigrate from this country.  I believe there are hundreds who elect to go because they would rather earn £20 a week in London, Birmingham or Manchester than £6 or £7 a week in their own town.  I am not at all sure that, when all the bills are paid, they are very much better <Col N="1358" /> off on the high wages they get in England. However, they think they are. They are entitled to live their lives the way they want to live them, not the way I think it is good for them to live them.  This House should never have the power to abridge that freedom. Once that freedom is taken from our people, they are no better than slaves in prison camps.</P>
    <P>I believe that at the present moment this country is one of the best countries in the world to live in. I believe we should be proud of it.  I think we have to face the fact, however&mdash;and the sooner we do it, the better for everybody&mdash;that we will never be rich in this country.  If we fix our eyes on the far horizon of material wealth, such as is displayed in Great Britain and the United States of America, we are chasing chimeras.  So far as this country is concerned, we are primarily an agricultural economy whose material resources consist of 12,000,000 acres of arable land and the people who live on it.  That will never provide in terms of money and goods the same standard of living as is available in great industrial economies such as Germany, Great Britain and the United States of America.  If we make up our minds to that and adjust ourselves to the fact, I believe it is possible to get for our people in this country a better living than is obtainable in any other country in the world.  If we make it our heart's desire to emulate in Ireland what they have in Birmingham, Pittsburgh and the Ruhr, we will never know peace and contentment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I believe that our policy of establishing stability and developing our resources was yielding an ever-growing result.  I saw around me in my own town and in other towns of Ireland a standard of living being enjoyed by the small farmers of Ireland that certainly my father never hoped to see.  I rejoice that the people in one short lifetime were tenants at will in mud cabins, the most of which were roofed in thatch, and came to the market towns in their bare feet, while their children are now living in security on their own land, not infrequently driving a car and many of them a tractor, wearing clothes and enjoying a standard of living comparable with that enjoyed by <Col N="1359" /> any rural community in the world.  I heard conditions here compared with those in Denmark.  I rejoice that our people value correctly freedom, the right to leisure and the right to labour hard, in truer proportions than many Continental peoples seem to do.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly agree that the whole future of this country depends on increased production for export and that the maintenance of the kind of standard of living for our people that I want, and which I believe they can enjoy, ultimately depends on our capacity to get from the land the maximum of which it is capable of yielding. The whole purpose of the policy of our Government was to bring within the reach of the farmers of this country the means to get from the land of Ireland the best living it was capable of yielding for themselves, their wives and their families, in the certain knowledge that, if they did that, it would be the wisest thing they could do for the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I apprehend that the departure embarked upon by the present Fianna Fáil Government is throwing all that stability away by inviting sections of our people to bear wholly disproportionate sacrifices for a purely economic theory which has no intrinsic value except as a means of achieving the balance of payments that we all desire, and putting the whole programme we had in mind in jeopardy.  I am afraid of the consequences of that.  Let us be clear on this.  On the heads of Fianna Fáil be it.  I do not think the people knew what Fianna Fáil intended to do.  I think Fianna Fáil is entitled to say, &ldquo;You told them and they did not believe you.&rdquo; I agree that is true &mdash;I admit that.  I do not think they wanted to believe it.  I do not think they could persuade themselves that any Party professing to be a national Party in this country could do to our people what Fianna Fáil are doing in this Budget.  They were wrong.  Their most treasured right in the sphere of politics is their right to do wrong in politics, but it is a right which could be purchased at a terrible price if our people elected to exercise it.</P>
    <P>I think in this Budget they are only <Col N="1360" /> paying the first small instalment in the debt they contracted by electing Fianna Fáil with a clear majority in this Parliament.  They have got the majority; they have got the assurance that no attempt by anybody to set that authority aside, except by the will of this Oireachtas, will receive support from any responsible Deputy.  I think they are using their authority like madmen and I deplore the catastrophe it will bring upon our people.</P>

      <P>I wonder where the boys found the neck.  There is no doubt but that they have neck.  On the last three attempts they made to get a loan, they were refused.  That was the total of their credit.  Last night, I heard a lot about the wisdom of the prize bonds scheme.  The total amount of credit that Deputy J. A. Costello, Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Dillon and the whole bunch of them together could get from the Irish people on the prize bonds was £200,000; but, as soon as they were going, the people came in and subscribed up to £5,000,000.  There is their total credit for you.

      <P>Deputy James Dillon. When that crowd were leaving office in 1952 I asked the then Minister for Finance a question.  I asked him if he would state the total amount payable and paid in interest and sinking funds in the financial years 1947-48 and 1952-53. The answer was that there was payable in 1947-48 for interest £3,095,000 a year and for sinking fund £1,128,000.  On the day of the election there was payable for interest <Col N="1361" /> £7,300,000 and for sinking fund £2,725,000, a total of £10,080,000 a year or over £6,000,000 a year of an increased dead-weight debt to be paid by the people of this country because the boys were in office for three years.</P>
      <P>To-day I asked a question of the Minister for Finance because I was curious about the present position. Here is the answer: payable for interest, £10,188,964 and for sinking fund, £5,219,529, a total of £15,408,493. It was £4,000,000 for interest and sinking fund on the day the Irish people had the misfortune to throw that mixum-gatherum gang into office. They have to pay now for their foolishness a sum of £15,000,000 a year, a dead-weight debt that must be paid before there is a penny for anything else.  Eleven million pounds a year those heroes have cost this nation, to be found by taxation out of the poor man's pint and the poor man's bread and butter.</P>
      <P>Those are the facts.  Will any Deputy over there contradict them? Only one of them.  I noticed that Deputy M. J. O'Higgins, during his speech last night, showed great fondness for quotations.  But he stopped at March, 1956.  Apparently there was a blank in the ammunition bag between March, 1956 and March, 1957.  I have no delusions whatever.  I told the people no lies.  I told the people that the only reason that gang were going was because they could not get, beg borrow or steal, one bob more to keep them there.  That was proved by the way the prize bonds were received. People in this country would not subscribe to them, would not give them a bob for anything.</P>
      <P>Look at the tale they are leaving after them.  I will give it as closely as I can.  I should like to quote from the Official Report of May 7th last.  During his statement on that day, the Minister for Local Government said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There was, however, another factor contributing to the decline in activity as shown in the figures for 1st April last and that was the hold up, for financial reasons, of the commencement of new works between last summer and the spring of this year.  That has had the effect, not so <Col N="1362" /> much of considerably reducing the number of dwellings completed in 1956-57, as of diminishing those in progress and those ready to be undertaken now.  This in turn will probably have the effect of reducing the number of dwellings which we may expect to have completed in the present financial year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since assuming office, I have recommended the issue of £1,340,000 to liquidate the obligations of local authorities outside the Cities of Dublin and Cork, to banks, to contractors and to persons awaiting payment of approved grants and advances for private housing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And those gentlemen informed us yesterday that they left a clean sheet behind them.  That is only one of the little tales they left after them.  We know what happened as a result: private individuals owed money to the contractors who built the houses, the contractors owed it to the builders providers, the builders providers owed to the banks, and no credit was available. That was the mess those bucks left after them.  There was in addition to that, a sum of £2,000,000 due on sanitary services.</P>
    <P>Later in his speech on the Estimate, the Minister for Local Government said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The outstanding liabilities of the Road Fund at 31st March, 1957, in respect of road maintenance and improvement grants and other liabilities, amounted to £4,212,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Be adding them up, boys, if you want to know why we had to withdraw the subsidies from bread and butter.  These are all part of the little tale left behind. The Minister later said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Payments in respect of the existing liabilities of the Road Fund to road authorities will be the first charge.  These amount to approximately £2,600,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course the local authorities had to go in and borrow in the ratepayers' names and pay 5½ per cent. interest for the money.  This is only some of <Col N="1363" /> the tale left behind; I am dealing with only one Department.  The Minister's predecessor walked out of office leaving over £6,000,000 due to contractors, to private individuals and to local authorities.  It is no wonder the incoming Minister did not know where he stood until the bills came in.</P>
    <P>I have another little docket here.  I heard Deputy Dillon speak about wheat.  I wonder is this little docket, dated October 5th, 1956, yet paid: &ldquo;Negotiations are at present on the point of completion for the purchase by the Éire Government of 100,000 tons of Canadian wheat&rdquo;&mdash;on three months' tick.</P>

Has he found out that one and, if he has not, I might suggest a few more to him.  I might suggest he inquire of the Indian Bank how much is due for the tea which was ordered there last October. I am creditably informed that there is £2,000,000 due to the Indian Bank for tea.  I want to know if that has been paid.  Those are the items which go to make up the reason why we have to come in here to clean up the mess and put extra taxation on the unfortunate people of this country.  It is just as well to be clear about it.  I hope there is somebody taking all that down, who can add them up in a minute.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan was very anxious about some things.  I shall deal with him in due course.  I have a few nice gems here for him. Speaking of wheat, I notice in the Budget Report the Minister says there is a certain quantity of wheat left over.  If those are the circumstances, I wonder why those boys over there went over and purchased 40,000 tons of soft wheat&mdash;that is, the kind of wheat which is grown here, not Manitoba stuff at all&mdash;and brought it into this country at a cost of £1,300,000 within the past three months.  This is where the surplus soft wheat came from.  That is the reply I got here in this House three weeks ago from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when I asked what quantity of soft wheat was brought into this country.  I was told that 40,005 tons of soft wheat were brought in, at a cost of £1,300,000.  That is the wheat of which that caricature of a Minister for Agriculture we had some time ago told use we were growing too much.  Now, as the result of that, I wonder how much of that soft wheat, of the 40,000 tons those gentlemen brought in, is turned over for animal feeding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hoping, Sir, that they are taking it all down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy overestimates himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>On top of that, there is a dead weight debt which must be found by whatever Government sits on those benches.  For the next 30 years they must extract from the Irish people £15,000,000 a year to pay for two interParty sprees.</P>
      <P>There were a few more questions I asked recently and I got some further information.  The information is that there is still an increasing Civil Service. I saw in the Budget statement that the Minister for Finance has allowed £250,000 for reductions.  I would like to remind him that the cost of the service has gone up from £10,000,000 to £17,000,000 in just six years.  I would further suggest to him that that is something which the people cannot afford.  We know how all this came about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the emergency a large number of temporary officials had to be brought in here because of the rationing of bread, butter, and so on.  Subsequently, the inter-Party Government with one sweep of the pen, made them all permanent, whether they were wanted or not.  Their jobs had gone as a result of the end of rationing, but they were kept on.  In addition to that, the doors of the Civil <Col N="1367" /> Service were still kept wide open.  You still had full-belt recruiting, with the result that if an unfortunate member of a local authority writes up to a Department requesting sanction for the building of a labourer's cottage, by the time it has passed through the hands of the last official, there will be a new Government in office.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Finance that it is his duty, first, to stop recruiting to the Civil Service for five years and, secondly, to appoint some three members of this House to investigate the conditions and the position in the Civil Service.  I am saying that with the full knowledge that there are at least 50 per cent. more civil servants in every office in Dublin than are required.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the example shown here is being followed by the faithful copyists, the county managers down the country.  I gave an instance here, when I spoke on the Local Government Estimate, of four officials going out to examine the site for one labourer's cottage.  When such a request for sanction for a labourer's cottage goes up to the Department, there are 14 officials there to pass it from one to the other, each one holding it for a fortnight until the next cottage comes along for fear that he will have nothing to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my business and the business of the Cork County Council, and the Deputy should be very thankful.  I suggest to the Minister that, instead of a saving of £250,000 this year, there should be a saving of well over £1,500,000 on the Civil Service, and that it is his duty to achieve that saving.</P>
      <P>The last matter I want to deal with is the Minister's allusion to a famous team who were brought together, known as the Capital Investment Advisory Committee.  I heard Deputy O'Sullivan last week making inquiries from the Minister in this connection and demanding to know&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder how thankful Deputy O'Sullivan's constituents would be to him if some of the recommendations that were brought in by these gentlemen were carried out.  The Minister for Finance in his Budget statement said that owing to the position of affairs this year he did not intend to do this at the moment.  I want to quote now from page 7 of the Report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Grants to local authorities in relief of rates on agricultural land should be discontinued.  These grants which in the present financial year are estimated to amount to £6,000,000 are not economically justifiable as at present applied since they are made available indiscriminately and not directly related to increased production.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The same report winds up by suggesting that some of that amount should be given to the farmers in the shape of vouchers for lime and fertilisers. This agricultural grant is payable, first, on the first £20 of the farmer's valuation and, secondly, is allocated strictly from that on in relation to the labour employed on the man's land.  In the first instance, I do not think it wise of a Government to bring in advisers on matters of that description who have a definite financial interest in the findings.</P>

      <P>I withdraw it.  When I read this document, I put down a question to the Minister for Agriculture asking what was the position of the lime subsidy fund.  I was informed that the lime subsidy fund was going out at something like £800,000 a year to two firms.  There is not sufficient money left in the funds to continue the subsidy for the next seven months. There is £500,000 left.  Now that that is gone, the agricultural grant which the farmers are getting is to be taken from them.  A sum of £570,000 per year has been drawn as lime subsidy by C.I.E. and £100,000 as lime subsidy by the Irish Sugar Company, and both of those firms still have money to draw.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We will bring in a Supplementary Estimate to cover what you owed, or at least what your Government left after you.  The Minister for Finance assured me that he did not know if the £3,000,000 due for the wheat was paid or not.  This is what I want to emphasise, that definite advice was tendered by a body set up by the previous Government that the agricultural grant be taken from the farmers and, they be given back in its place, vouchers for lime and fertilisers.  I have been accustomed all my life to calling a spade a spade.  Since I read that report I took immediate action to find out what was left in the funds.  I wanted to know the reason why there was a recommendation to take the agricultural grant away from the farmers and give them vouchers instead.  I was not long finding out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that as far as that report is concerned it will be seen to that the agricultural grants are not taken from the Irish farmers.  The gentlemen who signed their names to that document did not even know what <Col N="1370" /> the Irish farmer is paying.  They were of the opinion that the Irish farmer was paying less rates now than in 1948. The rates actually paid by the Irish farmer since 1948 have increased by 110 per cent. and that information was given by an arbitration board on 6th January of this year.  I have examined that increase myself and 67 per cent. of the 110 per cent. was due to the direct action and legislation of this Dáil.  Now there is an extra £5,000,000 to £6,000,000 a year to be taken from the farmer if the agricultural grant is removed on the advice of a body set up by, I presume, the former Minister for Agriculture, Minister for Finance, and Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot over the past few days about the increases this Budget will place on the rates.  Can the ratepayers afford to pay an addition £5,000,000 to £6,000,000, if this report is acted upon?  I am not going to go into the details of it.  I hope we will get an opportunity in the near future to do that and I am determined to give an opportunity to the Deputies in this House to discuss it.  The democratic institutions of this State are on trial.  The public proved that they had not enough confidence in the team across there.  They proved conclusively they were not going to stand for broken promises.</P>
    <P>I remember the guarantees that were given.  The subject of guarantees was questioned here last night by Deputy Norton and I was very glad to hear our Minister for Industry and Commerce stand over them.  I want to suggest now that there was another guarantee given very definitely in this House and given by, I think, something like 68 Deputies, including the present Minister for Finance and the present Minister for Industry and Commerce who walked into the Lobby in support of that guarantee.  That was a guarantee that the Irish pig producer would no longer be taxed on his wheat offals.  That is a guarantee which should be honoured now when we are dealing with production.  I gave in this House details of the disgraceful bargain that was made between Deputy Norton and Deputy Dillon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  This is the time to deal with it, remembering that this brought an income in to the relief of the Budget of £1,091,000 in 28 months. That was the amount levied on the pig feeders.  The result of that levy was a reduction of 20 per cent. in our pig population in 1955 followed by a reduction the next year of 58,000 more.  The State gained some £600,000&mdash;£600,000 extracted from the pig feeders.  But the State lost, and the country lost, some £3,000,000 worth of bacon which would have been available for export if that penal tax had never been levied.</P>
      <P>We are now setting our faces towards increasing production here.  Let us start by taking off this penal tax off the raw material of the pig producers. Consider the outrageous camouflage under which the gentlemen in the last Government operated.  They imported a couple of thousand tons of foreign offals at a cost of £25 10s. per ton.  The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, reduced the price of wheat by 2/6 per barrel thereby increasing the price of home-produced offals which had been officially depressed by him. If the value of wheat offals was £20 a ton whilst the late Deputy Walsh was Minister for Agriculture, and it never went above that £20 a ton whilst he was Minister for Agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;what should have been the price of wheat offals when the price of wheat was reduced by £5 per ton?  I suggest that the price should have been somewhere around 18/6 instead of £20.  That was increased deliberately by bringing in a couple of thousand tons of foreign offals in order to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce an opportunity of increasing the price to £25 10s. per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the time has now come to remedy the position.  If we intend to increase production we must start by removing the handicaps on the producer. I hear a good deal of advice <Col N="1372" /> here: &ldquo;Oh, give the farmers credit. Give them a loan.&rdquo; Farmers want no loans.  What the farmers want is the price of their produce and the penal tax taken off their backs.  I was very disappointed in the reply I got here from the Acting-Minister for Agriculture in relation to the price of wheat for this year.  As I stated earlier, democracy is on trial.  That team over there was tried and found wanting, with 50 broken promises.  That is all the more reason why the present Government should endeavour to honour their engagements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon boasted to-day that he got 350,000 tons, I think it was, of wheat into the mills this year.  That 350,000 tons of wheat carried in every bag a tax on the producer of that wheat to the tune of £1,780,000.  That is what the farmer was taxed for growing wheat.  I was very disappointed to find that that tax will not be removed for this year.  Thousands of farmers, when they found that gang was on the run, started ploughing and growing wheat.  The extra acres are in and the wheat is growing.  They did that in the knowledge that, with their help, the country would get rid of Dillonitis.  They got rid of that all right.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should review the position now.  If we are to go ahead with increased production, let us go ahead knowing exactly where we stand.  The cost of production has gone up for every tillage farmer by something like £11 per acre in the past four years.  In the last 12 months the cost of producing an acre of beet went up by some 84/&ndash; or 7/&ndash; per ton.  That, thank God, is the one guide we have as to how the cost of production affects the farmers.  The farmers can see that industrial firms can go to the Prices Advisory Body and get an increase there.  They can see every industrial firm increasing their costs in the same manner.  It is not my intention to hold up the House.  We will have plenty of opportunities of dealing with these and other matters on the Estimates.  I think I have covered the matters I wanted to deal with in particular.</P>
    <P>The position is very serious.  It is a <Col N="1373" /> position where the people have to find in taxation an extra £11,000,000 a year for the service of the public debt.  That is practically £500,000 per county or nearly £1,000,000 in respect of the County Cork which has to be found by taxation each year.  I do not believe the people will ever again be as idiotic as they showed themselves to be in these two elections.  I do not believe they will ever again take the chance of piling on the load on their backs.  I think they would be very foolish if they did.</P>

I have not got a list&mdash;I hope we will get one in the course of the Estimates&mdash;of the debts left by the Minister for Health.  I am sure they will make interesting reading as will the debts left by every other Minister who deals with local authorities.  I could keep the House engaged not only to-day but to-morrow, were I to read the sheaf of documents I have here containing an account of what is due to the local authorities.

      <P>I accept your ruling, absolutely, Sir.  The Minister for Finance is the man who must find the money and I hope he has found it.  I want to warn the House again that unless there is an absolute change, the next Budget brought in here or into future Dála will be tougher.  The service of the public debt in 1948 was £4,224,000; it jumped up to £10,080,000 in 1952; in 1954-55 it was £11,000,000; in 1955-56 it was £13,000,000; and in 1956-57 it is £15,500,000.  I hope that shows accurately the Rake's Progress.</P>
      <P>The only reason it is not £30,000,000 is that no one would lend the previous Government any money.  If they could get a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; anywhere, they would be sitting over here yet.  Even in regard to the prize bonds, about which all the noise was made yesterday and the day before, the total amount subscribed on the day that Deputy John A. Costello, then Taoiseach, stated he was throwing in the sponge, was £200,000.  That was the credit they were prepared to give him.  Then there was a change of Government and £5,000,000 were subscribed.  Is that not a fair example of the credit they hold in the country?</P>

      <P>First, let me state that I regard the total abolition of the food subsidies as immoral and unjustifiable, particularly by virtue of the state of unemployment in this country.  I listened with attention to speakers on both sides of the House.  I recall Deputy Costello stating that he did not know what he would have done in <Col N="1375" /> this connection, if returned to power, notwithstanding the fact that a commission was set up under his Administration and, I understand, recommended the abolition of the subsidies. The Tánaiste states that the Minister must have a balanced Budget and that it is necessary for stable Government.  One can balance figures, but can one balance figures, on the one hand, and humans, on the other?</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton in his post-Budget speech was very anxious to know what the Taoiseach intended to do in this regard.  I did not hear deputy Norton in his pre-election speech state what he would do or what his Party would do in this same connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blowick made reference to the increase on the bag of flour, but only in a very slight way to the increase in the price of the loaf. I understand that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is considering the reintroduction of the transatlantic air service.  I have aways held that the inter-Party Government were wrong in abandoning that project. However, I feel that its promotion could be deferred at present and that the £X that would thus be saved might be added to the sum that goes towards this less than 2d. relief to those unfortunates of the lower income group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am new to this House and for that reason I will be brief.  In conclusion, may I bring in a matter which is relevant and appeal to Deputy J. Murphy, for the sake of his wife and children, to abandon the hunger strike he has undertaken.  May I ask him, through the Chair and through this House, for the sake of his wife and children and particularly for the sake of his colleagues, to abandon this project now? Deputy Murphy may consider me presumptuous in making this appeal but, as one who has had experience of a similar occurrence 35 years ago which was an abject failure, I urge him to abandon the hunger strike, as Deputy Kyne did, and reserve his strength to join me and others in our protest <Col N="1376" /> against the total abolition of the food subsidies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry told us he knows the reason for this Budget. We know the reason very well for this Budget.  The reason for a Budget such as this is that Deputy Corry and 76 other Deputies are sitting behind the Minister for Finance.  This is the first instalment of the strong Government of which we have heard so much since the Fianna Fáil Party were returned to office with an overall majority.</P>
      <P>There might be a case for a gradual desubsidisation of flour, bread and butter, but there is no excuse for the taking, at one fell swoop, of £9,000,000 out of the pockets of the wage-earners of this country.  There is no excuse for the manner in which it was taken and for the effects that will flow from it.  Every man and woman who helped to put these 77 Deputies back behind the Minister for Finance about two months ago will recall that they did not put them back on terms that the subsidy would be removed from bread and butter.</P>
      <P>I would point out that no member sitting on the Government Benches, not even the Minister for Finance himself, gave any inkling to the Irish people, when seeking their votes, that if returned to office they would take the drastic steps which have been taken in this Budget.  I guarantee to the Minister for Finance and to Deputy Corry, who knows the real reason why this Budget was introduced, that if the Irish people had had the slightest inkling of what was in the mind of the Taoiseach and those members sitting on the Government Front Bench, they would again have sought the protection they got from the inter-Party Government and we should not now have this experiment of a strong Government foisted on us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister was completely thoughtless as to the results which would flow from the removal of the subsidy on bread and butter.  Certainly he did not consider the men and women who have to bring up families on very tight budgets.  Let me remind the House of the man who was encouraged by the Minister and his predecessors to invest in purchasing a <Col N="1377" /> house, who is now paying the mortgage weekly and who, as a result, is trying to live on a very tight budget indeed.  The Minister did not consider the average wage-earner to whom an extra expenditure of 10/&ndash; per week is indeed a very great tribute to have to pay to the mistake the electorate made when they returned Fianna Fáil to Government.</P>
    <P>I have already said that while there may be a case for a gradual desubsidisation, there is no case whatever for the raid to the extent of £9,000,000 perpetrated by the Minister on the pockets of the Irish people.  That is especially so when one remembers that the Minister did not make even a token raid on the profits of those who engage in luxuries or pastimes such as soccer, rugby, G.A.A., racing, dancing, and so on.  The Minister sought no source whatsoever other than the pocket of the husband, the father of a family, or of the wage-earner.</P>
    <P>I have been told that the imposition of an extra 6d. a gallon on petrol will cause grave disorder to small businesses. I was talking to a small builder in Cork to-day.  He said that whilst the larger builders may continue to prosper under the new dispensation, the extra 6d. a gallon on petrol will put many small builders and businessmen out of commission.  When the Minister for Finance was dealing with this question of the increase in the price of petrol the first point that sprang to the mind of every member on this side of the House and probably, indeed, to the mind of every member on the Government side of the House was whether or not it would mean increased bus fares.  All that the Minister could say to us was that the increase in petrol prices would leave bus fares almost entirely unaffected.  I do not know what that statement means.  Does the Minister mean that they will be affected or that they will not be affected?  I take it, from what he has said, that he does not mean that they will be unaffected.  If they are affected at all, then I would point out that I have never known a bus fare to be increased by less than a halfpenny in respect of the shortest stage available on a bus.  Consider <Col N="1378" /> what that will mean to a man whose wife has to go to town to shop every day, who himself has to go to business by bus every day and who may have to send three or four children by bus to school every day.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not trifle with the House.  He should tell us definitely either that bus fares will not be affected or that they will be affected, so that the people of the country may know the full depths of their woe at this stage, rather than have to wait and hear it by degrees.  The House deserves to be given that information and the people deserve to be given that information.  They should be told whether, on top of the increased bread and butter prices, they will now have to pay more every time they get into a bus.  If bus fares are still further increased then, in addition to paying tribute to their mistake at the last general election every time they butter a slice of bread, they will have to pay tribute every time they step on a bus to go to work or for any other lawful reason which any member of a household may have for boarding a bus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here when he did so, but I must say I am glad he has explained it.  The Minister for Finance should have explained it himself rather than have left it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to do so, if he has done so.  Here is another point which I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce has explained, too, because I imagine he is in a better position to explain it than anybody else.  A present of £230,000&mdash;roughly, a quarter of a million pounds&mdash;has been made to the bakers of this country on the recommendation of the flour and bread committee. I do not know whether or not that payment was justified.  I am not making any allegations against the present Government on that ground. I do not know whether it is justified or not, but I say that every man or woman capable of reading the Minister's Budget statement feels exactly the same&mdash;they doubt if this £250,000 <Col N="1379" /> should be made available to the bakers. I think it would be in the Minister's interest and certainly in the interest of the science of Government if the £ s d of that payment of £250,000 of Irish taxpayers' money were made abundantly clear to the Irish people before the payment was made.  I hope the Tánaiste has explained it, and if he has not, I hope the Tánaiste or the Minister will do so.  It is something that requires explanation; it is not sufficient to come to the House and say that the Flour and Bread Committees recommended that it should be paid.</P>
      <P>As we are on that subject, it is known to us in my constituency&mdash;and I think it is known in many other constituencies&mdash;that within the last year a large combine, a cartel in this country, bought up a large number of small bakeries.  It is to the small bakeries, to the people who sold out to that large combine that the money is due, if it is to be paid at all, if it is lawfully due, in fact.  If the Government sees fit to pay it, to whom will that money be paid?  Will it be paid to the owners of the small bakeries who sold to the large cartels not knowing that the recommendations of the Flour and Bread Committee were to be implemented?  Or will it be paid to the large cartel?  That is a matter upon which the Irish people deserve to be informed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or any other Minister who sees fit to explain the situation.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of keeping the House much longer but I want to ask every Deputy in the House who listened to Deputy Corry here, to expunge every word Deputy Corry uttered from his memory because every syllable uttered by Deputy Corry plumbed the depths of his own insincerity. Deputy Corry comes in here and assails his own Minister.  He says the Minister should save £1,500,000 on the Civil Service, that he should give better wheat prices and that he should remove the tax on wheat offals. Deputy Corry has persisted in that clap-trap since the first day he came into this House and not only in the House but outside it as well.</P>

      <P>I shall point if I wish. When he walks up those steps there is one way in which he can show he is sincere in what he says.  There is no good in going back and telling his constituents: &ldquo;I abused the Minister today,&rdquo; when he can enforce his views on the Minister who sits there supported by his vote.  I would ask him if he is really sincere to take the steps that will show his sincerity.</P>
      <P>There is one section of Deputy Corry's speech with which I would like to identify myself.  He told us that the next Budget would be tougher than this.  It is a pity he did not say that before last March.  I doubt very much if he or any other Deputy sitting behind the Government would be sitting on that side of the House to-night if he had said it.  The eventual test of what the Budget meant was here last Wednesday night when, looking across at those Deputies sitting behind the Front Benches one found every Fianna Fáil Deputy with a face on him like a cat whose kittens had just been drowned, horror and disgust written on every face, aghast, just as every man and woman who read about the Budget that night was aghast.  That is the test of the impact of the Fianna Fáil Budget, not alone on the people, but on those who are keeping the Fianna Fáil Government in power.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the tune of £8,000,000, and we had to have recourse to taxation and removal of the subsidies in order to balance the Budget. We have further found that all the promises made by the previous Government to reduce expenditure on Government services, all the promises made by Deputy McGilligan in 1954 when he said that the cost of Government could well be reduced by £20,000,000&mdash;all those promises were not fulfilled.  We found that the previous Government had placed the country in a position whereby they were unable to face the present economic facts of which most of us are aware.</P>
      <P>I want to get away from the issues in this discussion which relate to taxation and to the severe character of the Budget so that we can face realities and face the future of the country with full knowledge of the work to be done. I think we should make it clear that the position which we inherited was far from satisfactory.  We found that, whereas in nearly every other country in northern Europe, exports were increasing, exports here were some 6 per cent. below the best figures of two or three years before.  We found an excessive import excess; we found we were importing too many goods and that only by the most severe curtailment of imports has the position been rectified for the moment.  We found the net external assets of the banks which had been utilised for capital expenditure, were down by one-third from their previous high level.  We found agricultural production had become static and that industrial production was 1 per cent. above the 1954 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We found that the finances of the State had been regulated in such a way that the amount of money immediately available for capital development was closely restricted through increases in the Exchequer bills, increases <Col N="1382" /> in ways and means advances. We found, far from what the former Taoiseach said, that there was a burden of debt left upon us to face and to handle.  We have done our best to balance the Budget and to make it clear to the people of the country that we must have our accounts well balanced.  We must show that this country is going to pay its way, but of very much more importance than that is the fact that we are now starting a new era in the history of this country.  There have been continuous economic changes in the last four or five years which compel us to reexamine every aspect of Government policy in so far as they affect the national life.</P>

      <P>The position that we find in this country and with which we have to deal is not the question of whether we should have removed the subsidies on bread and butter, but the fact that we are gradually approaching as near as possible to British standards of wages and salaries, British standards of consumption.  We aspire to these standards and we have still exactly 55 per cent. of the British trade per head in this country.  That is the fundamental problem we face and there is no other problem of really serious import for the people to examine.</P>
      <P>The causes are manifold.  Some of them relate to the encouragement to the spending of our savings by the Coalition Government during the last ten years.  Some of the causes relate to our proximity to England.  Some of the causes relate to the tremendous demands for labour in Great Britain, but the facts are there, that we have 55 per cent. of the trade per head of English people and that we are naturally beginning to aspire to British standards in the whole of our life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, everybody wants to aspire to higher standards of living. The position is now being reached that <Col N="1383" /> we have got to increase our trade or we cannot justify the maintenance of even the existing standards, still less the improvement of standards that might otherwise eventuate.</P>
    <P>For ten years we have failed to emphasise the need for greater production. We have failed to emphasise the need for preparing for competition in our agricultural trade.  We have failed to emphasise the need for developing industrial exports, for gearing ourselves to greater production, for overcoming all the deficiencies we have in regard to raw materials, in regard to minerals, by making greater and greater efforts to improve our export trade.  For ten years we have spent more on social capital works of a kind that do not bring about an increase of production than any Northern European country, although our productive resources are still very much under-developed.</P>
    <P>For ten years we have spent more on building than devastated countries in Northern Europe as a percentage of our total capital investment.  In the last ten years only 10 per cent. of our total capital from private and public sources has been directed to the development of agriculture.  Just 10 per cent. of the whole of our capital development has been directed towards the improvement of our farming methods and to preparing us to face competition in regard to the export of every single commodity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We spent over £1,000 million altogether in the last ten years, and of that £1,000 million about £28,000,000 of capital have been advanced by the State towards the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the facts we have got to face.  We have been indulging in a process of alignment with British standards of living and the process has gone on in a number of different ways.  Huge numbers of people have left the land, leaving a higher income for those who remain behind.  The character of our land tenure has radically changed <Col N="1384" /> within the last ten or 15 years.  We now know that there are some 52,000 sons and daughters left to inherit the farms of under 30 acres which now belong to 108,000 farmers, indicating a process of consolidation, a process of growth in the size of farms which will accelerate rapidly in the next 20 years, again indicating a very natural aspiration to a higher standard of living, but all affecting the future policy of the State.</P>
    <P>We find from reports prepared by the Department of Statistics that, because of lack of capital, lack of cooperative effort and distance from markets, practically the whole of the increase of production in agriculture, the small increase that has taken place since 1938, has been in the provinces of Munster and Leinster and has been largely on farms of 100 acres and over.  We find that, although the smaller farmers continue to produce much more per acre than the larger farmers, the distance between them is being gradually reduced and that most of the advantages that have been made available to farmers since 1938 or since the end of the war have accrued to larger farmers in the eastern parts of the country who have been able to benefit by such products as wheat and beet and who have access to capital, greater access to technical knowledge, closer access to markets. We have that problem to face.</P>
    <P>We find that, in industry, wage and salary levels in a great many industries approximate to those in great Britain, if overtime is not counted as a factor, and that in comparison with the larger British factories, the better organised factories, those that have greater facilities for sale and for export, output here is two-thirds of the British.</P>
    <P>Various side effects are inevitable as a result of the natural aspiration of the people to come as close as possible to English standards of living.  For one thing, the demand for labour in Great Britain induces emigration and naturally diminishes pressure upon increased capital investment because emigration offers an immediately easier course. Another result is that there has been a decrease in the demand for some of our industrial products owing to the <Col N="1385" /> reduction in population.  There has been the continual process of adjustment that has been taking place along those lines ever since the end of the war.  One notices them in many fields. For example, agricultural wages have gone up continuously, and rightly, but the number of agricultural workers employed has decreased, not only here but in other countries.</P>
    <P>There is only one solution to this problem and that is greater investment, preparation to face intensive competition, agricultural production based on high quality goods bought on merit by countries abroad and other agricultural produce of medium quality bought on a strictly price-competition basis.  We all of us know that.  We all of us know that the problem lies there ahead for us to solve and that it can be solved as long as we make up our minds that there is no short-circuit to prosperity, that that is the only way we can bring it about, by greater investment and greater production.</P>
    <P>When the decision is made in regard to the free trade area, whatever the decision may be, we are going to face still more intensive competition on foreign markets.  We will find that we will have to integrate and improve the marketing of our produce on a scale never before envisaged.  Quicker turnover of cattle will be essential.  The quality of our meat will have to improve. We shall have to engage in the production of far more agricultural specialities.  Such surplus production of milk as we have will have to be processed to a far greater degree.</P>
    <P>In regard to industry, at the present level of salaries and wages and in relation to the present output, the home market has become far too small. We shall have to look for exports on a scale never before envisaged when the policy of protection was first instituted. We hear a great deal in this House about subsidies on bread and butter. It is time we heard far more about increases in productivity.  It is time we heard far more about encouraging our industrialists in regard to making use of time and motion study courses. It is time we heard more about productive inducements to raise workers' wages so that they can pay <Col N="1386" /> for the bread and butter.  If we had Deputies arguing about the best methods of increasing production we would be advanced far more in our prosperity.</P>
    <P>We hear Deputy Norton telling us about the feelings of the workers towards the reduction in the subsidies. We have not heard Deputy Norton talking about the productivity councils in Great Britain, Holland and Denmark where workers and employers get together and where the workers themselves demand time and motion studies and examination of their industries in order that they can compete abroad in exports; in order that they can produce more and sell more exports and in order that they can go to their employers and say, without any regard to the cost of living or to butter and bread subsidies, &ldquo;We can demand a higher wage because we know production is going up in our factory as a result of improvements in methods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we had more discussion about such things in this House we would be further along the road to prosperity. It would be better if we had Deputies asking in how many industries were these developments taking place.  It would be better if we had Deputies asking where such examinations were taking place and where further educational facilities were required and whether employers and workers needed further encouragement by the State to get together and solve this problem.  If that was the case we would have advanced more than we have advanced in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>We could have Deputies citing the case of one very well-known factory not far from here, in County Kildare, which doubled its production with the consent of the workers and where the workers, through their trade union, were anxious that the result of the doubled production should not militate against them.  They feared that they might become redundant but within two years the factory was producing £150,000 worth of export goods, the number of workers had increased and wages went up as a result.  If we had had more talk of this kind in the last ten years we would be further on the <Col N="1387" /> road to prosperity and it would be a substitute for discussions on bread and butter subsidies.  It would be a grand thing if we could hear proposals for combined exports by groups of industries; if we could hear a discussion on whether the Government is doing enough to encourage export by a combination of industrial groups coming together and forming their own individual export corporations, which would make it easier for small individual units in widely scattered areas.  That is the sort of discussion we require. It would be better if we had discussion on what we mean when we say we must invest foreign capital.  We should have an economic policy so that there would be some permanent encouragement for a certain type of investor to put his money into this country.  It would be better if we had a permanent accepted economic policy to encourage our investors and to encourage those who at present prefer to invest abroad.</P>
    <P>We have got to get rid of a great lot of sentimental thought about our national life.  If we had more talk in this House on the basis that the best definition of &ldquo;national&rdquo; is now the will to outsell our competitors, this would be some contribution to the problems of the present day.  We have got to get away from the belief that spending money with the object merely of providing immediate and direct employment is by itself automatically a solution of our national problems.  We may find ourselves compelled to invest money in projects where there is no immediate yield in direct employment but where the result of the investment will in a few years' time provide far more employment than any money spent on something which could immediately yield employment.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to examine, in a very superficial and preliminary way, the work done by the Department of Fisheries.  A great deal of the work has been splendid.  The production of fish has, undoubtedly, increased.  The catching of fish and the processing of it have advanced considerably in the last ten years, but because we have failed to face the realities of our position as a near neighbour of Great <Col N="1388" /> Britain, and aspiring, as all of us naturally do, to getting as near as possible to the sterling standard of living, never in the last ten years, by any Government, has the true commercial value of our fishing potential been examined with a ruthless realism designed to produce greater exports at all costs.  I find that there are no memoranda and no proposals of that kind in the Department of Fisheries. It is for the very human reason that there is always the desire to please this individual or that individual, to please fishermen in this port or that port. There is always the desire that the money spent will yield immediate results in the terms of employment or production.</P>
    <P>I suppose that as good an illustration as any that I can give of the position of this State can be summed up from this one simple fact.  We are the only maritime nation in Europe without a proper fisheries school and without exploratory vessels which would enable us to find the fish, to locate the large shoals and to encourage more high grade commercial fishing.  That can be given as an example of the kind of job that has got to be done by this Government&mdash;hard, scientific endeavour and thinking, greater capital investment, and longterm thinking with a view to greater commercial production.  It is not going to be an easy job and the money for it will not be found easily but it is that approach to our life that is going to enable us to pay for our bread and butter subsidies.  That approach to our future will make this Budget appear comparatively light in the years to come and possibly bring relief in taxation in its wake.  It is that approach to every national aspect of our life that will produce results.  It is absolutely useless to consider that any kind of temporary measure or wishful thinking is going to get us out of our difficulties.  The future lies in better markets, more scientific production, greater technical instruction and the use of the brains that exist in all parts of this country and the fostering of our courage and ambition towards making this State a high grade commercial proposition in ever facet of its existence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> Let us take another illustration, a comparatively ordinary product, the pig.  Britain imports £80,000,000 worth of pig products each year of which we supply just over £2,000,000&mdash;after 30 years of independence and the ideal opportunities made available to us after the end of the war.  We in this country did nothing much about it, and the reason was that the formulation of our policy towards an integrated, modern pig export organisation is difficult. It involves dozens of changes in methods and attitudes by thousands of people; it requires capital with absolutely no immediate increase in employment to begin with; it requires changes in methods by bacon curers, it requires big changes in the entire structure of our pig collection organisation, big changes in pig breeding, a tremendous amount of persuasion for every farmer who produces pigs, the maintenance of sufficient financial guarantees not only to maintain supplies of pigs to Great Britain on a continuing basis but also a price maintenance guaranteed and standardisation of the export marketing organisation in Great Britain to sell Irish bacon&mdash;all involving a multitude of changes difficult to bring about, bringing no political popularity.</P>
    <P>Why did we not do it?  We did not do it for a number of reasons.  We did not do it because we were able to spend £200,000,000 of war savings since the war.  If those had not been there to spend, there would have been greater pressure exercised on us to get those jobs done, to get them done well and done quickly.  We did not do it because the atmosphere was, generally speaking, that cattle prices were rising, more people were going off the land leaving greater incomes to those left on the land, and there was not the sense of absolute urgency about facing competition on a heavy and mountainous scale as occurred in greater measure after the period of food scarcity in Great Britain ended.</P>
    <P>Every effort was, consequently, not devoted to that stage of our history when we must face heavy competition. It takes some time for the people of the country to assimilate facts about our economic position, one of which is <Col N="1390" /> the expenditure of our war time savings; and the spending of these savings, at the same time, has been the equivalent of the expenditure of £64 by every household in this country since 1947. Money has circulated among us, money which we spent, which meant a postponement of the dire necessity for getting on with productive enterprise, gearing farmers for higher production.</P>
    <P>As I have said, those are the facts we have got to face and the sooner we face them the better.  I am not suggesting we can achieve the intensive high grade form of production that is to be found in certain other countries, but if we could advance a little bit further in the intensive production direction, with the soil and climate available to us and the natural initiative the people have, we should be able to succeed.  It should not be impossible to increase production sufficiently in the next ten years to enable us to forget the unpleasantness of this Budget.</P>
    <P>The difficulties we have were expressed by Miss Margaret Rutherford very well in the Olympia Theatre on Monday night when she described this country and, in parenthesis, said &ldquo;if a little inconsequential&rdquo;.  The little inconsequential factor has been to our country's disadvantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the fundamental problem, we must realise that we are living in a modern world, in the sterling area, and if we wish to have large scale investment in this country, however much we may disagree in the political field and in this House, I hope it will be accepted that we need to have a diamond hard, crystal-clear attitude on our economic policy.  We must have balanced budgets; we must have in evidence continual saving, uninterrupted by flights of fancy; and we must cease spending those savings on non-essential items.  We must have a general atmosphere in the country that <Col N="1391" /> money invested must be dedicated to increasing production.  We must accept the fact that the best way to bring up production is not to engage in excessive social capital expenditure but to concentrate upon exports.  We hope that the trade unions who protect the interests of the workers, who protect them against increases in the cost of living, will themselves accept the idea that productivity is the only solution to our difficulties and that ultimately the worker must benefit by higher production.</P>
      <P>We have faced the end of the era in which our accumulated savings during two world wars made the economic problems more easy to solve.  It is now an entirely different proposition.  If we are to produce more, if we are to invest in new industries and better agricultural practices, we must realise that the world of 1957 is a very different one from that of 1947.  It is very different, even quite apart from the differences we have had on either side of the House.  For the sake of argument, even eliminating all these differences and assuming that we in this House were always united, that we never had any elections fought on the cost of living issue, on the prices of bread, butter and cigarettes, if we had carried on in the same way as other countries did, where there were no serious differences of policy, there would still have been an enormously different world to face now.  If we all consider the need for greater production and for modernising our techniques, we will get somewhere, but if we continue to talk on the less important facets of our national life we will not progress and we can then anticipate only further integration with Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all hope to preserve our distinctive pattern of life.  We will not, unless we can build our production per head to a greater level so that we can afford the standards of living which have been impossible up to this.  The whole existence of Irish nationality as a separate force in the life of our people depends on our building up that productive strength.  Without it we might as well consider ourselves a province <Col N="1392" /> of Great Britain such as Scotland. Those are the issues.  Let us face them manfully.  Let us have more talk in this House on the occasion of this Budget about real productive essentials than about how we are going to get over the difficulty of the subsidies on butter and bread.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all of us will agree that the Minister for Lands usually makes a pretty intelligent speech but he is rather naive in assuming we are not going to talk about the Budget proposals.  He has suggested to us on two or three occasions that we should talk about methods for increased production and other such things.  This is the General Resolution on the Budget and, despite what he says, I, for one, intend to talk on the proposals before us.</P>
      <P>I regard the very good speech the Minister for Lands made as a criticism of the Fianna Fáil Party and even as a criticism of the present Ministers within that Party.  I am sure even Fianna Fáil members do not assume that all the difficulties which beset us now arose during the last three years. It is not just an empty phrase to say that Fianna Fáil were the Government of this country for something like 20 years.  Surely they must take the larger share of responsibility and blame for the difficulties and ills which the Minister for Lands so eloquently described?  All of us must admit&mdash;and Fianna Fáil themselves admit&mdash;that the year 1956 was a very difficult year.</P>
      <P>I think it is true to say that, in our difficulties as a Government, we did not receive the co-operation from the then Opposition which the Government now expect from the present Opposition Parties.  We had various serious difficulties.  The Suez situation was extremely difficult and lost the Government quite an amount of revenue.  That was not of our making; neither was the fact that cattle exports declined and prices fell.  These developments represented a loss in revenue for the last Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a serious situation so far as employment was concerned.  I do not deny that and, as a member of the last Government, I am prepared to <Col N="1393" /> take my share of responsibility for it. However, there were many reasons for that unusual unemployment.  One thing which intrigued me about Deputy Lemass's plan for full employment yesterday was that he said the reason Fianna Fáil had to bring in such a hard Budget was that they did not know the financial state of the country. Yet in his inimitably brazen fashion he attempts to set down a plan for full employment and gives the people to understand that he did know at that time the complete economic position of the country.</P>
    <P>The one thing that struck me in his plan for full employment was that it threatened the workers of this country. He said they would either have to contribute 5 per cent of their savings voluntarily or it would be taken from them.  In my wisdom, I told the people of my constituency&mdash;and I think my colleague, Deputy Seán Browne, heard me&mdash;that that meant either of two things: a reduction in their wages by 5 per cent. or a decrease in food subsidies, so that their consumption of food would be cut by 5 per cent.  That is exactly what has happened in this Budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter about the name of the document.  It is a proposal to decrease consumption by 5 per cent.  He did not make any mention at all of the method he intended to employ to carry out his proposals for full employment.  Neither do we see, either in his speech or that of Dr. Ryan, any hope that there will be an easement of the unemployment problem at present.  There is no reduction in the unemployment figures compared with the same period last year.  I do not expect miracles from the Fianna Fáil Party, sincere as they may be.  However, they have been in there for two months now and still they have not &ldquo;got cracking&rdquo;.  The only contribution <Col N="1394" /> we have seen is a niggardly one&mdash; £250,000 for the relief of unemployment through relief schemes.  Is there any more money for housing in Dublin and Cork?  Is there any increase in the money provided for housing to any local authority in this country?  There is not one penny more.</P>
      <P>I fail to see what plans there are in this Budget or what hope there is for increase in employment.  There are vague references to other plans that will be introduced.  Deputy Lemass mentioned them yesterday but did not go into them in any great detail.  I know that Deputy Childers is very anxious for us not to talk about bread, butter, sugar, cigarettes, stout and so on.  He always seems to be planning for the future.  It is grand to plan for the future.  Possibly that is something Fianna Fáil should have done ten or 15 years ago.  Fianna Fáil always seem to thrive on crises.  They are usually artificial crises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

For the next 20 years or 20 months, whichever it may be, they will come along with the old parrot cry: &ldquo;We are paying your debts.&rdquo; They cannot mention any debts.  There was no complaint this time last year when our Budget was being framed.  They did not challenge revenue or expenditure and that was the time they should have done so.  They did not say that we were anticipating that we would get more than we really got or that we were expending more or less&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was and I can explain that.  Suez was responsible for that to the extent of £1,000,000 and no titter from the back benches of the Opposition can controvert that fact. The fact that cattle prices went down was also a contributory factor and we had no control over that.  We also had to impose levies which in some cases meant a loss of revenue.  The import levies were the best thing ever done <Col N="1395" /> for the Government now in office.  They corrected our balance of trade in 12 months&mdash;a shorter time than even we anticipated.</P>

      <P>I am taking my responsibility for that.  I do not gloss over the fact that there were 96,000 unemployed. The fact Deputy Childers wants to hide is that this Budget has imposed an increase of 3½d. on the loaf. Can we believe any statement that comes from the front bench of that Party when I mention what Deputy de Valera said in Belmullet, that the food subsidies would remain and that Deputy Lemass said many times that the food subsidies must remain?  I think Deputy O'Carroll, an Independent Deputy here, made the challenge that the Labour Party had said nothing about food subsidies before the election. We did say it.  I said it in a wireless broadcast.  I said that, as far as the Labour Party were concerned, the food subsidies would have to stay. It was embodied in the election address of every single member of the Labour Party who was a candidate at the last election, that under no circumstances would we have allowed these food subsidies to go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait now; I am referring to the withdrawal of the subsidies. Stout is increased by ½d., petrol by 6d., <Col N="1396" /> and, the meanest of all, the health services by up to 4/&ndash; per day.  The 3½d. on bread is not the whole story.  As every Deputy knows, the withdrawal of the food subsidies also means decontrol.  It means, as is now happening, that 4d. extra is being charged for the 2 lb. loaf.  It means that bread can skyrocket to any price and it seems that Deputy Lemass and Deputy Dr. Ryan, the two Ministers, have no concern about it.</P>
      <P>One thing that struck me about the Budget speech by the Minister for Finance was that there was no talk about prices at all.  There was no mention of any intention by the Government to attempt to control prices.  Now the sky is the limit as far as all commodities are concerned. There were plenty of admonitions to the workers not to look for increases in wages, but none to those who manufacture and none to those who sell. They can charge what they like.  Not once did I see any reference to a determination by the Government to stabilise prices.  The alleged justification, of course, is the Majority Report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee.  They recommended that it should be done.  If that was the case, why then did the Minister for Finance not implement the proposal in respect of the agricultural grant?  Because it would have been too difficult, in my opinion, because it would have lost them too much support.  But the easiest thing to do and the laziest thing for the Fianna Fáil Government, was to grab the £9,000,000 off the food subsidies.</P>
      <P>If the inter-Party Government had been still in power this year, we would have had a very difficult task but, believe it or not, I give this guarantee &mdash;we would have explored every single possible method before attempting to impose any burden on the ordinary people by asking them to pay any more for food.  That was proved in the last two Budgets which Deputy Sweetman introduced.  He used ingenious methods &mdash;methods which could not be questioned and were not questioned&mdash;in those two Budgets.</P>

      <P>I should like to give Deputies some little idea as to what this increase in bread prices means.  Of course, according to Fianna Fáil, all these increases can, to certain classes, be offset by paying the shilling.  It reminds me of the Saxon shilling.</P>

      <P>The shilling is to pay for all these things.  I am glad to see Deputy Beegan is here.  I quote no member of the last Government but I quote Deputy Beegan, to show what this burden will mean for the average family of five.  He used this example last year.  Talking about the criticism there was of the last Budget Deputy MacEntee introduced, when he reduced the 2 lb. loaf by ½d. per lb., he tried to prove that this ½d. was better than a reduction of 5d. a lb. in the price of butter.  He said, as reported at column 425 of the Official Debates, Volume 157, on the 15th May, 1956:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Take the 2-lb. loaf of bread.  Each member of the same family, if physically fit, and if depending on bread as many people in the cities have to, would consume a 2-lb. loaf in the day.  That would mean a saving of 2½d. per day.  Multiply that by seven and you get 1/5½d. if my calculation is correct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was correct.  He continued:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That means that the much despised halfpenny reduction on the price of the loaf was of much greater advantage to that family than was the reduction in the price of butter. Most of these families exist solely on bread because they cannot have potatoes or vegetables.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That referred to the 1/2d. increase.  That would mean a burden of 1/5½d. per week on a family of five.  The increase of 4d. will mean an additional burden of 11/8.  I ask Deputy Beegan is that correct?  I assume, if he remains silent, that it must be correct.</P>

      <P>The Government expressed great concern about the bakers and were so much concerned they decided to pay them £230,000 on the pretext that it had been promised by Deputy Norton.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, yesterday tried to justify that, but he failed miserably.  There was no commitment.  There was nothing in writing in the Department and no evidence which could be brought forward by any official of the Department of Industry and Commerce, to substantiate that allegation by Deputy Lemass, that the £230,000 was promised.  If it was in the report of the Flour and Bread Commission, it was rejected by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time and by the Government then&mdash;because we did not believe we should make a present of £250,000 to people many of whom were making substantial profits.</P>
      <P>This decontrol of bread prices, whilst it is a serious burden to place on the ordinary people, means something else as far as the small bakeries are concerned. In my opinion, it means the virtual destruction of every single small bakery in the country.  Does every Deputy not know what is happening at the present time?  You have the big bakeries from the City of Dublin and other centres peddling their bread 100 and 150 miles away, selling their surplus.  Possibly they will reduce the price of bread temporarily.</P>

      <P>There does not seem to be much concern on the part of certain Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;probably there is in their hearts, but not in their speeches &mdash;and certainly not on the part of Deputy Childers, the Minister for Lands.</P>

      <P>Of course, the ½d. in the lb. of sugar slipped through in the week or two before the Budget.  The people's eyes were on the Budget and the ½d. a lb. slipped through.  Let it be known that the last Minister for Industry and Commerce refused an increase of ½d. on sugar.  The Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party seem to have a harder neck than I would have, in going back to my constituency and defending some of the things which were done in this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cigarettes have been increased by twopence.  We increased cigarettes last year by, I think fivepence; and we had a shocking outcry from the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Of course, in a very good speech, to some extent, by <Col N="1400" /> Deputy Booth here last week, he was appalled that the members of the Opposition did not offer suggestions. Some member of the previous Government had the temerity to ask Deputy Lemass, last year, what he would do and in a very enraged manner he said it was the duty of the Opposition to criticise and he was not going to attempt to provide a solution for the Government then sitting there.  He said it was pure impudence for any member of the Government then to ask for suggestions from members of the Opposition, that the Opposition were watchdogs and it was their job to criticise, to tell the people what was happening, but not to make any suggestions.</P>
    <P>People might say the increase of 2d. in the packet of 20 cigarettes is a very small increase, but listen to what Deputy Briscoe said about the increase last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The workers and their trade unions have been told they should use restraint now.  Do not rock the boat.  We should all be prepared to co-operate.  Another round of wage increases might upset the boat entirely. The price of cigarettes was increased last year and Deputy Briscoe, who is a very shrewd businessman and who purports to be a very good friend of the workers, said this at column 293, Volume 157 of the Official Debates of 9th May, 1956:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Might it not be that we will be faced with another demand?  Are we sure that, as a result of this new form of taxation, employers in the industrial and agricultural fields will not be faced with increased demands from their workers in order to meet, in the case of a person who smokes one packet of cigarettes a day, the extra 5d. a day for seven days of the week?  I do not say that such a person would have any claims on the grounds of the petrol increase, but he would have on the grounds of the increase in tobacco and cigarettes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can he reconcile that attitude with the attitude displayed by the Minister for Finance and the Minister <Col N="1401" /> for Industry and Commerce?  That was surely a direct invitation to the workers this time last year to make their demand for a sixth round of wage increases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton said that one of our main aims during the past three years was to stabilise prices in order to stabilise wages, and I think we succeeded in doing that pretty well. Deputy Killilea is <i>hah-hah-hah-ing</i> but he has not the foggiest idea what he is <i>hah-hah-hah-ing</i> about, because wages were stable and prices were stable without either the implementation or threat of a wages standstill Order.  It was done voluntarily because the workers appreciated that there was a genuine effort to keep prices stable.  I do not say nothing went up in price in the past three years, but, in accordance with our stated promises, the prices of essential foodstuffs did remain stable over the past three years.</P>

      <P>We were told last year the price of petrol had reached saturation point and still the easy method is employed&mdash;6d. on the gallon of petrol. That also will have its effect on prices. It is not for me to go into the details. Every single Deputy knows how, where and when it will be passed on.</P>
      <P>Then we had the 20 per cent. increase in motor car insurance, another thing that had slipped quietly through when people were thinking for two or three weeks about the Budget. Might I say again for the benefit of Fianna Fáil Deputies that that increase was refused by the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce? Personally, I did not see any justification for it and I am sure he did not see any justification for it, but for some peculiar reason&mdash;maybe somebody else has a better guess than I have&mdash;the present Minister for Industry and Commerce allowed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of a penny per pint in the price of stout is again not the whole story.  There are two Budgets this year.  There is the Budget that is announced by the Government and there is the Budget that is announced by those who control prices.  The price <Col N="1402" /> of the bottle of stout has not gone up by the halfpenny proposed in the Budget&mdash;it has gone up by a penny. Again, surely the Minister for Industry and Commerce should not have done what his predecessor refused to do, decontrol the price of stout, of ale and of porter in a majority of the districts in the country, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce said the sky should be the limit as far as stout, ale and the pint are concerned.</P>
    <P>As I said before, the meanest of them all was the increase in health charges&mdash;and this from the Party who took full credit for the implementation of the Health Act.  The main portion of that job was carried out by the former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Higgins.  I do not say the legislation was introduced and passed by the last Government, but he had the sticky job&mdash;and it was a sticky job&mdash;of trying to implement the major portion of the Health Act of 1953.</P>
    <P>Whilst I do not want to go into the merits or demerits of the Health Act, I do not think it has been everything we expected and I will not say everything Fianna Fáil pretended it to be, because I thought the Health Act of 1953 was going to confer a certain amount of benefit on the people in the middle and lower income groups. There are many people now, who, prior to the implementation of the Health Act, were receiving certain services who are now not receiving them, and there are tens of thousands of people who find themselves much worse off than they were before this Act was implemented.  People from the middle income group who thought they would get some benefit from it now find that, if they go into hospital, they will be required to pay an additional 4/&ndash; per day.  Somebody may say the charge may be anything from nothing up to 6/&ndash; per day, but, in practice, and contrary to what the Minister for Health said yesterday, in the majority of the local authorities&mdash;in mine certainly&mdash;the charge is 6/&ndash; per day. There is no 5/&ndash;, 4/&ndash;, 3/&ndash;, 2/&ndash; or 1/&ndash; per day.  It is always 6/&ndash; per day, as far as I am aware.</P>
    <P>The person who has to survive on <Col N="1403" /> disability benefit of £3 1s. for himself, his wife and three children and who is refused the medical service card is now required to pay £3 10s. per week in hospital and is charged for the X-ray service as well&mdash;possibly not the total amount but some contribution towards it&mdash;and also has to make a contribution towards specialist services.  These things were not divulged by the Fianna Fáil candidates at the election. They said they were going to get cracking, that people were going to be put back to work.  If they had not been returned to office, at least things would not be worse than they were.  Food subsidies would not have been withdrawn.  The health services position would be better, but now it will be infinitely worse for people depending on these health services.</P>
    <P>Some other Deputy mentioned the burden on the local authorities.  They will have to pay more for bread, butter and sugar.  They will be affected by the increase in petrol.  They will also have to pay more for their stout and cigarettes for patients in some of their institutions.  This will mean an increase in the rates, something which Deputy Corry and many members of the Fianna Fáil Party have so violently attacked to-day in their speeches.</P>
    <P>Then we are all supposed to make sacrifices and to swallow this Budget. The only reason we are asked to do that is that Fianna Fáil have a majority, with 78 Deputies behind them, and as far as loyalty is concerned, there is no Party more loyal than the Fianna Fáil Party.  They can be kicked in the stomach and belted in the head and as soon as somebody says: &ldquo;The chief says you must do it,&rdquo; it is done.  Have they any regard for the people who will be affected by this Budget, and do they seriously think that there will not be a wage demand from the workers in all our trade unions?</P>

      <P>The Deputy can come back to-morrow and make a speech. It was announced last year in the Budget that a certain sum was to be made available for increases to those in the social insurance group, those in receipt of national health insurance, those on the stamps and those in receipt of widows' and orphans' pensions. The increase that was given was 25 per cent.  Since the rate was first announced in March, 1950, the cost of living had gone up by 23 per cent. and we compensated them to the extent of 25 per cent. and that is as it should be. The first speaker on that occasion was the present Minister for Finance and he said he welcomed the proposal; the only criticism he had to make was that it was not enough.  The man with a wife and two children getting £2 10s. a week up to last September got an increase of 11/&ndash;, at a time when there was no such thing as an increase of four points in the cost-of-living index. Deputy Ryan said it was not enough and Deputy Gogan wept salt tears for those in the national health group, the widows and orphans and those drawing unemployment benefit.  He said it was mean of the Government and of the Minister for Social Welfare to give such a skimpy increase as 11/&ndash;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do they get now?  They get an increase of 1/&ndash; a week and 4/6 for the second child in children's allowances. On the basis of the figures I have given for the increase in the price of bread to a normal family of five, how far is this 1/&ndash; increase for the man on the dole, and the 1/1½ per week in respect of the child drawing children's allowances, going to meet the increases caused by this Budget?  I do not care what anybody says, we have a duty at <Col N="1406" /> this stage towards old age pensioners and especially towards those in receipt of unemployment assistance, and to widows and orphans drawing noncontributory pensions.  There is a school of thought fast growing in this country which thinks we should not increase our social welfare allowances any more.  I say that in respect of these people we should give something that will enable them to live at least in meagre comfort.</P>
    <P>In respect of the insurance groups many people are under the impression that all this is paid by the State, forgetting that the principle is accepted in this country by all Parties that there are three contributors to it, the worker, the employer and the State. If there are increases such as last September's, the workers and the employers are willing to pay their portion of the increase and the State to contribute its third.  In respect of those people who are not insured I believe, and I have often said it, that we should have a special section of the Budget whereby a tax would be allocated and raised for these people so that it would be known that the tax on every cigarette smoked and on every bottle of stout drunk, would go to the old age pensioners and the widows and orphans.</P>
    <P>Are the workers expected to stay quiet?  Are they expected to believe that every section of the community is to bear the same burden?  I do not believe the Minister when he says that other sections of the community, better able to afford it, are contributing their fair share in this Budget.  Of course we have exhortations, with which every one of us would agree, to all and sundry in this country, that we should produce more.  I agree we should do that.  I agree we should have made a better attempt, very many years ago, to produce more and export more but when people talk, and especially politicians and certain other people, about more and more production they infer by that that the worker is not pulling his weight.  They would give one to believe that the worker can work a little harder and produce more.</P>
    <P>I know workers in foundries in Wexford&mdash;Deputy Seán Browne also knows them&mdash;and I do not think that <Col N="1407" /> anybody in this House would be able to stand the eight and a half hour day that they have to work in the foundries.  It is not true, as the Minister for Lands alleges, that the workers are lazy, or reluctant to work, and that the bulk of the unemployed are people who would not work.  That may be said of a small section but the vast majority of those unemployed at the present time are anxious to work. They are not content to stay on the dole and unemployment benefit.  They want work and above all they want security in their work.  They want constant work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we want to give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask why cannot we produce more?  I have seen many examples of it where workers have worked hard and listened to the call for greater production and produced themselves out of a job.  They have done that in Wexford town.  They have piled up so much that they could not dispose of, for one reason or another, and they found themselves down at the labour exchange again. They want to have a guarantee that, if they work harder, it will mean a greater return for them and more constant work and greater security.</P>
      <P>The emphasis is on greater production from the land.  How can we get more out of the land?  I am far from being an expert on land or agriculture. I know little or nothing about them, but the one question that comes to my mind is: Can we get more production by putting substantially more money into land and agriculture?  Can we get in by increasing the grants?  Is that the best method?  Is the payment of agricultural grants, to which Deputy Corry referred, the best method of increasing production?  I merely pose these questions.  I do not know what the best method is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Government were criticised and abused, and many sarcastic remarks were made about their decision of October, 1956, to set up this advisory committee, or council, between the farmers' organisations and the Government.  Fianna Fáil said: &ldquo;What?  Another commission? <Col N="1408" /> Another consultative body?&rdquo; But Deputy Lemass yesterday said, at the tail-end of his speech, that that is exactly what Fianna Fáil are going to do now, that was the first thing they were going to do in order to see how much more could be got out of the land.  I think it is a good method.  I think the previous Government excelled themselves in consultation with the public and in consultation with the people.  We have never said that any other body outside this House should, or could, control the affairs of this State, but we believe in consultation with industrialists, with manufacturers and with the agricultural community, and we believe that such consultation is for the benefit of everybody.  It was for that reason that a consultative council, or association, was established by that Government or&mdash;might I say? &mdash;by the Minister for Agriculture in that Government.</P>
    <P>There is one point that has not been mentioned in this debate.  Indeed, since I came into this House in 1945 I have never heard a mention of it from anybody on either side of this House. I refer to a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. We irritate this section of the community and that section of the community by imposing tariffs for the protection of Irish industry.  The Minister for Lands talked about incentives. We are all of us patting ourselves on the back and telling one another what great Irishmen we are.  It is all very fine to stand up and sing the National Anthem and wave the national flag and proclaim that we were out in 1916, and all that sort of thing, but we can be as good Irishmen as any of the generations that have passed if we make a contribution by buying Irish, thereby helping to ensure that Irish industry will survive.</P>
    <P>I remember on one occasion a proposal, which was accepted by the Government, to impose a tariff on agricultural machinery.  Agricultural machinery is manufactured in Wexford. Mark you, there was an outcry, despite the fact that the Irish-made article was cheaper, far cheaper than that which was being imported; but the Irish farmer in many districts&mdash;not in Deputy Corry's constituency&mdash;refused <Col N="1409" /> to buy the Irish-made article, preferring to buy the British or foreign article at an increased price.  If we can induce the people to &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; we will go some way towards solving our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The people in Kilkenny, for instance, are very conscious of Irish-made shoes. In Wexford, we are very conscious of the importance of Irish farmers buying Irish manufactured agricultural machinery.  Possibly the people in Wexford are not much concerned whether they buy Irish or British shoes; possibly the people in Kilkenny are not much concerned whether they buy Irish or British manufactured agricultural machinery.  If everyone could be made to realise&mdash;trade unions can play a big part in this&mdash;that if they buy Irish to the exclusion of the foreign manufactured article, they will be making some contribution towards the solution of the unemployment problem, we would go a long way towards solving that problem.</P>
    <P>I cannot see in this Budget what immediate hope there is of creating more employment.  There is some money for housing; there is a very small sum for the relief of unemployment by Public Works schemes; but that is not enough.  We shall await with interest the plans to which Deputy Lemass referred yesterday.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we are not opposed to proposals for remedying the situation. We have no prejudice against Fianna Fáil in measures we considered good for the people.  Indeed, since 1945, we voted with Fianna Fáil in measures that appeared to us to be beneficial. When measures did not appear to us to be for the good of the people, we voted against them.  We did not oppose merely for the sake of opposing.  This Budget, however, is something which the people did not believe could really happen.  They did not believe that such burdens and such impositions would be cast upon them.  It is for that reason that we believe the Budget is not one suited to the times in which we live or to the <Col N="1410" /> circumstances of 1957, that we shall, as a Labour Party, vote against it.</P>

      <P>During the past year, and particularly during the period leading up to the introduction of the Budget, the previous Government on many occasions pointed out that we were in a difficult period.  Repeated statements were made indicating that a number of problems had to be solved and that we could not look forward to an improvement in our circumstances, unless certain steps were taken.  The first steps to remedy the problems which existed were taken last year, initially in March and again later in July.</P>
      <P>Looking back now on what has happened, we can, as Deputy Costello said, regard with satisfaction the fact that it was possible to remedy a difficult situation.  It is true, and we never pretended otherwise, that any steps taken to remedy the difficulties that existed must impose certain disabilities, and possibly hardships, on some sections of the community; but, comparing what was accomplished with the dangers that were averted, and realising the necessity for the measures taken, we can appreciate now that very substantial improvements have shown themselves in the trading position, and the returns for the first three months of this year are confirmation of the wisdom of the policy of the previous Government.</P>
      <P>That confirmation is the best justification of the policy that was implemented and demonstrates, in fact, that the programme, which was initiated first in 1948, of expanding agricultural production has not only borne fruit to the benefit of the agricultural community, but has enabled the country to expand its export trade considerably, and has, in fact, provided us with the income wherewith to purchase goods which are not produced here and to provide for the essential imports of capital and other equipment.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16th May, 1957.</P>
