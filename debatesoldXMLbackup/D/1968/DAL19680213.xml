      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have arranged for an unofficial translation of the Benelux proposals to be placed in the Library of the House.</P>
      <P>The Benelux Governments have been informed that we welcome their initiative as a further demonstration of their continued support for enlargement of the European Economic Community and of their desire to facilitate the Member countries and the candidate States in coming closer together.  They have also been informed that we are anxious to play our part in any arrangement which would be constructive in leading towards membership. This is our position pending further consideration of the proposals in the light of the attitudes of other Governments concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available. However, certain data, bearing generally on this matter, are available in connection <Col N="861" /> with the compilation of the national accounts.  The data relate to public and private companies and all other corporate bodies.  The estimated direct tax borne by these concerns in 1965-66 was £23 million.  This covers (a) corporation profits tax on total profits, (b) income tax on undistributed profits.  Figures for the total profits of the concerns are not available but their estimated trading profits (net of depreciation allowances) in 1964 (out of which the direct tax may broadly be assumed to have been paid) amounted to £78 million, so that the direct tax represented 29 per cent of this figure.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will understand when he hears my answer.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate with the Official Report a list of the States which we recognise indicating those with which we have formal diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>As the list shows, we have recognised the State of Greece but it is one of the many countries with which we have not formal diplomatic relations. It is not our practice to take formal decisions to recognise the Governments of States with which we have not diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>The Government do not recognise Southern Rhodesia as a sovereign independent State and we have not accorded recognition to the Smith regime.</P>
      <P>Following is the list:</P>
      <P>LIST of States Recognised by Ireland as of 13th February, 1968.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the case of Greece the Council of Europe have suspended this country?  Is he aware that this is a question in which many European countries are interested?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise out of the question.  There are on an average several changes of government all over the world in States with which we do not have diplomatic relations and we do not do anything formal about it.</P>

Is the Minister aware that four countries in Europe, such as Norway, Sweden and Denmark have already brought the case of Greece before the Court of Human Rights? So far as I know this Government have not made their position clear in regards to Greece.  Is this another example of lack of firm policy on the part of the Minister?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The Government recognise the Federal Republic of Nigeria and maintain diplomatic relations with the Federal Government.  Recognition as an independent State has not been extended to the eastern region by Ireland or by any other country.</P>
      <P>There is a substantial number of Irish citizens, mainly but not exclusively missionaries, scattered throughout all regions of Nigeria.  We estimate that there are at present about 250, almost all missionaries, in the east and over 600 in the rest of Nigeria.</P>
      <P>My Department has been very concerned about the safety of our citizens in Nigeria and our Embassy in Lagos has given all assistance possible to those of them who wished to leave temporarily or permanently.  Before the outbreak of the civil war we sent the secretary of our Embassy in Lagos to the eastern region to keep in touch with all our citizens in the area, to organise evacuation arrangements and assist those who wished to avail themselves of them.  He stayed on there for several months for this purpose after hostilities had broken out.</P>
      <P>I may add that we have done everything possible to urge the leaders of Nigeria and other African countries to bring about a cease fire and negotiations for a peaceful and stable settlement of this tragic conflict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present CIE wages grade pension scheme, as agreed between CIE and the trade unions and confirmed by me on 2nd March, 1965, is based on the recommendation of the Commission on CIE Pensions and Sickness Benefit, 1964.  Under the scheme, the retirement income, including social welfare benefit, of an employee such as the Deputy refers to, amounts, if he is a married man, to £8 12s 6d a week up to 70 and £9 7s 6d a week thereafter.  If he is a single man, his weekly retirement income will be £6 16s a week up to age 70 and £6 8s 6d thereafter.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this level of retirement income compares favourably with what obtains in good outside employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> The present scheme is an interim measure.  The formulation of a final scheme is still under discussion between CIE and the trade unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister affirm that, in fact, the position is as I have indicated in the question, namely, that, for 50 years service, the pension paid by CIE is the princely sum of £3 18s. 0d. per week, that the additional allowances to which the Minister referred would be available to anybody who qualified under the Social Welfare Acts and are not by virtue of any power vested in CIE?  Even taking up the Minister on the basis of the figure of £9 per week for two people which he gives&mdash;and which is exaggerated&mdash;does he think that amount of money is sufficient to enable two people, in this day and age, to live, even where there are two pensions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the final pension scheme is being considered by CIE and the trade unions concerned.  I do not propose to comment on it.  It is for them to arrange the matter between themselves.  It is a matter for agreement between CIE management and the trade unions concerned. The social welfare benefits scheme was meant to assist and supplement pensions paid by companies: the Deputy is well aware of that.  He is also aware of the constant increases that have been taking place in the rates of the contributory pension schemes and also that such a scheme did not exist at all in 1957 in respect of old age pensions. There was only the non-contributory old age pension.  The Deputy should admit that we are making progress.</P>

You <Col N="868" /> will do your best to resurrect it in the next few months but it will not avail you because you will get the hammer. Arising further out of the Minister's somewhat provocative reply, I want to ask him this simple question which I put to him in the beginning: is he satisfied that £3 18s. 0d per week is an adequate amount to pay a person after 50 years service?  If the negotiations as between the unions and CIE in relation to these pensions produce a result whereby pensions are increased, will the Minister now tell me that these increases will be made applicable to existing pensioners?</P>

      <P>I decided in December, 1967 to extend the scope of operation of existing carrier merchandise licences which authorise the carriage of livestock in a restricted area so as to permit of the carriage of livestock anywhere in the State.  Under this concession, more than 600 licensees are entitled to have their licences extended for country-wide carriage of livestock and, to-date, some 300 licensees have availed themselves of this concession.</P>
      <P>I will keep under review the effects of my recent decision and should it be established that the issue of additional livestock licences is necessary, I will give due consideration to applicants whose vehicles are already &ldquo;plated&rdquo; by CIE.</P>

    <P>Recommendations for legislation imposing taxation and other restrictions on foreign spending by US citizens have been submitted to the Ways and Means Committee of the US House of Representatives.  The Government have made representations to the United States Government expressing deep concern about the possible effects of such restrictive actions on our tourist industry.  A precise appraisal of the effects on the <Col N="870" /> tourist industry in this country or on the business of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company would be premature until final decisions are taken by the United States.  Bord Fáilte and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company are studying developments closely and exploring the possibility of measures to minimise the impact on this country of restrictions of the kind proposed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The interruptions of postal, telegraph and telephone services last week arose, in part, from a strike by members of the Irish Post Office Officials Association, and, in part, from sympathetic action taken by the Sub-Postmasters Union.  Because of the inconvenience caused to the public, and in view of the reported threats by the association to take further strike action, I should like to inform the House in some detail about the matter.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, the Department employs a large staff of approximately 16,000.  That figure does not include some 2,000 sub-postmasters who are contractors to the Minister, employing their own staffs.  The Departmental staff are mainly organised in two large unions.  The Post Office Workers Union caters for the postman, postal sorter, telephonist, clerk and related grades, and the Post Office Engineering Union caters for technicians, installers and so on.  There is a number of smaller associations for the supervisory grades.  In addition, headquarters staff are organised in various General Civil Service organisations.  These unions and associations are all long-established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pay and conditions of civil servants, including Post Office employees, are the statutory responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  That Minister, in agreement with the various unions and associations in the Civil Service, representing some 25,000 workers, has operated since 1951 a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  That scheme has apparently worked satisfactorily so far as the staff are concerned and a proposal by the Minister for Labour to agree to substitute an augumented Labour Court for the arbitrator was not accepted by the staff representatives.  In the Post Office, since 1961, improvements in pay and conditions costing some £5 millions have been secured by <Col N="874" /> Post Office staff through it.  The sub-postmasters, being contractors, have a separate scheme of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>A new organisation was formed during the last two years, apparently by some Post Office clerks.  There has been a persistent minority of clerks who object to belonging to the same union as postmen and this is at least the third attempt to organise them separately.  The two earlier organisations&mdash;the last one was in the early 1950's&mdash;each disappeared after some years.</P>
    <P>The new organisation, to mark the distinction between it and the Post Office Workers Union, calls itself the Post Office Officials Association. It proposes to organise clerks and telephonists in opposition to the Post Office Workers Union, supervising officers in opposition to the Controlling Officers Association, and postmasters in opposition to the Postmasters Association.  Last week's strike indicates that it has, at most, the support of about one in four of the total numbers in these grades.  The activities of this breakaway group have been condemned by the other unions and associations in the Department and by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The larger Post Office organisations are affiliated to the Congress, and its procedures are available to dissatisfied members.</P>
    <P>The Post Office Officials Association applied last year for a negotiating licence from the Minister for Labour, and as they complied with the statutory requirements, effectively, a membership of eight and the payment of a deposit, they secured it.  Civil Service staff organisations are not in fact required to have a licence.  The licence authorises the association to carry on negotiations but it does not impose any obligation on anyone to negotiate with the association or prescribe any basis or procedure for negotiation.  Nevertheless, the executive of the association has used the licence to demand that negotiations should be on their terms. Spokesmen for the association claimed that the licence will give the association access to the Labour Court where its members will do better than under <Col N="875" /> the conciliation and arbitration scheme. This claim is in fact invalid.  The Labour Court is precluded under the legislation establishing it from dealing with disputes in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>When the Post Office Officials Association demanded negotiations, the position about the negotiating machinery in the Civil Service was explained to its executive.  They were informed of the procedure for joining in the conciliation and arbitration scheme and asked to give particulars of membership in the grades it claimed to represent. They refused to apply or to give the information sought.  Instead, they threatened to take strike action.  The Department had no alternative but to resist the threat and the subsequent action.  Or rather, the alternative was to let a minority of around 1,000, composed of minorities in every group it claimed to represent, wreck the negotiating machinery which some 25,000 of their fellow workers wished to maintain. Furthermore, the representatives of the other unions and associations in the Post Office have informed me that if the breakaway association were dealt with outside the normal negotiating machinery of the Civil Service, they would have to take protective action.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the association staged a series of two-day strikes throughout the country last week.  The strike was not supported by any of the other unions or associations.  Despite pickets, some intimidation, and appeals for solidarity by the striking association, the overwhelming majority of the staff, practically all of whom are trade unionists, reported for work in the normal way.  About 1,300 of all grades stayed out, 15,000 came in.  In the grades catered for by the association, only about one in four stayed out.  If the expression of a majority opinion were of importance to the association, it was clearly expressed.</P>
    <P>The association, however, is reported to be pleased at the result.  It says that &ldquo;services were seriously disrupted in every county&rdquo;&mdash;a rather smug boast, if I may say so, for public servants engaged in a vital service.  In fact, postal, telegraph and telephone services <Col N="876" /> were not gravely disrupted by the strike itself.  In the larger towns and cities, it was the counter services catering mainly for the payment of social welfare benefits, savings bank and remittance business which were those most affected.  In Dublin, apart from the night telephone service, the effect was negligible, as it was in many other areas.</P>
    <P>The Sub-Postmasters Union, which is, in effect, an organisation of employers, was not in dispute with the Department.  But it advised members to treat mails as &ldquo;black&rdquo; as requested by the strikers.  Accordingly large numbers of sub-postmasters refused to accept mails when delivered to them. The result was that large areas were without mails and large numbers of postmen who were available to deliver the mails were, in effect, locked out. This was done in areas where few, or even none of the Head Office staff were on strike.  It has been pointed out to the Sub-Postmasters Union that their action was in breach of contract.</P>
    <P>There is one other very difficult feature of the situation.  Postmasters, superintending officers and overseers are managerial and supervisory staff. The postmaster in particular is the Department's local representative, responsible for the staff and services in his district, the custody of official cash, the safeguarding of official property etc.</P>
    <P>One postmaster and four overseers who took part last year in strike action were warned at the time that if they did so again they would be dismissed. All five took part in last week's strike. In accordance with the warning given, they were given a week to put forward anything they may wish to say on their own behalf.  Other postmasters and supervisors who took part in strike action for the first time were warned against a repetition.</P>
    <P>These postmasters and supervisors took part in a strike which was, in fact, directed against the other unions and associations in the Post Office.  They did so not as a gesture of sympathy with their staffs but as members of the breakaway organisation and in support of its aims.  In at least one office <Col N="877" /> only the postmaster went on strike. The strike was opposed by the great majority of the staff in the grades which these officers supervise.  Now these officers are returning to supervise that staff.  I regret to say that many of these officers behaved with much indiscretion when out, both in relation to Departmental staff and to sub-postmasters. As a result, their capacity for exercising fair and acceptable supervision over Departmental staff or sub-postmasters has been seriously reduced.</P>
    <P>Last week's strike was a pointless one.  It caused quite unnecessary inconvenience and loss to the public. The executive of the association was warned before it began that it would achieve nothing by such strong-arm methods.  The great majority of their fellow workers refused to support the strike, and I hope that the members of the association will have the wisdom to accept that verdict, if they will not accept anything else.  The Post Office provides essential services for the community at large, and a strike aimed at disrupting those services is a blow, not against the Department, but against the whole community.  There are, at least, two peaceful courses open to the association and its members. They can seek to join in the conciliation and arbitration scheme with the rest of the civil service, or they can consider the recent public offer of the services of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions made by its secretary.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, which nobody could claim was inadequate, I would just like to ask him what he proposes to do to protect the public from this situation.  That is what we are all interested in.

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The incidence of the disease in Britain has been declining in recent weeks, though outbreaks are still occurring.</P>
      <P>As regards the special precautions that have been taken in this country, I have the position under continuous review, and, as the Deputies are aware, I have recently modified some of the controls.  The timing and nature of further modifications will, of course, be related to the developing situation in Britain.  I can assure the Deputies that the present restrictions will be retained for no longer than is absolutely necessary in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In what circumstances would the Minister lift the regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible to define the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this to the Minister before.  Suppose there were no new cases of foot and mouth disease in Britain for, say, a week to three weeks, does that mean that as soon as Britain lifts her regulations, we in this country will do so as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  Early on in this trouble it was the fond belief that it would come to a point where it had declined and some fine day there would be no case and there would continue to be no case for 21 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister anticipate that if there were no outbreak for 21 days, he would lift the regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In those circumstances they would undoubtedly be lifted. However, the pattern of this disease as it has emerged is a long drawn out dying thing and against the overall background of difficulty brought about for many people the three weeks clear period is not now regarded as absolutely essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-one days would be the minimum?</P>

    <Col N="883" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Twenty-one days would be the maximum.  If we had 21 days clear, there would be no problem about removing the restrictions.  What we must consider is how far inside of that, having regard to the continuing odd outbreak in Britain, we can relax restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread hardship being caused to small farmers due to the fact that they cannot bring their cattle to marts and get full value for them?  Is the Minister further aware that dealers can go from one farmer's house and from one farm to another at the present time and buy cattle under value?  In view of the fact that the Minister is allowing horse racing, dog racing and rugby matches to take place, does he not think he should allow the small farmers, who have to meet their rates and other bills, to sell their cattle?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that there were 80 cases in England at the end of November and you were taking no precautions here, buyers were coming over from England to marts here, and it was only when the NFA patrolled the Border, and on 9th or 10th December&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While fully appreciating the Minister's anxiety in regard to this very grave matter, does he advert to the exceptional difficulty of farmers living in the congested areas, substantially west of the Shannon, in continuing to be effectively prohibited from access to fairs and to marts because there are so few west of the Shannon, at a period when they know that the whole south of England, the whole of Scotland and part of the North of England are free from all restrictions? If this view is acceptable to the veterinary authorities in Great Britain where there is no sea barrier or no portal <Col N="884" /> frontier, has not the time come to consider seriously whether fairs might not be resumed at least in the west of Ireland, west of the Shannon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being seriously considered.  I would also say it is wrong to make a comparison between what is done in England and was is proposed to be done here in that they have the disease in England and we have not got it here.  Therefore there is a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>These problems are being seriously considered, and relaxations in the directions suggested by Deputies are being seriously considered at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it make any sense to the Minister to lift restrictions in the ports on incoming traffic while insisting that farmers have no facilities for selling their cattle?  The Minister is aware that there are many small farmers who have no fodder for their cattle, and whose cattle will be coming on the market in a very poor condition if these restrictions are not lifted if they are not necessary any longer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to minimise the difficulties that have been created for people, including farmers, big and small, but, at the same time, I am not prepared to go along with any exaggerated views expressed here or elsewhere as to the impact on the farmers in particular.  The fodder position this year, thanks to a very mild season so far, is not serious as of now. It could well become so but it is not at the moment.  I am aware of all those things and it is no pleasure to me, and neither is it of any assistance to me departmentally or otherwise, to retain these restrictions.  I would not wish that any Member of the House on any side would get the idea, or put it abroad, that I as Minister have any ulterior motive in keeping these restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

People who come from the land and who have any contact with animals, or who come from places which animals frequent, are still subject to the 21 day restriction and can be and are being prosecuted for any breach of this regulation.  There should not go from this House any suggestion that people are as free as the wind to come and go as they like.  That is not so, and will not be so for some considerable time.

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister is he not aware that the growing of feeding barley was introduced substantially into this country just 20 years ago when the Ymer variety was first introduced?  The price of feeding stuffs has gone up in the past month by over £3 a ton and, in view of that fact, does the Minister not realise that unless urgent steps are taken to raise the minimum price for pigs, people will go out of pig production?  I invite the Minister to ask his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, whether it is not true that in County Monaghan a great many people are getting out of pigs on account of the increased price of feeding stuffs which does not arise from any increase in the domestic price of barley but which has been sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the request of the compound feeding manufacturers on the grounds of increased cost of imports.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Dillon's sensible observation, I should like to say that this matter of the minimum price of pigs is being dealt with at the moment.  We are aware of the impact of these increased prices, brought about mainly by devaluation and the impact this, in turn, has on pig production.  We are fully alive to this and we will be making changes in that direction in the very near future.</P>

It will be appreciated that the period covered by these reports includes the spawning season when the apparent incidence of disease can be exaggerated by fungal growths, which are of frequent occurrence at spawning time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from Dublin Corporation, who are the responsible authority, that the excavation <Col N="897" /> referred to was the removal of the extensions to the footpath in Middle Abbey Street, at its junction with Lower O'Connell Street, which were provided in 1964 to narrow the crossing for pedestrians, following the introduction of a one-way street system in the area.  Temporary removal of these extensions was necessary to facilitate traffic during the execution of urgent necessary repairs at Bachelor's Walk, following a burst in a watermain.  It was necessary to close Bachelor's Walk during the execution of the repairs and to re-open Middle Abbey Street to two-way traffic during the closure.  Accordingly, the full width of Middle Abbey Street at the junction of Lower O'Connell Street was required for traffic as a result of this arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant of provisional licences and driving licences is a matter for the local licensing authorities who are not, in general, required to keep records of the applications made to them for licences or of the number of these applications refused by them.  In so far as the grant of a driving licence is affected by the requirement that the applicant must have passed the driving test, the position is that 35,000 tests were conducted in the year ended 31st December, 1967, the latest date for which completed figures have been compiled.  Of these applications, 19,554 or 55.8 per cent were refused.  Particulars are not kept of the passes and failures in each class of vehicle in which driving tests are conducted but over 80 per cent of applications received are for Class C or private car tests.  The amount collected in fees on all above applications was £35,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to make is that if a Deputy puts down an amendment which does not come within the Long Title of the Bill, he must accept the Ceann Comhairle's ruling but he could then consult the staff of Dáil Éireann to assist him to draft fresh amendments that would come within the Title.  However, if the Ceann Comhairle withholds a decision until three minutes before the Committee Stage of the Bill is due, then the Deputy is excluded from raising the matter he desired to raise because he cannot raise on the Fourth Stage that which has not been raised on the Third Stage.  Was it an oversight?</P>

      <P>My understanding of a Money Resolution in this situation is that unless it is necessary to employ additional staff in the shape of inspectors, and so on, the money is not required for that case, and authorisation for that is included in the Appropriation Bill and the Volume of Estimates. It is news to me that a Money Resolution should be solely required for the purposes of the prosecutions mentioned.  There must be something hidden as well in this.  There must be some other reason for this and the Minister should tell the House what else is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of subsection (1):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provided that the smelter concerned will be such as could cater for all national production of ore and ore concentrates&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move the amendment to provide that the Minister in granting a licence can do so only if there is a proviso added that the smelter will be such as will cater for all national production of ore concentrates.  I want to make it clear that I am not in any way suggesting that the wording of my amendment is completely happy.  The whole purpose was to produce an amendment on which to hang the hat of an argument on a matter on which the Minister for Industry and Commerce could not differ from me fundamentally.</P>
      <P>First of all, let me make it clear again, as was made clear on the Second Reading, that it is accepted and was acknowledged by the Minister and by everyone in this House, on the Second Reading, that there is to be no restriction on the export of concentrates provided under this Bill and that, indeed, the Minister has gone further, and properly gone further, and made it clear that there will not be any restriction on the exports of concentrates in the future.  It is necessary that that be put categorically on the record because one of the ways in which mining in Ireland has been financed has been by those who have smelters putting up the cost because they would be getting the concentrates at the substantial capital involved.</P>
      <P>In these days of scarcity of capital, we might find it extremely difficult to get the capital required for mining development, if not impossible, if it had not been provided to a large extent by smelters.  That was the method that was adopted for financing in the two base metal mines that are in operation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this smelter for which the Minister asks in this Bill, there is another matter that must be considered. The Minister, first of all, and I suggest <Col N="908" /> it was a gross breach of the decorum of the House, before he came with a Bill to this House, provided for the granting of a licence: he had already committed himself to giving the licence to any particular group.  I will not say. and I must not be interpreted as saying anything whatever against a group, but it seems to me very odd that where there is to be a provision for a sole smelter in Ireland, if such be feasible, where there is to be a provision in which one person, one body of persons, is to have sole monopoly of smelting in Ireland, that commitment was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce before it became public property that a Bill was to be introduced to permit and to guarantee such a monopoly.</P>
    <P>I will be frank in saying that I do not think it was Deputy Colley as Minister for Industry and Commerce who made this commitment himself.  I am certain the commitment was made by Deputy Lemass at the time he was Head of the Government, and that Deputy Colley, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, just as Deputy Lynch was before him in that subordinate position in the Cabinet in which Deputy Lemass was Taoiseach, had the power all along.  I have no doubt that the provision was there on the Minister's table and that he had to provide for it.  I do not think that anyone with any conception of what is involved here could deliberately flout the appropriate parliamentary and governmental procedure in the way this has been done.</P>
    <P>Let us see where we are.  This Bill provides that when the Bill is enacted, legislative sanction will be given to the promise that was made to give one monopoly the sole right to have a smelter in Ireland, that this right is to be given to that monopoly without any conditions to provide that the smelter will be of such size, capacity and nature as to be able to deal with such mineral discoveries as there may be in Ireland.  Many people could understand the anxiety of the Minister to provide a smelter, with all the employment that would go with it, for the purpose of ensuring that all our mineral resources would be fully and adequately developed <Col N="909" /> as far as possible at home, with consequent work, by-products and side industries at home.</P>
    <P>That is what I have suggested in relation to this amendment, that, having, as I say, made the <i>gaffe</i> of making a promise in relation to the granting of the licence&mdash;for what reason I do not know and I ask the Minister to give his reason for that promise being made before the legislation saw daylight&mdash; there should now be a condition written in that the licence should be such as to make certain that all our capacity could be covered.  I can accept that it may not be possible to provide that in the exact wording I have suggested.  A smelter could be put up tomorrow for all the known discoveries of base metals in Ireland and another mineral could be found a week after and obviously our legislation could not take account of additional finds.  But it does seem to me to be odd, to say the least of it, that no effort should be made by the Minister to ensure that the grantee of this licence would be bound to cater for the whole country, that he should be entitled under his monopoly position to set up for one sector only.</P>
    <P>Everyone will accept the view that where a monopoly is granted, it should be for the country as a whole and not for any particular part of it or any particular sector of those operating.  It seems to me that if the Minister wished to have this feasibility study&mdash;I am quite prepared to congratulate him on considering it&mdash;that the approach method was for him, as Minister, to get those who were in the industry in the country together and ask them whether they wanted to go into a consortium. If they did, the consortium would get a licence.  If they did not want to go into the consortium, those who did would be accommodated.</P>
    <P>We are dealing, of course, with a situation in which, according to the Metal Bulletin of May 1967, we have a prognostication that metal use will soar by 1980, that we will almost double the zinc utilisation, more than double copper consumption, have a 50 per cent increase in lead consumption and no less than a 300 per cent increase over the 1965 level in aluminium consumption. <Col N="910" /> These are big figures, figures which we hope will mean that the effect of the additional demand will be that even lower grades will have to come into production or will be able to be brought into production for the purpose of meeting this very heavy increase in consumption.  To put us in the position in which there will be one smelter alone in Ireland in those circumstances not able to cater for that position, no matter what the shipping transport situation may be to other European smelters, no matter what the political situation may be, is something that I think was very wrong of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister's objection to this amendment&mdash;and he has been courteous enough to indicate that he cannot accept it&mdash;is to the fact of writing it into the statute or that he feels that the position would be met by providing in the conditions attached to the licence that it must be shown in the feasibility report that the smelter will be adequate to cope with all the then known ore developments.</P>
    <P>There are coming up, we hope, other mining projects in Ireland.  We hope that the stories that there are, for example&mdash;I speak entirely from what I have heard as a Deputy and not otherwise&mdash;of the mine that has been found by Rio Tinto in Longford will prove correct and that this mine is one that will be developed and become public in the near future, with consequent improvement in our balance of trade position.  This is to me a company which, as I understand, has patented a special type of what is known as an imperial smelter which would not merely be able to smelt base metals, but also copper and do some other work also, and yet, that mining company has not been offered an opportunity of going into the consortium in relation to this monopoly project.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the way the Minister has approached this.  I thought he would agree completely with the views we have expressed on these matters again and again, that where a monopoly position is to be created, it is the duty of the State to ensure that the monopoly is not exercised by one sector alone for the benefit of that sector.  That is the purpose of my <Col N="911" /> amendment.  If the Minister's objection is solely to writing it into the statute and he is prepared to give an undertaking here that he will write it in as a mandatory condition to the granting of the licence, I should be perfectly happy to accept his undertaking, but unless there is some such undertaking, I find it difficult to understand how the procedure he is adopting can be justified, repeating, as I do, that everyone on every side of the House is agreed in endeavouring to do all we can to encourage, assist and promote the growth of the smelting industry here at home rather than send concentrates away, provided we can be sure the work will be done for the whole country in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman and I have been old campaigners over the years and we have crossed swords on many occasions and on other occasions we have been in agreement.  On this occasion I am in complete disagreement with his amendment.  He is, I am sure, speaking not alone as a Dáil Deputy but also as one who has a personal interest in the business of mining. I am speaking because of the fact that I have been an advocate of the mining industry since I came into public life. I pride myself on the fact that I was responsible for bringing into this country the people now running the largest mine in the country.  Let me make it clear that when they came in here they were regarded with disfavour by the people who then held high places.  When they came, a Government I supported was in control and Deputy Sweetman was Minister for Finance. I am not saying that he personally took an interest in trying to obstruct these people, but when they came, the word &ldquo;obstruction&rdquo; is a mild one to describe what happened when they attempted to get prospecting licences. Again and again problems came up which normally should not come up. However, they came in and they did get their licences, and they spent substantial sums on prospecting in places which did not yield mines or profit.  The old mines which they examined had been completely worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a change of Government took <Col N="912" /> place, a change in the official attitude did not take place.  It was only when they proved beyond yea or nay that not only was there ore in large quantities but that they had discovered it, that the Government, the civil servants&mdash;let me say it, for whom the Minister was responsible&mdash;were prepared to accept these people and to realise that they had not come in here to fill up sackfuls of gold and depart with them on the next plane.  They came in to run a business and to run it successfully.  In my opinion, Deputy Sweetman's amendment is an attempt to prevent a smelter being set up here.  I may be wronging him, but I am putting it plainly that it would appear that the whole point of the amendment is to prevent the smelter being set up.  If we claim to have a smelter which can refine various types of ore which can be found here, it can only be a claim.  In fact the situation is that a number of companies are themselves prepared to erect a smelter which will smelt all they are mining at present.  If Deputy Sweetman's argument is as strong as he claims, I can see no reason why the companies he is talking about should not apply to the Minister and be given a licence for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that if Deputy Sweetman's amendment is written into the Bill, it could mean that a smelter erected by one company would be prevented from operating properly because somebody else insisted he had the legal right to have his ore processed in the same smelter.  I do not think anybody would agree that this would be the ideal thing.  If there was a complete close down on the export of ore when the smelter was erected I could understand it, but the alternative to having the smelter erected at present&mdash;and it is going to cost a very substantial sum of money &mdash;is that we continue to send the raw ore to the continent and get the smaller amount of profit and the smaller amount of revenue to the State which <Col N="913" /> is being yielded from the export of raw ore.  It appears that there are vast quantities of minerals being discovered from month to month and it also appears that in a few years, if the industry is handled properly, the quantity of ore concentrates which will be available as a result of the mining will amount to so much that balance of payments problems will certainly not be one of our worries.  If that is so, I can see no reason at all why the firm which is at present prepared to go ahead with the erection of the smelter should be held up any longer and I recommend that Deputy Sweetman's amendment should not be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one thing crystal clear.  Deputy Tully referred to the Government of 1954-57.  The late Deputy Norton was in charge of the Department of Industry and Commerce then and I refuse to believe that when Deputy Norton was in charge of that Department he was prepared, in any circumstances, to permit any clog on development by prospecting licences by any group of any consequence. In fact, all the evidence is the reverse.  The interest that was shown in our mining potential arose because of the work done by that Government in relation both to the development of prospecting and the development of our tax code which encouraged that prospecting.  It would be very wrong of me indeed if I did not say that, to my own knowledge, this was one of the things which Deputy Norton was constantly pressurising to move ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Bill itself, may I say to Deputy Tully that this is not a Bill for the provision of a smelter?  If it were a Bill for the provision of a smelter, there would be an argument. This is a Bill to provide for a feasibility study in relation to a smelter and there is going to be an <i>ex post facto</i> granting of the licence after that.  If it were the other thing it would be a very different story indeed.  The position is not entirely as Deputy Tully seems to think.  Thirdly, is it because the Minister so interprets the phrase in section 2 &ldquo;by way of trade or for the purpose of gain&rdquo; that he suggests that a person is entitled, notwithstanding <Col N="914" /> this Bill, to smelt his own ore?  As far as I can see, there is nothing else in the Bill that in any way permits a person to smelt his own ore notwithstanding this.  Perhaps it will be a condition excluded by the Minister in the granting of the licence.  I cannot see where that arises under the exact wording of the Bill and I should be grateful for some clarification in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>May I hasten to say that I would be the last person in the world to claim that Deputy Norton did not do more than his share as a member of the inter-Party Government, or the Coalition Government, of the time to have mines developed but I still repeat that despite every effort he made and every inducement which he was prepared to offer, the people who were attempting to start a <i>bona fide</i> industry here for mining were prevented again and again.  Let me say further that it was only as a result of the direct intervention of the late Deputy Bill Norton that the licence was eventually granted to the people I am referring to to start the work in this country.  I cannot repeat often enough that every obstacle was put in their way by people who were in the position to put such obstacles in their way.</P>
      <P>As far as the Bill itself is concerned Deputy Sweetman knows quite well that despite what he has said and with which I agree as far as what it contains is concerned, the object of the Bill is the erection of a smelter in this country and the object of his amendment is to prevent such an erection at present.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to enter into the discussion between Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Tully as to what may or may not have happened in the inter-Party Government but I do want to make it clear, first of all, that this Bill does not set up or provide for a monopoly in regard to a smelter. What it provides is that a smelter to be operated can be operated only under licence.  The undertaking which has <Col N="915" /> been entered into, subject to the passage of this legislation, itself contains the proviso that any mine owner may erect a smelter for the smelting of his own produce, the produce of his own mine, and will get a licence for this.  I have said this in the House and I have, I think, communicated this to Deputy Sweetman outside the House but it is not provided for in the Bill because the Bill is not providing a monopoly: it is providing that a smelter to be operated must have a licence.  I have made it clear that this is the basis of the Bill and I have made it clear in the House and it is on the records of the House. As to the manner in which that will be operated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to make it quite clear that the undertaking, to which Deputy Sweetman referred, to the group carrying out the feasibility study was given by me and not by any predecessor of mine.  It was given by me because I was satisfied that if we were to have a smelter in Ireland, a thing on which all of us are agreed as being desirable, this was the only feasible way of providing for it.  One could, of course, indulge in a great deal of academic theorising about what should happen in circumstances such as this and one could propose bringing in a Bill that would deal with all these points but you would end up without any smelter in Ireland and my concern is to get a smelter.  We had here a proposal from a group who had been very successful in mining operations in this country to examine the possibility of erecting a smelter in Ireland and I think, more than anybody in this House, Deputy Sweetman is aware that there are very considerable difficulties involved in the erection of a smelter in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is even an understatement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the feasibility study which would have to be carried out in relation to it would be the feasibility of raising the necessary finance, which is very considerable.  I think Deputy Sweetman would already be aware of the fact that to raise the necessary finance, it would be necessary to be able to show that if a smelter were to be erected in Ireland, it could be carried on on an economic basis. As of now, I do not think there is anybody who would contend that it would be economic to erect more than one smelter in Ireland.  It may be that at some time in the future it will be economic to do so.  As of now, it would not.  Therefore for any group, no matter who they may be, to examine this question and examine the feasibility of financing a project of this nature, it would be necessary for them, in making that examination, to be able to work on the basis that if they were <Col N="917" /> to erect a smelter, there would not be another smelter erected on the basis of the production available at the moment.  This is the reason that the undertaking was given in the terms in which it was given and it was given subject to and on the understanding that legislation on these lines would be passed by this House and by Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>If I had followed the procedure now recommended by Deputy Sweetman and had withheld such an undertaking until the legislation had been passed, not alone would it have been very difficult to explain and justify to the House the lines that we are following here, which we would have had to follow later anyway in the legislation, without having a definite commitment. Not alone that, but some progress has been made on the feasibility study already even though the legislation has not been passed, and that progress could not have been made if the undertaking had not been given by me.  It seems to me very important that if we are to have a smelter in this country, we should have it as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman indicated that he realised there were difficulties of wording in his amendment and he rather suggested that this was a minor matter, and provided the principle was accepted, the wording could be easily dealt with, but I do not think this is so because it seems to me that the principle on which he is going is unworkable. It is not possible to say what the national capacity of production of ore will be within the next 12 months&mdash;I am sorry; it may be possible within the next 12 months, but within a reasonably short time.  Furthermore, if we were to adopt the principles suggested by Deputy Sweetman in this amendment, it would be impossible for me to have given the undertaking which I have given that any mine owner in this country will be entitled and will get a licence to erect a smelter for the smelting of the production of his own mine.  I could not reconcile that with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In view of what Deputy Sweetman has said.  I ought to say a word about this question of the size of the smelter.  I have an undertaking that any smelter to be erected will be capable of producing a minimum of 60,000 tons of metal.  Subject to what emerges from the study proposed it is possible that the output would be aimed at 100,000 tons of metal.  I understand that this would be at least as big as smelters built elsewhere in recent times with the exception of the smelter at Avonmouth which, I am given to understand, has an output of 140,000 tons.  As to the type of smelter on which there was some discussion in the House before, I have no reason to think that any particular type of smelter&mdash;and we have heard reference to the imperial type of smelter&mdash;would not be considered in the course of the feasibility study.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I make it clear to the Minister that I am not advocating that but that is a smelter, I have heard, that does two types of smelting.  That is all.  I only use it as indicative of the two-type job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>As I say, I have no reason to believe that any particular type of smelter would be excluded from consideration in the feasibility study.  I would also point out that under section 3, subsection (2) in regard to the granting of a licence and the conditions to be imposed, those conditions, as envisaged, would include such matters as the minimum size of the smelting operations to be provided for and a time limit within which such operations would be undertaken.</P>
      <P>In all these circumstances, having regard to what seems to be the only practicable way to ensure progress in getting a smelter erected in this country, having regard to the fact that we are not taking away the rights of mine owners other than the group to whom we propose to give the licence, it seems to me that what we are doing is in the national interest without doing an injustice to any of the other mine owners concerned and, in all the circumstances, I find myself unable to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is on section 7 or section 8 that I should raise a question which has puzzled me a little in the course of the Second Stage and Committee Stage of this Bill.  I remember being a member of two Governments and throughout the whole period, so far as I am aware, we were continually urging on the geological section of the Minister's Department to indicate the present position in regard to mineral deposits so that we might arrange for their exploitation.  I remember being peculiarly concerned in connection with the Connemara scheme to get the best information I could at that time.  What astonishes me now is that people not in the office at all seem to be able to go around the country and pick up stones and find mineral deposits everywhere. How does it come to pass that if these mineral deposits in so readily accessible form were sitting there all the time the geological survey of our own Department of Industry and Commerce never seemed to know of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Improvement in the methods of detection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is more <Col N="922" /> anxious than me to see the geological section of the Minister's Department vindicated.  Perhaps the Minister will say to me that in the last ten years entirely new detection methods which did not exist up to this have been evolved which permit of the detection of minerals, but what puzzles me a little is that it was not our own geological survey that discovered the deposits.  I am bringing this in on the ground that a person is liable to heavy penalties for making misleading statements with a view to getting a licence. If there were new methods suddenly discovered, why did not our own geological survey come to the Minister and say to him that all our geological maps so far as mineral deposits are concerned are effectively out of date; that we ought to review the survey with the modern methods so that these deposits can be identified and suitable steps taken for their exploitation for the greatest possible advantage to the community as a whole?</P>
      <P>Could the Minister explain that to us because it has occurred to me and I have heard other people ask the question, if these mineral deposits were sitting there, how on earth did our geological survey not know of their existence, seeing that successive Governments were urging on them to make proposals for mineral development and the impression I got generally was that there were no substantial minerals to exploit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be fair to say that the work of the geological survey over the years as marked on the geological maps has been vindicated rather than otherwise? What has happened is that modern methods of detection are so vastly improved that they have been able to assess the amount of minerals present fairly accurately. There are two places in Monaghan where under the old method they were marked and it was possible to know that there were minerals there.  When it was discovered they were completely worked out it was, in fact, found that there was gold in one of them near Castleblayney.</P>

There are two places in Monaghan in which there was lead and I mentioned them because, in fact, a considerable amount of money was spent on them by one of the mining concerns in this country. They were worked out.  The present one was discovered because of the marks on the maps prepared by the geological survey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just add a little to that?  I agree with what Deputy Tully has said, so far as it goes.  What I am about to say is not derived from any expert knowledge available to me as Minister for Industry and Commerce. I have not got information available to me that would enable me to give the explanation Deputy Dillon requires.  I am, therefore, about to summarise and add a little to what Deputy Tully says. Some of the important finds were led to by the work already done.  I think he also said that technical advances have made it easier to make those developments. In addition to that, it seems to me that mining of its nature is the kind of operation which requires a great deal of risk-taking and that you get people involved in it who have a particular flair for mining.  It is not reasonable to expect that you will get such people normally operating within the State service.  Furthermore, this is one area which it seems to me is clearly a field for private enterprise and not for State enterprise and the results which have been achieved seem to bear this out.  There may be many areas in which State enterprise would be superior but in this case private enterprise is superior.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The appeal commissioners shall be appointed by the Government and shall hold office during good behaviour.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to secure that another of the recommendations of the Commission on Income Taxation shall be carried into effect in this measure.  The explanatory memorandum to this Bill states:</P>
      <P>The section and section 3 implement recommendations of the Commission on Income Taxation to the effect that the Special Commissioners should be and appellate body only;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> It does not, however, go on to implement the remainder of the recommendation relevant to this particular topic.  In fact, the proposal in this Bill is in the teeth of the recommendation of the report.  At paragraph 775 of the Report of the Commission on Income Taxation, page 243, we read:</P>
    <P>The title &ldquo;Special Commissioners&rdquo; is not an apt one for an appellate body on income taxation, the adjective &ldquo;Special&rdquo; is not appropriate.  We recommend that they should be designated &ldquo;Appeal Commissioners&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>To the extent that I have read the recommendation, this Bill carries the recommendation into effect.  Not merely does it ignore the subsequent part of the recommendation but the provisions of this Bill are in the teeth of the remainder of the recommendation, which is that these Commissioners should be appointed by the Government, or by the Taoiseach, rather than by the Minister responsible for the Revenue Department.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Minister shall appoint persons to be Appeal Commissioners: that is in the teeth of the recommendation.  My amendment seeks to secure that the recommendation shall be carried into effect.  I directed attention to this omission in my speech on Second Reading: the Minister did not see fit to accept my proposition and said I was rather ungenerous in my approach as he had done what he was asked to do.  He has not done what the Commission recommended should be done and what ought to be done in the interests of the general public.</P>
    <P>These people who were known as Special Commissioners and, if my amendment is not accepted, who will henceforward be known as Appeal Commissioners, have a very serious duty to fulfil.  They are the arbitrators between the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners through whom they are responsible to the Minister.  They are the body responsible to the Minister for this purpose.  As the matter stands, they are civil servants.  They are part of the Department of Finance: <Col N="928" /> they are servants of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance now proposes to continue the old and, I think, inappropriate position that he should continue, as Minister for Finance, to appoint these people to perform these very onerous and very serious judicial duties which are imposed upon them by the Income Tax Acts and other laws.  Under these Acts, these Appeal Commissioners, as they will now be known, have the duty of standing independently between the Minister for Finance, or the Revenue Commissioners, and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>When the taxpayer is assessed with an amount of duty which he thinks is unauthorised, he has the right of appeal to the Special Commissioners, the Appeal Commissioners as they will now be known.  That is a very serious function which these people have to fulfil.  It was not merely that the commission thought they should not be called &ldquo;Special Commissioners&rdquo; but they were of the view that, so far as possible, they should be kept apart from the Department of Finance for the very reason that they are acting in a judicial capacity&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;judicial&rdquo; advisedly: I did not use the expression &ldquo;quasi-judicial&rdquo; which is often used in relation to these bodies.  They are deciding issues on fact and law between the taxpayer and the Department of Finance.  It is utterly wrong (1)  that they should be appointed by the Minister for Finance and (2)  that they should be under his control.  That is the position at the moment and apparently it is intended to continue that position unless my amendment is accepted.  They will be civil servants in the Department of Finance.  They will be governed by the Civil Service Regulations Acts which deal with matters of this kind.  They will be subject to the control of the Establishment Officer of the Department of Finance.  They can be demoted, promoted or deprived of their salary or increments in accordance with the decisions of the Minister for Finance, the Establishment Officer, in the ordinary way in the Civil Service.  That is utterly wrong.  They should not be in that position.  The Commission, recognising the very fundamental principle <Col N="929" /> involved in this matter, recommended that they should be appointed by the Government or the Taoiseach rather than by the Minister responsible for the Revenue Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance certainly gave me the impression, not merely in the explanatory memorandum but in the speech he made in this House and which is reported at column 1997, volume 230. No. 12, of the Official Report, that he was carrying out the recommendations of the Commission. He was carrying them out but he was keeping a fundamental control of them which is quite wrong, in principle.  It is very important that the taxpayer should know that he has a body to which he can appeal which is independent so far as the law can achieve it.  No taxpayer can have the confidence he ought to have in a body of this kind, dealing with these very fundamental rights, if he knows that the person to whom these people, who are hearing his case, are responsible is the very person who is trying to take from his pocket the money he is alleging before the tribunal is not payable.  That is wrong in principle. I do not know why, because we got no reason on Second Reading, having accepted one part of this recommendation, the Minister declines to accept the other part and persists in securing, in so far as this Bill stands at present, that these people will be appointed by the Minister in the teeth of this recommendation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to indulge in <i>clichés</i> or to repeat the maxim that justice must not alone be done but must be seen to be done.  It is of the utmost importance that the taxpayers should have a feeling of confidence in these people. They cannot have that confidence if they know that, in a matter of vital importance to them, in every appeal they make&mdash;and every appeal that goes before these people is a matter of vital importance to the person making the appeal&mdash;they are appealing to one civil servant against another who is subject to control, as a civil servant, to the person who is trying to exact what the taxpayer thinks is an excess of income tax from him.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I am not in a position to accept this amendment.  I am quite satisfied that the situation that has prevailed all along&mdash;indeed, since the State was established&mdash;with regard to these Commissioners has worked well. I cannot find any compelling reason to change it.  I think Deputy Costello exaggerates when he talks about these people being under the control of the Minister for Finance.  Even when they were Special Commissioners, they were not under the control of the Minister for Finance in any way in the exercise of their functions as Special Commissioners. They are likely to be much less so when they are specifically designated to be appeals commissioners. Apart from the actual wording of the statutes there are traditions and precedents which have great bearing on these matters.  It is preposterous to suggest or imagine that these Appeals Commissioners would be in any way influenced by the Minister for Finance in regard to any particular matter coming before them.  It is just impossible to contemplate any such thing happening.  I could not envisage any Minister for Finance attempting in any way to control these Commissioners in the execution of their duty or succeeding in any way if he did make any such ridiculous attempt.  The whole purpose in establishing these Special Commissioners, as they were before, and Appeals Commissioners, as they are now to be, is to provide a relatively inexpensive lay tribunal where the differences between the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners can more or less informal atmosphere.  That type of machinery has worked very well.  I do not see any reason why it will not work even better in the future when the administrative functions which the Special Commissioners had up to now are taken away and the Appeals Commissioners will be a purely appellate body as suggested by the Income Tax Commission.  I believe this is the right sort of machinery. Behind the Special Commissioners, even when they make a determination, there are always the courts.  The taxpayer has the complete right and freedom to appeal to the courts if he is dissatisfied <Col N="931" /> with the decision of the Special Commissioners, as they have been and the Appeals Commissioners as they will be in future.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not given one single answer to any point I made on this matter.  He has not given any reason why the recommendation of the Commission should not be accepted.  He says tradition has grown up.  If it has, let it be continued. Let these people have the further status of being a tribunal not subject to the Civil Service Regulation Acts.  I assert that in the last Civil Service Regulation Act the Special Commissioners, as they were then known, are specifically mentioned as being under the control of the Minister for Finance. Why is there to be a continuation of that position?  The Minister says there is power to appeal.  There is power to appeal to the circuit court judge.  There is also power to appeal by way of case stated from these very people.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that a taxpayer who knows that these people are under the control of the Minister for Finance&mdash; as they are in law whatever about fact &mdash;the person who will be hearing their appeal either by way of case stated or through the circuit court is the Minister for Finance who is making them pay what they think they ought not to pay.  What I am saying is that the Minister has not given a single reason why these people should not have this independence over the person who is employing them so that the taxpayer will have confidence in this tribunal.  I have appeared at this tribunal myself.  I have never appeared before the present Special Commissioners, whoever they are at the moment, and I am not in any way commenting on them.  But I was struck by the fact, appearing for the taxpayer at that time&mdash;it is some years ago now &mdash;that there seemed to be a close connection between the Special Commissioners and the income tax inspector appearing in the case against the taxpayer. They were interchanging notes, passing law books, interchanging precedents between each other in the presence of the taxpayer.</P>

There is no reason why they should not do it.  There would be an added dignity given to this body, an added confidence from the taxpayer. It would secure the same traditions as the Minister says have been brought to bear on the structure and operation of these bodies&mdash;this would still continue&mdash;but you would have a better status, more confidence from the public and the matter would be more in accordance with general principle than it is at the moment.

      <P>The adjective &ldquo;preposterous&rdquo; seems to be a little unsuitable on the Minister's lips in this context. This Bill ought to be in this House an uncontroversial Bill, a Bill for tidying up old anachronisms and bringing the law up to date in regard to a variety of matters relating to the Inland Revenue.  From the Minister's point of view I cannot see there is any practical difference between what Deputy Costello proposes and what the Minister seeks to enact.  It is highly likely if the Appeals Commissioners are appointment by the Government that the Government will be advised on their appointment by the Minister for Finance.  It is equally true that their appointment by the Government as distinct from the Minister for Finance does give them a certain status and does create in the minds of the taxpayer and his advisers the feeling that this is genuinely an appellate body outside the jurisdiction of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said more than once in this House that my experience of the Revenue <Col N="933" /> Commissioners and their proceedings, which is not inconsiderable, advising my own constituents or transacting business with them myself, is that I found the Revenue Commissioners, if they are met in a reasonable way, to be the friend rather than the foe of an honest taxpayer.  But it is true that there do arise cases where, on the text of the law there can be a genuine difference as to the correct interpretation in a matter of complexity.  It is true that it is right and proper in such circumstances there should be available to a taxpayer such an appellate procedure as the Minister himself has described&mdash;readily available and quasiinformal&mdash;so that expense may be spared.  It is poor consolation to say to an individual taxpayer who is not satisfied with the adjudication of the Appeals Commissioners that he has access to the courts.  I believe it was attributed to my own grandfather the aphorism or <i>obiter dictum</i> of the bench &ldquo;The Ritz Hotel is open to everybody&rdquo;. The Supreme Court is open to all, if they can afford to go there.  But we are asking a benighted and unfortunate man to classify financial legislation of this House by testing it not only before the Special Commissioners but the circuit court and the appellate courts thereafter.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some circumstance when Deputy Costello, from the point of view of one who has never been a Minister for Finance but who has been a Taoiseach of an Irish Government and who has been an Attorney General of an Irish Government, and who out of professional experience as well as his experience in government and in this House, endorses the view expressed by the Commission established by the Minister or, indeed, established, I think, by Deputy Sweetman to examine income tax.  They made this recommendation to which Deputy Costello attaches profound importance.  It does not seem to command from Deputy Sweetman any wild enthusiasm, because I suspect that anybody who has ever been Minister for Finance is in a certain measure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is one of the occasions on which the Minister for Finance might say with perfect propriety: &ldquo;While as Minister for Finance I think the present method is open to no conceivable abuse, the Commission take the view that this appointment should be made either by the Taoiseach or the Government or somebody other than the Minister for Finance, and this is the view to which Deputy Costello, standing on experience, attaches immense importance.  In those circumstances I am glad to accept the amendment&rdquo;.  We could, in fact, picture the Minister for Finance looking at the Ceann Comhairle and cynically adding: &ldquo;Not that I think it will make the slightest difference, but if it pleases Deputy Costello.&rdquo;  It is useful to do that from time to time.</P>

      <P>There is a distinction attached to the source of that officer's appointment.  There is a certain significance in who makes an appointment whether it is the Taoiseach or the Government or one of the Minister's of State, and in accordance with the source of a person's tenure of office his status is, in substance, fixed.  I do suggest to the Minister that if it makes no difference who the appellate commissioners are to be, there is a lot to be said for saying: &ldquo;If Deputy Costello attaches so much importance to that part of the recommendation of the Commission, be it so.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee whether the Government appoint them or the Taoiseach appoints them so long as they are appointed.&rdquo;</P>

We are doing that and, in doing that, I am quite certain we are meeting the essence of what the Commission wanted.  I fully agree with Deputy Dillon that it is completely immaterial whether these people are appointed by the Government or by the Minister for Finance, because in either event, the decision will be taken at the Government table.

      <P>We recommend that they should be designated &ldquo;Appeal Commissioners&rdquo;; and also that they should be appointed by the Government, or the Taoiseach, rather than by the Minister responsible for the Revenue Department.</P>

This responsible Commission, the findings of which have commended themselves to the Minister as being reasonable, recommended two things.  One was that the Special Commissioners should be Appellate Commissioners.  I think that is the word they used.

      <P>The Minister agrees that it does not make any practical difference from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, but he must see for himself that Deputy Costello did not ramble in here to hear himself speaking.  He came in here because he attaches some importance to the recommendation.  We must proceed on the assumption that the Income Taxation Commission set up by Deputy Sweetman, which sat for five or seven years, did not make a recommendation for fun.  That Commission consisted of a pretty wide spectrum of men, most of them very practical people, but not all of them approached this question from the point of view of the Department of Finance.  Is it not commonsense to suggest that if this Bill is to be considered in the atmosphere in which it should be considered&mdash;in common council trying to improve the machinery&mdash;the Minister should say: &ldquo;Very well, if you attach importance to it and if it will make no practical difference.  If it did make any practical difference I might have to resist it, but it does not make any practical difference, and if Deputy Costello thinks it does, that is fine by me.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Two things are involved in the change in the Appeals Commissioners.  The first is the removal from the Special Commissioners of any function whatsoever in connection with the administration and collection of revenue.  That is being done.  Apart from what is being done under this Bill, there has been a very big change in the method by which the Special Commissioners dealt with appeals over the years.  Undoubtedly it used to be a fact, as Deputy Costello has related, that the Special Commissioners sat with the inspectors of taxes handling the matter.  It used to be the regular practice that they would give the taxpayer the appearance of being complementary to each other in the submission of information, the borrowing of decisions, etc.  That has gone for some time in my experience, and that is a very good job.  I do not think anyone can make that allegation now.  So, the first thing recommended by the Commission is being met by the Minister and I can accept it is being met and met correctly.</P>
      <P>I do not think it really makes any difference whether the Minister for Finance or the Government makes the appointments, but I can see that other people could feel it would make an immense difference to them.  I would feel very strongly against the appointment of the Appeals Commissioners by the Taoiseach.  It should be the Minister for Finance or the Government, and I would not mind in the slightest which.  I believe that any Minister for Finance who was going to make an appointment of this sort would discuss the matter with his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what the Minister said about the dismissal of an Appeals Commissioner because he was not doing his work or was misbehaving himself, I do not believe any Minister for Finance, with any intelligence, would take that decision on his own without first bringing the matter before the Government.  Indeed, I think Ministers for Finance, although they may have power in relation to more junior <Col N="941" /> civil servants, realise there may be problems involved in asking a civil servant even to retire, much less dismiss him, and it would be entirely unlikely that Ministers for Finance would deal with that problem on their own.  I have a sort of suspicion at the back of my mind that it is only the Government who have the right to dismiss a civil servant.</P>

      <P>Obviously he has to take the initiative, but I would be very strongly opposed to appointments being made by the Taoiseach.  In my view, the Commission were wrong in that respect.  Appointments should be made by the Government as a whole. The Minister for Finance is part of that Government.  If people feel very strongly about this it is better to have appointments made by the Government as a whole, and I do not think it is worth the Minister's while opposing it. Frankly, I do not believe that there is in this respect&mdash;I say, in this respect&mdash; any secret motive behind the Minister's decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>He will undoubtedly take advice before he appears and anyone who is suspicious with regard to the method of appointment will, I presume, look into the relevant statutes to find out how and by whom these Commissioners are appointed.  If he finds the appointment has been made by the Government and if he is of a suspicious disposition he will very quickly come to the conclusion that this business of being appointed by the Government is all eye-wash because the Government are influenced to such an extent by the dark designs of the Minister for Finance of the day.  It is, I think, far better to come out into the open and say the man who will make the appointment is the man who will actually take the initiative with the Government and make his recommendations, recommendations which would almost certainly be accepted. We are only fooling ourselves if we say we are going to give any increased standing to these commissioners by <Col N="943" /> saying they are appointed by the Government and not by the Minister for Finance.  I agree that justice must not only be done but be seen to be done.  That, in itself, is a much better argument for leaving the section as it stands because then it will be plain and above board that there is one man who takes the responsibility for making the appointment.  Everyone will then know precisely where he or she stands.  The fact the commissioner may have received his appointment from the Minister for Finance can hardly be said to prejudice the commissioner so much in favour of the Minister for Finance that he, the commissioner, will fail in his duties.  It would be an extraordinarily unsuitable appointment if a man were appointed who was liable to do that.  I am against this amendment. I am looking at it purely as a layman. I much prefer that an appointment like this should be to all intents and purposes the appointment of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Booth's remarks call for any comment at all except to the extent that he overlooks, and the Minister likewise overlooks, that part of my amendment which specifies that they shall hold office during good behaviour. The amendment thereby assimilates the position of these appeals commissioners to that of judges who are appointed during good behaviour, and by the Government.  Civil servants hold office at the will and pleasure of the Government.  I want these appeals commissioners to be appointed in the same way as judges.  The Minister has not answered that argument.</P>

I am sure any accountant, solicitor or taxpayer who has <Col N="944" /> been before them on appeal would confirm what I say.  One regarded them as a completely appellate body, holding the scales equally between the taxpayer and the Revenue.  They were Special Commissioners.  Under this Bill they will have a new status.  Time and again I have got decisions against the Revenue, acting in my professional capacity.  On other occasions the Revenue Commissioners sustained their point of view.  I am quite certain that this body will be a completely fair tribunal.  That tradition has been firmly established and I cannot see that anything will upset it.  I think everybody, having heard the discussion, will agree that it is perfectly legitimate to have these Appeals Commissioners appointed by the Minister for Finance. The only exception is Deputy Costello; he has some reservations.</P>

    <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&mdash;Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan).</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we reported progress on Wednesday evening last, I had said all I intended to say, nearly all I wanted to say, on this important Bill to amend present planning legislation. I had indicated the widespread concern there was about the present position in relation to planning appeals and had also stated that I was aware of considerable demand for reform in relation to the method of dealing with planning appeals.</P>
      <P>Since last Wednesday, in fact only last night, I had additional evidence of this, if additional evidence were needed to prove that this is a very desirable measure.  In the Minister's constituency out in Clondalkin, I, in common with the other public representatives for the area, was invited to a meeting of the local parish council.  There were a number of items for discussion but one item which took up considerable time was an appeal decision made by the Minister in respect of a certain area in Clondalkin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we all know, throughout the county and throughout the country, in the various areas, particularly areas like Dublin city and county where so much planning development is taking place, various areas are zoned for various purposes, either residential or industrial. The area in question in Clondalkin was zoned as a residential area. It is a thickly populated area and the roads in it are narrow.  A certain individual&mdash;&ldquo;individual&rdquo; may sound derogatory: I do not know his name&mdash; made application for permission to build a factory in what is and what <Col N="946" /> could not be doubted as being anything but a residential area.</P>
    <P>The application was considered in the normal way by the local authority and it was turned down as being the essence of bad planning to permit industrial development there.  In Clondalkin there has been considerable industrial development but it is all in one area.  This application went on appeal to the Minister.  The residents and the parish council were aware that the original application had been made for an industrial purpose and they knew it had been turned down by the local authority.  They were as happy as Larry.  They were completely unaware that it had gone on appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is only now that the people are beginning to be wary of this.  They admit they were caught napping.  They made no representations to the Minister in relation to their feelings on it because they were unaware that the appeal had gone to the Minister.  The Minister reversed the decision of the local authority and allowed this industrial development in this residential area.  All I am sorry about is that the Minister was not invited to this meeting to explain to the people there why the decision of the local authority was reversed, allowing industrial development there.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of unsatisfactory situation that has been arising under present legislation.  The Minister makes the decision; he is advised by a certain group of technical people.  The local authority are advised by a group of technical people similarly qualified but with the added advantage of having local knowledge, but their decision is reversed.  In such circumstances, can you blame people for immediately saying: &ldquo;This is obviously the essence of bad planning.  The local authority say it is bad planning.  There must be some political influence or pull behind this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This suggestion is thrown up whereever this happens and I hope the Minister will find time to explain to the people in his constituency why he did this.  We all realise the importance of finding employment for people in <Col N="947" /> industry.  It is difficult to stop industries, but there is no point in zoning areas and in having good planning, if it can be reversed by one man, by the decision of a person who has not to give any reason why he reversed the decision of the local authority.  It is a most unsatisfactory arrangement.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill whereby the findings of an impartial tribunal will be available for inspection by people interested and concerned is an extremely important thing.  We are in an age when the State is regarded as the almighty benefactor, when everything and anything is given out in the form of package deals that people cannot understand.  We have a package deal for 3,000 or 1,800 houses.  We have a package deal even for the referendum on proportional representation. Every appointment, from a High Court judge to a man working on the roads, is made by political influence or ministerial influence.</P>
    <P>Therefore, at a time like this, when the people are concerned seriously and fed up with the situation, anything that can be done to dispel their anxiety and their suspicion of politicians generally should be welcomed by the Minister. I hope this Bill will be accepted. The Fianna Fáil speakers who have contributed to the debate have spoken against the Bill, saying there is no necessity for it, saying in effect: &ldquo;We do not want to lose this political control. We have the backdoor; we have the ear of the Minister.  The Opposition have not got it and it is an advantage to us&rdquo;.  In the interests of society and of politicians generally, wherever they may find themselves, this is something that should be changed.</P>
    <P>Another point that comes clearly to my mind is that somebody said the Minister can and does give permission with conditions.  I have known such permission to be given in the constituency I represent.  There is one case that immediately comes to my mind in relation to a builder's yard.  Permission for this yard was refused in a residential area, and quite rightly refused.  I am not telling any secrets when I say that the person concerned is a well-known friend of the Government.  He <Col N="948" /> is a man who comes out openly at by-elections.  He is a man whom I am friendly with myself, and a man, in fact, for whom I have intervened to get a factory where I thought it should be.</P>
    <P>He got permission to set up a builder's yard in a residential area where the people looked out their windows and saw objectionable builders' rubble and everything that is inevitable in a builder's yard.  This decision of the local authority to refuse this permission was reversed by the Minister at the time and he was allowed to set up this builder's yard on certain conditions&mdash;that he would erect certain buildings and would maintain certain standards.  He never put up these buildings and never maintained the standards.  The answer we got from the county manager was that these conditions were imposed by the Minister and &ldquo;we have no authority to enforce them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a serious situation and it is not one that should be overlooked in an effort to reform the present planning legislation.  The members of this Party expressed concern when the Planning and Development Bill, 1963 was going through the House.  We had amendments down and they were rejected. We see how unwise it was to have rejected the amendments proposed at that time.  We are very concerned about it.</P>
    <P>That concern is not confined to members of this Party or the Labour Party.  It is widely felt and the sooner the Minister appreciates it the better. He has evidence that the municipal authorities have passed a resolution asking for the impartial consideration of appeals and I do not know what further evidence the Minister or the Government require.  We cannot do any more than produce the evidence. We cannot do any more than propose the remedies.  There may be better remedies.  There may be alterations to the Bill before the House, alterations that might be accepted by the mover of the Bill, but we want to hear, very soon I hope, what the Minister has to say as to his objections and whether, if he intends not to accept this Bill, he <Col N="949" /> has an amended form to propose or what are the objections he sees to it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to hold on to the almighty power he already wields over the lives of many people and which seriously affects the lives and fortunes, good or bad, of many people and has done so already, there is nothing there is greater scope in than in this whole question of planning and development that will either make or break the individuals concerned.  I feel that people have been made and broken already.  It is time that power were taken out of the hands of a politician, taken out of the Minister's hands, and put into the hands of this impartial authority which it is proposed to set up under this Bill presided over by a judge.</P>
    <P>Whatever we may feel about the judiciary of this country there is still great respect for their impartiality and nobody will be suspicious of their word.  Besides, the work arising under planning appeals has increased, and it is impossible for any one individual to deal with it while at the same time carrying on all the other important functions of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the Department of Local Government have been enlarged considerably and the functions it is performing have been increasing as the years pass.  It is difficult enough for a Minister to do all the other work of his Department without this enormous task of bringing judgment to bear on so many appeals.  I believe the number of appeals will increase considerably as the years pass and as the people become more aware of the planning that is necessary, the development that is needed and which is bound to take place if the country is to advance and prosper as we all hope it will.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Clinton at all in his remarks in connection with this Bill.  I am very sorry that he should have digressed from the main arguments to level the usual Fine Gael accusation that every conceivable person and that every conceivable job is selected through, and processed by, political contact.  Deputy <Col N="950" /> Clinton knows that, too, and I do not know why he made such a statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>He knows it is not true in large or in small measure either.  Let us get down to the question of planning. I disagree with Deputy Clinton, too, on the question of the confidence of people in planning authorities and planning appeals.  We have to face the fact that every one of us is in favour of planning only in so far as it stops somebody else from doing something that we do not want him to do.  Planning is essential for my protection.  I resent&mdash;and I say that not because I am myself but the same as everyone else&mdash;not being allowed to do something because of the decision of the planning authority.</P>
      <P>That is where one comes up against it.  No matter how many appeals tribunals and commissions you might set up, the fact remains that people wish planning to be an endorsement of their own ideas as to what shall or shall not be done.  I feel that local planning authorities are very much at fault, too, in that they are far too apt to refuse permission in cases where they know and secretly hope that the Minister will subsequently grant an appeal against that decision.  It is very much easier for a planning authority just to refuse permission and give a few general grounds for that refusal, whereas a local planning authority comprised of people who are living and working in the area may well feel that they would create great antagonism if they granted such permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one case in my own area in Dún Laoghaire, a topical case which comes to my mind.  There was a proposal to build a new CIE hotel on the site of the present railway station at Dún Laoghaire.  Permission was refused by the planning authority and, as it turned out, the decision of the planning officer was improperly debated in Dún Laoghaire Corporation, and quite improperly because they had no power in the matter, not having invoked the necessary formalities.  It was decided by a majority of the corporation <Col N="951" /> to support the decision of the planning officer and to refuse permission for this new hotel.</P>
    <P>That is no harm and it should be put on record that the Fianna Fáil and Labour councillors joined to give the maximum support to this proposal, a proposal which obviously would add to the amenities of the borough and which would give substantial employment in the area as well.  The Fine Gael councillors voted against the proposal and made it perfectly clear they did so on the assumption that the Minister would reverse the decision in any case so that they would win one way or another.  They did get the hotel. A proposal such as that to build a new hotel on the sea-front will produce some local objection.  We had plenty of those local objections when there was a proposal to put the car ferry on the East Pier in the harbour.  Those of us who were active in the area received numerous approaches from the various pressure groups producing all sorts of seemingly highly technical reasons why the car ferry on the East Pier would produce traffic hazards of almost immeasurable proportions and do grave damage to the whole amenities of the borough.</P>
    <P>This small minority group worked very hard on the public in the area until there was very marked opposition to the whole project.  In the end the car ferry did come to the East Pier and has provided so far one of the greatest tourist attractions, as well as being the means of bringing into the country tens of thousands of tourists who would never otherwise have arrived here.  Similarly, in the case of this new hotel reasons have been given why permission should be refused.  The same old reason that we had with the car ferry, that it would produce intolerable traffic hazards, was produced. That, of course, is nonsense.  Anyone who knows the locality would know that.  This hotel would be dealing primarily with passengers just disembarking from the car ferry or passengers who are spending the night in Dún Laoghaire prior to embarking in the early hours of the morning.  The idea that 150 or 300 cars will arrive <Col N="952" /> simultaneously at the door of the hotel or that the total capacity of the car park would suddenly debouch on to the main road at the same time is quite ridiculous.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that a beautiful view of the harbour from Crofton Road would be spoiled by this very tall structure.  That was a stupid comment that could only come from somebody who did not know the area because, standing on that road, you cannot see the harbour now.  The station is blotting out the view completely as it stands and, except for the rather ornate frontage facing in an easterly direction, most of the structure of the station itself is an abomination and is in the last stages of disrepair.  Where you get a case like that where permission has been refused by the local authority quite unreasonably it is absolutely right that as a matter of national policy the Minister should have the right to review the whole matter and, if he is satisfied, to reverse the decision.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that at times the action of the Minister may offend certain people.  It is very hard to make any progress in any direction without walking on somebody's toes but there are always people in any area who are so opposed to progress that they will object to anything.  I have had cases in my own area where I pleaded with residents' associations to take a more reasonable view of certain proposals for development but many people are just opposed to change in any circumstances. People would almost prefer to see a piece of waste ground which has been used as an unofficial rubbish dump left there rather than have it used for some useful purpose simply because they have become so accustomed to seeing that piece of waste land that they object to anything new going in.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties about planning is that it takes a long time for the developer to get his plans considered in the first place and to get appeals heard and decided one way or another in the second place.  I see no reason to believe that the Fine Gael proposal will speed up matters in the slightest and I can see that it would be quite <Col N="953" /> possible for this appeals tribunal or commission to be influenced unduly by local pressure groups in such a way as to oppose general national policy on national development.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by Deputy Clinton that Fianna Fáil Deputies have the ear of the Minister at all times and the Deputy alleges that we slip in through the Minister's back door using improper influence to gain consent to proposals which would otherwise be thrown out.  That certainly has not been my experience.  I do not believe in making representations as such but where a matter is brought to my attention and I believe there is danger that certain relevant matters may not have been fully considered, I believe it is my duty to make sure that those matters are brought to the attention of the Minister and will be before him when he decides the appeal.  I have had cases where I thought I put up a very good case.  It was not a question of the political affiliation of the developer concerned but purely a question of a person wanting to do something in my constituency which appeared to me to be reasonable and where, to my mind, the developer had not put his case as well as he should have done and I assisted him to the best of my ability. I put up matters to the Minister which had not been previously raised with him and the Minister refused the appeal.  I have had a number of such cases where I did my best for a constituent fully believing in the reasonableness of his proposal but they were turned down by the Minister.  I do not consider this a reason for me to say that I have lost confidence in the Minister any more than if there was a case in court that went against me I would say that the judge was prejudiced or biased or had been asleep during the proceedings.</P>
    <P>This is something one must accept. There is every reason to believe that the Minister in dealing with these appeals will deal with them on a broader basis than any expert commission. This is a political decision&mdash; I use the word in the best sense&mdash;not a Party political decision; it is a political decision taken by the Minister in <Col N="954" /> the name of the community.  I would hope that the Minister would review the whole question of the activities of local planning officials because I believe that they are far too apt to refuse permission and rely on him to reverse the decision.  That alone is the reason.</P>

      <P>It is, exactly.  That is why the Department are so gummed up with appeals and why the Minister is being burdened with appeals which should never have been referred to him.  I cannot help feeling that there is a lack of real sincerity behind this proposed Bill.  I can see no way in which it would improve the present procedure and Deputy Clinton and others who have spoken on behalf of the Bill have not done any service to the community by their advocacy of it.  They have alleged all sorts of improper practices without any item of evidence. When Deputy Clinton was concluding, he referred to a man who he alleged was a Fianna Fáil supporter and who was allowed to have a builder's yard. Of course, the Fine Gael argument always is that if you are a supporter of Fianna Fáil, you should not get anything other than a kick in the teeth, you should not be allowed to have any appointment.  While I do not regard membership of Fianna Fáil as a qualification for an appointment, I do not think it should be a reason for disqualification either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have every confidence that any Minister for Local Government will look into appeals in a reasonable way and will judge those appeals on a national level in the name of the whole community, but I would be very frightened that any specialised commission of laymen, even though presided over by an impartial judge, might be influenced by all sorts of completely irrelevant considerations which would be in direct contravention of total national policy.  I am always sorry when an appeal goes against someone I have been trying to help but I would like to assure Deputy Clinton, and any other Deputy who spoke along the same lines, that there is no truth in the <Col N="955" /> rumour that a Fianna Fáil Deputy can get exactly what he likes out of the Department of Local Government or out of the Minister.  Certainly, that has not been my experience.  I have not done an actual tot because my records are not adequate enough, but I certainly feel that there would be far more cases where the appeal has been refused than where the appeal has been allowed.  In each case I have explained to the applicant, where the appeal was successful, that there was at least every probability that the appeal would have been decided in that way in any case.</P>
    <P>There are, I know, Deputies who will claim credit for an appeal being granted.  It is time we exploded that myth.  I do not believe that any Minister for Local Government has been seriously influenced by any member of his own Party.  I would be very sorry if he was.  My contention, therefore, is that the system as it stands is right.  We must not hand ourselves over to so-called experts, or artists, or people who have particular axes to grind in dealing with these appeals.  We are far safer in leaving the matter in the hands of the Minister who must answer, sooner or later, to this House for any decisions which he may give.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with the Minister, this is the kind of situation <Col N="956" /> Deputy Booth wants to retain.  I should like to say that so far as we in Fine Gael are concerned, we have been patient for far too long in relation to a matter which at times has approached almost the dimensions of a public scandal.  There has been grave public disquiet about the operation by the Minister for Local Government of planning appeals.  There are from time to time rumours current around the city and county, and throughout the country, about why a particular appeal was allowed and why a particular concession was given to a particular person.  I have sufficient faith in the standards of honour of Ministers, irrespective of what their Party may be, to believe that these rumours are not well founded, but I am concerned that a system which is at present in existence permits suggestions to be made which in the end are destructive of confidence in our institutions.</P>
      <P>It is quite wrong that so much power should be vested in one fallible individual.  The whole purpose and idea of justice is that it should not only be done but it should appear to be done, and we have known from experience throughout the centuries that in a public court, before the eyes of everyone, disputes should be settled and a decision should be given on evidence that can be heard by all, with a judge giving reasons which can be known to all.  It is for that reason that our system of public courts has, irrespective of individual aggrieved people, satisfied public conscience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are concerned with something that under the Planning Act, 1963, involves a decision given in secret with the reasons never announced. For that reason, the people in Mountpleasant Square, and in the area around it, are concerned at the moment with regard to a concession given by the Minister, the reasons for which are not announced and, apparently, a decision given in the teeth of what was held by everyone in the area as being sound commonsense.  Of course, when you find that happening, the worst possible constructions are put on the Minister's intentions and on the decision which he made.  In my respectful submission, you cannot continue a <Col N="957" /> system like this without causing continued public disquiet and without sapping confidence in our present institutions.</P>
    <P>We have been patient.  When the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act was going through this House, we sought by amendment to bring home to the then Minister the possibility of this kind of problem being created.  We suggested that in relation to these planning appeals, he should not exercise jurisdiction, that they should be handed over to the courts.  The Minister would not accept that amendment or would not accept that view, and sought to preserve the situation in which he and he alone had the power and the right to determine these matters as between one citizen and another. The Planning Act went into operation. We now have three or four years experience of it and when one finds that recently the municipal authorities who represent the different public representatives and authorities throughout the country, who are concerned vitally with the operation of this system, when they meet and consider the problem and recommend that a change should be made and that an appeals board to deal with these matters should be set up, that is not an opinion that should be just swept aside.</P>
    <P>Of course Deputy Booth would say it is ridiculous.  Deputy Booth would say we must not allow an appeals board to be set up because responsibility will be given to people who will be concerned with local interests. In the name of heavens, what is a more proper concern in relation to a planning appeal than the consideration of the particular district and the particular locality in which the project concerned is situated?  Who is the all-wise Minister who in our fallible society can bring instant wisdom to bear on each one of these appeals?  Even if I were an admirer or a supporter or a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, which I am not, I do not think I would be so carried away as to suggest that in that Party there existed such a man. What is involved here is that merely because a member of a political Party is made the Minister for Local Government, <Col N="958" /> he alone, among all the people of our community, knows just what is right to do and what is the proper thing to decide.  Was there ever such arrant nonsense uttered in this Dáil?</P>
    <P>In 1965, 979 appeals were presented to the Minister for Local Government. In 1966, 1,125 appeals were submitted to the Minister for Local Government. In 1967, 1,322 appeals were submitted to him.  How many of these did he ever see?  Only the special ones that he was asked to interest himself in, I am going to suggest.  What did he do with these appeals?  In 1965, 979 appeals were submitted: 437 of them were decided, about half the number submitted.  In 1966, out of the 1,125, 862 were decided; in 1967, out of the 1,322, 991 were decided.  What had the Minister to do with these appeals?  I am going to suggest that in respect of 95 per cent of them, all he did was to sign his name on a blank space on an order already prepared by the officers in his Department and it is they who decided the appeal, it is they who went into it, whether they are competent to do it or incompetent; whether they knew what they were doing or whether they did not know it.  The plain fact is that they were part of the process that churned out the decision.</P>
    <P>The small number of appeals the Minister interested himself personally in were perhaps those that Deputies approached him about and generally they would not be Deputies from this side of the House.  The plain fact is that when we talk about a Minister deciding these appeals, what in fact we are saying is that they are going to be decided by nameless civil servants for reasons never specified, on grounds that will never be disclosed.  That is the system we have set up.</P>
    <P>We have had experience of this kind of thing in relation to many other items of legislation that have gone through this House and there has been a general reaction against it in relation to a variety of matters on the social welfare side in relation to employment, in relation to people's rights of one kind or another.  There has been an insistence more and more that appeals should be decided by a designated board who will be known and who will <Col N="959" /> be in a position to state their reasons and it is in these circumstances that we put forward this proposal which I submit is eminently reasonable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth says that in putting forward this proposal we are not serving the interests of the country.  He is entitled to his opinion in that regard. I feel we are.  I feel that this proposal put forward by the Fine Gael Party is a proposal which has not been hastily contrived, which is put forward in no vindictive way, a proposal which is put forward by us because we recognise the need for planning; we recognise the margin for grave error which at present exists and we want to get the whole element of planning appeals removed entirely from political control.  Why should Deputy Booth say we do not serve the interests of the country in making this suggestion?  Why do Fianna Fáil Deputies proceed to was so impatient when it is sought to remove a matter of this kind, of prime importance as between citizens, from the control of the political head of the Department?  In my submission, the very fact that the Fianna Fáil Party oppose this measure, the very fact that they have resisted this Bill, is indicative that things are not as right as they should be.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we shall ever have any Minister I suppose in any Government who will be canonised as a saint. Certainly there is no living saint at the moment in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet, but if there were a saint and he was Minister for Local Government, I would not trust him with this power.  It is too much for one man.  There is too much involved, too much at stake.  If he were to give all his attention, all his time to a proper consideration of appeals, he would be doing nothing else.  In 1967, 1,322 appeals were submitted.  There are 365 days in the year.  That would mean that a Minister working on nothing else every day throughout the year would deal with no more than about four appeals a day.  If he were to do it properly, he should go and see the area involved; he should discuss and entertain opinions of people in the locality; he should make himself perfectly aware what the objections to the <Col N="960" /> proposal are and what the arguments in its favour might be.  If he did his job properly, I doubt if he would do more than one or two appeals a week.  But, still, Deputy Booth says that we must trust this all-wise Minister and he says, above all, do not let us get anybody else, above all, a judge and one or two experts, because they will have motives for their decisions which will appear strange to Deputy Booth.</P>
    <P>Sooner or later this is going to be done.  I do not believe that the patience of the public will long tolerate a system whereby a planning decision is given, often after public debate, often after public consideration, and that decision is reversed by a nameless person, a faceless official, who can state no reason because he is not permitted to do it and from whose political chief here in the Dáil or elsewhere no explanation can emerge.  That is not just.  It is not right. I have no doubt that this change will be made sooner or later.  It is better to do it now.  It is better to do it when so many of our planning activities are in the embryo stage, when there is still a considerable fund of goodwill behind good national planning.  This is the time to set up an appeals board.  May I say that on the figures I have available here, it is inevitable that the Minister will be forced, by reason of the large number of appeals, into doing something about it,</P>
    <P>As the Opposition in this House, we have put forward this Bill which has been drafted by the Fine Gael Party. It is put forward as a worthwhile effort to take a significant step forward in this whole problem of planning.  We do it with a sense of responsibility.  We do it because we are concerned with the public disquiet in regard to planning. Let no one say that disquiet does not exist.  We do it without apportioning blame to anyone.  We do it because it appears to us wrong that any one individual should have this very great power in a region in which so much is involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to feel that the proposals in this Bill or the sense of this Bill would eventually prove acceptable to the Minister and to the Government. We in these benches have been accustomed to so much of our policy, so <Col N="961" /> much of our ideas, being, in fact, put into operation by the Fianna Fáil Government in recent times that for the Minister to adopt this Bill or the idea in it certainly would be nothing novel or strange.  But I do hope we are not going to be faced with a situation in which the Minister and the Government will say: &ldquo;No.  We will have no change at all because we want to hold on to the power we have.  We want to resist any intrusion by any outside person or any outside authorities in relation to this field.&rdquo;  If the Government do that, I want to assert that they will be doing a disservice to the confidence which our citizens should repose in organised, legitimate government in this country. They will be doing a disservice to the whole idea of planning and they will be continuing a system which I regard as wrong and faulty, a system which permits rotten rumours and speculation to surround what may be a perfectly valid exercise of administrative power by a Minister or a Department.  This should not happen.  If things are to be done properly and above-board, if justice is to be done, it should appear to be done. I can see no reason whatsoever why a public hearing of these appeals should not be entertained, why a board such as we suggest, with its numbers added to, if necessary, should not sit publicly and deal with all these matters.  If that is done, I believe all the disquiet will disappear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House but I do wish to add my voice to what has already been said by my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party. I often wonder what the former Minister for Local Government had in mind when he introduced the Planning Act as we now know it.  The generally accepted concept of good administration is that things are made easier for people to avail of the services provided by the Government and by local authorities.  Now, when a person applies to a local authority for planning permission of any major nature, he would need to be a university graduate to be able to fill in some of the application forms and to answer some of the questions, only to be told eventually that he may not proceed to <Col N="962" /> carry out the project because his application contravenes some Planning Act.</P>
      <P>The legislation which was in operation prior to the Planning Bill introduced by the former Minister for Local Government may not have been the ideal or desirable legislation that one would dream of.  When the former Minister for Local Government introduced his Bill, he went to great pains to explain to the people that this was his concept of the approach to planning.  Indeed, when he took full credit for introducing this legislation, little did he think that some of us would eventually discover that this was but a good piece of legislation introduced by the Greater London Authority to tackle some of the problems which are more in keeping with the conditions of Greater London than the constituency which I represent.  I wonder why the present Minister has not changed the attitude of his Department in relation to this matter?  When we examine all the details of the present Government administration, not alone in Local Government, but virtually in every other Department of State, we find, as Deputy O'Higgins has just said, that very often it is more than rumour.  We find a certain vein running through each Department which can definitely be described as tending to be, if not completely, Tammany Hall.</P>
      <P>It is political control of virtually everything the individual does.  It is remarkable to note that in practically every county in Ireland the number of appeals which the Minister refuses is basically the same.  Deputy Molloy, I think, brought out the point that 50 per cent of the appeals from County Galway were upheld by the Minister. Roughly the same percentage can be quoted for Donegal.  I wonder what given right the present Minister for Local Government has or what extra powers he claims he possesses to have a planning appeal either upheld or rejected.  I do not think the Minister pays that many visits to Donegal. Indeed we would be glad to see him more often.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In a manner of speaking, we have too many of them. When an applicant is refused planning permission by Donegal County Council and when he is told his right as a citizen of this country is to appeal to the Minister, what extra evidence does the Minister require?  Does the Minister go to any part of the constituency of North-East Donegal, does he ask any of his staff to go to North-East Donegal or does he merely contact the local planning authority and ask them for their further observations?  Then, having discovered those, and undoubtedly he has discovered whether the person concerned is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party or, if it would be possible that if some extra consideration were given to his application, he would become an active member of the Fianna Fáil Party. Those may be rash remarks.  I do not think we can be accused of being political scandalmongers on this side of the House if we level those charges at the Minister, the Government and his Party because it is remarkable that if an appeal is lodged with the Department of Local Government and the person concerned is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, his appeal is granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never had the occasion to visit the Minister's office, either the present Minister or the former Minister, at the request of any constituent of mine.  In fact, any person who has ever approached me to complain that his planning application has been rejected by Donegal County Council, I usually advise him to renew his application by modifying the plans and, failing that, to appeal to the Minister or wait for 12 months, and if he is a good loyal party supporter, Deputy Cunningham or the two Ministers in the county will make representation to the Minister for Local Government and all in the garden will be rosy.  If this is not political corruption, I do not know the meaning of the term.  It is for this reason that the Fine Gael Party gave long and detailed thought to this proposal. It is why we moved it in the name of certain Fine Gael Deputies <Col N="964" /> and it is why I feel I should support it because I believe any individual in this country who obeys the laws of the land and who does not go into conflict with the laws of the land is entitled to certain rights.</P>
    <P>He should not, if he is entitled to those rights, have to go on bended knees, with cap in hand, to any politician, be he Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. If he is entitled to those rights, he should be given them and he should be under no obligation whatsoever to any political Party or any particular Member of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann.  The present arrangement, irrespective of what Government Deputies have said, lends itself to political abuse.  There have been many Parliamentary Questions addressed to the Minister for Local Government over the past two or three years relating to certain planning applications.  Indeed, political commentators in the national press have often commented, either by direct comment or by inference, on some of those major applications.</P>
    <P>I have no problems such as this in the constituency I represent, but I feel that the individual who makes an application to a local authority either to extend his business or improve his home is just as important to me as a magnate in the city of Dublin who is prepared to join Taca or is prepared to give a substantial sum to the Fianna Fáil election fund or to the Fianna Fáil Party.  However, the situation is simply different.  This individual who controls a lot of power in the city, in many cases more power than the backbencher Deputies of the Government Party, can persuade the Minister for Local Government to give more favourable consideration to his appeal than the humble citizen in rural Ireland who feels, by the standards of commonsense, that he is doing what he is expected to do, that he is living as a good citizen, that he is providing a living for his wife and his family, that he is building a business.  But, for some petty reason, very often a reason which is difficult to understand, an application by him is rejected by the planning officer and his only alternative is to appeal to the Minister for Local Government.  That appeal may lie with <Col N="965" /> the Minister for Local Government for as long as he feels it should stay there.  Out of frustration, or for some other just reason, the person may be driven to the point of having to consult with a public representative.</P>
    <P>Let us say, for the sake of argument, that this person is not of the same political persuasion as the Minister or the present Government.  Let us say that he consults with a Deputy from the Opposition Parties who, in his own interest, tells him either to amend his application or to talk kindly to somebody close to the Minister.  That person can be put into the position of having to use all due influence on the Fianna Fáil Deputy: by that I mean not that any financial reward should take place but that he might persuade the Government Deputy that, from now on, he will support him when, in fact, he has no intention of doing so. This, to me, is not alone bad planning but is creating a situation where an honest-to-goodness hard-working individual may be forced to tell a lie in order to succeed with a planning appeal.  I question the morals of it.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Molloy has as good a knowledge of morals as I have.  Thank God, I live a good Christian life.  I have nothing to be ashamed of.  I was sent here by people to represent them and I shall do that as best I can until such time as they select someone better.  In the meantime.  I do not want any lecture from Deputy Molloy about morals or anything else.  Let him be a good boy and sit up there on the back bench and &ldquo;keep in&rdquo; with the right wing of the Party and not make the same mistake as he made the last time and then someone might invite him down a bench or two.  Let Deputy Molloy not forget that some of the people who send their appeals to the Minister for Local Government consult with people who are not backbench members of the Fianna Fáil Party nor, indeed, are they Members of this House at all but, in many cases, they have a lot more influence with the Minister for Local <Col N="966" /> Government than, perhaps, Deputy Molloy has.  I should hesitate to name a few of these individuals but eventually they will be discovered and they will be named.  When that time arrives, I hope Deputy Molloy's morals will be as clean as he would have us believe they are at the moment.</P>
      <P>As I was saying, the number of planning appeals dealt with by the Minister is approximately 24 per week.  I wonder how often the Minister inspects any of these appeals.  I wonder if he does it all in a particular week or if these applications are dealt with as they come forward to his desk.  I wonder what the position would be should the appeal of somebody in Waterville, County Kerry, be on his desk together with that of another individual from, say, North Donegal.  Would the Minister get into his State car and head off for a drive to the Ring of Kerry and then head back to Bloody Foreland in County Donegal just to inspect the subjects of these applications?  I am quite sure that when he signs his name to the order he signs it to the proper order, either to reject or to uphold the appeal.  What information has the Minister to guide him before he puts pen to paper?  Has the Minister any information whatsoever other than that of his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash;as I say, strong supporters of that Party who are not Members of the House?  Is this the only information that is required?  Is this the standard of merit on which the Minister for Local Government bases his decision on a planning appeal?</P>
      <P>It is not unreasonable to suggest that if a commission were set up, and if this body were continually to examine planning appeals, they would amass a large amount of information which would guide them and one would not have to belong to a political Party or to be &ldquo;well in&rdquo; with the local TD or with any other person who might have influence with the Minister for Local Government in order to ensure that his appeal was upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present system is undemocratic. It does not help towards an improvement in our modern society.  It has nothing to commend it.  In fact, the reverse would be the position, in my <Col N="967" /> opinion.  I, therefore, appeal&mdash;vainly, no doubt&mdash;to the Minister for Local Government to reconsider this whole aspect of the matter.  I ask him to give serious consideration to the acceptance of this motion.  If he does so, I shall perhaps be able to avail of an opportunity to congratulate him on being fair-minded.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, I consider that the present system is not a good one.  It is too open to abuse.  It is too open to charges of political corruption, be they correct or incorrect.  It shakes the confidence of the average person in the street who finds that, for some unknown reason, his appeal has been rejected while, on the other hand, the appeal of some neighbour has been upheld.  They cannot understand why these things should happen.  If there is no reason but the reason of political corruption, I would not blame them for using it, particularly in view of the record of the present Government Party.</P>

      <P>I would have thought that the Minister would have been extremely glad to get rid of this difficult business.  I do not want to impute any sort of skulduggery or favouritism or partisanship to the Minister, his predecessor or anybody else, but inevitably with the 1963 Act now becoming operative and taking into account the complexity of modern planning, such criticism cannot be avoided.  There is the old maxim that not only should justice be done but that it should be seen to be done.  Even if the Minister were a paragon of virtue or like God Himself, were somebody who never made a mistake, because of the complexity of the problem and the number of decisions to be made&mdash;largely by his officers and only signed by the Minister&mdash;the probability is that there will be criticism on the basis or unfairness, or worse, by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that this suggestion of ours to have a judicial <Col N="968" /> appeals body with representation by the Minister would have met with his complete approval and, since he would have a vast majority in this House to back him, that he would have immediately adopted our Bill.  I do not know whether it is a case of being a trifle petulant and small boyish, deciding he will not play with our football, but whatever the reason, he has not accepted.  I do not know what kind of defence he can produce against this proposal.  There does not seem to be any logical defence.  We examined the situation carefully before introducing this measure.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why this proposal is important in the existing situation is that the Department of Local Government or a local authority is often an interested party in the decision of an appeal.  I can quote an instance where a local authority refused a planning appeal for the construction of flats because there was some minor building outside the existing building.  If the plan for the particular area had been carried out, the building to be renovated and adapted to make flats would have been demolished.  The line taken by the local authority officials was that if the plans that had been adopted meant anything, let the Minister for Local Government produce whatever the figure might be, £5,000 or £10,000, in order to demolish this building.  The appeal lies with the Minister for Local Government and the whole thing hangs in the balance for at least 18 months.</P>
    <P>I confess to a personal interest in the matter.  I want to make my contribution without criticising him, but I believe it is wrong that he should be put in the awkward situation of being an interested party, the person to whom recourse would be had for money if there is arbitration, and at the same time, being the judicial person who eventually signs his name to the appeal decision, granting it or otherwise.  That seems to me to be in contravention of the normal practice of the law and fraught with danger and injustice.  I want to make it quite clear that in this instance there is no thought in my mind that there is any injustice. Nothing could be further from my mind either in regard to the local <Col N="969" /> authority or the Minister's office.  At the same time, it would appear to the uninitiated person not acquainted with these matters, a person who is not a member of the Dáil or of a local authority, that there is full circumstantial evidence of injustice.  The Minister must suffer because of that circumstantial evidence, not merely in one case but in a myriad of cases all over Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let us face it: the Planning and Development Act, 1963, is going to create a multiplicity of these appeals. We are right in the middle of this.  The upsurge in the number of appeals and rejections is going to be fantastically enlarged in the years to come.  Another question arises similar to what we have been discussing.  If, for instance, a dutiful officer of a local authority desires to create a site for building and get an entry to a particular place, we find extraordinary powers are given to county managers under sections 77 and 74 of the Act.  But, apart from that, there is the refusal of an application for permission to build.  If an individual is in the position that his house is in the way of development and if he has applied for a reconstruction grant and permission to provide another bedroom for his enlarged family, then if the local official feels that this is to a certain extent prejudicial to future development&mdash;the development he desires but which may not even be at the planning stage&mdash;he can refuse this application.  Again the Minister becomes an interested party because if this opening was made at this place, perhaps local authority houses could be built, and the Minister would not like being criticised for not building houses when people need them.  Therefore, he is an interested party.  On the other hand, a judicial body might decide that that local authority official was wrong and might tell him: &ldquo;You could have made this entrance 50 yards further up the street and you could have built your houses without interrupting this man building an extra bedroom for his family.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If there are interested parties, it means that power is thrown into one hand, and that hand is a political hand.  I am sure the Minister signs as <Col N="970" /> many political letters as I do a week&mdash; anything from 150 to 200.  These people are suppliants to politicians who in many cases can do nothing for them except tell them, as a solicitor would, the exact legal position.  If the Minister is to have this number of suppliants in a week, it is incorrect that, at the same time, he should be in a judicial capacity in respect of this question of appeals.  The whole structure of the law would not allow this. I am absolutely certain that if I signed a political letter or made a political phone call an behalf of a constituent to a circuit court judge or a district justice, that district justice or judge would be inflamed beyond belief, would regard my act as most improper and as something I should not have in any circumstances done.  Yet the Minister must receive his political letters and representations, as I and every other Deputy do, and at the same time act in this judicial capacity.  Why he does not want to get out the side door and leave this extremely difficult job to somebody else who could act in that judicial capacity and without the difficulty of influence, I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>Again there is the question of appeal under section 74 and section 77 of the Act.  I should like to draw attention to a case in my constituency where our county manager&mdash;and I am chairman of the county council myself&mdash;has indicated he wants to acquire a portion of land from a businessman and hand it to another businessman.  If that is to be done, there could be action under section 4 by the county council or there could be an appeal; in either case, the man who sits opposite to us would himself act in a judicial capacity.  In my view, that is quite improper, and the Minister should accede to our request.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 33, after &ldquo;officer&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not below the rank of inspector&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are related and may be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me we would all be in favour of reasonable delegation by the Revenue Commissioners but that it would not be reasonable to delegate below a certain rank the tasks that up to this have been the sole function of the Commissioners themselves.  I do not want to suggest for a moment that the Revenue Commissioners are likely to delegate to the office boy.  Of course they are not, but there is an important principle involved here that we should retain in the Act, and that principle is that we should not delegate functions of the Revenue Commissioners as such to a person below the rank of inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that in many other pieces of legislation there is a similar provision that one cannot go too much below a certain rank, and it seems to me that this is <i>par excellence</i> a case in which that principle should be protected.  As I understand it, the inspector of taxes is the one grade for this class of work and certainly one should not go below it.  The effect of the amendment would be to protect in the statute a principle that is vital, even though I am not going to suggest for an <Col N="973" /> instant that it is likely to be abrogated in practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to suggest to the House that neither of these two amendments is really necessary.  In fact it might cause us difficulty if we were to adopt them.  In the first place, I should like to refer to a technical point, that is, that there are officers in the Revenue who would have the same standing and status as an inspector of taxes but who are not actually inspectors, and it would be quite unrealistic to suggest that these officers should not be trusted with the responsibility of making assessments.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, there is the fact that we hope to continue to streamline the whole administration of Revenue.  As Deputies know, we are very well advanced with the programme of computerisation. Before very long we might be delegating the power to make assessments not alone to this officer or that officer but to computers.  Therefore, this would be unnecessarily restrictive on the Revenue in their attempts to streamline the administration and achieve economies of staff.  Deputy Sweetman said himself he is prepared to accept that the Revenue authorities will not delegate lightly or without due consideration, and I think he might perhaps rely on their discretion in this regard without putting a strict statutory limitation on the extent to which they can delegate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intrigued by the Minister's suggestion that there are people who are of the status of inspectors but who are not inspectors.  As I understand it, in a district where there is more than one inspector they all rank as inspectors and would all rank as inspectors for the purposes of this amendment.  It would not be only the senior inspector in that district, and I cannot understand how any streamlining could be done below that.  Even if a computer produces a result, there will have to be some certification by someone on it because it would be very wrong to dish it out from the computer without somebody accepting responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Our assessments must show adequate detail and this is not going to get an assessment in one global figure of £X with tax of £Y.  If the intention is to streamline it, this is far from it.  In fact, it is the reverse. This will mean that the whole works will get bogged down by people raising queries.</P>
      <P>There is another question I want to ask the Minister.  So far as I know there is no statutory provision covering this matter.  Is there anything, any custom or extra-statutory provision, whereby the rank to which the delegation is made is tabled in any shape or form?  Nothing like that has been tabled here because this has never been done here before.  In similar legislation is there any order that directs the rank below which it will be not delegated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean any internal document of Revenue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have seen this before.  I think it has something to do with the Diseases of Animals Acts.  I cannot guarantee my memory on this.  I think there is something that directs that the rank shall be such and such.  If the Minister feels any great difficulty in accepting this in the statute itself, I would press him very hard to agree to it as an extra-statutory matter.  A list of the authorised officers to whom the delegation was being made should be tabled in the House from time to time.  As I understand it, the Revenue Commissioners will not say: &ldquo;An officer called Michael Casey can do this.&rdquo;  They will say that in the signing of an assessment or the taking of a decision about certain allowances, an officer of the rank of inspector or the equivalent will be entitled to act in the name of the Revenue Commissioners.  If that type of prescription of delegation is in the Act, it should be available to the House so that if it is too low, the matter can appropriately be raised here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will consider <Col N="975" /> that.  On a point of information, there are many General Service officers on the staff of the Revenue Commissioners with a considerable amount of technical experience who are not actually inspectors of taxes but would rank below in the hierarchy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They would rank below?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be possible for the Minister's advisers with technical knowledge to grade it so that it would not go below the rank of inspector or the equivalent which would cover the situation.  An assistant inspector is an inspector, I think.  There are senior inspectors in districts with several others in the district who would be assistant inspectors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would give some indication of the type of matter proposed to be dealt with by delegation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say in any positive way what we will or will not delegate.  No doubt the vast body of assessments will be made by inspectors.  A great deal of this work is becoming more and more automatic and capable of being mechanised or computerised.  I feel that it will be possible as we streamline the organisation to take increasing blocks of assessments and have them handled more or less automatically.  Someone at a higher level would naturally have responsibility.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 23, to delete &ldquo;or neglect&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Candidly, I do not understand the purpose of the Minister in this section. I had thought it was agreed that the Minister had agreed he would prohibit going back beyond ten years except in cases of fraud.  We all accept at once that if there is a case of fraud, there is no reason on earth why the Minister should not be able to go back, because why should a person who acted deliberately fraudulently get away and the rest of us have to pay his share?  As I read the section now, it goes very much further than that.  Subsection (2) (a) states:</P>
      <P>Subject to any provision allowing a longer period in any class of case, an assessment or an additional first assessment may be made at any time not later than ten years after the end of the year to which the assessment relates:</P>
      <P>Provided that in a case in which any form of fraud or neglect has been committed by or on behalf of any person in connection with or in relation to income tax, an assessment or an additional first assessment may be made at any time for any year for which, by reason of the fraud or neglect, income tax would otherwise be lost to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a statutory obligation on everybody to make a return of his income.  If a person by mistake leaves out an item from his income and that omission goes unnoticed during 20 years, the Revenue Commissioners are <Col N="985" /> entitled to go back those 20 years.  If a person has, for example, a genuine view that particular types of moneys are not income within the meaning of the Income Tax Act and therefore omits them, there is a judicial decision confirming that the opinion of that person and his adviser, be it an accountant or a solicitor or past solicitor or past inspector of taxes, is wrong.  But the man left it out of his return <i>bona fide</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 4, to insert the following paragraph after line 28:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  (i) In a case in which emoluments to which this subparagraph applies are received in a year of assessment subsequent to that for which they are assessable, paragraph (a) shall have effect in the case of assessments or additional first assessments in respect of the emoluments subject to the substitution of a reference to the end of the year of assessment in which the emoluments were received for the reference to the end of the year to which the assessment relates.</P>
      <P>(ii)  The emoluments to which the foregoing subparagraph applies are emoluments as defined in section 110 (2), including any payments chargeable to tax by virtue of Chapter II of Part V and any sums which by virtue of Chapter III of Part V fall to be treated as perquisites of a person's office or employment, being emoluments, payments or sums other than those taken into account in an assessment to income tax for the year of assessment in which they are received; and for the purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="988" /> (I)  any such payment shall, notwithstanding anything in section 114 (4), be treated as having been received at the time it was actually received, and</P>
    <P>(II)  any such sums which are not actually paid to that person shall be treated as having been received at the time when the relevant expenses were incurred or are treated for the purposes of the said Chapter III as having been incurred.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The necessity for this amendment arises out of the new ten-year provision. In the normal case, the ten-year limit for making assessments will run from the year for which the income is assessable.  The general effect of this amendment is that if emoluments are received in a year later than the year for which they are assessable, the ten-year time limit will then run from the year in which the emoluments are actually received.  The reason for that would be obvious.  It would be possible for people to delay making the payments and so get outside the ten years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where an assessment or an additional first assessment is proposed to be made by virtue of paragraph (a) or by virtue of paragraphs (a) and (b) of the subsection substituted by subsection (1), it shall not be made&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in case it is proposed to be made by virtue of the said paragraph (a), if it is an assessment relating to a year prior to the year 1961-62, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  in case it is proposed to be made by virtue of the said paragraphs (a) and (b), if the time of receipt (within the meaning of the said paragraph (b)) of the emoluments, payments or sums was prior to the year 1961-62, <Col N="989" /> save in a case coming within the proviso to the said paragraph (a).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I might say a general word here to explain a number of these amendments. Up to now, as I explained on Second Reading, the practice of the Revenue Commissioners has been not to go back more than six years, except in cases of fraud or neglect.  I argued strongly on Second Stage and on last year's Finance Bill that that practice should be continued. As the House knows, some Deputies were not satisfied and they thought we should have a statutory provision and, being the reasonable man I am, I accepted their arguments and I am now providing a statutory limit of ten years.  I have to bear in mind that the limit up to now has been six years. In bringing in a ten-year limit, we have to safeguard the six-year provision.  In later amendments, the same thing will be applied in reverse.  We apply to the Revenue Commissioners' extra assessments the same provisions as will apply in relation to taxpayers seeking repayments. It is a fair approach.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 4, lines 52 to 56, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  by the substitution in subsection (1) of  &lsquo;any year of assessment for which an assessment or an additional first assessment could have been made upon him immediately before his death, or could be made upon him if he were living&rsquo;, for  &lsquo;the year of assessment in which such person dies or for any previous year&rsquo;.&rdquo; .bqe</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This also arises out of the ten-year period.  When a person dies, the income tax assessment on the income liable to tax for the pre-death period&mdash;that is a terrible phrase &mdash; cannot be made until the grant of probate.  If there were delay in taking out probate and if the ten-year period were to run back from the time of making the assessment, the period in which assessments could be made could be less than ten years.  If the ten-year limitation <Col N="990" /> period were to run from the time of taking out probate, delays of up to three years could result and the period prior to death for which additional assessments could be made would, in fact, be restricted to seven years.  This amendment is to deal with that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall begin again; perhaps I did not put it very clearly. When a person dies, assessments cannot be raised until probate or administration has been taken out.  As Deputies know, there may be a delay in taking out probate or administration.  If we did not amend the Bill, the ten-year period would begin to run from the time the assessment was made and that might be two years after the date of death so that we could only go back eight years in that case.</P>

That <Col N="991" /> is, in my view, grossly discourteous to a Deputy&mdash;for an amendment to lie there for six months and the Deputy not to be told that it is out of order and particularly over the time before the amendments were to be discussed here.

      <Col N="993" /> The inspectors shall, within the time directed by the precept of the Special Commissioners, give a particular notice to every person chargeable, within the limits wherein they act, requiring him, within such time as shall be limited by the precept, to prepare and deliver to the inspectors all such lists, declarations and statements as are required by this Act to be delivered.</P>

      <P>It is done by section 172 of the Income Tax Act, 1967. Section 168 refers to the Special Commissioners. They will not be there any more and so section 172 takes over and deals with the matter.  Section 172 does much the same thing so far as the individual is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for taking so long but it is a very voluminous Act to which one must keep referring back.

I do not like having to suggest that we possibly could have fallen down on anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this is a new relief.  It provides a new relief and I do not think it should have a very wide application.  It is in relation to Chapter VI of Part IV of the 1967 Act, which is concerned with the taxation under Case IV of the Schedule D of income from rents out of lands and buildings which escape taxation under Schedule A.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of that Chapter which relate to rents under short leases, that is leases for a term not exceeding 50 years, the starting point of the Schedule D computation is the amount of rent to which the lessor becomes entitled in the year of assessment.  From the gross rent receivable deductions are then made under various headings&mdash;annual value, rent payable, repairs, rates, services provided, insurance and management; and, for the purpose of determining the amount of the deduction to be made under any heading, the rules governing the computation of trading profits apply as if the letting were a trade carried on during the currency of the lease by the lessor for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where, in the case of any lease, the <Col N="995" /> computation brings out a loss, that is to say, where the aggregate of the deductions allowable exceed the rent receivable, the loss may be set off against any income, whether from rent or otherwise, on which the taxpayer is chargeable under Case IV of Schedule D for the same year; and any part of the loss in respect of which relief is not so given may be carried forward and set off against any income on which the taxpayer is chargeable under Case IV for any subsequent year.</P>
    <P>In the case which has given rise to the present section there was very heavy expenditure on repairs to a number of let houses in the years 1963-64 and 1964-65.  In consequence, the Schedule D computations in those cases brought out losses which have been relieved in the manner I have just indicated.  To finance the repairs the taxpayer obtained a loan from a building society.  Pursuant to an arrangement between the society and the Revenue Commissioners interest on loans made by it is paid without deduction of tax; and the amount paid in any year of assessment is allowable as a deduction from the total income of the borrower for that year.  In the particular case in question, however, the amounts of interest paid in the years 1963-64 and 1964-65 respectively were in excess of the taxpayer's total income for those years; and, under existing law, no relief in respect of the excess can be given.  The substance of the representations made in the case was that a provision should be introduced to enable the excess to be carried forward in the same way as a loss.  In this connection, reference was made to the provision originally enacted as section 10 of the Finance Act, 1963, now section 316 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which gives relief of the kind sought in respect of interest on money borrowed for the purposes of a trade or profession.</P>

      <P>As Deputies know, section 9 proposes to exempt certain United States pensions from Irish income tax.  The reason is that these pensions are themselves exempt from income tax in their home country, the United States.  It has been represented to us that there are other pensions from other parts of the world which are also exempt from income tax in their countries of origin and if that is so there is a case for exempting them also.  I propose to bring in an amendment on Report Stage to do that.</P>

      <P>The reason we did this in the case of the US pensions was that they were exempt from income tax in their country of origin. If we were to exempt from Irish income tax a pension which is taxed at source in a country with which we have a double taxation agreement, we would, in fact, only be making a present to the revenue of that country. This does not apply where a pension is paid free of income tax in its home country.  We were struck by the two cases, the US Social Security pensions and the US railroad Retirement Act pensions, and it seemed to be very desirable that we should encourage people, in particular Irish people, who had these pensions to come back here to live and bring this income with them.  It is now clear, I think, that there are other similar types of pensions originating in countries outside the US and it is only logical and sensible that we should do the same for those.</P>

I would agree at once if we had not set up the Appeal Commissioners to begin with but it does seem to me that having set them up, we should debate it.

He certainly has the power.  There is no question about that.  He was laying down certain conditions about appeals and really I think he was concerned with accountants coming in and using the circuit court for the purpose of getting an adjournment.  He was laying down stipulations on how he was going to deal with cases in future where people had been before the Special Commissioners and so on and where accounts were submitted and where they were not.

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 30, to delete &ldquo;transferable by delivery&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I wanted to cover was the case in which a registered security is registered in the name of a holder outside the State.  Let me give an example of what happens at present. A person is registered in respect of a security here and that person so registered is a trust corporation in New York, shall we say, and it issues sub-certificates transferable by delivery there or issues sub-certificates transferable by registration.  There is some doubt at present as to whether in the case of the sub-certificates issued by registration by the person who is the registered holder of the bonds so far <Col N="1002" /> as the books here are concerned they might not be also liable for some duty in respect of sub-certificates issued abroad.  The Minister has, in fact, no control over what is done and it would be desirable to acknowledge <i>de jure</i> as well as <i>de facto</i> that he has no control and that the stamp duty does not arise.</P>
    <P>May I take a specific case?  A company here raised a substantial sum of foreign capital by means of the issue of a series of bonds placed in New York.  So far as the company here is concerned, those bonds are inscribed in the books of the company in Ireland in the name of&mdash;this is not the right name&mdash;the Anglo American Trustee Corporation Limited and they remain so registered for the lifetime of the bond because if they do not remain so registered for the lifetime of the bond, on every transfer of those bonds there would be one per cent duty payable. To obviate that, the Anglo-American Trustee Corporation Limited issued sub-bonds of the principal bond that they have.  No duty can be collected by the Minister on these sub-bonds because they are issued in America. It is not a transfer within a State. The result of it is that the Minister gets no stamp duty but it is a very circuitous and cumbersome way of dealing with the matter and it would be much better if in these circumstances that registrable security was dealt with in exactly the same way as the bearer bonds will be dealt with if these were at any time changed into bearer bonds or had originally been issued as bearer bonds but there was a difficulty: they could not be issued as bearer bonds because of the <i>pari passu</i> nature of the bonds with certain other registrable securities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not quite clear what the Deputy had in mind in putting down this amendment but it is a different thing entirely from what I am dealing with in the section.  The situation in regard to bearer bonds is that a special duty is payable on them at the time of issue, but only at the time of issue.  Because there is no subsequent duty leviable upon them as they pass from person to person, the <Col N="1003" /> duty at the time of issue is a heavier duty than it would normally be so as to compensate for the fact that we do not get any stamp duty at subsequent stages.</P>
      <P>The situation in regard to bearer bonds issued outside the country is that at the moment they are supposed to attract this compensatory duty of £2 per cent but this leaves them at considerable disadvantage in relation to other bearer bonds issued abroad in the same countries by other companies or by corporations having their headquarters in other countries.  It is to relieve them of that disadvantage that we are introducing this provision and they will not attract this special compensatory duty at the time of issue when they are issued for subscription abroad.</P>

      <P>I think that what we are trying to do here will commend itself to Deputies.  It is to deal with the case of people who build property and sell it subject to a condition as to lease-back. We are trying to facilitate that sort of transaction.  In brief, what we are proposing to do is to permit the payment by instalments over a ten-year period of the tax on a big profit which might be realised on that type of transaction but would not be available in cash to the person concerned.  So far as this transaction would give rise to a taxable profit which would not be a liquid profit we are permitting the person to pay the tax over a ten-year period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What is specifically involved is that very often a person sells a building for less than the full market value but with the proviso that he gets a lease-back.  This lease forms part of the transaction, part of the sale price.  The cash selling price would be taken into account and also the value of the lease-back.  The particular portion of the profits on the transaction applicable to the value of the lease-back is not available to the person in cash and, therefore, he <Col N="1007" /> might not have ready money available to pay the tax on that part of the profit. We are allowing him to pay the tax on that part over a ten-year period.</P>

      <P>I can understand the Minister perfectly.  But that is not capitalisation.  That is the reason I was looking at the Minister.  I am not quite clear about the case of a builder who builds a premises and having built those premises, sells the premises for £10,000 subject to receiving a rent of £100 a year.  The rent of £100 a year would be capitalised, as the Minister knows, shall we say, for £1,400, I use a person in the statutory sense as being a company or an individual. The person is assessed on the profit he made out of his building, that is to say, the £10,000 receipt, less his expenses, plus the £1,400 capitalisation on rent.  I am assuming that he had it as a freehold before.  Do I now understand that the portion of the profit covered by the £1,400 capitalisation can be paid over ten years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then this affects only a very restricted type of case.  It virtually affects only the type of case where a company own its premises, owns liquid cash, goes along to somebody and says: &ldquo;We will sell you the premises.&rdquo;  They could go along to the insurance company and say: &ldquo;We will sell you the premises if you will give us a lease-back for 50 years.&rdquo; The number of cases of that type which arise every year, compared to the ordinary capitalisation case, is trivial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I will explain why we are doing it.  First of all, in addition to the case the Deputy mentioned, that is, the case of the person who owns his premises and goes to an insurance company, we also have the company which builds its own premises and makes a building profit in the process.  The reason we are doing this is that the sale and lease-back system seems to be a desirable development. Modern industrial management is more and more concerned not <Col N="1008" /> to lock up good working capital in bricks and mortar.  It prefers to have the profit where it can use it for improving its business.  A company may go to an insurance company so that it will be able to have liquid capital in order to expand its business.  We would destroy the whole effect of that if we made them pay tax in hard cash on all of the profit.  It would probably reduce very considerably any additional liquidity they might get from the transaction and that is why we are enabling them to pay this tax over a ten-year period.  The builder who builds a premises and receives a ground rent on it is not in the same position. The builder is in the building business and his profits from building are taxed in the normal way.  We are dealing here with a different type of person, institution, or company who are not in the building business but who are doing this sort of transaction as subsidiary to their main occupation.</P>

      <P>A, B and C are drapers and pull down their shop and rebuild it.  It costs £10,000 and they sell it to an insurance company for £15,000. They get a capital gain of £5,000 on that building.  That is not a profit on their trading.  That is not assessable tax. That is capital.  If that transaction is attended by a contemporaneous agreement with an insurance company, they will give them a lease of 50 years at £1 per annum.  That is not profit because it is not part of their business. If a draper engages in a capital transaction of that kind, where does he get his profit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the Minister's position but what puzzles me is that I understood that profit which accrued to you as a result of a capital transaction of any kind was not assessable to income tax and super tax. If you are not in the business of building, which was the whole argument we had on the Finance Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what this <Col N="1009" /> whole Bill is all about.  At present even though you are not in the business of building, under Part VII of the 1965 Act, you could be taxed in respect of a whole variety of transactions which were not related to the business you were in.  We are trying to remedy this and we are trying to bring about a situation where such a person will not be charged on his profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man is in the business of building and uses up £100,000 capital in building and sells it to the Norwich Insurance Company, on the understanding that the Norwich Insurance Company will not only pay him the £100,000 he spent on the erection of the building but will also covenant to give him a lease for 99 years at £1,000 a year.  He spent £100,000 and he got £100,000 cash from the insurance company.  He has no profit on that.  But he has also got a 99-year lease.  The Revenue Commissioners value that at £20,000 which is the profit on this transaction, but, because it comes to him in the form of a lease, he shall have the right to pay it to the Revenue Commissioners in ten annual instalments of £2,000.  That applies to all men whose business it is to build and sell buildings.</P>
      <P>Suppose Switzers and Company, or Arnotts or any large firm, as often happens, build themselves a new building and spend £100,000 on the building.  Having spent £100,000 on it, they sell it, say, to the Norwich Insurance Company for £120,000.  They have now made a gross profit of £20,000 and, in addition to that, they secure a covenant to lease it back to them for 99 years.  I am asking the Minister if I am not right in saying that, in as much as they are not in the building business, as defined by the Finance Act, 1965, they are not liable to tax either on the £20,000 or on the capital value of the covenanted lease?</P>

We hope by this Bill to change the position under the 1965 Act and to provide that, unless one is in the business of building, developing, and so on, an isolated capital transaction of the nature Deputy Dillon is talking about will not be taxed.  If such a transaction is not taxable under this Act, this section will have no relevance. It will come into operation only where such a transaction can be shown to be a trading transaction and income tax is chargeable on the profit of the transaction.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If you were to put it after the section, it would give rise, I suppose, to a lot of other problems. I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 8, to delete lines 33 to 37 and to substitute as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;development&rsquo; means, in relation to any land,&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the construction, demolition, extension, alteration or reconstruction of any building on the land, or</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that the definition of &ldquo;development&rdquo; in the Bill as it stands is ambiguous in that it is not altogether clear whether the words &ldquo;to adapt it for materially altered use&rdquo; apply both to the construction, demolition, extension, alteration or reconstruction of the buildings and to the carrying out of engineering and other operations or only to the latter.

      <P>My amendment seeks to deal with the second sub-paragraph of the Minister's amendment.  One of the things that worried me about this definition section when it came in its original form, and still very much worries me, is in relation for example to the erection of a fence.  If a farmer sells a site and if that farmer erects a fence cutting off the site it seems to me, that under sub-paragraph (b) of the amendment introduced by the Minister, that, <i>ipso facto</i>, he is developing the site because that seems to be carrying out an &ldquo;engineering or other operation.&rdquo;  Of course, I can understand the view taken where the person concerned builds and erects the fence.  Consider the situation, however, where the vendor, for example, does not do any building at all, as such, where he is at arm's length, where he has no connection, either control or anything else, with the builder.  Under this sub-paragraph, merely by the erection of the fence, I think that person will be caught.  I do not think that is desirable.  I do not even think it is desired.  I will concede at once that there is the very greatest difficulty in defining &ldquo;development&rdquo; in a way that will let out the genuine case and bring in the case where it is merely some type of avoidance.</P>

If the Minister can show me where that is not so I will be <Col N="1015" /> delighted to hear, but if it is so it means that the provision of sites anywhere in rural Ireland is going to be a thing of the past.  None will be provided. God knows, it is hard enough for people who want to get married and build a house for themselves to get a site anywhere.  If this means that they cannot get it that way without the owner concerned having to pay tax on the capital value of what he has sold, then the day of getting any sites throughout the country is absolutely gone.  Many farmers when they sell do not like leaving it to the site purchaser to erect the fence.  They want to be sure that they know where they stand with regard to fencing and so on. Even when a local authority buy it they have plenty of experience that the local authority method of fencing is entirely unsatisfactory, that the persons who go into the house will not keep the fence and, therefore, they make it as part of their original deal that they will do the fencing themselves.</P>

      <P>I see the Minister's difficulty there.  I agree with Deputy Sweetman.  I do not think the Minister wants to catch this operation, but as the Minister rightly reminds the House, what he says here does not bind the Revenue Commissioners. They are bound by what is written in the statute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be since they determined to reverse themselves when they so disposed.  I am not here, nor is the Minister, I am sure, going to criticise the procedure of the Supreme Court.  As I understand the law, and my knowledge of it is restricted, the judge interprets our statutes not by what we mean very often but by what we say.  I apprehend, Deputy Booth notwithstanding, that this form of words could catch and would catch a person who divided ten acres of agricultural land into 20 half-acres of building sites.  I also apprehend that if the statute did that, we would be in the self-same position to which I have often referred in this House in which our ire, wrath, indignation and protestations are directed at the Revenue Commissioners because they have pursued some poor fellow down the country who only fenced his land, the position being that the Revenue Commissioners are all saying: &ldquo;They must be daft when they put this section in the Finance Act, but it is there and once it is there we must implement it, and the way we implement it is to raise an assessment.  We hope the Special Commissioners will turf us out.&rdquo;  But if the Special Commissioners do not, the words of the statute apply.&rdquo;  This poor unfortunate devil goes to the Circuit Court.  Again the Revenue Commissioners will be praying to get turfed out, but they may not get turfed out because we have not taken the trouble to be precise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister in regard to his problem.  The only immediate problem here is this one of fencing, and it gave rise to acrimonious argument in this House when we were discussing the Marts Bill.  The same issue arose about converting land into the business of conducting a cattle mart, and the very same issue arose.  If you fenced a piece of land for the purpose of confining cattle and subsequently sold the cattle, then that converted the place <Col N="1019" /> and made it liable to the restrictions of the Bill.  The Minister for Agriculture argued powerfully that it did not.  We argued powerfully that it did.  I think the same proviso arises here, and perhaps the Minister would consider whether words might not be added providing that the erection of a fence for the division of a parcel of land sold for a materially altered use does not come within the scope of this subsection, or words to that effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this man who is fencing three or 20 sites, or whatever it is, is as safe as a house.  First of all, he must do this in pursuance of the business of developing land.  The very hypothesis put forward by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman rules out the fact that he is carrying on a business.  You must have development as defined and you must have trade or business as defined.  You must get these two things in conjunction before any possibility of an assessment arises.  Development here is clearly defined as something of substance and something to alter materially the use of the land.  I submit that a simple thing like fencing the land, ploughing the land, cutting hedges or anything like that could not, in any circumstances, be regarded as something which materially alters the use of the land.  Even if it did, then it must have been done in pursuance of a business of developing land.  You must have the two things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me give the Minister a case I know has happened. This man was a farmer who has no business of any kind or description except that of a farmer.  He sold to one particular person three sites next to each other.  That man had at the far end of the same field some land where he had cleared away scrub years back <Col N="1020" /> and this land was not too good.  With a bulldozer he took the top soil off the sites that he had sold and he put it away out to the back of the field to spread it as a means, if you like, of manuring the back of the field.  That clearly was an engineering operation which materially adapted the site for another use.  Having done that, he proceeded to sell his three sites to one person with whom he has no connection of any sort, a person completely at arm's length.  Nobody can deny that that was an engineering operation.  In my view, under section 16 he had a dealing in land, one dealing in land, as defined in section 16, and as defined in section 16 where a person has a dealing in land <i>ipso facto</i> he carries on the business of development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

I have copies of various submissions that have been made to me in respect of section 16, and there appears to be a big difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words. However, the case I have made&mdash;I have made it deliberately&mdash;is the extreme case of engineering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These three amendments have been put down in consequence of representations which we received in relation to paragraph (a) of section 15 (2) of the Bill.  The purpose of that paragraph is to secure that ordinary lettings will not be <Col N="1023" /> regarded as disposals of interests in land and that, consequently, Part IV will not apply to them.  It has been questioned whether this purpose has been achieved.  Section 15, subsection 2 (a) talks about a lease granted &ldquo;wholly in consideration of rent&rdquo; but it has been pointed out that, in virtually all cases, there are additional considerations by way of covenants, for instance covenants dealing with the repair or user of the property.</P>

      <P>The second of these amendments, amendment No. 22, relates to subsection (2) (a) of section 15 and makes it clear that such covenants are to be disregarded and that a lease under which no premium is payable is not to rank as a disposal of an interest.</P>
      <P>The third amendment, amendment No. 23, is consequential because it secures that in the application of section 18 to a case in which a lease is granted &ldquo;price&rdquo; is to be taken to mean the fine or premium required by the lease.  These changes render unnecessary the final paragraph of section 15 (1) which provides for the interpretation of price or consideration in relation to a lease.  Therefore that paragraph is proposed to be deleted by amendment No. 21.  I think that should put the situation beyond any doubt.</P>

      <P>A great deal of thought has been given to this section by those competent to consider it.  On Second Reading and when he was discussing it a second ago, the Minister tied all his arguments to the question of what is the business of dealing in land.  As I said a moment ago, there is no definition that I could find anywhere in Ireland, in England, or even in the books dealing with American law as to what is a business.  The only decided case I could find anywhere was a case in New Zealand.  Subsection (2) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>A dealing in land shall be regarded as taking place where a person having an interest in any land disposes, as regards the whole or any part of the land, of that interest or of an interest which derives therefrom.</P>
      <P>One single transaction is to be a dealing in land.  Having looked at subsection (2), there we come back to subsection (1) where, apart from this section, all or some of the activities of a business of dealing in or developing land&mdash; now there is nothing to suggest that a business is to be a succession of acts. One single transaction, one single sale is a business of dealing in land under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one way I can see the necessity for the Minister so to provide because otherwise one could arrive at a succession of avoidance measures by promoting a company for the sole purpose of dealing in or developing land&mdash; I can understand that, To me it would seem more appropriate, however, to tackle the problem under section 15 rather than section 16.  There are many instances of definition as to what is a trade and, if this section were based around the trade of dealing in land, then I think, with the cognate control subsections there are in section 15, one would be able to knock the anti-avoidance measures and, at the same time, ensure that the person who genuinely buys land or genuinely has land and sells that land will, in consequence, be treated as dealing with a capital transaction and not an income transaction which requires taxation.  I know there have been suggestions put to the <Col N="1025" /> Minister in this respect by other people. The first time that there has been any reference to the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; in a statute, so far as is known to me, arises in the Excess Profits Act of 1915 where a trade or business is involved, but I think business there is intended to cover the profession as apart from the trade.  It is not intended to cover the type of definition of business that is here.</P>
    <P>A company formed to take over and manage freehold property, devised to beneficiaries, was held to be carrying on a business merely because it was carrying out the wishes of the testator. A company which received a fixed annuity and distributed it to shareholders was held to be carrying on a business.  In fact, I am sure the Minister is probably aware that one of the better judges in England described &ldquo;business&rdquo; in relation to interpretations of this sort as being essentially the vaguest word in the English language. In subsection (2) we have the definition that I have mentioned of a dealing in land&mdash;that is to say, a capital transaction is to be treated as a dealing. There are a variety of analogies one could consider but, no matter where one turns under this section, one comes back to the same thing.  We were met by the Minister, on Second Reading, by the statement that you must be carrying on a business; that is the same as saying you must be carrying on a trade; that is the same as saying you must be doing it again and again, that it is your business.  There is nothing anywhere in any statute or court decision to suggest that argument could stand up for a minute.  I am with the Minister in agreeing that there should be a provision that this section would cover a person who makes it his business to make profits out of dealing in land.  That is a different story altogether from what is included in the section here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy looks at paragraph (a) of subsection (2)&mdash; where a person having an interest disposes of the whole or any part of the land or any interest in the land or of an interest which derives therefrom: I suspect that provision was put in for the purpose of catching the company formed for the single purpose of one single transaction. That I can understand, but I fail to see how the farmer who does a dealing under section 2 in the land, or who develops it, would not be caught under section 16.  The Minister knows that he has received not Capal Street opinions in respect of this but opinions given by quite frankly, one of the people who is accepted as being a first-class conveyancing and tax lawyer.</P>
      <P>The ultimate suggestion that was put to the Minister&mdash;I cannot for the life of me understand why the Minister did not accept it&mdash;was that subsection (1) should be amended to read: where apart from this section a business of dealing in or developing land is, in fact, carried on, all or some of the activities of such business would not, apart from this section, be regarded as activities carried on in the course of trade within Schedule D.  It seems to me that if that amendment, put to the Minister by one of the bodies that went to see him, backed by the opinion of counsel, skilled in conveyancing, skilled in tax matters, and an acknowledged expert in this type of case, an acknowledged opinion in the technical sense of the phrase, had been accepted, there would be no argument.  Why the Minister continues to set up his view against that opinion puzzles me.</P>
      <P>Why does he not rather say: &ldquo;All right; I do not agree with you but I will amend this in a way that will cut out the avoidance case&rdquo;&mdash;that will block that loophole but, equally, let out the genuine case that we believe is caught by it and that we accept the Minister does not want to catch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is best to begin by saying it is a very difficult problem.  We have been over most of the ground before.  First of all, we must look at subsection (1) and also at its <Col N="1027" /> origin.  The basis of it is that if a person buys the fee simple of land, builds a house on it and sells the fee simple, he is trading.  He has bought something and he has sold it However, if he buys the fee simple in land, builds a house on it and gives a long lease, he has not disposed of his full interest in the land and he cannot be regarded as trading&mdash;buying something and selling it.</P>
      <P>That is the situation we are facing; that is what is at the root of this whole legislative problem.  We have tried in the subsection to say that if a person who is dealing in land is caught by the normal provisions of Schedule D, the section does not apply to be in at all. However, if he is not carrying on a trade under the normal provisions of Schedule D, but would be regarded as carrying on such a trade were it not for the fact that he did not dispose of his full interest in the land, then he shall be deemed to be carrying on a business of trading.  That is the whole basis of it.  We must look at the words in their normal, natural meaning. &ldquo;Dealing&rdquo; in ordinary usage does imply purchase and resale.</P>

The property must have been acquired by him in the course of business before the dealing in the land can be regarded as coming within the scope of the chargeable provision.  It seems to me there is no other way in which I can achieve what I am trying to do here. I am trying to leave out the type of transaction which most Deputies agree should be left out&mdash;the isolated transaction by a person not carrying on a business&mdash;and trying to include as far as I can those who are engaged in the business of dealing in and developing land and who, simply because they do not dispose of their whole interest, cannot be caught under the normal rules of Schedule D.</P>

They are taken out of the ambit of Schedule D by the fact that they do not dispose of their full interest.  I am trying to catch those people, who are carrying on a business but not caught under the normal rules of Schedule D. At the same time, I am leaving out people carrying on only isolated transactions. This is a considerable legislative straitjacket in which to be placed. I think the section achieves what we are trying to do; I am advised that it does and I do not think we can do any better.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to a single transaction.  Supposing a farmer has land and his family before him had it in a couple of generations.  Therefore, there is no question of resale.  Supposing he sells it to three people, at arm's length with whom he has no contact.  They are three capital transactions, or should be so treated, but the Minister said a few minutes ago that because the transactions were successive, they would be trading.  Does the Minister not agree that so long as the transactions are completely at arm's length, they should be treated as three capital transactions?</P>

      <P>I have no hesitation in doing that at all.  This provision will be retrospective and will soon be tested. A number of cases, as it were, are already in existence which will immediately be subjected to the test of this piece of legislation.  It seems to me we would be dealing with test cases immediately because of the retrospective effect of the provisions.  I would really like to take Deputies back to the wording of subsection (1) of section 16 again.  We can ignore for the moment the words &ldquo;apart from this section, all or some of the activities of a business&rdquo;.  We are dealing with cases which the normal income tax law does not bring within the scope of Schedule D.  These cases do not come within Schedule D because the disposal was not a disposal of the full interest held in the land.  If you buy and sell something and you still retain an interest in it, the transaction is outside the normal scope of Schedule D.  We have here a case where &ldquo;all or some of the activities of a business of dealing in or developing land would not be regarded as activities carried on in the course of a trade within Schedule D but would be so regarded if every disposal of an interest in land included among those activities was a disposal of the full interest&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a case where, because there was not a disposal of the full interest, the case is not within <Col N="1032" /> Schedule D, and we are saying that, if in that case the person carrying on the business had disposed of his full interest, liability would arise.  Surely that makes it quite clear that the matter can only be &ldquo;deemed to be wholly a trade within Schedule D&rdquo; if the person carrying on the business would be regarded as carrying on a trade but for the fact that disposals made by him were not disposals of the full interest he held?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The next type of man we are after and who will be caught, is the fellow who is carrying on a business but would not be caught under the normal rules of Schedule D on either of two grounds, first, that he does not dispose of the full interest he acquired in the land or secondly, that he says he did not acquire it with the intention of turning it over at a profit, that is, that he did not acquire it in the course of a business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the intention is still there under the normal rules of Schedule D.  The argument he would use to get out of the normal rules there is that he had no intention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I described to this House how a person got out of that situation.  He bought the land today and then brough his wife along the next day, showed her the site and said: &ldquo;We could build a nice house here for ourselves.&rdquo; She says: &ldquo;No, you will not, unless you want to be divorced.&rdquo; Then he says that he has to develop it and he is not caught.  We all know who that was.  It is very well known to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only mentioning that he might also escape liability under the rules of Schedule D and I have been talking about one loophole, that is to say if he did not dispose of the full interest.  He might also bring himself outside the ambit <Col N="1035" /> of the rules by saying that he did not acquire this property with the intention of selling it or developing it; that he just acquired it for his own use.  The fact that he did not have the intention would remove one of the ingredients of trade out of the situation.  He might get out of the situation in either of these two ways: that he did not dispose of the full interest or did not have the intention of selling when he bought.  This is the sort of person we are trying to catch. If he is trying to get out of the position where he can be shown to be trading, by either of these two devices only, then we catch him, but if he is outside the ordinary rules of Schedule D for any other reason&mdash;the other reason being simply that it is an isolated capital transaction&mdash;we do not catch him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole of this business began by our apprehending that there were people going around, paying £20,000 for a piece of land to sell to somebody&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was the famous case, where the land was sold for £120,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The feeling of the House was that this was a profit that should be accessible to the Revenue Commissioners and should not be regarded as the case of a person who had grown elderly and had an old house in disrepair and an unmanageable garden of some 30 acres, selling the property and going to live in a flat.  That would be regarded as an isolated capital transaction whereas the fellow who bought the property for £20,000 and sold it perhaps for £120,000 to a developer, would be expected to pay tax on the £120,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It all began in the Supreme Court.  In 1936, the situation obtained under which people who did what Deputy Dillon was talking about were taxed on the profits, and that was that.  Then the Supreme Court upset that situation by incorporating the idea of intention.  The Supreme Court said that the intention is one of the ingredients <Col N="1036" /> of trading and in order to be carrying on a trade, you must have acquired land with the intention of developing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That threw the cat among the pigeons.  How was anyone to establish intention?  How were the Revenue Commissioners to establish intention on the part of a builder? He could say that he had bought it for his wife to walk around in it.  So the Revenue Commissioners came along in 1965 in an effort to deal with the situation and get back into the net the man whose business was buying land, developing it and selling houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it went a little farther than we intended and now we are trying to draw back again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the main cause of the second step in the intention case was that what happened then was that the man bought land for development for, shall we say £20,000 and having done so, he went through the antics to which I have referred, to disprove intention, and then proceeded to sell the land for £120,000 to his own company, with the result that his own company made a loss on building development instead of making a profit with which he should be taxed.  I think there was a succession of people, in my view dishonestly, saying that they had not bought with intention and then selling for a faked price to a company to ensure that they got their profit capitalwise instead of making a normal profit on their business.  I think that started the Revenue Commissioners going into it in 1965.  We told the Minister's predecessor then that we would give him every assistance to block the type of case to which I have referred but that the way in which the Minister's predecessor went into it would catch the entirely innocent case also and would result in fact in there being fewer sites for development.  That was the experience and the fact.  Mark you, I admit quite honestly that the Minister has gone a long way towards <Col N="1037" /> persuading me that his interpretation of section 16 is better than mine.  We shall have a little time between now and the next day to discuss that and certainly, if not to agree that his definition is right, at least to see whether there is some other way in which we can provide that the man who is doing the genuine capital transaction is not caught, without letting out the man who is doing what is an income transaction but which is being done under the guise of a capital transaction.</P>
