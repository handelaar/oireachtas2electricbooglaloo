      <P>Last night I was dealing with the portion of this Bill that affects rural areas.  I say, and make no bones about it, that the policy of this House, as I have known it for 40 years, has been against rural Ireland. When I first had a constituency, it was a five-seat constituency.  The constituency was handed back to me some five or six years ago, but in order that it might still be a five-seat constituency, there had to be added to it a stretch of country from Mallow out to the Kerry boundary at Rockchapel, even though the part of the constituency in which I live is the highest industrialised portion of this country today, an area where one cannot find an idle man except a man who does not want to work.  One finds an odd one like that.</P>
      <P>Last night I was describing the difference between the position of the Deputy elected for a city constituency and that of a rural Deputy.  I pointed out that when after the 1961 general election I found myself again in my present constituency, until the time my colleague, Deputy Jerry Cronin was elected in Mallow to assist me, I had to go out there and stay in a hotel for three days in order to cover one part of my constituency, whereas a Deputy representing a city area can cover his constituency by taking what used to be a 4d bus fare but which is now, I believe, increased by CIE to 6d.</P>
      <P>That disparity will continue for the reason that since we started our industrial policy we did not bring up the rural community step by step with industrial development One needs only to know the agricultural wages fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board three weeks ago to see what has happened. An agricultural wages was fixed at a rate which is roughly 50 per cent of what is paid to any industrial worker in East Cork today.</P>
      <P>We always prided ourselves on having a tillage policy which would keep the rural people on the land and maintain the rural population.  This year every other section of the community is getting the benefit of a rise and one hears of strikes for more pay and shorter hours and a week even shorter than five days.</P>

      <P>Take the position of West Cork.  The West Cork constituency, as I knew it previously, was a five-seat constituency.  It has been made a three-seat constituency.  Then, portion of South Cork had to be added to it so as to entitle it to have three seats in the Dáil.  Under the 1960 amendment of the Constitution, portion of North Cork, Macroom, had to be added to it again in order to entitle it to three seats in this House. If tomorrow you were to carve out a three-seat constituency in West Cork, again, under the ordinary conditions, you would have to extend the constituency, take portions from other constituencies and add them to it.  All that means further extension and involves the Deputy being further away from his work and having to spend longer hours travelling between one portion of his constituency and another.  That is the difference between the rural and the city Deputy and that disparity has been gradually built up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether or not this question of tolerance will work out but, very definitely, something must be done if Deputies in rural areas are to be in a position to look after their constituents. Imagine the position of one Deputy for a Party elected in a five-seat constituency having to look after his constituents from Rockchapel right down to Youghal Bridge, a distance of over 100 miles, and from Blarney right down to Charleville and Mitchelstown. That is why I am in favour of having a constituency which a Deputy will be able to look after.  It is all right in the cities where you have a dense population but to-day everything we are doing is leading to depopulation of the rural areas, in no uncertain fashion. Even the Planning Act which we have been discussing is aiming at the same thing, to have no building done outside <Col N="316" /> the towns and villages.  Everything is leading to the one end and that is that there will be an increased population in the cities and the rural areas will be denuded.</P>

      <P>Where is the man to-day who is going to work a seven-day week when he can get a five-day week?  And more power to him.  I am one of those who came, as Deputy Dillon said, from the barricades, if you like to put it that way.  I came out of jail in November, 1926, and I came in here in June, 1927. We came in here to see if we could get by political means what we had failed to get by other means.  I make no apology to Deputy Dillon or anyone else for that.  We succeeded in doing so to a large extent.  I should be the last one to object to proportional representation, seeing that I have been elected under it for 40 odd years, but I can see the difficulties.  I admit that to-day there are easier ways of travelling than there were in my time but to-morrow is a man from Rockchapel, or a man from Newmarket going to have a discussion with me, if under this Bill he can have the opportunity of having a local Deputy on his doorstep to look after his business, or within a radius of 20 miles at most of him?  That is completely different from the fellow living in the next street which the city Deputy can reach for a 2d or 4d bus run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No provision has ever been made in this House for the position that exists in the rural areas.  The city Deputy is able to look after his couple of lanes or alleyways but there is no provision for the man who has to travel from Youghal to Rockchapel.  I do not blame the city fellows for being anxious to retain their pound of flesh but up to now the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has just been a mockery in this regard.  These are the changes which I see as necessary.  You have a choice.  You can take every two rural areas and put them into one and say: &ldquo;This was a three-seat constituency and we will now add to it another 50 miles so that it will still remain a <Col N="317" /> three-seat constituency; we will take a piece of Tipperary and Waterford and join the two together so that it will at least be a constituency and we can have three seats.  We are going to have no respect even for the county boundaries. We are going to tie two counties together so that we will be able to have a constituency.&rdquo;  That is the present situation and there is no denying it.  I saw it before when portion of my constituency on the Youghal side had to be added to Waterford and it remained there for ten years.  To my mind, those are the things that count in representing the people here.  You have to examine the position in that light, in the light of what is good for the ordinary people, and you have to work it out on that basis if you are going to have anything effective.</P>
    <P>I listened to poor Deputy Dillon last night and as I said, I have every sympathy for those young old men.  There are a lot of them in this House today. We hear them talking about the youth movement and all the rest.  There are fellows of between 30 and 40 and they are older in their minds than many of the old age pensioners outside.  Fancy an unfortunate man getting up here to defend PR who had described PR as a fraud and a cod, as something that was the product of all the cranks in creation.</P>

      <P>I have the speech here of Deputy Dillon if anyone wants to see it.  I am taking it and comparing it with the speech he made 20 years afterwards when he takes the very opposite view.  What is the use of going on that way?  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was foisted upon us by a collection <Col N="318" /> of half-lunatics who believed that they had something lovely that would work on paper like a jig-saw puzzle, but like all these crank ideas in operation, it has resulted here in an election in 1931, an election in 1932, an election in 1938, an election in 1939, an election in 1943, and an election in 1944.</P>
    <P>That was on 1st November, 1947.  That is Deputy Dillon's description of the proportional representation system, the system he is now endeavouring to defend here, the system he spent an hour yesterday evening defending in this House.</P>
    <P>Can we have anything like sanity in this House at all?  I regret to have to say it, but I tell the Deputies in this House now, who have brought the situation about, that when they have all the elections in the cities and towns and villages, they will have a damn poor Ireland.  They will have a denationalised Ireland, like everything else.  It is being worked out.  One can see that policy running right through everything.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions I had to get up here to advocate increased wages for agricultural labourers.  I was a lone voice in most of those cases, except on the odd occasions on which I got some little bit of assistance from Deputy Dunne after he came into the House.  That is what is wrong.  Talk of serfs.  If rural Ireland insisted tomorrow on the same five-day week as is given to industrial workers, then you would have a cost of living to shout about.  You would have to pay overtime every time the fellow sat under the cows on Saturday and Sunday. These are the things that count in all this.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the rural population are leaving the country.  No man can blame them.  I would be the last to blame them.  They are the men who were out right through the Tan War and the Civil War; the men who fought in those wars were not the fellows in the spats or the fellows popping out of motor cars.  They were the ordinary small farmers' sons and the ordinary labourers and workers of the country. It was they made this Dáil, such as <Col N="319" /> it is.  They made it.  They gave their lives to make it, a great many of them, and that is one thing that I, during my 40 years here and before it, have never forgotten for them.  I do not think I could forget it.</P>
    <P>Under the present system of election, you have one Deputy waltzing around his constituency in a 4d bus and you have another who has to travel 100 miles from one end of his constituency to the other; and, in the next slicing up of the constituencies, if it is done under the present system of proportional representation, he will have to make that 100 miles 120 or 130 miles. That position has been brought home to me in my own constituency.  Had any sane man drawn the boundaries, it would, I admit, have made things easier.  Take a look at it.  You start down at the Waterford boundary and Youghal Bridge and you go out to the Kerry boundary, to Rockchapel.  You are told to look after the people in that area.  There is no sanity at all in it.  There is nothing fair in it.  I have done my best for the people there. Only I did I would not be here now. I have endeavoured to do that which, in my opinion, our people died for, namely, to find decent employment and decent homes in this country for our own people.  I have worked on that principle.  That has been my guiding light right through since I came in here, and before I came in here.</P>
    <P>Does anyone think for one moment the present situation can be allowed to continue?  Something will have to be done.  I heard a Labour Deputy talking on television the other night about Deputies representing sticks and stones. Sticks and stones have to be there, too, and the people representing the sticks and stones have to work, and work hard, so that the gentlemen can have the five-day week and plenty of leisure time and a share of food.  These are the things that matter.  No matter what anyone says to the contrary, if these proposals are turned down now, there is no rural constituency I know of that will not have to get its boundaries extended still further at the expense of some other constituency.  In <Col N="320" /> fact, in some cases one would almost have to throw three countries in together in order to get one constituency. You will have that position, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, you will have a growing urbanisation of representation here in this Dáil.</P>
    <P>When I look around me now at the type of men who are here in this Dáil today and compare them with the type of men who were here 40 years ago, when I sat up there in that corner the first time ever I came into this House, I can tell myself representation here has not improved.</P>

      <P>I am one of the survivors of the last debate on proportional representation in this House.  It is interesting to note that about 70 Deputies who were here on that occasion are no longer with us; some have retired; some lost their seats; some have gone to the Seanad. Although I have not the long experience of the Deputy who has just spoken, I am satisfied that an overall majority does not necessarily make for good government and does not necessarily make for stable government either.  During my period here, Fianna Fáil have had an overall majority twice. In 1959 we had a referendum in an effort to achieve what they are trying to achieve now and they had then, too, <Col N="321" /> an overall majority.  It was a significant fact that when they had that overall majority, instead of utilising it for the benefit of good government, or the stable government they talked about, they spent months trying to change the electoral system and put the country to the expense of a referendum in which they were defeated, although at that time it was confused and complicated by a Presidential election on the same day.</P>
      <P>Now we find ourselves in the same position in this small Parliament of ours, when they have an overall majority; not the overall majority they won the last time but an overall majority which they gained by fortuitous circumstances.  They gained it under the electoral system which they are trying to refute, in that there were four by-elections which were fortuitous by-elections, because they were constituencies in which Fianna Fáil were strong.  They won these four by-elections and got an overall majority. In other words, by a narrow majority, they had the will of the people that they should govern the country and govern it in the best interests of the country.</P>
      <P>What have they done?  They have done exactly the same thing.  When they get into the same position as they were in in 1959, they start to play about with the Constitution.  I accept the fact that in a democratic country and in a democratic parliament such as this which must conform to the wishes of the people as a whole, had there been any great demand for them to do what they were doing, they might have been justified in doing it.  I am unaware of any local authority or any other organised body passing a resolution suggesting to the Government that the present electoral system was not a desirable one and that they should make these changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read the speech the Taoiseach made last week and it is perhaps the weakest and most unconvincing speech ever made by the leader of any parliament or assembly in the history of a parliamentary democracy.  He tried to argue the case that it was necessary and it was the wish and desire of the <Col N="322" /> people to change the electoral system. I may not be able to read into his mind as well as some of his own colleagues, but I could only adduce two arguments from his speech, the first of which was that we wanted stability of government, and that is a queer remark for a Leader of a Party to make when he has an overall majority and when his Party have been in power and have not been defeated within the Parliament itself since 1957.</P>
    <P>The other argument produced was the old worn out argument that was used <i>ad lib</i> in the 1959 debate which went on here over an extensive period, the one about the instability of government in France.  I stated during that debate in 1959 that France has not had PR in the true sense of the term since 1945, nor was the instability that arose in France prior to the advent of General de Gaulle attributable to the electoral system; nor has there been any great electoral change as between the Fourth and Fifth Republics.</P>
    <P>There has only been this change in France.  After the many variations of government they had there, the multiple disagreements between political leaders and even between members of the same party, General de Gaulle attracted a great many people to the policies he represented and was able to form a stable government.  Prior to that, the reason why the French Government fell frequently after being two or three months in existence&mdash;very often they had a caretaker Government&mdash;was that under the Constitution that then existed the dissolution of Parliament was practically impossible.  Therefore, there was no incentive to stability, for one of the great incentives to stability within Parliament is the risk of a general election, the risk representatives have to face in going before the public in a general election, the expense they have to meet and the knowledge that they will create a disruption or a hiatus in the political life of a country.  As I say, those risks did not apply to the Fourth Republic of France, and that in effect was the major cause of instability, added to the fact that France had been occupied during the War and that there was a great deal of disaffection internally among the political ranks in France. <Col N="323" /> These ranks were united under General de Gaulle, but that did not mean there was a major change in the electoral system.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice interrupted here last night, and I am sorry he is not here this morning as I would like to educate him in the political systems that prevail in Europe and in other parts of the world.  In one of his interruptions last night&mdash;perhaps he got a little heated at the time, as happens, I notice, to some of my friends when arguments are telling against them&mdash; the Minister said there was no such thing as proportional representation in Europe, that they had all gone over to the straight vote.  I take a poor view of a remark like that coming from a member of the Government, a Government who are introducing a Constitution Amendment Bill here that is being widely discussed and in respect of which there is a large measure of disagreement, although disagreement is more likely to produce a wider and more comprehensive discussion. There is no use in members of a government coming in here absolutely unversed in the facts.  They should know the fundamentals of what they are introducing.</P>
    <P>I propose to give the House a few facts in relation to the European election systems and after that we will return to the United Kingdom electoral system to which the Fianna Fáil Party appear to be so devoted at the moment; in fact, we have become, as far as I can gather, increasingly devoted to it over the years. There are only two countries in free Europe today that have not got the proportional representation electoral system, and those two countries have not got the British system, the straight vote.  In other words, they have not got the first-past-the-post system which enables a minority to be elected.  Those two countries are France and the Federal Republic of Germany.  France has what they call the second vote. What happens in France is that there is a list of candidates who go forward and unless a candidate secures an overall majority or an absolute majority &mdash;which is the principle on which I <Col N="324" /> personally stand, on which my Party stand and on which the majority of the Irish people stand, as will be evidenced after the referendum, if it ever takes place&mdash;if the candidate does not secure the first-past-the-post, there is a further election a week afterwards.</P>
    <P>If that is not a transferable vote, what is?  Further than that, any candidate who does not obtain five per cent of the votes is not eligible to go forward at a second vote which takes place a week afterwards for which the electors, the candidates themselves and the Parties have plenty of time to consider and cogitate on the subject. In this vote if one man polls 40 per cent, another 30 per cent and the remainder maybe 20 per cent and they are somewhat of the same affiliation to each other, it is quite obvious they will make a compromise of some sort so that they will endeavour to defeat the man at the head of the poll.  If the man at the head of the poll is able to gather sufficient support in the second vote, he is going to get elected.  If that is not a transferable vote, what is?  But it is not the straight vote.  There is no use in the Taoiseach trying to make out that France and Europe are moving away from proportional representation.</P>
    <P>The second country that does not have the list system and proportional representation is the Federal Republic of Germany.  We are told&mdash;I think the statement was made by the Taoiseach or perhaps outside the House by some other luminary of the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;that the Federal Republic of Germany was moving away from proportional representation.  I know from my frequent contacts with members of the Parliament of the Federal Republic to whom I have spoken on many occasions that a lot of them admire our system very much.  I know they are considering the possibility of making a change in their own electoral system, which is somewhat complicated and which I shall endeavour to explain later, and that one of the things they are considering was whether the Irish system, which had been so conducive to political stability here, should be seriously considered by them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> In the 1957 election in Germany the system they operated&mdash;I believe it is still the same&mdash;was that half the House was elected by the straight vote.  There is a membership of 605 Members, or Deputies as they are called there.  They elected half by the straight vote: that is a qualified majority.  But on top of that they have what they call <i>die zweite Stimme</i>, the second vote.  The second vote is not for the individual; it is for the Party.  Therefore a system prevails&mdash;this is only half the House they are electing&mdash;whereby a man can vote for a candidate belonging to the Social Democratic Party, which is the left-wing Party, and he can subsequently at the further vote vote for the Party itself or for the Christian Democratic Party, if he wishes.  That is a form of alternative vote.  But the other half of the Federal Republic elect their candidates by the list system under proportional representation, which is the system which prevails in practically every other free country in Europe.</P>
    <P>There is of course the straight vote, which perhaps Fianna Fáil may be interested in, behind the Iron Curtain which is a straight vote.  But there are no lists or, if there is a list, there is only one Party to be on it, that is, the Party nominated by the dictators in power in all those countries.  That applies to Cuba and other countries. Most of the South American Republics, a lot of whom were on the straight vote at one time, have since transferred to the system of election appertaining to Europe, whereby they have proportional representation with the list system.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the necessity for this change here is due to instability. I think we are perhaps one of the most stable Parliaments in the world.  It is no harm to mention the fact, because the Taoiseach himself mentioned it, that the differences in Parliament here originated from the Civil War.  It is to the great credit of the Irish Parliament and the Irish people that we have lived down the bitterness of those days.  Although from time to time it is raked up in short skirmishes here in Parliament, that does not mean very much.  We <Col N="326" /> have lived that down and managed to have the stability we here enjoy.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about splinter Parties.  The truth is this.  In 1948, before I came into Dáil Éireann, the Fianna Fáil Government believed that they were in power <i>ad infinitum.</i> A lot of new Parties appeared in that election.  They coalesced and formed the first inter-Party Government which, to my mind, gave this country good government.  It also gave an alternative to Fianna Fáil.  It made the people think democratically.  Politically, it was probably one of the greatest services rendered to a young Parliament in the history of democratic institutions in any state.  Fianna Fáil may not have liked it.  It probably engendered in their minds the idea of getting over to the straight vote so that it could never happen again.  They have never really recovered from the fact that they found themselves sitting in Opposition.  They dread the day when that may happen again.</P>
    <P>For that reason, they want to ensure &mdash;mark you, conditions are very different in this country politically from those across the water&mdash;that they will maintain themselves in the happy position they are in now and that they will have a majority after the next election.  For that reason, some of the extremists within the ranks of the Government, possibly some of the extremists of the old brigade&mdash;one of them has just sat down having given us a tremendous discourse relating to everything but proportional representation&mdash;thought: &ldquo;Now is the time to create a situation whereby we will be sure to be returned to power after the next election and to ensure, before the country wakes up to it and realises the injustice it will be to themselves in local conditions, that the Fianna Fáil Government are back in power.&rdquo; Hence all the work of the State is disrupted.  Everything is held up.  All the necessary things that should be done, that a Government are elected to do, are put into abeyance while the plans are formulated for the perpetuation of the Fianna Fáil Party in power.</P>
    <P>We are told we should go over to the British system&mdash;the Northern <Col N="327" /> Ireland system, if you like, the American system, the Canadian system.  I am glad to see the Minister for Transport and Power here.  He is one of these people who when he speaks, covers a wide area. He has travelled a good deal.  I have no doubt that he will be using as a cogent argument the fact that the United States of America have it, and Canada and Britain also.  The extraordinary thing is that no one else has it except certain parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations, or the ex-British Commonwealth of Nations, if you like.  The developing countries have the system which was left to them as a heritage from the British Government.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to deal with the British system, I should like to refer briefly to Australia.  The electoral system there must be of particular interest to the hopes and aspirations of the Fianna Fáil Government in this referendum.  Australia has got the same electoral system.  She has had it for practically 100 years.  She has the single transferable vote and the single member constituency.  Of course, Australia is a very much larger territory. Deputy Corry complained about having to travel 100 miles, but every rural Deputy in Dáil Éireann has to do that and does not talk about it as he does.  In Australia, under the multi-member constituency system, it would not be a question of travelling 100 miles.  You might have to travel 1,000 miles.  For that reason, Australia has the single transferable vote and the single member constituency.</P>
    <P>A feature about the vote in Australia is that you have got to vote the list.  You have to vote 1, 2, 3, 4, if there are four candidates, in the order of your choice. If you do not, your vote is null and void.  That, to my mind, is a good system.  I am reliably informed by an Australian parliamentarian with whom I had the opportunity of discussing their electoral system recently, that Australia will never surrender that system.  They find it a good system. They are absolutely and totally opposed to the first-past-the-post system which the Fianna Fáil Government wish to <Col N="328" /> impose on us.  They have had their system for nearly 100 years.  They have had four referenda to change the electoral system and all those referenda were heavily defeated.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments used by the advocates of the first-past-the-post system was that the mother country had it and that Australia should have it as well, but the referenda were heavily defeated.  This Australian parliamentarian I was talking to the other day asked me which side I was on in the attempt to change our electoral system.  I told him I stood for maintaining PR because it had served us well.  He said.  &ldquo;You need not worry. The Government may carry the vote all right, but the experience in Australia will prevail and the referendum will be heavily defeated.&rdquo;  In my opinion, that will be the case.  I am not in on the inner secrets of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet but I think that if they could see any way out of the invidious position in which they have placed themselves, they would be happy to escape from it, provided they could save face.</P>
    <P>To return to the British electoral system, the Fianna Fáil Government have been hankering after it for years. That is a slight change of policy on that side of the House.  At one time it used to be: &ldquo;Burn everything British except their coal.&rdquo;  Now they seem to have become so indoctrinated, shall I say, with everything British that they even say that the British electoral system would be good for the Irish people, that is, the first-past-the-post system. To my mind, that has not produced any great stability.  It has not produced any greater stability than we have had in this country.  I think it was Deputy Corry who quoted the many elections we have had here.</P>
    <P>We had frequent elections in the 30s and in the early 40s, but they were all at the instigation of the then Leader of Fianna Fáil who loved elections and, at the least excuse, went to the Park and dissolved the Dáil to show that he could do what he wanted and be successfully returned in the election. Undoubtedly we had elections which were entirely unnecessary.  The Government had not been defeated in the Dáil and there was no evidence that <Col N="329" /> they would be defeated.  Apart from that, we had comparative stability under PR.  We had the Government from the institution of the State up to 1930.  Then we had a Fianna Fáil Government from 1932 to 1948.  We had a change of Government from 1948 to 1951.  From 1951 to 1954, we had a Fianna Fáil Government.  Perhaps there was a little instability because they depended on the votes of a few Independents.  At that time it looked as if the Independents would turn their backs on the Fianna Fáil Government but, after some cajolery, and so on, some of them joined the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government were able to carry on.  We had a change of Government again from 1954 to 1957.</P>
    <P>In 1957 Fianna Fáil got an overall majority.  As I pointed out, they utilised that overall majority not for the benefit of the people but for another politically futile exercise such as we are having at the moment, an attempt to change the electoral system. They were in office from 1957 to 1961. That was four years.  The legitimate or legal span of the life of the Dáil is five years.  From 1961 to 1965, they were there.  That is four years again.  They came in again in 1965 and by the fortuitous circumstances of winning by-elections, they secured an overall majority and they are there now.  In ordinary conditions, and providing they were prepared to avoid the pitfalls of a referendum to try to disrupt the Constitution, they should be there until close on 1970, the year in which we understand from the Fianna Fáil Government we are getting into the Common Market.  However, that is another matter.</P>
    <P>The British system with regard to the calling of elections is the same as ours.  It is the prerogative of the Prime Minister to go to the Queen and ask for a dissolution of Parliament, just as it is the prerogative of the Taoiseach here to go to the President and ask for a dissolution.  They have the same system and their elections can be called when it suits the Party in power.  The British have had innumerable elections. The Labour Government came into power in 1963 and the following <Col N="330" /> year there was another general election. Perhaps the greatest argument in favour of the straight vote is what happened away back in 1926 or 1927, when the Conservative Government which had been a coalition before that &mdash;it was formed during the war&mdash; ceased to function very well and a Labour Government then got into power.  After that, rightly or wrongly &mdash;it is not for us to decide since we are not citizens of Britain but of Ireland&mdash; the people turned against the Labour Government and they had a general election under the straight vote system. The result, from the point of view of the British parliamentary institution, was a disaster because the Conservatives swept into power with an enormous majority.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party who constituted the principal Opposition in those days, since the Liberals had slowly died out having ceased to be fish or flesh or fowl, was decimated and reduced to 60 members, led by Sir George Lansbury.  This with the addition of a few Liberals represented the Opposition against an overwhelming Conservative majority.  There was no effective Opposition, no possibility of anybody coming in to produce cogent and constructive arguments.  Most of those who had constituted the Opposition&mdash; which is just as important in Parliament as the Government&mdash;had disappeared and the Conservative Government went asleep and did nothing, with the result that there was mass unemployment and complete disruption of the economy.  There was an ineffective Parliament.  That, I suggest, is what could happen here.  Although the Conservatives had this overwhelming majority in the British House of Commons, they were ineffective. Although the Labour Party Front Bench had been decimated and many of their members had disappeared from the scene, they had still polled a considerable proportion of the votes, 42 per cent or 43 per cent against the 57 per cent polled by the Conservatives and a few Liberals but they had practically no representation, only 60 members out of 500.  Anybody who likes to work out the proportion will find they had a considerably lower <Col N="331" /> percentage of seats than the percentage of votes they polled.</P>
    <P>On another occasion in a British election in 1945-46, I think, the British Conservatives had a smaller percentage of votes than the Labour Party had got but they won the election.  Is that a great electoral system to have?  We are told that if the people vote they should vote for a Government.  They want to be sure their vote is fully effective but it cannot be in that kind of case.  Any Liberal who intervenes in the British electoral institution may be responsible for creating a minority seat.  These are things which should be borne in mind.  I should like to hear them answered on the other side. If the Government have taken the trouble, as I believe they have, to discuss this among themselves behind closed doors, I want to hear them argue against the minority vote putting a Government into power.  Do they want a minority Government in power or do they want to see a fully democratic vote operated?</P>
    <P>There is also the question of trained political personnel.  Many people have become cynical about our political institutions&mdash;perhaps not so many but one imagines there are more because they are the people who write letters to the paper suggesting that the entire Dáil should be cleared out and new blood brought in, and so on.  The training of political personnel is necessary. Today in public life things have changed considerably from what they were when I first came here in 1951. The State is spending enormous sums of money and is by far the biggest employer.  Anything that concerns the State concerns the elected representative who is the bulwark against the growing encroachment of bureaucracy on the rights and prerogatives of the individual.  In saying that, I do not want to cast any aspersions on our very fine Civil Service but I want to stress that the system is growing whereby there is bureaucratic control under which decisions are being taken in the name of the Minister.  A Minister cannot attend to everything himself and decisions are being made behind closed doors by some unknown persons <Col N="332" /> who may be senior or even junior civil servants.</P>
    <P>The defender of the rights of the people is the elected representative but to be a good and influential defender, able to state the case of the person with a problem, the Deputy&mdash;or will he be called a Member if the referendum succeeds?  &mdash;must know the facts of his constituency and how to deal with each particular problem.  He must know to whom to go and he must evaluate the problem from two points of view, that of the individual and that of the nation.  To do that successfully, he must be a trained person.  If we are going to create a situation in which the entire political personnel or a great number of them will be wiped out, it will be a very dangerous situation in Irish political life and will remove the greatest bulwark of democracy, indeed the only bulwark of democracy in the country today.</P>
    <P>I may carry that a little further.  The Minister will probably get up when I have finished and say that we are very despondent in Fine Gael, that we are afraid we shall be wiped out.  Personally I have no fears and I hasten to assure the Minister on that point, but I am interested as it happens, perhaps because I belong to a political family, in the welfare and prosperity of the country as a whole.  I should like to give two reasons why I consider this a dangerous situation.  I want to take the Members of the House back to the period of the 1918 election.  At that time, we had sitting for practically all constituencies, with the exception of a few that had been won by Sinn Féin, which was then the coming Party, the Irish Parliamentary Party, approximately 84 of them.  They were trained political personnel and could have played a very vital part though quite obviously they would not be the Government in the new Parliament ultimately set up here.  They had spent long hours in the British Parliament and in fact they had made the new British Parliamentary procedure.  They had forced the British Government in 1884 to bring in the guillotine Act to close a debate, the weapon which Fianna Fáil used so effectively in the protracted discussions on the Live <Col N="333" /> Stock Marts Bill.  They were trained personnel.</P>
    <P>We had the 1918 elections and we had the straight vote, the vote which the Government are so keen on, and the result was that these trained personnel, men who had dedicated their lives to the parliamentary institution were swept away overnight, with the exception of the late Johnny Redmond, who held Waterford, and one or two in Northern boundary constituencies. They were totally eliminated and a new Party came into power, Sinn Féin. They became the dominant Party and swept Ireland.  If we had had proportional representation then, 24 to 30 of that Parliamentary Party would have survived.  They would have been useful in that they would have formed an effective Opposition.  Secondly, they would have helped in the establishment of parliamentary institutions here and they would have been of immeasurable value in helping their colleagues even of a different shade of opinion in advising them on what attitude to take in furthering the interests of their constituencies, both in private and in public.</P>
    <P>They disappeared overnight and this enormous Sinn Féin Party came into power and controlled the whole country from north to south.  Ultimately the Treaty came and when the Treaty came, we had the split.  The reason we had the split was&mdash;and this was the sole reason&mdash;that we had no Opposition.  We had the Sinn Féin Party and they split among themselves. It we had had proportional representation, we would have had 25 to 30 perhaps more Redmondites in the House here who would have constituted an Opposition, an Opposition which would have been responsible possibly for keeping the Sinn Féin Party knit as one instead of having the disastrous split we had, the Civil War and all the results that flowed from it.  That is one strong, cogent argument against the straight vote.  If, as some of the pessimists believe, the straight vote comes back here and it produces a dominant Fianna Fáil Party flowing from those benches right around here and there are only a few of us struggling to survive as the bulwark of democracy, is <Col N="334" /> it not likely that we will have a further split?  I can tell you this: if the Fianna Fáil Party split, if they get into that position, it will be some split.</P>
    <P>Let us take another point of view.  I have said that Irish political life is a personal thing.  The majority of us who come from rural constituencies and those who come from urban areas live in our constituencies.  We understand the immediate problems of the people concerned.  Although we are in political opposition in Wexford, we are a friendly sort of people and we agree with each other and we unite at all times&mdash;the four of us who represent the constituency&mdash;where we conceive it to be for the benefit of the public as a whole, <i>pro bono publico</i>.  We do that and I have no doubt they do the same in other constituencies.  We know and we understand the problems of our people.  If I lived in Merrion Row or somewhere else in Dublin the whole year round, what could I expect to know about the immediate problems of agriculture unless I spent every second day going down to my constituency? What could I know about the problems of housing in my constituency? How could I be approached by the local people if they wished me to do something for them?</P>
    <P>That brings me to another argument against this.  We go back again to the British Parliament because that is what is on the minds of Fianna Fáil.  It is inbred in them.  They are looking at what the British are doing all the time. In the British Parliament it is the exception rather than the rule that a Member lives in his constituency. There are men representing Wales who come from the north of Scotland but the majority of the parliamentarians in Britain live in London itself. The imposition system exists there.  It simply means that&mdash;and one reads about this in the papers&mdash;when a vacancy comes up in Parliament, it is not a question of the local alderman, the local mayor or some local influential person being chosen.  It does happen in the odd instance, but in the majority of cases, there is what is known as a list.  People are asked to apply.  That is really what happens in Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> The Chairman of the Conservative Association and Transport House which functions on behalf of the Labour Party ask for a list of applications by candidates.  Candidates apply.  They have no local connection with the constituency whatsoever but perhaps they may have previously sat for some other constituency and may have been in the House of Commons for a time so that their names are well known.  Beyond that, they have no real contact with the local people whatever.  Then there is a short list and in 90 per cent of cases, none of those MPs&mdash;whether Labour, Conservative or Liberal&mdash;have ever had anything to do with the constituency before.  Is it not possible here that we will approach the same idea?  Is it not possible that you will find that the leaders of the Party whoever they may be will decide that so and so is a good man; he toes the line; he gives a good subscription.  I shall not mention the famous organisation referred to here so often because it seems to engender such heat all round and I want to keep the debate as free of acrimony as possible. He gives a good subscription to the Party and he is imposed on an area in which he has absolutely no interest.</P>
    <P>He could be a wealthy business tycoon probably living in Dublin.  He is imposed on the rural constituency. He does not want the salary because he already has numerous directorships.  He has probably placed his salary at the disposal of some local person to carry out the functions of the constituency. He will be able to call himself&mdash;I do not think it will be a TD then if the aims of the Government succeed&mdash;an MP. That is exactly what is likely to happen in this country.  It is the system in countries in which the straight vote exists. That would be a disaster because even supposing the business tycoon, if he is given a constituency to enhance his reputation, his business acumen and business influence at the behest of Fianna Fáil, or even at the behest of any other Party, gives the salary which he does not want to some local person to look after the constituency, that local person will not have &ldquo;TD&rdquo; after his name.  Therefore he will not have the influence with the Departments and will <Col N="336" /> not be able to fight the issues as we can do today.  Those are two reasons to which the Minister and his Government and his Party should give serious consideration.</P>
    <P>The system in the United States of America has been quoted as the straight vote.  I like to help the Government as much as possible because they have so little to argue.  I like to assist them in every way I can by referring to all the countries in which they have this electoral system.  Canada has the straight vote.  I cannot recall at the moment any other country in the world that has it, except, I will concede, several of the South American countries.  However, revolutions took place so frequently there&mdash;the only method of changing a Government there was by the overthrow by force of arms of the Government&mdash; that the majority of them have changed to the proportional representation system.  The Taoiseach said it is a product of the nineteenth century that is passing away but actually it is a product of the twentieth century that is returning with all the force it can command to maintain and establish democracy in countries that have been dictatorships.</P>
    <P>However, to return to the United States of America, the political situation in the United States is not exactly the same&mdash;although they have the straight vote&mdash;as the Government would have us believe.  When they are electing Congressmen, when they are electing Senators, they are not electing the Government and the position is not quite the same as it is under the British system.  In the United States of America, the President has almost unparalleled authority.  In fact, he is the Government because he establishes the Government.  It is not the Congress or Lower House in the United States, nor is it the Senate, it is the people of America who elect their President and by electing him, they give him full executive authority to do virtually whatever he wants to do.  It is also possible in the United States for a President to govern without a majority in the Congress.  That is a point which is worth bearing in mind because it has been argued from the Fianna Fáil <Col N="337" /> benches that we must have this because we must have a Government, that we must copy America, that it is a powerful democracy and it has managed to maintain itself as a Republic since its inception 150 years ago.</P>
    <P>With regard to Canada I do not believe the Minister for Transport and Power in the persuasive tones which he will use when he rises to speak after me will be able to show that there is any parallel between the situation in Canada and here.  There are miles and miles of tracts of land where you will see very few people living.  You can travel long distances in trains without seeing a human being.  It seems to me that the system of proportional representation there would be unworkable and for that reason they just do not have it.  They have the system they have at the moment, and in relation to local government as well.</P>
    <P>To return to France for a moment, there is one point I forgot to mention, that is, that France seems to be the real reason in the mind of the Taoiseach who stated the case for the Government for abolishing proportional representation.  The local elections in France are still held under the proportional representation system and France is also governed by committees. They have local committees as well which creates a very much different situation in that a great deal of power is taken out of the hands of parliament itself.  I mention those facts to show that there is virtually no parallel whatever between France and this country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to detain the House unnecessarily but I feel that the Government should consider this whole matter again.  It seems to me that originally when they introduced this hare-brained scheme, they believed, having been defeated with everything in their favour nine years ago, that these two Bills would go through, first of all, as one, that they would put them together and confuse the issue, that the greater part of rural Ireland would vote for the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill to enable the parity of constituencies to be maintained in those areas particularly <Col N="338" /> in the West.  They also believed that the idea of wiping out the Labour Party or any small parties would appeal to the Fine Gael Party.  They have read wrongly the mind of Fine Gael: let them make no mistake about that.  The history of this Party, which is quite a long one if you dovetail it with the original Cumann na nGaedheal Party, which has very much the same personnel, has been one of defence of the rights of minorities and the defence of democracy.  We are not likely to give that up lightly.  Furthermore, no matter what we ourselves might decide in this Parliament, those who voted for and stood behind us over the years are not likely to surrender it lightly, nor would they have a high opinion of their public representatives were we prepared to do so, which we are not.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the Government that this Party will put all we have into this fight and we are not alone in it. I want to warn the Government as well that the people of Ireland resent what the Government are doing.  They resent the fact that with all the problems there are, and there are serious problems, which I do not want to mention here because you, Sir, might rule me out of order, facing this country and right well the Government know it, they still want to put this through.  The Government must know the problems facing this country internally and also the problems facing us outside.  If ever there was a time when all the forces and all that parliamentary debate can secure should be utilised in the best interests of the country, it is today, when by reason of the fact that this is a changing world, with numerous new countries coming into existence, when there is world-wide responsibility and communication, the Government have many problems on hands.  Is there not something wrong, something almost despicable and petty in the fact when for the second time in less than 20 years the Fianna Fáil Government have a majority they come forward with the same proposals as were rejected by the electorate in 1959?</P>
    <P>I want to warn the Government that not only will they be defeated by 34,000 votes, or whatever it was the <Col N="339" /> last time, but they will be overwhelmingly defeated.  The time of this Parliament will have been wasted talking about something nobody wants except the small clique facing us in the benches opposite and the result of it will be that when this Parliament comes to an end&mdash;and it is likely to continue until the 1970s, with the overall majority they have&mdash;the people will look back on it as a disastrous parliament like the 1957 to 1961 parliament when they had an overall majority and when there was so much they could have done which they did not do.  They spent the time of the people and the time of the public representatives arguing something nobody but themselves wanted.</P>
    <P>Let the Government take heed of what I have said.  It is never too late to mend and any man who changes his mind when he finds that full public opinion is against him will not be thought any the less of.  I am personally interested in seeing that those problems which are so paramount to our political life should be dealt with here in parliament and that we should not be asked to spend our time fighting something we know the country does not want.  At the end of it, we will find that it is something that will besmirch the name of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde pretty well gave the show away when he spoke about the certainty of our defeat and of the damage we were going to do to the country. It seems to indicate that if he is right, we are showing an amount of political courage in deciding to place this issue before the Irish people during the course of a referendum.  What he said about there being no possibility of discussing matters of serious interest to the country because of this debate in the Dáil has no relevance whatever to the present situation. Our economic future will be discussed at the time of the Budget and the Estimates will have to be passed in the usual way.  The length of the debate is largely a matter for the Opposition if <Col N="340" /> they choose to indulge in endless and perpetual repetition, most of which will not be put into the newspapers in detail because they have not the space to print it.  Although the debate will be very long, it will not prevent an important discussion on social and economic problems in the Dáil during the present year and it is ridiculous to suggest that it would do so.</P>
      <P>Another charge has been made against this, that by recommending the straight vote, we are preventing the possibility of left-wing Parties being elected to this House.  Left-wing Parties have been elected in countries with the straight vote system.  There is nothing to prevent them being elected.  In the modern world in which practically everyone places his confidence in the intervention of the State in social and economic fields, the idea that it would be impossible for a left-wing Party to be elected is ludicrous.  It is designed to give the people the impression that we want to impose some kind of dictatorial right-wing control over the country, whereas, in fact, the Fianna Fáil Party are a left-wing Party, a left of centre Party working for years with the object of ensuring social equality as far as we can secure this.</P>
      <P>I will not compare the situation here with that of the United States, a country with 200 million people of varying races.  I want to apply the principle of the straight vote to our circumstances. I would like to remind the House that during the two periods in which we had a Coalition Government the period ended on each occasion with an acute financial crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the people of the country should be reminded of what happened in 1948 when the first Coalition Government were elected.  Several Parties, two of them new Parties, put forward their various plans at the time of that election.  The Clann na Talmhan Party had a sort of mixture of land socialism and at the same time, a belief in the individual rights of the small farmer which is difficult to understand, but, nevertheless, they put forward some sort of policy.  Then we had the Clann na Poblachta Party. They ignored our success in preventing <Col N="341" /> wartime inflation and suggested that the only thing to be done was to spend vast quantities of money.  They accused the Government of corruption and when they returned as Government to office, they found no evidence of corruption. They said we should quickly recoup our external assets invested in British securities and in that way produce a paradise of good living for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>At that time there were two Labour Parties, the National Labour Party and the other one, and sometimes they spoke against each other at various election meetings.  I heard them speak against each other in County Wicklow. The electorate were deprived of their rights at that time in deciding which of the various Parties should be selected for the Coalition Government.  They had no choice.  They elected the two Labour Parties with no decision whereby the two Parties could come together in a Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>None of the policies was in fact operated.  Some of the worst policies from the various Parties were chosen and, as I said, the first Coalition Government ended with an acute economic crisis, largely because of what they thought they should do concerning money, that to repatriate external assets from Britain would bring economic strength to the country, whereas you can only do that by importing something and unless you can import manufacturing machinery that can produce more goods or some sort of machinery that can produce wealth, you will end up with an acute situation in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>The electorate at that time had no possible way of deciding which of the various Party policies could be discarded in order that a Government could be formed and they had no power to decide on actual policy because no one knew what the policy was to be and they had no mandate in regard to the financial policy adopted by the Coalition Government.  So we had three years of government without any definite mandate from the people. with the Fine Gael Party, as the largest, gradually gaining influence.  Some people believe there was something extraordinary about them.  That was not <Col N="342" /> true.  They inevitably gained influence as the larger Party in a merger of Parties.  In some respects one of the smallest Parties put the Coalition Government out of office.</P>
    <P>During that period the people knew what Fianna Fáil would stand for. Their policy was proclaimed in various documents in 1947-1948.  Everybody knew what the Party stood for and as a result the Fianna Fáil Party retained their status and were finally elected in 1951.</P>

      <P>The same thing happened from 1954 to 1957.  The Coalition were again elected.  There was an acute inflation which could not be controlled at an earlier point and the various members of the Government were unable to face the final results of the inflation and acute economic depression took place.  Some 41,000 people lost their jobs in one year and emigration and unemployment rose to a record high figure.  The reason the Government failed was that the various smaller Parties were unable to agree on what the Government should do during the occasion of a financial crisis.</P>
      <P>In our view, that kind of operation makes for thoroughly bad government. One of the reasons this makes for bad government is that the small Parties have never any chance of seeing their policy put into operation, having no responsibility for fiscal inflation.  Budgets are not interesting to them.  Therefore, they suggested any kind of policy regardless of its merits. That deluded the people into believing that some wonderful improvement in the economic situation could be brought about overnight and the smaller Parties of the Coalition Government did not object to the idea that they did not have to do any national housekeeping when they decided whom they would vote for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present age it is our view that each elector should do a little bit of national housekeeping calculation before he elects someone to form a Government because our economic progress depends most desperately on our preventing a resumption of the <Col N="343" /> inflation that has taken place in this country three times since the war, in 1951, in 1955 and again between 1964 and 1966.  The 1964-66 situation we were able to handle because we were not supported and kept in office by a Party, say, of five to ten people in whose interest it was not to impose taxation or to take difficult steps, unpopular steps, to control an inflationary position.</P>
    <P>The importance of preserving this country from inflation is absolutely vital.  We are an import-intensive country.  We have no great volume of metals or ores or other raw materials other than the good soil of our land. Every time that an extra pound is spent and thrown into circulation, 8/6 of that pound is spent on imports and that situation is likely to continue.  We have a situation in which we are on the fringe, just below, the richest 16 countries in the world and a great many people think that they can seek a higher and higher standard of living, closer and closer to this richer group of countries without having earned the productivity which would justify it.  If Members of the House read the Full Employment Report signed by employers and by nine trade unionists, they will realise that if we are to make any progress in bringing about full employment in this country, very great discipline of mind will be required by the Irish people and you cannot have true discipline of mind in regard to social and economic policies if there is any chance of a coalition Government being elected in which each Party would try to prevent disciplinary action being taken when it would be required in order to preserve the value of money which particularly affects the interests of the poorer, the less well off people.</P>
    <P>That is our view in regard to this whole matter and particularly in relation to the very high level of taxation which we have in this country, which we shall have in the future.  It is absolutely essential that, taken as a general principle, when people elect someone to the Dáil they elect someone who will form a Government the whole of whose policy they have read, understood and <Col N="344" /> appreciated.  It is true to say that in the modern age the greater communication we have derived, partly through the growth of prosperity in the country, induces the creation of pressure groups. There are no objections to pressure groups&mdash;they are part of the democratic system&mdash;but I think it would be far better if the pressure groups were to exercise their influence on Parties capable of forming a Government, rather than turning themselves into political Parties who will have no responsibility for forming a Government when they get elected because the people who vote for the pressure party groups will never know whether their policy will be achieved.</P>
    <P>Another reason why we must make quite sure that we give the opportunity to the Irish people to decide whether they want the system of voting by which the electors are encouraged to vote for a Government is the fact that all policies now require co-ordination one with another.  The social and economic progress of this country is based on co-ordinated planning, co-ordinated financing, very careful financing, to ensure that every element in the community benefits from the various policies administered by the various Departments.  For example, agriculture depends on the operation of the Department of Lands as well, and of the Board of Works in relation to drainage. Education is linked with the work of other Departments; transport, equally, is linked with the operations required to forward industry and to promote agriculture.  When we consider the very serious problems that face us in trying as far as we can to stabilise the population in the west, one will appreciate that any kind of Party which merely operated to defend the west by itself would be fraught with very great danger because the western policy itself must be integrated with all the rest of the policies of the State&mdash;tourism, development of regional centres, the provision of housing, regional planning of industry. All have to be co-ordinated, and to allow a system to grow up in which there could arise numbers of Parties which were in fact pressure groups would not result in the right kind of policy now or in the making use of <Col N="345" /> our financial resources to the best possible degree.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat it has been suggested that we want to deprive the country of the right to elect people with extreme left-wing views.  I wonder whether there is much reason for any Party with extreme left-wing views&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the problems we are faced with in modern democracies is that there are no really conservative Parties left.  The State must intervene so much, spend so much money, extract such a large volume of taxation by way of direct and indirect taxes and rates, provide such a panoply of welfare services, assisting private investment with grants, that more and more political discussion is becoming associated with marginal differences between the interests of the various sectors of the community.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is still more important that when people come to an election they first of all elect someone who can form a government and, secondly, elect someone with a personality who is able and willing to represent an area of reasonable size.  I should like to remind Deputy Esmonde that all the major Parties have advocated the straight vote at one time or another, as the Deputy knows.  Deputy Oliver Flanagan clearly showed his approval of the straight vote principle in a recent appearance on Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave in 1965 when he was elected Leader of the Fine Gael Party, said that he himself approved of the straight vote system. <Col N="346" /> Deputy J. A. Costello in 1937 condemned the concept of PR, and Deputy Corry has already read the wonderful diatribe on PR delivered by Deputy Dillon on 12th November, 1947.  I do not think Deputy Corry put on record the concluding statement in which Deputy Dillon said that he looked forward to the day when &ldquo;we may provide our people with an opportunity of getting rid of this fantastic system and hasten the day by which we will return to a normal system devised to ascertain the will of the people&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is quite entitled to change his views and I have always disagreed with some of my colleagues on both sides of the House who condemned people who change their point of view during their lifetime as Deputies.  Equally, one is quite entitled to quote their previous views if one thinks he can add to the tone of the debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde pointed out that we have had a number of elections here.  I think that, in 16 elections, on not less than 11 occasions the Government elected were in a minority of votes in the Dáil and only three times in 16 elections was a clear majority established. In fact, I think that my Party have survived as a Government partly because their policy was so clear and so well-defined that, even though a minority of the House, they managed to maintain their position, at least for a period.</P>
      <P>Some people suggested that, under the straight vote system, a great number of candidates are elected on a minority of the total poll of each constituency. I happened to get some figures which showed that, in a recent election in Great Britain, in only 37 out of 630 constituencies were candidates returned who received a minority of the total poll whereas, under proportional representation, in 1948, when the Coalition Government were elected here, 43 out of 146 seats were filled without reaching the quota.  I do not think I need go into detail on the various disadvantages of the proportional representation system.  No doubt other Deputies will engage in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde, along with other <Col N="347" /> Deputies, suggested we want to perpetuate ourselves in office.  There is no stronger weapon in defeating a Government which the people think have been too long in office than the straight vote system.  It is more likely that a Government who have become really unpopular through getting careless or indifferent would be a longer time in opposition under the straight vote system than they would be under the proportional representation system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde should know that, if ever Fianna Fáil are to be defeated, they are far more likely to be defeated when the representative of Fianna Fáil in each constituency represents the whole people in that area and has to account to the whole people, of all Parties, in that area for his conduct, for the way he speaks in the Dáil, for the policies he advocates in respect of his local area, for the responsibility placed on him&mdash;which is good from the point of view of the philosophy of democracy&mdash;to represent all the people of the area, for being the only person representing all the people in the area. Unless he exercises it successfully, unless his Government is successful, then, very surely, that Government will be defeated.</P>
    <P>I utterly disagree with the concept of some people&mdash;including some people outside this House&mdash;that the straight vote system automatically perpetuates the life and the existence of the Fianna Fáil Government.  If we are elected under this system, we shall, more than ever, have to show proof to the people that we are acting as an effective and good Government&mdash;more than ever before.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made by some people on Radio Telefís Éireann, who were discussing the effect of the straight vote system of election, that, based on the last local elections, we might receive 93 seats in the next general election.  That might be so because I think people will find that we have carried out our responsibilities fairly well in the past 12 or 13 years. Indeed they might want to vote for us with very great enthusiasm.  However, the whole of that calculation was based <Col N="348" /> on very false premises.  In local elections, there is a wide variety of candidates.  There is an enormous number of candidates on each ballot paper. I do not think local elections can be used for making these kinds of calculations. In a general election, all the policies with no hope of survival are eliminated.  I do not think there is any comparison at all between local elections and any elections that take place. There are very different circumstances between them and an election to make sure that a government is formed.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies on the opposite side cannot understand why we have not a long-term interest in holding on to proportional representation.  They jeer at us on having been so successful under the proportional representation system.  We are looking forward to the future and to the fact that no government can survive for ever.  We want to make sure that, if there should be an alternative government, we shall not have recurring economic and political crises.  The only way we can ensure that is by having the straight vote so as to eliminate the inevitable conflicts that take place between Coalition Parties whenever they are challenged on some major issue, whenever things become difficult.</P>
    <P>If, as we hope, the referendum is passed, this will be a great challenge to Fianna Fáil because, if it is passed, then for the first time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not saying there are not individual circumstances. In any discussion, whatever one says is not necessarily 100 per cent true in every case.  I know that, in a great many areas, the straight vote system would provide a wonderful opportunity for young men to prove their mettle and their capacity for public speaking, for getting to grips with local and national problems and to present themselves to the local Party organisation, whether it be Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, knowing that that organisation has to select the person who is most likely to receive the support of the people in the area, there being no second or third candidate.

Under the straight vote system, the introduction of young blood will, in my opinion, produce a better candidate. There will no longer be the rivalries, the Taoiseach said, between candidates of the same Party or <Col N="350" /> different Parties in trying to emphasise the personal influence they have in regard to administrative decisions and Government decisions.  People will then begin to learn, when there is one representative in one area, how impartial is the exercise of the administrative laws in this country.

      <P>The Deputy is talking in an asinine way.  I said that fiscal stability is essential and absolutely the lifeblood of this country is to have fiscal stability, financial stability, to prevent inflation and rapidly soaring prices and to prevent all the evils that afflict a great many countries where there is not a Government which commands the support of the people or, at least, of a majority of them.  That is one of the principal reasons why the people of this country in future should more and more when they vote, as I have said already, vote for someone who, they believe, can form a Government, with a set of co-ordinated policies and, above all, with financial responsibility, with the knowledge that Budgets must be balanced, if possible, that money can be raised only from the savings of the community and, under the straight vote procedure, people are compelled, at least to a reasonable extent, to observe that rule that they elect an individual who takes part in promoting a series of co-ordinated policies planned so that each one of them has a certain effect on the country's economic and social life.  For that reason, I strongly recommend the House to adopt the Third and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister for Transport and Power making his contribution on these Bills, I have been once more convinced.  He, by his statements, has proved over and over again the motives behind the proposed changes.  It is simply to keep the Fianna Fáil Party in power.  The Minister has spoken of the so-called dangers of alternative Governments and of changes of Government and has tried to establish <Col N="352" /> that the existing Government is the only Government that can and will do any good for this country.</P>
      <P>In regard to these proposals there is a coincidence which may have escaped some people.  This is, of course, the second time these proposals have been put forward.  On the last occasion they were put forward, there was a leadership crisis in Fianna Fáil.  The Taoiseach of that time, then Deputy de Valera, was resigning as Party Leader.  He was leaving active politics. There was fear and trembling amongst the members of the Government and the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party of that time that once the then Deputy de Valera went out of politics, the Fianna Fáil Party would crumble and disintegrate.  They made this attempt in 1959 to consolidate and cement themselves in power.</P>
      <P>On this occasion, we know there have been, and from what we hear there could still be, difficulties about the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is still the possible danger of their not getting their overall majority at the next general election and again, as they had to do in 1959, they must think of some means by which they can remain in office, even though the number of persons voting for them would decrease.</P>
      <P>All this became very clear.  The Minister for Transport and Power clarified even more, to me at any rate, that these proposals have been motivated by the fear of defeat on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government and their anxiety to remain in office even against the will and the wishes of the majority of the people.  We have heard repeated here by the Minister for Transport and Power the reasons put forward for these proposals.  He mentioned the fact that the straight vote system would open the doors of Leinster House to&mdash;I forget his words but what they meant was&mdash;a more intelligent type of candidate and a more intelligent type of Deputy.  This is a serious slander on the members of his own Party and a serious reflection on the electorate as a whole.</P>

      <P>The proposed Boundaries Commission is one of the frauds of these proposals.  It is one of these proposals which on the surface appear to be quite impartial but on closer examination, one sees that the final say in the Commission in regard to the fixing of boundaries will lie with the Fianna Fáil Party.  There can be no doubt about that being likely, and the Government know this.  The Commission, as it is proposed to be constituted, will not be able to put forward proposals that are not acceptable to the Fianna Fáil Party and any of these proposals that are not acceptable can, on a majority vote in this House, be changed.  Therefore it is a waste of time having this provision in the Bill because the final say will lie with the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to how constituencies will be divided.</P>
      <P>There is one significant reference in the Bill, that is, that as far as possible county boundaries will be adhered to but urban and rural boundaries and borough boundaries will be ignored. The reason for this, of course, is to divide up the concentration of the urban vote which recent elections, and particularly the county council and corporation elections last year, showed was definitely turning towards the Labour Party.  There will be a free hand under the relevant section of the Bill to carve up towns and cities to ensure that there will be no heavy concentration of organised workers in any one constituency.  They will be mixed up with the rural areas and in that way the constituencies can be gerry-mandered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point put forward by the Minister for Transport and Power was in regard to what he thought was the serious rivalry between Deputies of the same Party in the same constituency. We can only assume he is speaking <Col N="355" /> for his own Party because he must know, or he should know, what goes on within his own Party.  I think this is a very weak reason.  I know this rivalry exists in certain constituencies. I know one constituency in which two Deputies of the Government Party did not speak to each other for many years.  I suppose that situation was not so good for the Fianna Fáil Party, but the fact that it was not so good for the Party does not now justify the constitutional change proposed here.  The fact that two members of the one Party sitting for the same constituency do not see eye to eye or cannot agree between them as to who is or who is not responsible for giving a certain constituent a particular job or filling a vacancy within the prerogatives of the Minister does not justify this change in the voting system now.  These things are internal Party matters and, if the Fianna Fáil Party are as strong and as efficient as they are alleged to be, and as keen on putting the interests of the country before everything else, then I think they should equally be able to iron out these minor difficulties within their ranks; they should be able to deal with them in some way other than by a constitutional change.</P>
    <P>I think it is a good thing to have rivalry in a constituency between Deputies of the same Party even.  Competition is the life of trade and competition in a constituency is really what keeps Deputies on their toes.  Reference was made to Deputies attending to trivial matters and trying to build up a name for themselves by doing things as between the constituency and Government Departments which could easily be done by a glorified messenger boy. But that position, where it exists, would not improve under the single-seat system.  It would tend to become worse, certainly for a time.  Then, when the Deputy would find himself with no opposition within his own constituency, he could sit back and be as indifferent to and as aloof from his constituents as are Members of Parliament in those countries in which the single-seat system operates.</P>
    <P>We would also have the situation that it would be the Party bosses who <Col N="356" /> would decide who should stand for each constituency.  The constituents would no longer have a say in the selection of the candidate.  I say &ldquo;candidate&rdquo; deliberately.  With the lapse of time, the Party bosses would become aware of what were safe constituencies, what were marginal seats and what were unsafe.  The safe constituencies would be reserved for the kind of people, who have been mentioned here from time to time, who would not stand any chance of getting elected to any public body under the present system; they would be foisted on the safe constituency and the local organisation would be told: &ldquo;There is your man. That is the man to elect.  Go out and get him elected.&rdquo; He would be duly elected.  He would reside in Dublin, correspond occasionally maybe with his constituents, visit them at election time and say a few encouraging words. Then, once the election was over, he would return to Dublin and his constituents would not see him again.</P>
    <P>The situation could also develop in which seats would be uncontested.  This would be very detrimental to the proper working of democracy.  In the long run, it would be very bad for the country. The system proposed under this Bill is the same as the system which operates in the Six Counties.  There quite a large number of seats are uncontested.  This evolution has occurred because of the way in which the constituencies were carved; it was a waste of time to contest such constituencies.  That situation would develop here under the single-seat system.  I know that is what the Government would like to see.  They would like to see as many safe seats as possible and as many of their candidates as possible returned unopposed.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that that would be the evolution under the proposed change.  Even though they would get a reduced share of the votes, and continue to get a reduced share over many elections, their candidate could still be elected, even though he would not have what could be described as an overall majority.  He would be elected, as has been pointed out by other speakers, on a minority vote.</P>
    <P>We are aware of unfortunate illnesses occurring to Deputies.  Sometimes <Col N="357" /> these are prolonged.  In a single-seat constituency, people could find themselves without any representative for a considerable part of the year. In that situation they would have no one else to whom to turn.  They would have no one to represent them. They would be absolutely on their own.  Under the present system, there are at least two, three or four other Deputies in the constituency and people are never too far from a public representative. That evolution would be bad for the people.  It would also be bad for the Deputy because there could be no rest for him.  He would not be able to convalesce as he should because he would have to get back on the job as quickly as possible and look after his constituents.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to this proposal of the tolerance between certain constituencies.  Here again a serious principle is being departed from and we are proposing to write into our Constitution a provision that all voters are not equal, that some are worth more votes than others.  We are going to put this in black and white in our Constitution if these Bills are passed and the majority of the people vote to accept that principle.  This is something to which we are opposed, and I think the Government Party would not put this proposal forward, were it not for the fact that they must have this provision to ensure the maintenance of their own representation in these areas.</P>
    <P>I wonder would they be so concerned about the representation in these areas if they had not got the grip they have on the electorate there. I do not think they would, and it is blatantly obvious to everyone that the only reason this is in the Bill is to maintain their own level of representation in these areas and to keep down the number of Deputies who can be elected in Dublin, Cork and other populated areas.  Here again we know if there is an increase in seats in these populated areas, this increase will certainly not go to the Fianna Fáil Party.  This kind of gerrymandering is so obvious to the people that they <Col N="358" /> will, I have no doubt, reject this proposal.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that all the Fianna Fáil Deputies are not allowed to speak their minds on these measures.  I think we would hear some very interesting statements if they were.  The Minister for Transport and Power referred to personal statements that were made by Members from other Parties, but gave the impression that all Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party were 100 per cent in favour of these proposals.  I want to challenge the next speaker from the Fianna Fáil Party to state here in this House that all the Members of the Fianna Fáil Party support these proposals. I have not heard any speaker from the Fianna Fáil Party assert that. They have said that this is a Party decision, but they have not said it is a unanimous Party decision.  They have not said that there is any volume of members who do not see eye to eye with these proposals.</P>
    <P>When I began, I referred to the fact that similar proposals were put forward in 1959 and to the coincidence that at that time the Fianna Fáil Party were in danger because of the departure of the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera.  I said there were problems in the same quarters on this occasion and that there is a great fear the Party will be defeated at the next general election.  There is another coincidence, that the two occasions Fianna Fáil have put forward these proposals, have been the two occasions on which they have had their biggest majorities in this House. In 1959 they had the biggest ever majority, and at the present time they have, although not as big a majority as they had in 1959, a comfortable majority.  When they have this comfortable majority, they look for stable government.  They never look for stable government when they have a very slender majority.  I think the reason is that when they are in this strong position, they try to use this strong position to keep themselves in power.</P>
    <P>While the vast majority of the people are surprised at this attempt to change the Constitution, some of us need not be too surprised, because the Fianna Fáil Party have the strength and numbers <Col N="359" /> to put this through the Dáil without any difficulty.  They also have the representation of Dáil Members and Seanad Members in each constituency in big numbers to try to put it across to the people.  That is why they are pressing forward at this point of time with these proposals.  Some might argue that the Dáil Deputy in his constituency would be worth 8,000 or 9,000 votes for the referendum, and of course the more Dáil Deputies they have the more troops they have to put this across to the people.  After the next general election, the same number of Fianna Fáil troops will certainly not be here in this House, so that, I suppose, from a tactical point of view, the Fianna Fáil Party have considered that this is the best point of time to put this forward, simply for the sake of and to the best advantage of their Party.  Right from the beginning, that is all they were thinking about in these proposals.</P>
    <P>A number of other arguments have been put forward in support of these proposals, many of them too silly to deal with.  I have mentioned already rivalry between Deputies.  There was also the argument about the long distances Deputies have to travel and the large areas they have to cover.  I do not see what can be put forward in support of this view.  I speak as a Deputy for a five-member constituency, one of the biggest in the country.  It covers all Kilkenny, all Carlow and north-west Wexford.  The present representation is two Fianna Fáil, two Fine Gael and one Labour.  If any of those five Deputies should have a complaint about the size of the constituency and the difficulty of servicing it, it should be myself.  There are two from the other Parties so they can divide the work between them and there should not be any problem as far as they are concerned.  I think therefore I am more qualified to speak about this aspect than a Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael Deputy in the constituency. I see no difficulty.  A Deputy when going for election knows the area he has to cover.  If he properly organises his work, his appointments, meetings and so on, it is possible to <Col N="360" /> service a constituency of that size.  I have found it possible to do it.  Even though I say it myself, I have done it very well.  I have managed to visit all centres in the constituency quite frequently and to deal with all the problems that come my way.</P>
    <P>Representing a large, mixed constituency like that, in which you have a large concentration of urban workers and large areas of agricultural workers, various types of industry and of agricultural production, a Deputy can be more acquainted with the overall picture rather than concentrate on a small single-seat area where there may be only one type of work performed or one type of agricultural production where he becomes parochial in his approach to the problem of legislation, Estimates and Dáil Questions here.  When you have a wide area to cover, you can study these things far better and get an overall grasp of the problems, compare the problems of the urban and rural dweller, of the coal miner and the building worker, of the agricultural worker and the forestry worker. Therefore, when you come into this House, you can say you are truly a representative of the people.  You can speak with authority and with a knowledge based upon a comparison of different ways of life.  You can speak about the people's problems.</P>
    <P>To become specialised in any small constituency would mean that that Deputy would concern himself only with the legislation and other proposals coming before the House which affected his constituency.  At present, referring again to my own constituency, it is most unlikely that there is any Bill or Estimate coming before this House that would not affect in some way some place in my constituency. But under the single-seat constituency system, a whole year could go by and a Deputy might not have to deal with any point in legislation or Estimates that would affect his constituency. Such a Deputy would become more and more the type of glorified messenger referred to previously.</P>
    <P>I put forward these views&mdash;they are the unanimous views of the Labour Party&mdash;on these proposals not because we fear the abolition of PR but <Col N="361" /> because we feel that the present system is the best system for the country and for the people.  It is the system the people have learned to live with.  They have not asked for it to be changed.  Over 45 years they have got to know the procedure of approaching Deputies.  They have their own ways and means of doing this.  Take a supporter of the Labour Party in Kerry.  Under the single-seat constituency system, it would not surprise me, if no Labour representative were elected there where they had one, to see that supporter trying to contact a Labour representative in Dublin outside his own constituency.  We would have people from one constituency travelling to another constituency in order to find a Deputy who would be in sympathy with their own political thinking.</P>
    <P>There would be a system under which the opposition of the sitting Deputy within the constituency, particularly if that sitting Deputy were a Member of the Government Party, would result in victimisation, either direct or indirect in some way or another.  It is not unknown at present, even in the multi-seat constituencies, for ordinary rank and file members who have the courage of their convictions, and demonstrate it at election times and other times, to be victimised by various State bodies and Government bodies.  Of course they are not told why they are being victimised, but the reasons for it are obvious.  This would get even worse under the single-seat constituency system.</P>
    <P>Mention is made here from time to time of the feasibility and advisability of appointing an ombudsman.  We are all ombudsmen here in this House, and I do not think that is a bad thing. Under the single-seat constituency system, if a constituent had a complaint about certain Government action that resulted in his being victimised to some extent, there would be no use in his going to the sitting Deputy if he were a member of the Government Party.  He would have absolutely no one to turn to.  At the moment he can lobby all the Members in his constituency.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the people will <Col N="362" /> give the same answer to these proposals as they gave in 1959.  I am confident that on this occasion it will be an even more emphatic refusal to change the system.  The long counts are also given as a justification for this change.  That is one of the silly reasons which I was not going to mention.  I think the first shot in these proposals was fired back in 1965 or 1966.  The feelers were then put out by the Government, through the Minister for Local Government who sent directives to all the borough authorities with a population of 10,000 or over to carve their urban area into wards.  I think that was the first shot in this electoral war. This proposal, too, was directed to maintaining Fianna Fáil representation and trying to increase it at local authority level.  Strangely enough, it was the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are members of these authorities who resisted it and spoke strongly against the proposal to divide these urban areas into wards.  After some time, the Minister for Local Government watered down his proposal and increased the limits to urban areas with a population of 12,000 or more.  The same reason was put forward&mdash;the long counts.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is justifiable to have a referendum, and to spend the best part of £200,000 on a referendum, simply to try to shorten by a few hours the time taken to count votes.  I know there are some members of the Government Party, and particularly some Ministers, who regard it as a very unpleasant duty to look after their constituents, and even to associate with them.  I know they would much prefer to have a safe constituency 100 miles from Dublin, which they could depend on to elect them without going to any trouble at a general election.  This is what some of those Ministers are hoping to accomplish under this system. In order to keep local cumann members and other supporters quiet in those constituencies, they might throw one of them a Senatorship and that would keep them happy, and the Senator could always be depended upon to do his stuff for the Minister, whoever he might be.</P>
    <P>The Minister would not have to go around at election time, and he would <Col N="363" /> not have to lower his self-styled dignity canvassing and looking for votes.  He would not fear his own Party colleague or any young candidate within his own Party who might be a serious rival to him.  He need not worry about him. He need not worry about by-elections. The only by-election that would worry him would be the one he would not be worried about.  It would be a very attractive position for him.  It is for these reasons that these proposals are being shoved down through the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The decision is made at the top and shoved down by some means to the rank and file.</P>
    <P>There are some other points I could cover in this debate but I think most of them have been covered already and will be covered again before this debate ends.  It would not surprise me if the Government even at this late stage withdrew these proposals.  Nobody wants this question put before the people again.  If these proposals are put to the people, I know that a certain number will vote for them even though they will be defeated.  Some people will vote for them because they are hypnotised into believing that anything put forward by Fianna Fáil is good for the country.  It is a sort of feeling like that of the Taoiseach we had on one occasion in the Fianna Fáil Party who, whenever he wanted to know what was good for the people, looked into his own heart.  Unfortunately, some people seem to think that since a proposal is made by the Government, it must be good for the country. The Government know this and are playing on this belief in a section of their supporters who just follow blindly where they are led.</P>
    <P>Anyone who examines these proposals fully and realises the principles involved and understands that no longer shall we have a situation where all men are equal but a situation where people in places like Dublin and other urban populated areas will have their votes devalued, a situation in which the Fianna Fáil Party will select the boundaries of constituencies and have the final and only say in this matter; when they realise that under these provisions urban areas can be carved up and a <Col N="364" /> town of perhaps 12,000 population divided into three or four constituencies, they will think again.  Under the proposals in this Bill it is clearly intended, because it is specifically mentioned, that there will be no recognition of the boundaries existing between an urban area and the county area within that county.  This is a clear indication of the Government's intention.  They will get as many constituencies merged into urban areas as possible.  I do not say that Fianna Fáil have the support of the rural population by any means but they know that the organised trade unionist is by and large in the urban areas and that these people are voting more and more for the Labour Party, and it is because of this that these proposals now confront us and this proposal is deliberately put into the Bill in order to carve up the trade union vote as much as possible.</P>
    <P>We shall have another opportunity to go into more detail on the various aspects of each section of the Bill when we come to Committee Stage but I should like to hear some speaker in the Fianna Fáil Party assert that all their members in Parliament are totally and fully behind these proposals.  None of their speakers has said that yet, although they have accused other Parties of being divided on the issue. They have deliberately avoided referring to any misgivings within their own Party.  I know that they cannot make such a statement.  These provisions will be passed because Fianna Fáil have the Whips on and no member of the Party will be permitted to step out of line and give his personal views on these provisions, nor will he be permitted to give a free vote when the time comes.</P>

      <P>My reaction to these proposals to amend the Constitution and the reaction of the vast majority of the people in my constituency is one of amazement that the Government should introduce proposals for new legislation which is unnecessary, unwarranted and indefensible. Worse still, this legislation is being introduced and foisted on the House, at a time when we should be and could be devoting time and energy to the many serious social and economic problems confronting us at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> I believe that the two Bills now introduced are a deliberate attempt by Fianna Fáil to design new electoral machinery for the sole purpose of keeping themselves in power in the foreseeable future.  It is only a mere eight-and-a-half years since the people gave their verdict on the existing electoral system.  That verdict was clear and unmistakable, leaving no doubt about the desire of the majority to retain PR. Nothing has happened since 1959: no new circumstances have arisen since which would warrant another referendum on the same question now.  The two Bills to amend the Constitution cannot be justified, in my opinion, and it is reasonable to assume that their sole purpose is to ensure the continuance of a Fianna Fáil Government <i>in saecula saeculorum.</i></P>
    <P>I believe that the people are well satisfied with the present electoral system and the Taoiseach when making his introductory speeches a week ago on these amendments and various spokesmen from the Government side of the House have not put forward one single piece of evidence which would show that there is any demand from the people for a change in the electoral system.  I believe that the present electoral system has served this country very well.  Contrary to what might be said about PR leading to instability, I believe that PR has served this country well and has given a stability of government here comparable with that in any country in Western Europe.  There is no evidence of any demand for a change in the electoral system.  I believe the people do not want any change and I confidently predict that these new proposals when referred to the people in May or June, or whenever it will be, will be rejected by an overwhelming majority, by a majority even greater than that which rejected the proposals in the referendum of 1959.</P>
    <P>I believe also, and I have found, that there is growing anger and resentment among the people at this unwarranted action of the Government in plunging the country into the turmoil of a referendum campaign.  I believe that this anger and resentment will continue to grow and I am very confident that the <Col N="366" /> Government will get the greatest shock they have ever got when the results of the referendum are known.  I believe that nowadays we have a very intelligent electorate, despite what the Taoiseach may have said in support of the change from the multi-seat to the single-seat constituency.  We have an intelligent electorate who are well able to study the various issues at stake and well able to make up their own minds.  For that reason, I believe that the people will see the present proposals for what they are, a blatant attempt by the Government to rig the electoral system for purely selfish Party motives.</P>
    <P>Certainly, speaking for the constituency of which I have the honour to be a representative and having sounded opinion there over the past couple of weeks, I find that the people are much more concerned about having something done to alleviate the dreadful unemployment situation which we have in Limerick city where, as I pointed out last week when speaking on the Adjournment on this very question, we have 2,500 people unemployed. I find that the people in my constituency would much prefer if the Government would devote their attention towards arriving at some solution to this serious unemployment problem. There are many other problems not merely in my constituency but on a national scale to the solution of which we could be very profitably devoting our time and our energy.  I therefore join with my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party in condemning these proposals and I shall certainly do everything in my power over the next couple of months to ensure that every elector in my constituency will fully realise the motives of the Government in introducing these amendments.</P>
    <P>Going from the general to the particular and taking first of all what has come to be known as the tolerance Bill and looking at this in the calmest and most objective manner possible, I find it very difficult to find any really convincing arguments in support of the introduction of this tolerance margin as it has been called.  Indeed, the Taoiseach in his speech did not put forward any <Col N="367" /> very convincing arguments in relation to this question of tolerance.  The main argument which he put forward was the difficulties which confront a Deputy in a rural area as compared with those which confront his urban colleague.  I represent a constituency which has a large urban area&mdash;it includes most of the city of Limerick.  In addition, it includes a substantial rural area, about one-third of the area of County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I must say that from my experience over the past 6½ years, all this talk and the arguments that have been put forward here for the Government side in support of the tolerance margin are complete codology.  This question of the accessibility of a Deputy to his constituents is not solely determined by the area of his constituency or by physical or geographical factors.  In my opinion, the accessibility of a Deputy to his constituents depends on the Deputy himself, whether he be in an urban area or in a rural area.  Certainly with modern methods of communication and modern methods of transport the people in a rural constituency do not find any great difficulty in contacting their Deputy.  I have experience of both rural and urban constituency work, and, if anything, I would say that the volume of work in an urban constituency is greater than the volume of work coming from a rural constituency.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach tried to make the point that the rural people have a greater variety of problems, and are therefore in greater need of the services of a Deputy than the people in urban areas.  I do not see that that is so at all.  As I said, my experience has been that the volume of work in an urban constituency, that is, the work taking up the time of a Deputy, can be far greater than in a rural constituency.</P>
    <P>There are many problems in an urban area which do not occur so frequently in a rural area.  I find in Limerick problems in regard to housing, social welfare, unemployment, redundancy, industrial relations, business problems, industrial grants, the development of tourism and so forth and <Col N="368" /> those problems are encountered much more frequently in an urban area than in a rural area.  The arguments, therefore, advanced by the Taoiseach in support of this tolerance Bill are, in my opinion, untenable.  I cannot possibly subscribe to the view that a tolerance margin of 16 per cent is justifiable. There may be an argument for a small tolerance margin of some two to three per cent but I think the margin proposed in the Bill, that is, 16 per cent, is too large and is wide open to suspicion.</P>
    <P>Another argument put forward by the Taoiseach in support of the tolerance Bill was the question of county boundaries and the desirability of keeping constituency boundaries within the confines of county boundaries.  The Taoiseach pointed out the difficulty of a Deputy having to deal with two sets of officials in different counties. There has been some experience of this since the last revision of constituencies and I am sure a number of Deputies have had the experience of dealing with local authority officials in more than one local authority area. I have that experience in my constituency where I have to deal with officials in Limerick County Council as well as officials in Limerick Corporation.</P>
    <P>There is a situation in South Tipperary where some of Waterford comes into the constituency of South Tipperary and where Deputies there have to deal with officials in Waterford County Council as well as officials in Tipperary County Council, but I do not think there is any evidence that this has been a very great difficulty.  I have certainly not heard of any serious problems arising from the fact that a Deputy would have to deal with officials in two different local authority areas.  I, therefore, believe that those arguments put forward by the Taoiseach and by the various Government spokesmen in support of the tolerance Bill are but lame excuses for introducing what in effect may well prove to be another gimmick for rigging the election system.</P>
    <P>Now, coming to the more important issue at stake here, the actual system of election, as I said at the outset, I believe proportional representation has <Col N="369" /> served this country very well.  There is certainly no evidence of any demand on the part of the people for its abolition. As I said, the people gave their verdict in 1959 and no new circumstances have since arisen to warrant any change now.  Proportional representation is probably the fairest system of election that could be devised.  It gives a fair chance to everybody and minority viewpoints can find expression and can be given representation.  Proportional representation not merely provides a choice in the matter of Parties but also a choice as between candidates of the same Party.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Taoiseach may have said and despite what various Government spokesmen may have said about rivalry and competition between candidates of the same Party and also the rivalry and competition that can exist between Deputies in the same constituency, I do not believe that is doing any harm at all.  I am a firm believer in the element of competition in anything, whether it be in sport, business, commerce or anything else.  I believe this element of competition might be a good thing, in the sense that it keeps Deputies on their toes.</P>
    <P>Under the proportional representation system, in a multi-seat constituency, every Deputy has to be constantly on the alert, and I think he will be more inclined to provide an efficient on-the-spot service for his constituents' problems when he knows that if he does not do it, a constituent may go to another Deputy in the same constituency.  I have seen many examples of where this competitive element has had very satisfactory results not merely for the individual problem of a particular constituent but more important still, in the matter of constituency problems.  I certainly see nothing wrong whatsoever with this element of competition.  While I am not opposed to the idea of competition among Deputies in the same constituency, however, I do not condone where it is brought to the stage of cloak and dagger stuff but I do not think that happens.</P>
    <P>There is also another factor I find in a multi-seat constituency, that as well as competition between one <Col N="370" /> Deputy and another, there is very often very close co-operation among the Deputies in a particular constituency when some issue of vital importance in the constituency arises.  I have seen many examples of that, and certainly so far as my constituency is concerned, my colleagues and I, representing different Parties, have time and again co-operated and by our united efforts, have succeeded in convincing a particular Government Department, a particular Minister or a particular local authority of the necessity for action on a particular problem.</P>
    <P>Another argument that has been put forward in support of the abolition of proportional representation is that it leads to a very complex system of counting and involves a very slow process for counting votes.  The fact that the system leads to a complex system of counting and delays in reaching a result is no argument whatsoever against the particular system. The proportional representation system is one which we have had since the foundation of the State.  It is a system which the people know and I believe the vast majority of the people fully understand it.  I think it is completely wrong to say, as the Taoiseach and others have said, that when you have a multi-seat constituency under the PR system, with a ballot paper containing a large number of names, containing different candidates and different Parties, very often people do not know who is who or what candidate represents what Party.  I do not believe that is a fact.  After 40 years, I believe people have got to know the general workings of the PR system and that, by and large, they do what they intend to do when marking a ballot paper. The fact that there is such a small proportion of spoiled votes in each election is clear evidence that people understand the system and that they have no difficulty in marking the ballot paper.  In this year of 1968, to say that people are confused by the large number of names on the ballot paper is completely ridiculous.  They know who is who and they know what candidate represents which Party.</P>
    <P>In his arguments in support of the <Col N="371" /> single-seat constituency, the Taoiseach went into great detail and went to considerable rounds in trying to sell this idea of the single-seat constituency. He pointed out that in a single-seat constituency, by reason of the fact that the area would be much smaller, the Deputy elected would be better able to give attention to his constituents and that he would have a more intimate knowledge of their problems.  If one Deputy had sole responsibility for a given area, he would be compelled if he wanted to survive to give on-the-spot attention.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the point here at all.  As I have already pointed out, I see nothing wrong with the element of competition between the different Deputies in the same constituencies, provided that competition is kept within reasonable bounds.  But I cannot see how one man solely in charge of a particular area and having no competition from anybody else would have the same incentive to give this better attention to which the Taoiseach refers.</P>
    <P>There is another fact that arises here. As the Taoiseach says, the average size of the single-seat constituency would consist of 12,000 voters.  I think Deputy Corish referred to this last night.  If there are three candidates in the average constituency of 12,000 voters under the straight vote candidate X gets 5,000, Y gets 4,000 and Z gets 3,000 and candidate X on the 5,000 is elected.  He has 5,000 votes and the other two combined have 7,000.  A very important point was made, if I recall it correctly, by Deputy Corish, that 7,000 people in that constituency will be unrepresented. They will be unrepresented in the sense that their particular viewpoint will not be represented in Parliament.  If a single-seat constituency system is introduced and if my constituency is divided up into four single-seat constituencies, there would probably be no change in Party representation and I would still be the sole Fine Gael Deputy in that geographical area which now comprises the constituency of East Limerick.</P>
    <P>If I am elected in a corner of that constituency nobody will persuade me that people who have elected me in the <Col N="372" /> present constituency, whether it be in Limerick City or in any part of the constituency, whether supporters of my Party or not&mdash;and after seven years now many of them are close friends&mdash; when they find themselves in a single-seat constituency to which a Fianna Fáil Deputy is elected that they will go to that Fianna Fáil Deputy.  It would be a very long time before they would do this.  I have no doubt that in a single-seat constituency system in my constituency, I would have the same volume of work.  Fine Gael Party supporters in the other single-seat constituency, which might be represented by a Fianna Fáil Deputy or another Party Deputy, would still come to the nearest Deputy of the particular Party for which they voted.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe the system would revert back to where we were.  All this talk about making things more comfortable for the Deputy and making the Deputy more accessible to particular constituents, and all these arguments about the fact that a single-seat constituency with a smaller geographical area means that people would be in closer contact with their Deputy, I do not agree with at all.  I have already said that the accessibility of a Deputy to his constituents and the type of service he renders to his constituents depends entirely on the Deputy himself. Nowadays with the availability of modern means of transport even in the most isolated rural area people do not find any great difficulty in contacting the particular Deputy they wish to contact.  Even though they might be some of the poorer sections of the community&mdash;Deputies have referred to such people&mdash;I find that if an old person wishes to contact me he has no difficulty in finding a neighbour who has a car who will be only too glad to oblige him.  I find that if a person living in even the most remote part of the constituency wants to contact me he will find means of doing so.</P>
    <P>My main objection to the two proposals before the House&mdash;I think it is the objection of the majority of the people of the country&mdash;is based on the fact that this legislation is unnecessary. There is no demand for it and there are many ways in which the time of the <Col N="373" /> House could be occupied more fruitfully. However, we on this side of the House, will fight the legislation here and in the country.</P>
    <P>There is another point of clarification. It has been stated that the arrangement of the boundaries will be done by a special commission comprising Members of the Oireachtas under a judge.  My interpretation of the proposal is that when these boundaries are determined by the commission the commission's recommendations must be submitted to Dáil Éireann for approval and that Dáil Éireann can agree with the recommendations of the commission relative to constituency boundaries or can disagree with them.  What this means in effect simply is that the determination of constituency boundaries will be done by the Fianna Fáil Party by reason of the fact that they have a majority in the House.  It means that where particular boundary lines drawn by the commission do not suit the Fianna Fáil Party they can be altered by a majority vote.</P>

      <P>There was one point I omitted to refer to.  It arises from the Taoiseach's speech and I refer to the Official Report, Volume 232, column 1947.  He said:</P>
      <P>The boundaries of county boroughs are, in effect, excluded from the provision which aims at preserving county boundaries.  Housing and other community developments have extended the built-up areas across the boundaries of the four County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and it might not be practicable to determine satisfactorily constituencies if the overlapping of these city boundaries had to be avoided within the context of the new subsection 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand what, in fact, the Taoiseach is getting at here &mdash;that the boundaries of county boroughs are, in effect, excluded from the provision which is aimed at preserving the county boundary.  He mentions Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  I take it that this refers to the fact that the present Dáil constituencies as at present drawn up, in some cases&mdash;particularly Cork, Dublin, Waterford and Limerick&mdash;may include an urban and a rural area and that they may go over the borough boundary but I am not quite clear as to what he is getting at <Col N="376" /> here.  It possibly means that when the Commission will be determining the actual boundaries of the proposed single-seat constituencies&mdash;particularly in relation to the tolerance margin&mdash; this will apply only in the purely rural areas in the west of Ireland, and so on.</P>
    <P>I think there has not been any indication of the actual counties to which the tolerance margin is to be applied. There has been mention of its application to the west of Ireland and to the western seaboard.  There is a whole lot of confusion.  This tolerance proposal is a confusing document.  Whether it is deliberately meant to be confusing, I cannot say.  However, it is difficult to understand the arguments put forward in support of it.  Certainly, I know of no special circumstances which would warrant this one-sixth tolerance margin.</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party, I shall continue to oppose these two measures both in the House and outside of Dáil Éireann by every means at my disposal.  As I have said, I have covered most of the points.</P>

      <P>I was referring to various points made by the Taoiseach in his introductory speech to the two proposed amendments of the Constitution.  In Volume 232 of the Official Report, column 1947, we read that the Taoiseach put forward a number of arguments in support of the single-seat constituency and also in support of this proposed tolerance margin.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>.... the Government have always taken the view that the special difficulties <Col N="377" /> of persons living in large constituencies in rural areas should be recognised.  These people do not have the same ease of access to their Deputies as persons living in the more compact urban constituencies.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Moreover&rdquo;, the Taoiseach states, &ldquo;experience has shown that people living in rural areas are more likely to have to seek the help of their Deputies for quite legitimate reasons.&rdquo;  I do not subscribe to this viewpoint at all.  Representing a constituency which is partly urban and partly rural, my experience has been that the volume of constituency work from the urban part can normally be much greater than that from the rural part.  There are many problems in a large urban area which occur much more frequently than they would occur in a rural area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received from a number of residents in the vicinity of Sydney Parade level crossing objections to a proposal by CIE for the installation at the crossing of remotely controlled barriers.  The proposed barriers would be fitted with skirts and would seal off the crossing completely while trains are passing.  The barriers would not be automatically controlled but together with the railway signals protecting the crossing would be under the full manual control of the signalman at Merrion level crossing who would have the Sydney Parade crossing in view at all times by means of closed circuit television.  Conventional type traffic lights would be provided at the crossing instead of flashing lights and bells as had originally been proposed. The barriers would be more difficult for <Col N="379" /> children to climb than the existing conventional gates.  CIE have informed me that the TV cameras at the crossing would have within their field of vision only the area of the crossing and the question of invasion of privacy does not arise.  The Board are satisfied that the proposed installation would not jeopardise safety at the crossing and are not aware of any evidence to the contrary from any country abroad.</P>
      <P>An order made by me under section 9 of the Transport Act 1958 would be necessary to enable the installation of the proposed barriers and CIE have made formal application to me for such an order and have forwarded copies of the draft order to Dublin Corporation and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  Before deciding the matter I will, as required by statute, consult the Minister for Local Government and I will also give due consideration to any representations made by Dublin Corporation, the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or any other interested parties.  At this stage I consider that CIE should be given the opportunity of explaining to those who have reservations about the proposal the various details of the proposed installation and the safeguards which would be provided. I have therefore arranged with CIE that they will, on request, meet representative deputations from interested parties to discuss the matter.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.  No established or quasi-permanent staff have been displaced before the normal retiring age as a result of motorisation of rural delivery services.  Only men who were recruited on a temporary basis have been displaced, and they were told, on being recruited, that they had no prospect of continuous employment.</P>
      <P>I may add that motorisation of posts is considered only where a reduction in operating costs can be achieved in this way and with the object of keeping to a minimum the loss on rural postal services.</P>

      <P>The increase in recent years in the population of a number of Dublin suburbs, including Rathfarnham and Howth has made it necessary to review the suitability of arrangements for sittings of the District Court.  This review is being carried out by my Department, and future arrangements for courthouses must await the results of the review, which because of its complexity and the need to consult various interests, will take some time to complete.</P>
      <P>I accept that overcrowding may occur on certain sitting days at Rathfarnham and Howth, where the courthouses are exceptionally small.  Under an arrangement made in 1965 in Howth to facilitate the public and to reduce overcrowding, cases for hearing are divided into three lists, two of which are taken at fixed times in the morning and the third at a fixed time in the afternoon. In view of a recent complaint about overcrowding, the numbers of cases in these lists have already been reduced, and special court sittings have been provided to relieve the pressure on the scheduled sittings.</P>
      <P>I intend to introduce separate lists of cases, with fixed times for each list, in Rathfarnham court, and this should reduce the number of persons who find it necessary to be present in court at the one time.  The position at both centres will continue to be kept under review.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Government not to participate directly in mineral exploration and development but to provide adequate facilities and incentives to private mining concerns to engage in such activities.  The effectiveness of this policy is reflected in the steadily increasing number of prospecting licences granted in recent years and the important discoveries already made.  I am satisfied that it is providing for the thorough and efficient exploration and development of our mineral resources.  The operating company at Tynagh, County Galway, hold a State mining lease, particulars of which are shown in the six monthly reports furnished by me to the House under section 77 of the Minerals Development Act, 1940.  The company did not receive any financial assistance from the State.  In the next 12 months some 40 companies will be prospecting in some 470 licence areas, averaging ten square miles.  In addition to the mines including those at Tynagh and Gortdrum which are, at present, in operation, the mine at Silvermines, County Tipperary is scheduled to come into operation in April, 1968 and detailed investigation of the discovery at Keel, County Longford is continuing.</P>

      <P>The Local Appointments Commissioners recently announced the first of a series of competitions, the remainder to be announced over the next few weeks, for a number of permanent district medical officer appointments, including a permanent appointment for the vacant district medical officer post in Ferbane dispensary district.</P>

    <P>The recruitment of permanent district medical officers has been suspended for some time in order to facilitate the reorganisation of the general medical service on the basis of choice of doctor.  All the districts included in the competitions which the Local Appointments Commissioners are now announcing have been without permanent district medical officers for a considerable time.  The competitions are being held on conditions which will enable the persons appointed to be <Col N="391" /> absorbed into the new general medical service in due course.  The question of holding a further competition on similar lines is being considered.  The case for including the Killoughy post, which became vacant too recently for inclusion in the current competitions, in the next competition will be carefully examined.</P>

      <P>Apparently, the first thing we are expected to deal with in this debate is how it comes about that we are asking the people at this juncture to make this change in our electoral system.  My colleague, Deputy Dunne, stated that there was nobody in favour of this except myself, that I am the only person in the country who wants to put this issue before the people, and that I succeeded not only in forcing it on the members of the Fianna Fáil Party but also on the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> Personally, I do not think I have got this capacity with which Deputy Dunne credits me for forcing my views on other people.  I do not think I have persuasive powers of this high order, powers I often wished I had, candidly. We are told there is no public demand for these two amendments of the Constitution.  It is very difficult to know in advance whether or not the public demands something but, if the success of a Government is to be measured by their interpretation of public demand, then I think the fact that we have been in government for 30 out of the past 36 years indicates that we have succeeded reasonably well in interpreting public demand.  There seems to me to be only one sure way of finding out if the majority desire any particular thing, that is, to ask.  That is exactly what we propose to do.  If I am responsible for this, as Deputy Dunne says I am, then I think it can be shown that I have at least been prompted by Deputy Dunne himself.  The ink was hardly dry on the preliminary report of the census of population in 1966 when Deputy Dunne had a Parliamentary Question down seeking to have a revision made of constituencies.  That was on 27th November, 1966.  The last revision of constituencies had taken place in 1961, but Deputy Dunne tabled this question in 1966:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government when the Government propose to recast Dáil constituencies so as to bring representation into conformity with the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>On at least two subsequent occasions he repeated this question.  His colleague, Deputy O'Leary, repeated it at least twice and Deputy Sweetman asked the question at least once.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne asked first on 27th September, 1966.  He also asked it on 18th October, 1967, and on 1st February, 1968.  Deputy O'Leary asked it on 13th July, 1967, and on 28th November, 1967, and Deputy Sweetman asked it on, I think, 6th <Col N="393" /> April, 1967.  There has therefore certainly been pressure from the Opposition side at least for a revision of constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but I can appreciate quite well the reasons for Deputy Dunne's anxiety in this matter.  I admit that I also find the constituency of County Dublin unwieldy and very extensive.  I find it quite difficult to keep in contact.  In order to keep in contact with the needs of the constituency we, in the Fianna Fáil Party, have no less than 62 units of our organisation to help us in County Dublin.  This entails a great deal of work for myself and my two colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party and even then, despite the adequate organisation we have, it is true to say that none of us feels he is continuously and really adequately in touch with the whole area.  Deputy Dunne paid a very well-deserved tribute to our mutual senior colleague, whom he described as a very hardworking Deputy but, as Deputy Dunne knows, even he finds it difficult to cover the constituency, the constituency Deputy Dunne wants to have reduced.  As Deputy Dunne knows, he has recently acquired some valuable assistants to help him in this direction, but, obviously, from Deputy Dunne's persistence in demanding a revision of his constituency, he finds the going too tough altogether.  He obviously wants to know in advance what part of the constituency for which he has been elected he can afford to ignore between now and the date of the next general election so that he can concentrate on that part of the area he will be actually contesting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the preliminary report on the census was hardly <Col N="394" /> out when he was demanding a revision and I can see no other reason for his indecent haste since the constituency had, in fact, been revised as recently as 1961.  There is plenty of evidence, indeed, that what I say is true.  Deputy Dunne wants to know just how much of his constituency he should continue to devote his attention to and I think the majority of his constituents appreciate that he has already given an indication that he wants to shake the dust of the biggest part of the constituency off his feet by going forward for Dublin Corporation and not for Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>Article 16, section 2, subsection (3) of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The point at issue here seems to be whether this phrase &ldquo;at any time&rdquo; makes it necessary to revise constituencies after a census which discloses a significant movement of population from one area to another and whether this subsection supersedes the next subsection which states that the constituencies shall be revised at least once in every 12 years.  Obviously Deputy Dunne&mdash;I think Deputy O'Leary also and Deputy Sweetman&mdash;want this to be interpreted in this particular way because he believes that a revision made in present circumstances would inevitably reduce both the size and the complexity of the constituency he was elected to represent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dunne and Deputy O'Leary can speak for themselves but, so far as I am concerned, I put that question down because I had been advised the Attorney General so advised the Government and I wanted to know when the Government were going to do the job the Attorney General told them to do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is why we consider it necessary to put forward this proposal about the Constitution at this juncture.  Deputy Dunne apparently thinks that such a revision would inevitably result in a reduction of the constituency he was elected to represent, but this is not necessarily so. However, the fact that the burden of representing such a large constituency is too much for Deputy Dunne, and even something of a strain on our colleague, Deputy Burke, is one of the arguments against the present system of multi-member constituencies.  A revision of the constituency would not necessarily result in a reduction in the numbers in that constituency.  For instance, it could be adjusted by giving it seven seats instead of the present five.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible.  It would be moving closer towards the system that was envisaged by the inventors of the system which we have here and which is misnamed proportional representation. It was envisaged that PR would operate in much larger constituencies and that each constituency should elect a far greater number of Deputies than is the position at present.  For instance, any PR expert would say that the whole of the county of Dublin, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and the city of Dublin would be a suitable constituency, but even the emaciated form of PR that we have in operation here is obviously proving too burdensome for Deputies like Deputy Dunne.  These changes in population that Deputy Dunne wants to have taken into account at this juncture have, as I said, only occurred since 1961, and I wonder would it really be of any great help to solving Deputy Dunne's problem if, instead of reducing the constituency, it was adjusted by merely giving it seven seats as against the five that are there at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am pointing out that to move closer to what was intended by the inventors of this system would make it even more difficult for Deputy Dunne, not easier.  This is a possible solution of the problem, but, as Deputies know, it is not one that would be likely to commend itself to us or, I think, to anybody in this House or anybody that has had experience of the system of multi-member constituencies. I admit that such a move might make it a little bit more of a possibility that Deputy Dunne would eventually acquire the colleague in County Dublin that he has tried so hard to acquire over the years.  Possibly if he did get the benefit of the assistance in the constituency of some of these prominent Labour county councillors who have been colleagues of his in elections, this might help him all right, but I think Deputy Dunne and myself know that these colleagues of his see in the prospect of single-seat constituencies their only hope of ever graduating from Dublin County Council to Dáil Éireann and that they know that in the present set-up, they can never be more than mere sidekicks to Deputy Dunne.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am, but the fact of the matter is that Deputy Dunne knows as well as I that this is the only prospect these people see and that they would be anxious to be genuine candidates in reasonably-sized areas rather <Col N="397" /> than have the present position.  I admit in regard to this question as to whether there has been public demand that none of these people has asked me to make this move, but still we know that the feeling of frustration is there.</P>
      <P>In 1959, a revision of constituencies was made in accordance with the Article of the Constitution which provides that such a revision must be made at least once in every 12 years, and that revision of the constituencies was made in accordance with the principles that have operated here since 1922.  I have already quoted Article 16. 2. 3º of the Constitution, and in that Article the phrase &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo; has always been interpreted as meaning that reasonable account should be taken of such practical considerations as administrative boundaries and of geographical features, and the revision of constituencies that was made in 1959 was carried out in this way.  The revision that was then made was accepted unanimously in this House, but it was challenged in the High Court by a private individual, and we all know the decision that was given by the Court. This was to the effect that these practical considerations could not be taken into account but that a revision of constituencies must aim at achieving mathematical accuracy in regard to the ratio of population per Deputy in each constituency, and Judge Budd indicated that a maximum deviation from the national average of 1,000 was tolerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of this was that a new revision of constituencies had to be made.  This was done on the basis of keeping the mutilation of counties to an absolute minimum, but despite this it was found necessary to do a number of illogical and, in my opinion, quite inequitable things.  It was necessary, for instance, to detach from County Louth a considerable number of the population and to attach them to Monaghan. Part of Meath and Westmeath had to be attached to Kildare.  Part of Wexford had to be attached to Carlow-Kilkenny, these two counties having already been joined together for the purpose of this system.  Part of County Waterford had to be added to South Tipperary, part of County Roscommon to County Mayo, part of Leitrim to <Col N="398" /> Roscommon, and the remainder of Leitrim to Sligo.</P>
    <P>Despite what Deputies have been saying here, not everybody was satisfied with these provisions.  In fact, even in this debate, Deputy Treacy referred to the gerrymandering of the Tipperary and Waterford constituencies under the Electoral Act of 1961.  He asserted that the county had been dismembered in a savage way at the behest of the former Deputy Loughman and primarily to unseat Deputy Kyne, but in actual fact, he knows that this savage dismemberment, as he describes it, was carried out only as a result of a decision by the High Court that this kind of thing had to be done, whether or not it suited the people in the areas.  Practical considerations could not be taken into account.  Deputy Treacy should know that under the Electoral Act of 1959, which was the one made in accordance with the usual interpretation of the phrase in the Constitution, County Tipperary North Riding, Tipperary South Riding and Waterford were each left as separate Dáil constituencies without any &ldquo;savage dismemberment&rdquo;. This measure was accepted as rational by all Parties here when before the Oireachtas.  It was only when it was challenged in the courts and this decision given that these illogical things had to be done and that these &ldquo;savage dismemberments&rdquo;, as Deputy Treacy said, had to be carried out.  I fully agree with his description.</P>
    <P>Justice Budd's decision was, in effect, that the revision of constituencies was a purely statistical and administrative problem&mdash;one that, as Deputy Dunne has noticed, changes with each census and not with each 12 years as mentioned in the Constitution. The problem as it existed at that time had to be solved in the way I have mentioned.  Of the numerous possible ways it could be solved, this was the one that appeared to be the least objectionable, although of course it was very objectionable indeed to the people concerned&mdash;the people taken out of constituencies to which they had always belonged and transferred into other areas with which they had no affinity.  I may say it was also objectionable <Col N="399" /> to the Party organisations in these areas.</P>
    <P>This mathematical problem could, of course, have been solved in a number of different ways.  For example, that part of the problem that involved the attaching of portion of Louth to Monaghan and, further down, the same problem which required that slices of Meath and Westmeath be added to Kildare, this could have been dealt with in another way which could have involved the transfer of population from North County Dublin to Meath or from Meath to North County Dublin, or the transfer of population from South County Dublin to Kildare or from Kildare to South County Dublin.  This is the kind of thing that may have to happen in future if the change we are proposing is not made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne in his contribution referred to such well-known indoor games as chess and ludo.  I do not know if Deputy Dunne's recreational activities extend to jig-saw puzzles.  If they do, he could spend many a long hour amusing himself with working out the possible solutions to comply with the requirements of the High Court in regard to the revision of constituencies in present circumstances.  All the equipment he needs is a copy of the census and a map showing the electoral areas and townlands and a street map for the built-up areas.  He does not have to think of such things as county boundaries, rivers or lakes, mountains or peninsulas.  He does not have to think in terms of human beings.  They are mere shuttlecocks to be moved about at will.  If these people, in being transferred every five years from one area to another, get the feeling that somebody is playing the three-card trick with them, that does not matter.  They are not to be considered at all.  Their interests do not count.  Mathematical accuracy is the only consideration, according to the judicial interpretation of the words of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In devising possible solutions to the problem as it exists, Deputy Dunne will not have to consider such things as county boundaries.  These exist.  We who contest elections know that they are real things, but the High Court has <Col N="400" /> ruled they are not relevant.  In revising constituencies, we can do such things as putting a chunk of the north side of Dublin in with the south side of Dublin or <i>vice versa</i>.  Clare can be adjusted with Limerick or Kerry and Tipperary with Clare, Offaly with Galway, Westmeath and Longford with Roscommon.</P>
    <P>The existence of the Shannon and its lakes and estuary is completely irrelevant.  Even without these complications, the job of revising constituencies to comply with the present judicial requirement would be an absorbing pastime and an infinite number of solutions would be available. The exercise would be on a somewhat higher mental level than ludo, but would hardly be as involved as chess. I think Deputy Dunne, provided he could spare the time from looking after the huge constituency he has to cover at present, could spend many an enjoyable hour working out the different solutions possible.</P>
    <P>I think he will find some of them very interesting indeed.  For instance, one type of solution that would continually crop up would have the effect of placing himself and his colleague, Deputy Tully, in the same constituency. No doubt that would be a very interesting situation indeed.  I feel sure that some of his professorial friends, who have been making such amusing and fanciful forecasts with regard to what would happen under the type of electoral system we are proposing, would assure him that in such a rearrangement, only one of them would survive. One thing is certain.  It is doubtful if even one constituency, as they are at present constituted, would be left untouched in a new revision based on the 1966 census.  Indeed, comparatively few counties would not have their boundaries breached.</P>
    <P>There are at present 38 constituencies. As I said, Justice Budd indicated that a maximum deviation from the national average, which is approximately 20,000 of the population per Deputy, of 1,000 would be permitted. Of these 38 constituencies, there are at present a total of 14 which come within this range.  There are 18 in which the population per Deputy is too <Col N="401" /> low and there are six in which the population per Deputy is too high, according to this interpretation of the Constitution.  This means that 24 of the existing constituencies would have to be changed to comply with the decision of the High Court in this matter.  Of course, to change these 24 would involve most, if not all, of the others, due to the desirability from the practical point of view of having constituencies continuous, that is, not having a part of a constituency cut off from the rest of it by the intervention of another constituency.</P>
    <P>I say that this would be necessary from the practical point of view because anybody who had any experience of the practicalities of elections would try to achieve this.  Of course the Constitution, according to the judicial interpretation, does not in fact require this to be done.  It would apparently be quite permissible to top-up the constituencies in which the population per Deputy is too low by the transfer of population from those constituencies in which the population is too high.  For instance, the deficiency in the constituency of Donegal South-West might conceivably be adjusted by attaching the residents of Errigal Road to that constituency.  Indeed, that might not be any more illogical than what otherwise must happen, the transference of portion of the population of Sligo-Leitrim to Donegal, or the transference of portion of the population of Donegal to the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim. This kind of thing may sound ridiculous, but it would not be contrary to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Only a High Court judge or someone who had never had any experience of elections would in fact contemplate doing anything like this.  No one with any experience of the practicalities of election work would decide to adjust a constituency that required to be adjusted in accordance with the interpretation of the Constitution except by transferring the population from a neighbouring constituency.  That would mean inevitably that practically every constituency in the country would have to be interfered with.</P>
    <P>As I said, there are at present 14 of the 38 constituencies which come <Col N="402" /> within the tolerance laid down by a High Court decision.  Some of them are very near the upper limit, and some are near the lower limit.  These 14 could just get by and not be interfered with, were it not for the fact that they would inevitably be involved in the adjustment called for in the remaining 24 constituencies.  The 14 constituencies which are all right according to the present interpretation are Carlow-Kilkenny, which of course has already been made up to the requirement by the transfer of portion of Wexford constituency, Cork Borough, North-East Cork, Dublin South-West, West Galway, Kildare, which of course is a constituency which comes within the tolerance because it has already been adjusted by the addition of parts of Westmeath and Meath, Laois-Offaly, East Limerick, Louth, which of course has already been mutilated by the transference of portions of the population to Monaghan, Meath, which has already had portion of its population transferred to Kildare, South Tipperary, Waterford, which again has been mutilated by the transference of part of the population across the Comeragh Mountains to South Tipperary, Wexford, which has already suffered in the same way by the transfer of population to Carlow-Kilkenny, and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that these constituencies could necessarily be left as they are.  For instance, while Cork Borough and North-East Cork could remain as they are, if they could be treated in isolation, the other two constituencies in Cork county would not comply with the requirements of the High Court decision.  Similarly while the Dublin South-West constituency is all right as it is, the other constituencies in Dublin are not, and it would hardly be possible to make the required adjustments in the other areas without interfering also with Dublin South-West.</P>
    <P>Similarly, while the constituency of West Galway could continue as it is, if it could be considered in isolation, East Galway does not come within the present requirement, and, therefore, whatever solution would be found to the problem of East Galway would very likely involve West Galway as <Col N="403" /> well.  The present constituency of Kildare is all right but Westmeath-Longford is not and the solution to that problem might require the return of the population from Westmeath that was transferred to Kildare the last time.  This would involve further complications which could well involve portions of South County Dublin such as the Rathcoole and Lucan areas being transferred to Kildare, or portions of Kildare being associated with a Dublin constituency.</P>
    <P>Similarly, while East Limerick is within the tolerance provision permitted by the High Court decision, West Limerick is not.  Therefore in any adjustment of that constituency, East Limerick also would have to be interfered with.  The constituency of Louth as at present constituted would be permissible, but Monaghan is not within the present permitted tolerance, and a solution there might require the return to Louth of the population taken from Louth and this could cause a further chain reaction which might involve the county of Meath, and possibly Dublin County.  Again, while South Tipperary as at present constituted complies with the requirement, North Tipperary does not.  An adjustment here might also involve the county of Waterford because, as Deputy Treacy pointed out, some of the population of Waterford had to be attached to South Tipperary on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>There are 18 constituencies in which the population per Deputy is too low, according to the present requirements. These are Cavan, Clare, South-West Cork, North-East Donegal, South-West Donegal, Dublin North-Central, Dublin South-Central, East Galway, North Kerry, South Kerry, West Limerick, Longford-Westmeath, North Mayo, South Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo-Leitrim and North Tipperary.  In the other six constituencies, the population per Deputy is too high.  These are Mid-Cork, Dublin North-East, Dublin North-West, Dublin South-East, Dublin County and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  So far as can be seen from a preliminary examination of what might be required, certainly the only one of the existing <Col N="404" /> constituencies in the west of Ireland that could conceivably be left untouched is West Galway and it is extremely doubtful, in view of the situation that would have to be dealt with in Mayo and East Galway.</P>
    <P>I think it desirable to give some examples of what would have to happen to effect the revision of the constituencies which Deputy Dunne, Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Sweetman have been pressing for since the publication of the census in 1966.  It seems that the most feasible solution for Cavan and Monaghan, in both of which the ratio of population to Deputies is too low at present, would be to join the two counties together and form a five-seat constituency instead of the present two three-seat constituencies.  Deputies will appreciate how much simpler their job would be with a constituency extending almost 70 miles across Ireland than in the present situation where they have only one of these counties to cover.  That could be the solution there. Another possibility would be, of course, that Cavan and Leitrim would be joined together, or portion of them. I think the people in the counties of Cavan and Monaghan will know how appropriate such a joining together of those two counties would be.</P>
    <P>The situation in Clare would have to be dealt with either by changing it to a three-seat constituency and transferring some of the population to a Galway constituency, or by retaining it as a four-seat constituency, which would involve the transference of some of the Galway population to the constituency of Clare.  This is, of course, assuming that we take account of the existence of the Shannon and do not deal with it by transferring population from a constituency situated on the opposite side of the Shannon.  If there were no other complications in the situation, East Galway could probably be dealt with in this way, by adjustment with County Clare, but there are other complications involving a chain reaction starting in Donegal and probably affecting Galway, through Sligo-Leitrim and Mayo.</P>
    <P>In Donegal, the situation could conceivably be dealt with either by making the county a five-seat constituency and transferring portion of the population <Col N="405" /> to the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, or else by retaining the present six seats in two Donegal constituencies, making adjustments in the constituency boundaries and adding on portions of Sligo and portion of Leitrim.  Anybody familiar with the geography there would see it would not be feasible to do it by adding only portion of one of those counties.  The Sligo-Leitrim constituency is obviously due for a further mutilation either by receiving portion of the population from Donegal or by giving some of the population to Donegal.  This would involve further adjustments from the present Roscommon constituency, or possibly from Mayo.</P>
    <P>The present constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim would also obviously require adjustment with the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim and probably again with Mayo.  In the case of County Mayo, there would have to be adjustments between the present North and South Mayo constituencies and possibly also with Roscommon-Leitrim and Galway.  Longford-Westmeath could conceivably be dealt with by the return of portion of Westmeath which was transferred to Kildare in the last revision, but this would have consequential effects on the constituency of Kildare as at present constituted.  The only feasible way of dealing with County Kerry would be either by taking in portion of County Cork in order to retain two three-seat constituencies with adjustment of the boundary between the two present Kerry constituencies as constituted, or else by the transfer of portion of the population of County Kerry to West Cork and the formation of a five-seat constituency in the remainder of the county.</P>
    <P>Cork City constituency could be adjusted to remain as it is at present, a five-seat area, or it might be adjusted to form either a six-seat constituency or two three-seat constituencies involving the return of the portion of the borough which is at present in the County Cork constituency.  The remainder of Cork County could conceivably retain the present 12-Deputy representation but this would involve a considerable amount of rearrangement and the necessity to transfer some of the population <Col N="406" /> of County Cork to Kerry for election purposes.  It would involve either the loss of a Deputy or the transfer of a further 4,000 or so of the population from the city area into a county constituency.</P>
    <P>The adjustments that could be made to deal with the situation in the Dublin area, Dublin city, Dublin county and Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown are so numerous as to make it impracticable to mention them here but one thing is certain, that nobody, neither Deputies nor voters nor Party organisations would know where they stood for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the possibilities that might arise with the return of portion of County Westmeath to Kildare.  That could involve adjustment with South County Dublin or North County Dublin with possibly even an adjustment between Kildare and County Wicklow.  All these solutions would involve problems in other constituencies and what I have read out is by no means a comprehensive list of what would have to be done.  It is merely an indication of the type of mutilation and transfer of population from constituency to constituency that would have to be done in these cases and probably after each succeeding census in future unless the change we propose is made by the people.  Otherwise, we must look forward to these continued changes in constituencies and not only in those in which the numbers of population per Deputy change significantly but also in the adjoining ones even where the population remains stable because of the chain reaction which is set up in having dealt with other areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell said he was quite sure that if single-seat areas were set up in his present constituency, his supporters from the present constituency would still come to him with their problems.  I wonder if they were being chopped and changed at five-yearly intervals, as Deputy Dunne and other Deputies have been urging, would they ever come to know who their Deputy was.  If Deputy Dunne is right in his interpretation of the Constitution, this type of thing would have to happen now.  I cannot say with any certainty <Col N="407" /> whether he is right or wrong; I do not know.  This has not been submitted to the courts and I think nobody else can say with certainty either.  Neither Deputy Dunne nor I is a constitutional lawyer.  Personally, I doubt if there is any such thing as a constitutional lawyer.  There are some who will give opinions with greater assurance than others but they can go to court and then find others who will argue with equal assurance from the other point of view and the decision will eventually have to be made by whatever judge is dealing with the case.</P>
    <P>It appears to me in deciding whether or not a revision of constituencies is required now by the Constitution, it would be just as well to toss a coin. One thing is clear and that is that no area either in town or country is safe from this type of frequent change in the future under the present judicial interpretation of the words in the Constitution. &ldquo;Savage dismemberment&rdquo; was how Deputy Treacy described it. It is clear that unless a change is made, people in areas adjoining other counties will find themselves moved about from constituency to constituency like shuttlecocks possibly every five years so that neither the people nor the public representatives will know where they are.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has any experience of practical politics knows that when this type of thing happens the people in the affected areas feel frustrated and virtually disfranchised.  If the proposed change is to take place at five yearly intervals instead of 12 which is the maximum period in the Constitution the position for the people, the Deputies and the Party organisations will become chaotic.  I know it has been contended that this is really unimportant, that Deputies are elected to legislate and that the constituencies for which they are elected are irrelevant; that the people have no need to have any interest in the Deputy as an individual but merely in his policy and that Party organisations are of no concern. I have no hesitation in saying that this is a wrong view.  I think a Deputy is entitled to have a reasonably stable constituency, not one that will be <Col N="408" /> different in every election he contests. I think the people are entitled to know their representatives&mdash;not to have them transferred to another constituency within a short time of being elected.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that a revision of constituencies does not legally take effect until after a dissolution of the Dáil, but it takes practical effect as soon as it is made, and this, of course, is the reason why Deputy Dunne has been displaying such indecent haste in trying to have a revision made within two years of the last general election.  I feel that it is unfair to expect the electorate to keep themselves informed of the frequent continuous shifting of the boundaries of the constituencies which would be called for if Deputy Dunne's interpretation of the Constitution is correct.  The people are entitled to know where they belong and I believe that party organisations are important also.  I think it reasonable that political parties should have a stable system to work under.  They are composed of voluntary workers and they are doing work of national importance and this chopping and changing is not really fair to them.  There are other democracies in the world, and this kind of nonsense does not have to happen anywhere but here.</P>
    <P>We believed, at any rate, that this kind of thing was undesirable in everybody's interest and in fact it can only be avoided by having a referendum, so that in the opinion of the Government, a referendum was required in the interests of the people and their representatives of all Parties.</P>
    <P>I may say that what we are proposing is not by any means unusual.  In fact, the deviation that we are proposing, the ratio of population to Deputy, as between one constituency and another, is very small compared with other countries.  The Taoiseach mentioned that wider deviations were commonplace in Britain and Deputies opposite chose to interpret that as indicating that these deviations only apply as between constituencies in the Highlands of Scotland and constituencies in the London Metropolitan or other built-up areas.  This is not so at all.  In 1962, it can be shown that there were very large differences in the ratio <Col N="409" /> of electors in constituencies in Scotland. In Aberdeen North, the electorate was 66,351, whereas in Caithness and Sutherland it was 26,716, so that there was 148 per cent more in one constituency in Scotland than in another.  In England, in Billericay, Essex, the electorate was 78,328, whereas in Gates-head West, it was 42,643, so that there was an excess of 83 per cent in one of those constituencies over another.  In Wales, in the constituency of Newport, the electorate was 71,342, whereas in Merionethshire it was 26,435, so that there was an excess of 169 per cent in one of those Welsh constituencies over the other.  We are not proposing anything approaching this deviation and still it has been contended that what we are doing is in some way undemocratic.</P>
    <P>It is fraudulent to argue that what is proposed is in any way a departure from the principle of one man, one vote.  The Constitution in fact does not provide for this principle at present. On the contrary, representation is on the basis of population, which is a completely different thing.  In some places, as Deputies know, the proportion of children to adults is greater than in others and the existence of institutions catering for children in certain areas can be a factor in securing greater voting power for the adults in the particular area.  For instance, the census shows that in the combined areas of Dublin city, Dublin county, Dún Laoghaire and Cork city electors comprise approximately 56 per cent of the population while in the rest of the country electors are 61 per cent of the population.  Therefore, on the present basis a vote in these built-up areas is almost 9 per cent more effective than in the rest of the country.  The maximum deviation of 16? per cent which we are providing for will not, of course, operate everywhere so that the end result will be unlikely to do more than equate a rural vote over the whole of the country with an urban vote if in fact it even does that.</P>
    <P>The disparity is even greater in some areas.  For example, in West Galway, there are 58 electors per 100 population, while in Dublin North-West, there are only 51 electors per 100 <Col N="410" /> population, so that in present circumstances a vote in Galway West is 17.6 per cent less valuable than in Dublin North-West.  The proposal here in fact would not quite redress that position. Relating representation to population rather than to electors obviously breaches the principle of one man, one vote in favour of the built-up areas and that is what is provided for at present and that is the position that Deputies opposite are trying so hard to retain. The proposal that we have here will do little more than redress the balance in the areas in which it will be applied. It is clearly laid down that the proposed permitted deviation from the national average will apply only in the circumstances mentioned in the Bill, that is, only where the respecting of such things as administrative boundaries and geographical features require it.</P>
    <P>There is no question whatever of inserting in the Constitution a provision, or anything approaching it, that all rural constituencies will have a lower average population per Deputy than urban ones.  In fact, many rural constituencies will have a ratio of population to Deputy of the same order as urban areas.  This deviation will apply only where it is necessary to avoid anomalies and inequitable situations such as those I have mentioned and indeed it is not sufficient to avoid them in all cases.</P>
    <P>There is no need whatever for this attempt by the Opposition Parties to divide the country along the lines of rural areas versus urban areas.  That is a fraudulent argument.  It is completely unnecessary and a completely undesirable thing to do, and yet for selfish and ill-conceived reasons, the Opposition Parties are desperately trying to do this.  All it will be possible to do if this proposed amendment to the Constitution is made is to avoid to a certain extent this senseless mutilation that is required by the present interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo; in the Constitution.  The proposal we are making is not by any means sufficient to avoid this kind of thing in all instances and the deviation from the national average which is proposed is much less than it is in most <Col N="411" /> other countries.  It will, of course, still be possible to challenge a revision of constituencies in the courts, as was done on a previous occasion.  While it is true that in present circumstances, the immediate application of this provision would probably be not fully to maintain but partially to maintain the representation in the western areas, it will also &ldquo;operate to save other areas from savage dismemberment.&rdquo; There is no question of ensuring that there will be no change in representation if the population in particular areas declines.  This provision has nothing whatever to do with the maintenance of the present distribution of Deputies in the country. That will only be possible if our regional development plan and our policy of decentralisation is successful.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something about the proposals in the other Bill, the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  Once again, in regard to this, we have this question raised of whether or not there is public demand for an amendment of our electoral system.  As I said before, I do not know what means the public have of demanding something like this, except as members of political Parties.  There is no certain way of knowing until the people themselves vote on it.  I know certain small pressure groups can come together, make a lot of noise and demand certain things, but the fact of small vocal pressure groups demanding something does not necessarily mean that there is a public demand for it.  The newspapers are sometimes described as &ldquo;organs of public opinion.&rdquo;  I do not know whether this means that they interpret public opinion or form public opinion, or whether it is a combination of both, but I think an examination of newspaper files will demonstrate that since the last general election, and long before there was any suggestion from the Government that anything might be done in this regard, there has been a considerable amount of newspaper speculation that there would be an amendment of the present electoral system.</P>
    <P>It would not be an exaggeration to say that there seemed to be something <Col N="412" /> amounting to an assumption since the last general election that something would be done to change the electoral system.  This of course means that the people would be asked to amend the Constitution because the electoral system is specified in the Constitution and cannot be changed except by a referendum.  This speculation arose largely because of the disedifying experience of the long recounts in the Longford-Westmeath and Dublin North-East constituencies in the last general election.  It is fair to say that those long recounts raised a great many doubts in many people's minds of the suitability of the present system. That definitely showed up the complexity of election counts under the present system.</P>
    <P>They also showed up the unreliability of the results, and as a result it is impossible for anyone to have faith in the returns in any constituency where the result was close.  Some people have said that the system is not responsible for the discrepancies between the different counting of votes in those constituencies but that this was due to the human factor and that this would be there, regardless of the electoral system as long as votes have to be counted.  Of course, it must be admitted that errors are possible under any system, but at the same time it must be quite clear that the complexity of a ballot paper marked with the figures 1 to 10 or 1 to 20 or more is bound to lead to excessive errors, particularly in the later stages of the count when the fatigue factor becomes relevant and when because some candidate may already be elected and some candidates may already be eliminated, the ballot paper requires to be examined closely to see whether it is a No. 2, 3, 9, 10, 13, 14 or possibly a higher number that is the relevant one in the particular stage of the count.</P>
    <P>For many years people who are experienced in watching election counts have been convinced that many mistakes are made when they see votes dealt with in those later stages of the count being distributed into pigeon-holes as rapidly as they are in the first <Col N="413" /> count.  At this stage of the election, it is really necessary to study each ballot paper closely and individually before deciding where it is to go, because as I said, on one paper the relevant number may be No. 2 and on the next, may be No. 9 or No. 10.  So, to be confident in the result of an election under proportional representation, the count should, in my opinion normally, without any recount at all, take the best part of a week with the returning officer's staff working at a more leisurely pace, in better conditions and for a shorter than normal working day rather than at the present when they are working under high pressure in trying conditions and/or excessively long hours.</P>
    <P>The recounts in Longford-Westmeath and Dublin North East constituencies have fully established that it is practically impossible to have an accurate count in present circumstances. This is due to the fact that PR, even though the principle of proportionality on which it is supposed to be based is only partially adopted, is in fact an impractical system.  Apart from this, the fact that at different stages of the count bundles of votes for transfer are taken at random means that in a close election it is purely a matter of luck as to who is elected.  If a different bundle of votes had come to the returning officer's hand a different candidate might have been elected.</P>
    <P>There is no way I can see of making the present system entirely accurate except by carrying the idea of proportionality to extreme and counting all the votes for every distribution of the surplus and working out how a transfer should be made, but that would be so farcical that the system would have to be abandoned straightaway if it were adopted.  The only way of making it reasonably fair in a close count like this after the first count when it was obvious that only a few votes separated two candidates would be to start all over again, to put the ballot papers back into a sweepstake drum, mix them up and decide that the candidate who got the best out of three such efforts was the successful candidate.  Under the present system where there is a close result, it would be just as equitable <Col N="414" /> to draw the name out of a hat. What happened in those two constituencies in the last two elections could have happened in others.</P>
    <P>It appears certain that recounts will become more common in future elections and the results will take weeks rather than days to produce.  In fact, it seems clear to me that under the present system, with practically no facilities for the agents of the political Parties or the candidates to be even reasonably sure that the complicated papers are distributed properly it is impossible to have an accurate result. Proper facilities are necessary for the agents to see the ballot papers at every stage of the count.  If the count is to be carried out in a reasonably responsible manner, then even a normal count, without any demand for a recount, should take days instead of the present rushed system.  At present everything has to be taken completely on trust by the candidates, their agents and the returning officer.</P>
    <P>The conditions in which the counting staff have to work, are appalling and the hours are such as to make mistakes not just likely but inevitable.  They work in circumstances of strain which, I think, call for shorter than normal working hours rather than the excessively long hours they are working at present.  Apart from anything else, it is clear that if the present system is to remain and if there is to be any confidence in the results, election counts must become much longer and, of course, much more expensive.  There may be difficulties in getting competent staff for the much longer periods that will be inevitable in future and there will be difficulty also in arranging that there will be proper facilities for candidates' agents to satisfy themselves that mistakes are not made.</P>
    <P>I think that all the speculation that developed since the last general election was one indication at least that there was a substantial body of opinion in favour of a change being made in the present electoral system.  Apart from that, all through the period the informal Committee on the Constitution were meeting, the newspapers again were continuously speculating on <Col N="415" /> this particular aspect of the Constitution, and while the report of the Committee indicates that other aspects of the Constitution were considered at the same time, it seems clear from the report that the question of the suitability or otherwise of the present electoral system did occupy a large part of the discussions.  In the event, no recommendation was made but the report, as I said, did substantiate that this loomed large in the discussions.</P>
    <P>If there was not an actual assumption by the general public that something would be done to rationalise the electoral system, it was clear that there was a substantial body of opinion that a change was desirable.  At our Party Ard-Fheis a number of cumainn had resolutions down calling for a change to single seats and these resolutions were passed, if not unanimously, certainly virtually unanimously.  It may be said that these resolutions were inspired by the comments in the press but the arguments put forward indicated a deep belief that the present system was undesirable from many points of view.</P>
    <P>There were many references to the long counts in the constituencies of Longford-Westmeath and Dublin North East.  In regard to the question of public opinion, I may say that I do not know of any body in the country that is more representative of a cross-section of the people as a whole than the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.</P>

      <P>It consists of delegates from all over the country, from cities, towns, urban and rural areas and from isolated parishes all over the country and the views of our Ard-Fheis are as good an indication of public opinion as is available to me or to the Government. As I have said, a referendum was believed to be necessary in any case so as to enable this phrase, &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo; to be interpreted in the way it has been interpreted since the State was set up until it was referred to the High Court for decision.  It is not possible to say definitely whether or not there is a public demand for this because the <Col N="416" /> public have not been asked yet, and this is what we are proposing to do.  This will be known after the referendum.</P>
      <P>I do say it was widely expected since the last election that the people would be given an opportunity of providing themselves with a more rational electoral system and our Ard-Fheis recommended this unanimously.</P>

      <P>Unanimously, or practically unanimously.  I doubt if there was anyone against it.  There may have been one or two, but certainly not very many.  We can see nothing wrong with proposing the amendments made.  It is true some nine years ago this decision that we are asking to be made was rejected by a very small margin.  At that time there were two separate elections taking place at the same time, and there has been more experience of the system since.  There has been a practical example of the absurdity of the present system.  There has been a substantial change in the electorate since.  People have died since and have been replaced by people reaching the age of 21.  As well as that, at the time of the last referendum, the decision by the High Court with regard to the phrase, &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo; had not been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, neither the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis nor the informal Committee that studied the Constitution made a specific recommendation with regard to the system of voting in the single-seat constituencies, so we naturally decided to put forward the proposition that we are known to favour, that is, that the system of voting should be the straight vote.  I think this was natural in view of the fact that there was no indication either by the Ard-Fheis or the informal committee, that another system should be proposed.  We decided to do this because it appeared to us that a referendum was called for in any case in order to rectify this position as far as it was possible.  Our decision was to ask the people to amend the Constitution in this way so as to arrive at a situation whereby it would be permissible <Col N="417" /> to take reasonable account of such practical considerations as boundaries of counties and geographical features and at the same time to provide the more rational system of single seats by the straight vote.</P>
    <P>At the time of the referendum in 1959, Judge Budd had not been called upon to make his decision and so the actual need to change the wording so as to make this clearly permissible had not, in fact, arisen at this time.  Nevertheless, the Bill that was enacted in the House at that time did contain a provision making this clearer.  The only difference between the 1959 proposal and the present one is that an actual maximum amount of deviation to be allowed from the national average was not specified in 1959 as it is now.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will remember, we had a long and protracted debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas in 1959, and a long and protracted debate in public, but throughout that whole period, it was never suggested, by either the Opposition Parties or the newspapers, that the inclusion of this provision, making it permissible to take account of these practical considerations, made the issue confusing in any way.  When the decision to have a referendum was announced this time, the present-day Opposition immediately started complaining that this was far too complicated an issue.  They were confused; they could not understand it.  We were not playing fair in putting these two questions before them at the one time. This, in itself, is an indication of the change that has taken place since 1959. In 1959, the Opposition Parties and the newspapers were able to understand a similar Bill, but this time they were confused.  Does this indicate in any way a reflection on the present electoral system?  However, we do not want to confuse them and rather than have them whinging that we were not playing fair, that we were making things too complicated for them, we introduced what is really the unnecessary complication of two Bills and two ballot papers and Deputy Dunne is still confused.</P>

They were not confused in 1959 when they could understand it, but with the departure of Deputies Mulcahy, McGilligan and others, they became confused on the Front Bench.</P>

      <P>They were whinging and whining that we are trying to confuse them.  Even now they whinge when we introduce this unnecessary complication of two Bills and two ballot papers.  I do not know how we shall deal with this confusion.  Deputy Dunne, as reported at column 1975 of volume 232 of the Official Report said:</P>
      <P>How is it suggested that the average citizen, and I count myself an average citizen, will understand that kind of double talk that is there in the Bill and is incomprehensible?</P>
      <P>We have given them two Bills.  They were confused when it was to be one Bill and they are still confused when there are two Bills.</P>
      <P>In introducing these two Bills, the Taoiseach gave many reasons for the change we are asking the people to make.  It is the declared objective of the present system to make it feasible for small sectional Parties to continue to exist.  In so far as this aspect is concerned, it seems to be purely and simply a question of whether one thinks the people should have a real opportunity of choosing between different Governments or whether they should be encouraged by the electoral system to vote in accordance with their purely sectional interests or personal interests, and that the formation of a Government should wait until after the election and should result from whatever bargain it is possible for the numerous different sectional interests represented to work out among themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" /> We think that it is inherent in the whole idea of democracy that the people should choose the Government of the country.  Others think that this is unimportant, that it is quite all right for the voters to be presented with a considerable number of small Parties and that it is a feasible thing for the country to take pot-luck with regard to the type of government which will be in operation.  There are two fundamentally different conceptions of democracy here.  Ours is that the people should choose their Government while the Opposition's conception appears to be that the formation of a Government can be left to whatever group of individuals happen to be elected at any election.  We think it is a good idea for people to consider the broad national interest rather than their own purely sectional interests and that the electoral system should encourage them to do this.</P>
    <P>We suggest that the people are entitled to choose a Government and the present system is designed to make this practically impossible.  It has not succeeded in doing it so far.  Opposition Deputies have been arguing that the people are entitled to elect a Coalition Government if they want to but the fact that a Coalition Government may result&mdash;and it has resulted twice&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have had two Coalitions but the people have never voted for a Coalition Government.  The Opposition say the people are entitled to vote for a Coalition if they want to, and if Deputies want to put a Coalition <Col N="420" /> Government before them, the people will have the opportunity of choosing them.  However, the fact that Coalitions are formed after elections does not mean the people want them.  In such conditions, the people do not get the Government they voted for because they are never asked to support a Coalition.  Apparently it is not the intention to ask the people to vote for a Coalition Government in the future, but the Opposition want the electoral system to be rigged so as to make it feasible for a Coalition to be formed. The only object of the Opposition Parties is apparently to confuse the electorate as they did before by the pretence of being separate Parties with separate policies.  The results were indecisive. Even if this should happen again, which is unlikely, it still will not be correct to say that the people chose to give themselves a Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the people never have had the opportunity of doing that &mdash;the proposition has not been put before them.  If the Coalition being planned between the two Opposition Parties should happen to be formed, it will be formed because some people will have voted for Fine Gael and some for Labour, and when the election is over they come together.  In the event of that happening, it will not be because any single individual in the country wanted a Coalition.</P>

      <P>Apart from this, one of the most compelling reasons as far as I am concerned is the inherent advantages for the people that come from single-seat constituencies.  Under the system we propose, Deputies will have smaller constituencies.  Each Deputy will be able to know his constituency thoroughly.  He will be able to pursue diligently matters really requiring his attention, unlike the present position when the extent and the diverse nature of his constituency makes it impossible for him really to know the problems that exist and those that are raised with <Col N="421" /> Deputies are very often dealt with in a very cursory manner.</P>
      <P>The people will obviously benefit by having better representation.  Because of the smaller size of constituencies and the smaller number of constituents there will be less time spent by Deputies on both organisation and representational work.  This will mean that there will be more time available to them to do the real work of Deputies, namely, to pursue their duties as Members of this House.  There can be no doubt that the Dáil will benefit from this.  The community will benefit in two ways: (1) by more effective representation on local problems and (2) by having a more efficient Dáil to deal with legislative problems.</P>
      <P>Under the system we propose, a Deputy who does not do his job well is unlikely to survive since he will be pin-pointed in his constituency.  He will not have available to him any colleagues to do the actual work while, as Deputy Corry says, he is dodging the column.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Benefits, assistance, grants, loans and services of all kinds which are provided by the State are all available in accordance with strict statutory rules. All of these things are administered by a Civil Service which is often described as bound by red tape but which has been found by experience to be incorruptible. Entitlement to these things is purely a question of fact.  It is not necessary for anyone to make representations on behalf of people who are applying for any of these things.  In fact, such representations generally only delay the receipt of whatever is claimed because of the necessity to reply to the representations &mdash; and generally these are made by all the Deputies of the constituency and sometimes by Senators and county councillors as well.  All of these must get their notification in exactly the same terms and at exactly the same time.  The most sinister ulterior motives are imputed if there is any slip-up in this regard.  An inquiry is demanded if one Deputy is informed a day earlier than or in different terms from another Deputy. The possibility of there being a genuine mistake is scoffed at and political intrigue <Col N="422" /> is the only explanation that is accepted.  In general, as I said, the only effect this has is to delay matters &mdash;and it is an expensive and time-wasting procedure.  Most of the replies that have to go from the Minister to members of his own Party and from the Secretary of the Department to members of other Parties are completely unnecessary.  They are time-wasting and expensive bluff but the public unfortunately do not think so because they will not be let think so. If one Deputy tries to disabuse his constituents of this idea, he is not likely to last long because his colleagues of all Parties&mdash;certainly some of them at least&mdash;will keep up the pretence.  I know there are Deputies on all sides of the House who do make a genuine effort to explain to their constituents that these things are obtainable as of right and not as a result of representations, but I think they know themselves that they do not succeed very well in doing this.  In fact, I think, there are comparatively few who will not at least write on behalf of the constituent and send on the reply, and thereby, whether or not they try to do so, they do get a certain amount of credit for having got something for a person that he would have got anyway and to which he was legally entitled, and indeed for trying sometimes to get something for a person for which he was not eligible.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that all our people will approach a public representative to obtain a favour in this way.  Very many, probably the majority, would not stoop to it but even some of these are, to a certain extent, affected by the widespread belief that favours can be obtained through the intercession of a public representative.  These things are in fact administered in an impersonal way.  The belief that representations are necessary or that they can succeed in getting something for a person to which he is not entitled by normal application is a belief in corruption and it is not true.  To a large extent, it is the product of the multi-member constituency.  Certainly, it is impossible to get rid of it with multi-member constituencies.  I believe it is bad for public morale.  In a single-seat constituency a conscientious Deputy <Col N="423" /> could disabuse his constituents of this wrong idea but he cannot do it now because his colleagues will not co-operate.</P>
    <P>Under the system of election we are proposing, each candidate will be a real, live, genuine candidate.  He will be the representative of his Party in the constituency.  If the Party organisation is wise, they will select the best man for the job.  Under the present system, it is feasible or considered feasible sometimes to select one or two outstanding candidates and then to select somebody who may be considered the most deserving in the hope that he will be elected with the surplus votes of his colleagues.  However, the most deserving candidate may not always be the best from the point of view of fulfilling the functions of a Deputy.  Under this system which we propose, every candidate will know he has been selected as a real, genuine candidate, that he is put forward by his Party with the full intention that he will be elected and that it is his job to get himself elected.  There will obviously be more scope for young, able people to get into public life under the system we are proposing.</P>
    <P>Where a candidate, for instance, is an obvious failure as an election prospect, there will be an opening for a new man.  There will be new life in any Party that is worth its salt&mdash;an infussion into the political field generally of young people anxious to serve their country and to make whatever contribution they can to the country's welfare.</P>
    <P>Unlike the present system which discriminates as between one voter and another in a purely arbitrary way, the system of single-seat constituencies with the straight vote which we are putting forward is perfectly fair to political Parties, to candidates and to the voters. I do not see what could be more straightforward and fair to everybody than that, in each constituency in the country, the political Parties would put forward the best candidate they can get to explain their policy and to get votes for it.  If there is any other relevant factor in an election than the calibre <Col N="424" /> and suitability of the candidate, and the merit of the policy he espouses, I do not know what it is.  I do not know what other factor should be considered. I do not think there is anything else that would be of interest to the electorate.</P>
    <P>This system will give a true result in every constituency.  The total of those results will obviously give a true result in the country as a whole.  The people will be able to see clearly what they are doing.  No one has any cause for complaint. If a candidate is defeated, he is defeated because one at least of his opponents found more favour with the electorate through the combination of his personal qualities, his Party's policy and the way it was presented&mdash;and surely these are the things which should decide elections?  The Party who can do this in most constituencies will win the election and so no Party has any cause for complaint.  If they fail at one election, then their task for future elections will be to try to improve the quality of their candidates, the presentation and possibly the content of their policy. And the people will have no cause for complaint because they had the matter at issue put before them as clearly and as effectively as it was possible for the political Parties to put it.  If some of them vote for candidates who are not successful or vote for Parties who are not successful, well, this was because there were fewer people who agreed with their view than there were people who took some other view.  I do not know what could be fairer than that. This system is scrupulously fair.  It does not discriminate between voters, as the present system does.</P>
    <P>It seems clear that the Opposition Parties can see no future for themselves on their own.  It is clear that they can only hope for a situation similar to that which resulted on two previous occasions and which enabled them to come together after an election and bargain with one another and form a Government, which, of course, inevitably collapsed within a short time because of the internal stresses in the Government.  Apparently, they can only hope for a future in multi-member constituencies where it will be <Col N="425" /> feasible to scrape up votes here and there over a large constituency, with the hope of eventually winding up with a quota, or something near a quota, of votes.  They have clearly made it known that they have no faith in their ability ever, at any time in the foreseeable future, to win more support than Fianna Fáil in a majority of constituencies. They know that the present system encourages, and is designed to encourage, the formation of small splinter Parties and apparently their only hope is that in these circumstances they will manage to pick up sufficient preference votes from such small Parties which they cannot obtain for themselves.  The hope is that they will pick them up on the spurious basis that anybody who votes for any individual other than the Government candidate should transfer his vote to other candidates who are opposed to the Government until eventually it reaches either the Fine Gael or the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>It was really pitiful to listen to Deputy M. J. O'Higgins here making a plaintive plea for the continuance of conditions which would enable Coalition Governments to be formed or which could have results making the formation of Coalition Governments feasible.  His whole speech here was a plea not to do anything to lessen the possibility of a future Coalition Government being formed.  I have never heard a more abject admission of the hopelessness of the prospects for a Fine Gael Government. What he said, in effect, was that a Coalition Government is the only possible alternative to Fianna Fáil, that it was not fair to try to change the electoral system so as to make it difficult to form a Coalition Government. It is impossible not to have sympathy with Deputy Cosgrave and the minority of the Fine Gael Party who have some faith in the future of the Party.  It must, indeed, be galling for them to have failed, despite an all-night sitting, to instil some backbone into the Party and to have to carry on with these sail trimmers, in the knowledge that in future general elections they are beaten before they start.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's approach <Col N="426" /> appears to be more abject still.  Their plea solely from the standpoint of a small Party proves that they do not even aspire ever to become a major Party, never mind a Government.  There is apparently, a complete and final acceptance of their role as a third Party with, as their highest aspiration, a future coalition, with Fine Gael, as before, the dominant Party.  In fact, it seems now that they have even abandoned their attempt, which, of course, was not successful, to get the people to believe that what they wanted to achieve was a balance of power position in which a minority Government would exist for a time at their whim. However, in either case, obviously, they only hope for a short-term position of responsibility but they want the present system to protect them as a purely minority Party.</P>
    <P>Surely, if either of the Opposition Parties really aspires to form a Government, they will be prepared at least to do this&mdash;to contest elections in the clear-cut way which this system will provide, that is, to go out and fight on their own merits in a total of 144 constituencies and to try to win at least 72 of these?</P>
    <P>Surely the Opposition contention that a proposal to change the electoral system to the single-seat, straight vote system must result in a perpetuation of Fianna Fáil Government is a clear indictment of themselves as political Parties?  It is a pity that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave, and others in Fine Gael, like Deputy Flanagan, who are opposing this proposal only because they were narrowly out-voted at their Party meeting would not tell us why they are, in fact, in favour of the proposition that we are making to the people but I suppose it is safe to assume that they are not in favour of it because they see it as perpetuating Fianna Fáil in government.  I think most people will agree that these are the people in Fine Gael who really want to form a Fine Gael Government at some time and who really have some hope that this will be possible.  It is a pity that at some time they would not let the people know why it was they voted in this way at the Fine Gael Party meeting.  As I say, these are <Col N="427" /> obviously the people who have some faith in the capability of their own Party to convince the people of their suitability as a Government.</P>
    <P>I have as much confidence in the future of the Fianna Fáil Party as anybody else.  Under PR, we have been in office for 30 out of the past 36 years and we have continuously, since 1932, been by far the largest political Party in the Dáil.  During all that time since 1932, we have never received a clearer indication of the brightness of our prospects for the future than we have received in the past two years.  In that time we have won four by-elections in succession&mdash;something that was never done before&mdash;and before this debate is over, we will have won six by-elections in succession.  We have never got a clearer indication of our favourable prospects for the future than this.  So we can feel absolutely certain of continuing in Government after the next general election under the present system, and that is as far forward as it is possible to forecast.  Personally, I have no doubt that we will continue to prove our suitability as Government and that we will retain the majority support even after that, but I would hesitate to forecast a perpetuation of Fianna Fáil Government for all time, even under the present system which has shown that it is next to impossible to replace Fianna Fáil and that it is certainly impossible to reduce us below a certain minimum number of seats which would still leave us the major political Party in the country.</P>
    <P>One thing is clear: under the present system, the worst that could conceivably happen to Fianna Fáil&mdash;and it is obvious that it cannot happen at the next general election&mdash;but even in the future is that we might possibly be replaced for a short term by another short-lived Coalition Government and it is beyond doubt, as I have said, that this will not happen at the next general election and that is as far forward as anybody can reasonably foresee.</P>
    <P>Purely from the point of view of continuing Fianna Fáil as a Government, there is no need to make this change.  The proposal is made in the interests of commonsense, and in the <Col N="428" /> interests of real democracy and in the interests of providing the people with more effective representation and with a more effective Dáil.  I say definitely that no member of the Government or of the Fianna Fáil Party, of the Opposition Parties or any university professor who never did a day's electioneering in his life can say with certainty what the result will be, even at the next general election, for the various political Parties of the change in the electoral system that we are proposing.</P>
    <P>As far as we in Fianna Fáil are concerned, we are prepared to allow our policy to be decided on in the clearer circumstances that will result from this proposed change.  If the people continue to support us, as we believe they will, we will remain as Government, and if they do not, then we can be replaced. In fact, the system we are proposing will provide the electorate with a more effective manner of doing just that.  Under the proposed system at election time every Party in every constituency will endeavour to convince the greatest number of electors of the superior merits of their policy and of their candidate, but the Fine Gael and Labour contention is clearly that it is inconceivable that either of their Parties, or both of them combined, could succeed in doing this in more areas than Fianna Fáil in the next general election, or any other general elections in the future.</P>
    <P>This is an amazing admission by political Parties who pretend to be serious in the matter of proposing to form a Government, that they cannot visualise, at any time in the foreseeable future, that it would be possible for them to get more support in 72 of these 144 constituencies than Fianna Fáil would get.  I know that the electorate will take due note of this admission by the Labour and Fine Gael Parties.  No matter what way it is looked at, it is surely an admission that the Fianna Fáil policy is the best one; otherwise there is no reason why the people should continue to support it in conditions where they will have such a clear, alternative choice.  Surely they do not claim that the electorate is incapable of making an intelligent choice between <Col N="429" /> different Parties and policies?  I am sure they do not want to insult the voters by making this allegation. Therefore their claim that a change to this system would mean a continuation in perpetuity of the Fianna Fáil Government amounts to an admission that their policy is in fact inferior to ours.</P>
    <P>In any event, it is clearly an admission that their only hope for the future is to continue the situation in which the issues can be confused by a multiplicity of Parties and candidates in these large multi-member constituencies and they can see nothing but ruination for themselves in circumstances in which there will be a direct confrontation between the Parties in each constituency.  We are hardly likely to argue the point with them if they insist that it is inconceivable that they will ever succeed in convincing the majority of people in more constituencies than we can that they are better than we.  That is their assessment of their own capabilities and of the merits of their own policies but it is certainly an amazing admission to make.  However, if that is so, and if this could never happen and it is still believed desirable to get rid of Fianna Fáil, then the obvious solution seems to be for all the array of talent on the opposite benches to come together and try to pool their ideas to see if it is possible for them to produce a better programme than ours which would be acceptable to the people.  To say that we are going to be perpetuated in office is an admission that this cannot be done.  If it cannot be done, then there is every reason why we should be perpetuated.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, we are prepared to put up 144 candidates in the next and subsequent elections, each standing on his own as the sole representative of Fianna Fáil in the constituency and asking for support on the basis of our achievement and programme for the future.  I do not see why the Opposition should be afraid of a contest on these clear-cut straight forward lines.  The only possible meaning to be taken from this advance conceding of permanent victory to Fianna Fáil in conditions where the issues will be clear and impossible to confuse, is <Col N="430" /> that they have an inherent lack of confidence in their own Parties.</P>
    <P>Deputy M. J. O'Higgins described the present system as being fair.  In fact it is grossly unfair; it discriminates between voters and in a close finish to an election, the system, as I said, is equivalent to drawing the name of the candidate to be elected by lot. In an election in a multi-member constituency under the present system, normally a number of candidates are eliminated and according as they are eliminated, their votes are treated as if they had been cast for the person to whom they gave the next preference, which of course is ridiculous.  This process goes on until all seats are filled and one or two seats are left. No account is taken of the votes cast for these candidates and the only thing that marks them out is that they nearly made the grade.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what sin against democracy did the people who voted for these candidates commit that they should not be treated in the same way as the others who voted for unsuccessful candidates?  The only sin was that they voted for somebody who went reasonably near getting the quota of votes.  I do not see what is wrong with that.  Why should it cause them to be discriminated against?  The fact is, of course, that this system was designed for those who find the smallest number in the constituency to agree with their views.  Every care is taken to ensure that it is these people who are most out of touch with the majority view, who will make the ultimate decision.  They may transfer their votes from one candidate who finds little favour with the electorate to another, until eventually their votes arrive with someone who will be really in the fight for the seat.</P>
    <P>In the last general election, 27 per cent of the total valid poll voted for candidates who were not elected and 14.6 per cent of the total valid poll voted for candidates who were not elected and had their subsequent preferences treated as votes for other candidates, while 12.5 per cent, or almost half of the total who voted for candidates <Col N="431" /> not elected, had no further account taken of their votes.  Surely the fundamental thing in a democratic election is that all votes should be treated in the same way?</P>
    <P>There is no democratic process by which it was decided to disfranchise some while taking account to the nth degree of others.  The present system encourages irresponsibility in the exercise of the franchise.  The person who does not take elections seriously can, with impunity, vote for a man who is so unrealistic in his approach that he can find only a few people to vote for him, knowing that the system has been designed to ensure that whatever happens, his vote will be considered at the vital time.</P>
    <P>The system ensures that the final decision on the last seat will be made by those whose views were furthest from the real majority.  The overall result in a constituency usually depends on the last seat and this is decided not by the majority but by the smallest minority in the constituency.  This final decision then, is made by the voters who were furthest from the views of the majority in the constituency and very likely they make the decision on the basis of attaching the same importance to their view that a particular candidate is second worst, as to the view of other people that he is the best. The fundamental concept of democracy is that the views of the majority are those that should prevail.  If this is right, then it follows that the least meritorious views are those which are furthest from the majority; in other words, those who find the fewest in the constituency to agree with them; but it is these who are selected under the present system for preferential treatment, while the votes of those reasonably close to picking a candidate acceptable to the majority are ignored. Nothing could be more undemocratic. For instance, in the constituency of Dublin North-East in the last election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We can explain.  It was very important to have the Constitution enacted in 1937 because there were objectionable features in the existing Constitution.  That Constitution was imposed by an outside power.  It had to be got rid of.  It was important to remove the more objectionable features.  In order to get rid of a Constitution which made the country subservient to another power, it was necessary not to introduce too many complications.  In other words, it was necessary not to let the Opposition Parties confuse the issue by our doing too much at the one time.  The main thing which had to be done at the time was done.  It was done despite the efforts of the two Parties opposite. They wanted us to continue saddled with a foreign-imposed Constitution and the Irish Free State.  We got rid of both.  The people got rid of that Constitution, despite the desperate efforts of the Opposition Parties to hang on to the King.</P>

      <P>I am as anxious to have this revision as Deputy Dunne is, or some of his running mates in the constituency of Dublin county.  I think they appreciate that the only possible chance they will ever have of seeing Dáil Éireann is by getting out from under the shadow of Deputy Dunne.</P>

      <P>We all know why the Minister is here.  He is here under the protection of the political umbrella of the old gentleman in the Park.</P>

      <P>I came here originally through a surplus of votes from our mutual gracious colleague, Deputy P. J. Burke, and he will, indeed, be a great loss to me when we get the single-seat constituencies.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 12th March, 1968.</P>
