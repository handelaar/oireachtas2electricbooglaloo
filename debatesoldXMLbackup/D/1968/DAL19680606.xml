    <Title>Death of Senator Robert Kennedy: Expression of Sympathy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we commence business, I should like to refer to the sad news we received a few minutes ago of the death of Senator Robert Kennedy.  The country and, indeed, the world were shocked by the news of the attack on his life yesterday morning.  Now comes the terrifying and horrifying news of the consequences of that attack.  No words of mine could adequately express the sense of shock and the sense of loss that we in Ireland feel at the death of Senator Robert Kennedy nor the sympathy that we have for his widow and his young children and, indeed, for all the Kennedy family, who have suffered so much.</P>
      <P>I would, therefore, suggest that as a mark of our sympathy, we take the unprecedented step of adjourning the Dáil for one hour and in the meantime I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, on behalf of Dáil Éireann to convey to Mrs. Ethel Kennedy and his family the deep sympathy we all feel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the Taoiseach in expressing our very deep sense of shock at the dreadful tragedy which has affected the Kennedy family and, in particular, to express our deep feeling of sorrow to Mrs. Ethel Kennedy and her children and our very great concern at the tragedy which, once again, has affected <Col N="620" /> the Kennedy family and, indeed, the whole human race.</P>
      <P>We in this country are all aware of the services which the late President Kennedy and the late Senator have rendered in the cause of resolving the conflicts which at present affect not only the United States of America but other parts of the world and we wish to express the sincere hope that with the help of God and the assistance of men of goodwill everywhere this period of violence will pass.  I should like to join with the Taoiseach in expressing our very deep sorrow in the present tragic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I should also like to say how shocked and saddened we are by the tragic death of the young Senator Kennedy.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I should like to express to his wife and his family our sincerest sympathy.  I certainly agree that there should be this token of respect to the memory of Senator Kennedy in adjourning the Dáil for one hour.  When we think of the Kennedys, we remember the close ties there were between us and the Kennedy family, particularly in recent years.  It is at a moment like this that we recall the tragic death of the late President John F. Kennedy.  Only a short week ago his sister, Mrs. Shriver, participated in the ceremony at the opening of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Park.  I should therefore like to reiterate what the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party have said and to say how shocked we are by this tragedy and to express the hope that God may comfort the wife and young family of the assassinated Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing with this matter last night, I was drawing attention to the present position in my constituency which is something over 100 miles long.  It is a kind of stretch on which you would not know where to start or finish.  I can look after my constituents: I am long enough here to look after them.  This position is all right where you have a five-seat constituency as we have and where you have two Deputies elected from each Party, but where you have one Deputy elected as you have in the Labour Party at present, he has difficulty in looking after his constituents from Rockchapel down to Youghal. It is a practically impossible task.  At the same time, his salary and emoluments are only the same as those of the gentlemen over there from Dublin who can gallop around their constituency at a bob a time: I was contradicted last night when I said they could do it for the price of a fourpenny bus ticket.  It would take more than a bob a gallon to go from Youghal to Rockchapel: you would be a time doing it.  Even our Committee on Procedure and Privileges have known that for the past 40 years, which will show you the Dublin influence in this House.  It is completely unfair and unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard a yarn here about people not wishing to go for favours to a man they voted against.  I am a long time here and I have seen none of it.  There <Col N="623" /> are as many Fine Gael supporters coming to me to my various stations&mdash; Fine Gael and Labour men&mdash;and I know them and they know I know they did not vote for me.  However, they come in because they say: &ldquo;After all, experience teaches, and that old lad can do the job when others fail.&rdquo;  That is the way they look at it.  It is above board.  There are people who say they went to Deputy Stephen Barrett but, &ldquo;hang it, he could not do it and Martin did it&rdquo;.  Perhaps there are people from my constituency going up to Deputy Stephen Barrett and talking in the same way about me.  You have that condition of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>You have the injustice of one Deputy being expected to look after people in a stretch of country as long as 100 miles, while another Deputy, as I said last night, can pick up his constituents in a bus: a bob bus will take you to any part of Dublin.  Those Dublin fellows have not even the gumption to have the station we have.  I have to have one station in Youghal, Cloyne, Midleton, Cobh, Blarney and so on, where I attend each time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have people here who have the misfortune to believe that the single-seat constituency is the right one and who still have to trot into the lobby to vote against it.  We have that misfortune here.  It is a political misfortune that they cannot help.  I am alluding to poor Deputy Dillon over there.  He has my utmost sympathy. Any man who described proportional representation in this House as a fraud and a cod and a product of the brains of all the cranks in creation and who <Col N="624" /> will then walk up the lobby and vote against putting an end to proportional representation, well, all one can wonder is what intelligence is in a man like that.  I am sorry for him: honestly, I am.</P>
      <P>We know what is happening.  I am not blind at all to what is happening. For the past three weeks or a month, they are down in my constituency carving a slice off it to attach to West Waterford for the next round.  You need not think I have not my ears to the ground: I have.  You have that kind of thing happening.  You do not know where you will find yourself.  They say that three removes are as bad as a fire. My fourth time round, I found myself back where I started in a five-seat constituency but with this difference, that it had a tail 40 miles long stretching from Rockchapel out into Mallow and then further on to White-gate. That ridiculous thing is going on for years.  I had part of Deputy Stephen Barrett's constituency and, signs on it, I was able to go back there at every by-election and round up my percentage of the votes on the right side&mdash; and nothing Deputy: Barrett could or would do could change that.  He knows it and I know it, and we are quite happy, then.</P>
      <P>Take a Deputy who is elected for the first time to represent a constituency. He comes in and breaks his neck for years looking after every part of it.  Then, suddenly, there is a revision of constituencies, as they call it, and he finds himself with about a thousand votes less out of his own constituency and a splitting-up of someone else's constituency.  I represent from Kinsale on the one side down to Charleville on the other.  My constituency is Rockchapel, Newmarket, Kanturk, Mallow, Charleville, Buttevant, Midleton, Fermoy, Cobh, Mitchelstown, Youghal and not forgetting Blarney&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Can anyone imagine a Deputy elected for his Party having to travel that area and look after the people there?  Thank God, I am as healthy now as I was 40 years ago; <Col N="625" /> otherwise I would not be able to do it. Then you have the fellow who lies down in the corner at the far end of the constituency.  I want to get after him and make him stand his ground in a single-seat constituency.  That would change the aspect of things in this House enormously.  People may say that Fianna Fáil will get a majority of all seats: perhaps they will get a majority in many constituencies the first time but people are very discriminating. They will say: &ldquo;That is the fellow to whom I wrote four letters which he did not answer.  I will vote against him the next time.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;that is the fellow who was missing when we knocked on his door.  We will not go to him again.&rdquo;  If a Deputy has a definite field and a definite line-up in that field, he will be a better Deputy than he would otherwise be, no matter how good he is at present. I have seen Deputies here from all Parties: I have seen the dodgers. When I look around after every election, I wonder where they have gone. That is why I am altogether in favour of the single-seat constituency.  It is a personal view but an honest one.</P>
      <P>As things are going, one's biggest enemy at the general elections is the fellow put up by one's own Party beside one.  He is the man you must watch and fight: you can forget the other fellows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House but I have seen the dish that is being prepared for the next election already. I have seen a big slice being handed to Waterford.  I saw how that worked out before and I saw the difficulty of it.  I saw one of the most decent men who ever came into the House from Youghal and he was put up and he had not a dog's chance.  The Waterford man will vote for the Waterford man and the Cork man for the Cork man.  I am speaking with 40 years experience of a matter in which I have taken an interest and of which I have made a study.  If I did not do this, I would not be here.  A Deputy does not know whether he had better work one side of the constituency or the other because he does not know which side will go from him on the next occasion.  That is <Col N="626" /> nonsensical.  Personally, I do not mind. I am here working for my people for about £500 a year.  That is all I get.  If I stayed at home I would get much more.  I am amazed that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has done nothing in the past 40 years as regards the discrepancy in expenses between those who can travel their constituency by making a couple of bus journeys and those who have to travel 100 miles through their constituencies and spend money on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government may come in here with massive files provided for him by the best Civil Service in Europe, giving him mountains of statistics which he places upon the records of the House in speeches of great length.  They are utterly irrelevant.  We oppose these proposals and I propose to be brief in my remarks because the sooner we get to the country and determine this in a referendum, the better it will be for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a long time in the public life of this country and all belonging to me have been in public life for a century and a half and I claim the right to speak with some authority.  Surveying the world in which we live, I warn Oireachtas Éireann: send no minority in this country out of Parliament to the barricades.  We are living in a world of violence.  We have every right to be proud in Ireland that minorities have consistently found their way to this House, have been heard with respect and had their rights as Deputies protected by the Ceann Comhairle.  The people have watched them and judged them and either returned them again or dismissed them into the obscurity from which they should never have emerged.  But there is no use pretending in 1968 that the voice of organised labour is not entitled to be heard in <Col N="627" /> Dáil Éireann.  Much of what it says I disagree with but I glory in the fact that every single member of that minority Party has the same right to have his voice heard in our Parliament as the Leader of the House, the Taoiseach, or the Leader of the Opposition or any other Deputy, great or small.  I do not give a damn about all the statistics that are trotted out here about how the Minister will be bewildered if he is charged with the task of rearranging the constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies to the other Bill also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all fraudulent cod.  I have been a Minister of State and I know this matter can be attended to in a rational and intelligent way without the slightest difficulty, but you can produce every kind of irrelevant horror and raise every kind of intimidating ghost for the sole purpose of serving the base unworthy motive that at present inspires a minority, I believe, of the Fianna Fáil Party, a powerful minority who want to crush the Labour Party out of this House.</P>
      <P>I do not want to do it.  In June, 1968, I know that if these proposals were adopted by our people, that is the effect they would have and I say in June, 1968, with democratic institutions tottering all the world over in the face of the challenge of the violence born of frustration, no one but a Government gone mad would urge our people to reverse a decision that they calmly took nine short years ago.</P>
      <P>I implore this House to get away from irrelevance, to get away from illusory statistics and to face the fundamental issue: do you want to drown minorities out of parliament or do you not?  I do not.  They have talked about the multiplicity of Parties thrown up by proportional representation and the possibility of the fragmentation of this House into a multitude of warring factions.  Look at us after 40 years of proportional representation.  There are three political Parties in Dáil Éireann and two Independents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Four Independents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="628" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had forgotten.  Where is the fragmentation?  I have seen this House with five Parties in it.  I have seen this House with 14 Independents. Out of that situation was born the first inter-Party Government in the record of which I glory, which served our people magnificently, which gave them an alternative Government and, altogether apart from the achievements they left after them, did the public life of this country an inestimable service in demonstrating that the swing of the political pendulum could be maintained calmly and effectively.</P>
      <P>Here we are today with three Parties, and is there any one of our Parties which does not represent a substantially effective and recognisable block of free electors in a free country?  We are told that proportional representation induces instability of government.  I challenge any honest Deputy to say that there is in Europe or the western world a country that can claim to have had more stable government than the Irish Republic has enjoyed in the past 40 years, and that in a country born in civil war. I doubt if there is a country in the history of man which can claim to have achieved what we achieved in Ireland in stability of democratic institutions. In times of turmoil and difficulty and deep and bitter feeling, the civil power in this State has never faltered, and it has carried us through one crisis after another.  Yet we are told that this system of government has induced instability and the fragmentation of our Legislature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know we can quote one another <i>ad infinitum</i> over the years, but I am not concerned with the irrelevance of quotations and statistics.  I am concerned to ask myself: what is it right to do today; what is it expedient to do for the future of this country?  There is one thing I am certain of.  I want it to go on record, as I know the Irish people will insist on its going on record in the referendum, that this Legislature of the Irish Republic is the place for any minority who wish to make their voice heard, that the doors of it are wide open to any minority who can get a quota of votes to send them here, and that from this platform of Oireachtas <Col N="629" /> Éireann, they can exhort their fellow-countrymen to add to their numbers until ultimately, with the vote and with the vote alone, they can take over the government of this country and claim to rule it by the authority of God.  Is that the kind of society in which we want to live?  Certainly it is the desire to live in that kind of society that brought me into public life and kept me in it for 40 years.</P>
    <P>Let us drop the irrelevancies.  Let us drop for the moment the desire to score points off one another.  Let us ask ourselves this question: is the effect of this instrument, paragraph 1º of Part II which we are now considering not going to be construed by a substantial section of our people as the slamming of the door of Oireachtas Éireann in their faces?  I believe that is what it is constructed to do.  I believe it is a kind of madness born of power.  I have warned this House time and again: give Fianna Fáil a clear majority in Dáil Éireann and they seem to go berserk.  I have never approved of their government because I have dissented from their policies, but so long as there was always the potential here in Opposition of their defeat, so long as they were a government supported by 70 or 71 Deputies, there was always somewhere at the back of their minds the feeling that if they embarked upon a course of extravagant folly, the Opposition of the House would combine against them to eliminate them from the scene.</P>
    <P>The chances of four or five by-elections have given Fianna Fáil a clear majority in this House, and the old symptom manifests itself again.  They have gone berserk at the dictate of the power-hungry minority amongst them. I urge Dáil Éireann to dispose of this. I wish I could hope to persuade Fianna Fáil to abandon this Bill.  I do not believe they will, so I urge Dáil Éireann to dispose of it with despatch. Let us get to the country and let us ask the people by their ballots to determine: do they want to shut the door of Oireachtas Éireann in the face of minorities; do they want to send minorities from Parliament to the barricades? I do not, and it is because I do not that I am passionately anxious <Col N="630" /> to ensure that our people will vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;, not only to the specific propositions we are now discussing but to the associated Bill which has been submitted at the same time.</P>

      <P>I suppose I should be the last person to speak on proportional representation.  In the last election, I spent five days being dissected, bisected and trisected to increase my majority by 100 per cent from six or seven votes to 13 votes.  It was a most undignified performance for a public man to live through, though afterwards a county council member said to me: &ldquo;Congratulations: it is a pity it is over.&rdquo;  That is my comment on the long drawn out count.  In regard to PR, I personally suspect its origins and so does Deputy Dillon, born as it was in the strange liberal glow of a successful empire, smelling of liberalism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The PR system was made for subject people, invented by our late masters and was first tried on us.  PR is all right for a subject people but not for a homogeneous society such as ours in which everybody is the son of a farmer or a teacher, a worker or a small shopkeeper. We are a homogeneous society and very little divides us.  The North of Ireland has been mentioned and certainly the system is necessary there where you have cleavages and where you have antagonisms born of different beliefs and so on.  It is necessary to preserve the rights of the minority but here in this homogeneous society it is absolutely irrelevant.  There has been a good deal of talk about the rights of minorities.  Deputy Dillon said that the <Col N="631" /> Labour Party would be wiped out but I bet that under the single-seat system, they will come back just as well as ever.  They are well entrenched in their areas and I could give the names of the Deputies who will come back here again.  I have no doubts about that. The only significant minority we have in this country is the Protestant minority.  It is a very substantial minority but Deputy Booth finds that it is well catered for.  We also have such things as pressure groups in this country.  We have the Georgian Society and the Save the Canals organisation and so on, and such groups will find a home in one of the three Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said: &ldquo;Do not drive us to the barricades&rdquo; and spoke about the &ldquo;underground&rdquo;.  The only underground movement I am aware of is in the mines.  I should like to bring the Deputy's mind back to 1918.  We had no PR system then and the people were fed up with the Irish Parliamentary Party and felt that Westminster would never give us our freedom but Sinn Féin came in with single seats with a bang.  It is only by way of the single seats that you can save people from going to the barricades.  Under the multi-seat system, the last man will crawl in, as I did on the backs of Fine Gael votes and Labour votes and on our own votes.  The multi-seat system will always throw up somebody.  If the country is seething with discontent, it will never be reflected in the multi-seat system and that is why the system was brought in by England for a subject people.  In the single-seat system, the anger of the people will be known throughout the country and the people's voices will be heard and will be well served by those returned to Government who will serve their interests. This happened in England twice or three times.  You had a Tory Government taking over from Attlee's Government and they did away with certain aspects of the previous Government's policy and retained others. This is what happens; you have one Party accepting part of the other Government's policy.  That is the great benefit of the single-seat constituency <Col N="632" /> system and under it the underground and the pressure groups vanish.</P>
    <P>The single-seat constituency will ensure a compact, intimate area in which every candidate will be known to the electorate and he will be able to serve them.  At present under the multi-seat system, a Deputy cannot do all he should; he may be running from one end of the constituency to the other, and between being a postman and an ombudsman, he never has time to help his Party or the Ministers or the House in regard to legislation.  Another point is that we talk a lot about decentralisation. The single-seater will mean decentralisation plus, as far as Parliament is concerned, because the single-seater involves a small intimate area, whether it is represented by Labour, Fianna Fáil, or Fine Gael, and it will throw up the best man. Each Party will put up its best man and this will produce a good Dáil and the man returned will be able to do more work than he is able to do at present.</P>
    <P>All this is apart from the physical problems about which Deputy Corry spoke.  In my constituency I am rather fortunate because Deputy Carter, my colleague, looks after Longford and I look after Westmeath.  With Deputy L'Estrange, we do the best we can on the principle that &ldquo;anything you can do I can do better&rdquo;.  We do our best to prevent the closing down of non-viable post offices or schools but we both do it, possibly with our tongues in our cheeks, and as long as the two of us do it, one cancels out the other.  There is no honesty about it, none whatever.</P>

All this is part of the physical aspect of it, preventing schools and post offices from being shut down.  The minorities about which we are so worried will be saved and the barricades will be saved from that European fate, that awful fate, under a single-seat system.  You will get better Deputies who will be able to do their work better in the smaller areas, <Col N="633" /> and also in this House, than at present. I say: away with the multi-seat system.  I am the last beneficiary I hope under PR in a general election and never, never again.</P>

      <P>I listened with a considerable amount of interest as I always do to Deputy Dillon.  He said that this was a sordid attempt by the Fianna Fáil Party to destroy the Labour Party and he went on to say that he has been a long-serving Member of the House. I agree that he is a senior Member and as such deserves respect.  Even on the basis of family traditions, he deserves the respect of the House because the Dillons, as the House knows, through dark and evil days were good people. At the same time, when Deputy Dillon indulges in histronics, a young man like myself must stand up and defend the name of the Party which I believe is the best political vehicle for the country.  I should like to say to Deputy Dillon, to Fine Gael and to the Labour Party that at no time did the Fianna Fáil Party consider this proposal in the light of doing away with the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>At no time did the Fianna Fáil Party make this suggestion. I have been in the Party now for some 15 years, and at parliamentary level for three, and I have, I think, a fairly good grasp of what goes on within the Party generally.  At no time at Party meetings, at cumann meetings or at constituency executive meetings has the view been expressed by any member of the Fianna Fáil Party that the abolition of PR and the introduction of the single-seat constituency would do away with the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I have always held the view that the single-seat constituency, particularly in urban areas, will improve the position of the Labour Party, as was demonstrated indeed in the local elections.  The Minister's colleague, Deputy Seán Dunne, headed the poll on the first count.  Now, he will be elected no matter what tag he attaches to himself.  Let us then be quite definite about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, for whom I have the <Col N="634" /> deepest respect and whose opinion and oratory I admire and envy, made allegations which were both unfair and unsubstantiated, totally unsubstantiated. We should disabuse our minds of cant and humbug, he advised; he should disabuse his mind of cant and humbug and cease his attempt to spread hysteria.  Let us discuss this in as dispassionate a manner as possible but, when the Deputy from Monaghan stands up and makes these allegations, we have a function, as a political Party, to put the truth before the country.  I can assure Deputy Dillon that, in relation to the proposals before the House, and this proposal in particular, if I thought for one moment, as a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party, that the Labour Party would be wiped out and destroyed as Deputy Dillon said, I would oppose these proposals.  I say that honestly and sincerely and with deep personal conviction.</P>

I was born into a republican socialist tradition and I respect it.  I will always respect it.  Maybe I am not a socialist but I am deeply convinced of the ideal of social justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this proposal is not carried in conjunction with the straight vote and the tolerance issue, it is not a dictatorship of Fianna Fáil, or Labour, much less the unions and Mr. Conroy's hooded crows, that will ruin the country; if these proposals are not carried, I believe the dictatorship that will threaten the country is the dictatorship of political paralysis.  At the moment the Opposition, as I see it, are freewheeling <Col N="635" /> along with no hope of power under our present system unless, of course, Fine Gael join forces with the Labour Party under one leader and become one individual Party.  If I might briefly refer to the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme last Tuesday night dealing with the single-seat constituency, we had on that programme the chairman of the Labour Party welcoming a coalition, the Leader of the Labour Party against a coalition, Deputy O'Leary against a coalition and the vice-chairman of the Labour Party for a coalition.</P>

      <P>That is not true.  At no time has the view been expressed that, if these proposals are carried, the <Col N="636" /> Labour Party will be done away with and that allegation has not been substantiated to any degree in this House, except by vague generalisations and the authority of people like Deputy Dillon.  When the Deputy speaks, people listen to him, and with respect, and I think he has an obligation to temper what he says and to substantiate his statements.</P>
      <P>The constituency I represent, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, has the second highest population figure in the country; with 104,584 it comes second after Dublin county with 145,903.  It has the fourth highest number of electors, 61,322.  It comes fourth after Dublin county in that respect.  Dublin county has 74,600 and gives the second highest number of electors, 15,330 people, per TD.  Again, this comes second after Dublin North-East, with 15,638.  One would want to know the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. Like Deputy Corry in Cork, I have been living there all my life, and I know it, not perhaps with the same degree of experience as Deputy Corry has of his constituency because he has been in public life for 40 years but, as a native of the area, my whole inclination is towards the single-seat constituency. It is a very rational proposition and even Deputies opposite agree with the concept of single-seat constituencies. What we are falling out on is, I think, the method of election. Deputy Fitzpatrick is smiling.  I wonder would he accept the transferable vote?</P>

      <P>Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown is a very large area.  It stretches from Booterstown through Blackrock to Dún Laoghaire, Sandycove, Glasthule and into Killiney and Ballybrack and from Ballybrack to Wyattville, Foxrock, Cabinteely, Stillorgan, part of Dundrum, the whole of Mount Merrion and then down into Milltown.  How could one Deputy traverse that constituency and be as close as I should like to be to my constituents? I believe in communication. I believe in making myself available to my constituents.  I do not believe in becoming a doormat for my constituents or anything like that.  I believe that my constituents deserve my presence&mdash;that may be a bit of self-flattery &mdash;in a particular area at least once a month.  This is <i>bona fide</i>, because I have set up within the constituency, as I call them, political clinics.  Deputy Corry calls them stations.  We all have different terms for this type of thing.  I have set up clinics in Milltown, Sallynoggin and Dalkey, which I visit once a month.  I know this is not sufficient. I would want a clinic in Stillorgan, Mount Merrion, Booterstown, Black-rock, Dún Laoghaire, Glasthule, Sandycove, Ballybrack, Foxrock, Cabinteely, and so on, back into Dundrum and Milltown again, that is, if we were doing the thing properly. You can imagine, within a single-seat constituency, how easily accessible I would be to my constituents and they would be to me.  This is such a rational thing, such an easy concept to me, <Col N="638" /> this idea of a single-seat constituency as distinct from multi-member constituencies where you have, apart from your opposition, internecine strife.  It is probably too rational, actually.  However, I should like to disabuse the doubting Thomases of the idea that the single-seat constituency is being brought in for the benefit or welfare of Deputies.  I do not think that is true. The proposal is being suggested for the benefit of constituents, because from election to election one visits one's constituents and one finds at election time on knocking at the door of a constituent, the constituent says: &ldquo;We have not seen you since the last election.&rdquo; Of course, they have not seen me since the last election because they could not possibly see me; the area is too vast.  I think it is a justifiable complaint. It is justifiable that they should say this to me.  It is a reasonable complaint. They are entitled to see me. They are entitled to have me available to them, not as a public messenger boy. I have to exercise my own judgment in all these matters.  If somebody comes to me as a supplicant, I tell them the facts and do my best for them&mdash;no question about it.  I do not treat with my constituents on pre-conditions.  I meet a man face to face and we have a discussion and that is it.  I do not set pre-conditions to my meeting with anyone.</P>
      <P>There is the other aspect, of course, of the multi-member constituency.  As you know, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown has no Labour representative.  If the constituency were split into single-seat constituencies, there is a place for a Labour representative in the area.  I have said this already and I will say it again.  I have no doubt about that.  At the last election, of course, their only mistake was that they put up only one candidate.  I am probably helping the Labour Party but I want to disabuse Deputy Dillon's mind of the idea that Fianna Fáil are trying to do away with them.  Under PR, if they put up a second candidate there would be a Labour Deputy there.</P>

      <P>Many members of the Labour Party come to me as a Deputy for the area and say: &ldquo;I am not going to vote for you at the next election but I want you to help me this time.&rdquo;  I say: &ldquo;So what?&rdquo;  I do not ask anybody who comes to my door whether he votes Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour. This, again, I hope, will dissipate the view that if a Party is not represented in a constituency, the electors who voted for that Party will be disfranchised. It is just not on, just is not true. We are all reasonable people, civilised people, and we have the innate courtesy of the Celtic race.  We are a courteous people, a hospitable people and I would hope that if people come to my door, they will always be met with courtesy.  I am sure I speak for 99.9 per cent of Deputies.  I know very well that Deputy Fitzpatrick would love a singe-seat constituency.  He is a hard-working Deputy&mdash;I will say that for him&mdash;no question about it&mdash;but would not it make life much easier for him?  My problem at the moment is that Deputy Fitzpatrick will not tell us what system of election he wants. I know he wants the single-seat just as all the other members of Fine Gael want the single-seat, as typified by Deputy Cosgrave in April, 1965, when he said that as far as he was concerned, he wanted to reiterate what he said in 1959, that he wanted the single-seat constituency and the straight vote.</P>

      <P>I should like to mention the constituency of Galway West, which is the perfect example of the multi-member constituency and which is represented by Deputy Geoghegan and Deputy Molloy.  This is a case against the multi-member constituency.  It is a constituency 80 miles in length, which includes the Aran Islands, and which is 14 miles wide.  How, in the name of all that is wonderful, can the four Deputies in that area really spread themselves over a constituency that size, taking in the Aran Islands?  The people of the Aran Islands, by virtue of being Irish citizens, are entitled to representation and they are entitled to accessibility to Deputies.  How can they have accessibility living on an offshore island It is not a reasonable thing for these people.  My information is that Deputies do their best to see them as much as possible but they feel, as Deputies, that they do not see them often enough.  How can they, in a constituency 80 miles long by 14 miles wide?  It is just not physically on.  As to the question of the religious minorities which, I think Deputy Dillon mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is one other matter I should like to put on the record in relation to the Constitution Committee, of which I was privileged to be a member.  Some people have suggested that the Fianna Fáil people on this Committee were against the straight vote and single-member constituency. This is not so.

At the moment you have the Fine Gael Party looking for salvation from the Labour Party and their plea for salvation being rejected.  There are so many different views within the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party that one does not know where one stands in relation to them.  They will admit themselves they are only part-time politicians and some of them will even admit they are a weak Opposition.  We want a strong Opposition.  Weak Oppositions lead to a narrow, inert type of Government. That is the sort of situation I do not want to see my children being brought up in.  I am very serious about this. That is the type of Opposition that brings about the downfall of the democratic fabric.</P>

      <P>We have been accused of taking no interest in this.  It was reported widely by many of the political commentators that we had no interest in the PR issue and there were references to the poor attendance in the Dáil Chamber and so on.  However, we are very interested in it.  In spite of the allegations of the Opposition that we in this Party are divided on the issue of the single-seat constituency, I want to say that is not so. We are very united.  This Party has never failed to do its duty and to do what we feel is right by the people.</P>
      <P>During the last general election I made a swift calculation as to how long it would take me to visit all the people on the register.  I worked it out that I could visit everyone in the constituency if I worked an eight-hour day for 120 days.  It can be truly said there must be houses in my constituency which have not been called on by even one of the five Deputies representing that area.  There are approximately 60,000 people on the register for Dublin South-West and if you include those under 21, it probably represents 104,000 souls. These people can call on every one of the five Deputies in the constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the Deputies in the Opposition most concerned about single-seat constituencies, and in particular, the straight vote, are those who have been elected in the past on the coat tails of others, on head of the poll surpluses.  What puzzles me is how the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party cannot imagine themselves as being a Government ever. It is obvious they have no faith in themselves.  Somebody made a calculation that if we were to receive 40 per cent of the votes, we would get 90 seats out of the 144 in this Dáil.  Yet if 40 per cent can give 90 seats, 35 per cent would certainly give an overall majority.  I would think it far easier to go after 35 per cent of the votes <Col N="643" /> and form a Government than get the 48 or 49 per cent necessary at the moment.  While Labour and Fine Gael cannot see themselves being elected under PR, they are afraid to stand the trial of the single-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the irrelevancies of Deputy Corry because Deputy Corry had the temerity to refer to and to comment on what Deputy Dillon had said about PR. Naturally these kind of comments he made previously, which are on the record, would be considered irrelevant by Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon is a well-known coalitionist.  He said to Deputy Corish here on one occasion: &ldquo;If you had not announced you would not form a Coalition you would be in office now.&rdquo;  We know where he stands.  In regard to the idea that this is a trick on the people of the country, can you imagine what this House would be like with 144 Independents?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to minority groups in this country.  As Deputy Lenihan correctly said, there are no major issues between the minority groups, certainly the religious groups, in this country.  They are members of all Parties.  At one time if you were of a particular religion, you were automatically pro-British.  This has all died out.  There is no longer any conflict between nationality and religion in this country.  That is important to note.  It is glaringly obvious that the people now so anxious to let the Bill go through the House, and accusing us of filibustering, are scared stiff that time is running out.  The people who were seized with hysteria when this was first announced have had time to think <Col N="644" /> it out.  I would venture to say that many of the political commentators also have had time to think it out and are satisfied that this is not the monster it was supposed to be.  The people of this country have a right to vote. They will never be denied that right. But this Party will never refrain from its duty to do what it feels is best in the interests of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I just briefly want to put on the record where I stand with regard to the single-seat. It was suggested by Deputy Dillon that the motivation behind this was to exterminate the Labour Party.  Lest he or anybody else might think that I was party, or would be party, to such a sordid conspiracy, I want to refute it quite clearly.  I want to make it clear that what motivates me to support the single-seat is my belief that it will lead to greater efficiency, greater political stability, a better type of candidate and the two-Party system&mdash;all of which I am very much in favour of.  I felt particularly vulnerable as an Independent actively concerned with it.  As a Deputy who recently resigned from the Labour Party, I felt perhaps there was some reflection thrown on me in this matter and I would not like the House to be under any illusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was brought up in a family which had and still has a social conscience. I learned to concern myself in a practical way with the less privileged members of society.  I do not happen to believe in an extreme form of a socialist communist philosophy. I found myself in a position where the Labour Party had moved extremely to the left and were no longer the Party they were in the days when my father was the Leader of the Party.  Having fought a rearguard action quite openly and without any disguise, I found myself in a position where I could not in conscience accept the point of view put forward by the fellow travellers who are now in control and I resigned from the Party.  I did not know this referendum was going to be brought forward and I now find myself in the position where the single-seat constituency is proposed that I support this proposal because I believe it will lead to efficiency <Col N="645" /> and stability and not for any sordid reason.  It is possible that there are people in the Fine Gael Party who believe in single-seat constituencies but who may have other motivations.  I am not accusing Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Sweetman or Deputy Flanagan or Deputy L'Estrange or other Deputies who are known to favour the single-seat constituencies of any particular motivations.  Perhaps Deputy Dillon is speaking from what he knows but a person of Deputy Dillon's standing is doing himself less than justice when he makes the sort of charge he made.</P>
    <P>In a grand manner Deputy Dillon dismisses statistics as being unimportant, although they are obviously irrefutable.  When he cannot answer them logically, he dismisses them as a matter of no importance.  It is only Deputy Dillon who could get away with that grand manner approach but I think he does the nation and this House a disservice when he lends his undoubted talents to this type of double-talk.  I do not think he should indulge in it any longer.  If he believes in the single-seat constituencies, as I am inclined to think he does, he should live up to his family tradition and not refute statements which he made years ago.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that it is no conspiracy to wipe out the Labour Party which motivates me.  I do not think the Labour Party would be wiped out, and I would not like that Party to be wiped out.  I think they have a function: I think some Labour Deputies do a good job.  I think many Members could with advantage be replaced by better Deputies but I have no personal grudge against the Labour Party.  I have taken great care not to attack the Party since I left, which is something other members who left the Party in recent times have not done.  I bear no grudge and I carry no grievance.  It is the interests of efficiency and stability of the two-Party system which motivated me to support single-seat constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very good that we should now, as compared with the early Stages of these Bills, have a reasoned, calm and, indeed, lengthy <Col N="646" /> discussion on the proposals in the Bill. In the beginning, I must say the Opposition had a good innings, and inside and outside the House mounted all their big guns against the Government's proposal to amend the Constitution. In the initial heat of the discussion, possibly, they did convince some people in the country to change their minds, but now I feel we are getting to the stage where the people are beginning to forget the blitz and reason things out quietly for themselves.</P>
      <P>The case was made over the past few weeks by the Minister in a workmanlike way, without any flourishes, and the people are beginning to see that the case now being made is a logical and reasonable one, and one which I think will convince the percentage of the people who may have views one way or another.  The most important aspect of all this was the point made by the Minister, and proved by him, that if this Bill is not passed here, and if the referendum is defeated in the country, the voters in the rural areas will find themselves less well represented, and it will take a larger number of electors to return a TD in a rural area than it will in the urban areas and the city areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take, for instance, my own county which consists at the moment of two constituencies.  It is a large county with a falling population.  This means that under the Constitution as it stands, Donegal would be represented by five Deputies, each representing&mdash;I am not quite sure of the figure&mdash;over 13,000 and possibly 14,000 electors, whereas in Dublin and in the urban areas, the number is as low as 10,000.  In other words, it would take 50 per cent more voters, if the referendum were not carried, to return a Deputy in Donegal than it would in the built-up areas. The Ceann Comhairle who is a non-politician will have one of the five seats.  This means that there will be a contest in the county for four seats, and should the Ceann Comhairle again become Ceann Comhairle after the election, this will mean that the people will be effectively represented by four Deputies, in a county which stretches from Malin Head to Tullaghan Bridge between Sligo and Bundoran, and <Col N="647" /> again from Lifford to Tory Island.</P>
    <P>No matter what the remuneration was, I do not think that any city Deputy or any urban Deputy would like to face the task of looking after the interests of that wide area.  It could happen that in the case of the four Deputies, there could be centralisation. You could have a number of them living close together with the result that very large areas of the county would not be within striking distance. As against that, what the Government are proposing, and what this referendum will enable the people to have, is equal representation electoral-wise with the cities.  This would be the effect of the tolerance which is contained in the Bill.</P>

The Fianna Fáil Party do not believe in the proposal they now have before the House and, for some weeks past, have been shadow-boxing and stalling here to delay the passing of these Bills so that the referendum could not be held until Autumn.

      <P>What was the majority in the vote of confidence?  There have not really been a lot of new points raised by the Opposition on this Bill but there are a few things which call for further reply by me.  First of all, Deputy Fitzpatrick has continued to give evidence of the fact that, on both of these Bills, he wants to have it both ways.  He has continued to give evidence of the fact that he is completely confused in his own mind as to why he and his Party are opposing <Col N="650" /> both of these proposals.  Of course, that is natural because we know that there is a near fifty-fifty division in the Party as to whether or not they should be opposed and that, in fact, the decision to oppose these two Bills was based on the traditional attitude of the Fine Gael Party that their duty, as an Opposition, is to oppose and that everything proposed by a Fianna Fáil Government should be opposed.</P>
      <P>As I said, on both of these Bills Deputy Fitzpatrick has been arguing two different and completely opposite viewpoints.  On the Third Amendment, he spoke against the principle of what was being proposed&mdash;and then somersaulted to say that the present position is in fact what we are seeking to establish, minus the limitation of one-sixth maximum divergence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick stated that it is purely on the grounds of suspicion of some ulterior motives which he ascribes to the Fianna Fáil Party that that Bill is opposed.  Similarly, with regard to this Bill, he does not know but suspects that there must be some sinister and ulterior motive in the mind of Fianna Fáil in putting this forward and therefore, although he can see nothing wrong, he must again oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, Deputy Fitzpatrick has been arguing, on the one hand, that the main advantage of the present system is that it gives minority representation and, again, in the same speech, in the same contribution, he argues in defence of the present system that it has not done this, that it has not produced numbers of minorities being specially represented here. This indicates clearly that the Fine Gael attitude to these proposals is not based on any reasoned disagreement with what is proposed but on the usual <Col N="651" /> unreasoning attitude of opposition for opposition's sake and on suspicion that Fianna Fáil have some sinister ulterior motive.</P>
    <P>Now, one point Deputy Fitzpatrick made in one of the two contributions he has made since his first one, to which I have already replied, to which I should refer briefly is that the Fianna Fáil Government have introduced this proposal because they want to create a one-party State.  What is the system we propose?  We propose that there will be 144 separate constituencies and that in each of them will be one seat to be filled so that these constituencies will be contested, it is to be expected, by one candidate on behalf of all the different Parties that have proposals for the conduct of the country's affairs. The situation in each of these constituencies will be that the best possible candidate the different Parties can find to put forward the best policy they can devise for the country will go before a comparatively small number of electors and try to convince them that their proposals for the conduct of the country's affairs are the best.  If this is, as the Fine Gael and Labour Parties say, going to result in the perpetuation of Fianna Fáil Government and going to result, as Deputy Fitzpatrick suspects, in the creation of a one-party State, this can only mean one thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My understanding of democracy is that it is based on the assumption that the people are capable of choosing for themselves the most suitable form of government.  If we assume that and if it is to be the position in these circumstances that there will be a clear confrontation between the different parties in each constituency and these circumstances must result in the perpetuation for all time of Fianna Fáil government, and if we accept the fundamental principle of democracy that the people are capable of choosing the best type of government for themselves, this surely constitutes an admission that the Fianna Fáil proposals for the conduct of the country's affairs are the best?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Or what is the Opposition contention? Is it that the people are too stupid to be able to see what is good for them?  Or is it an admission that Fianna Fáil policy is the best?  Or do they contend that although their policies are better, it is inconceivable either now or at any time that they will be able to attract to these superior policies of theirs people who would be capable of explaining to an intelligent electorate that their proposals are in fact better than ours?  If that is so, surely there is a contradiction there, a contradiction of the whole basis of democracy?  There is no limit to the inconsistency of Deputy Fitzpatrick and the Party for which he claims to <Col N="653" /> speak.  I say &ldquo;claims to speak&rdquo; because I know that in fact he speaks only for a majority of one in the Party.</P>

Is it not a fact instead that it just happens that the people who have some confidence in the prospect of the Fine Gael Party at some future time forming a Government happen to be in a minority of <Col N="655" /> one in the present parliamentary Fine Gael Party?</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, on the one hand, says that the present system ensures minority representation, ensures that minorities can be represented and therefore makes it a feasible proposition for all these unspecified minorities we have in the country to form their own political Parties and, on the other hand, he maintains in defence of the present system, that it has not led to the formation of minority Parties.  I remember that in the debate on the Amendment of the Constitution Bill in 1959 I listed the number of political Parties that had contested the elections up to that time.  As far as I remember, they numbered 26.  It is true that at present we are in a phase when there are only three Parties represented in the Dáil, but there are a number of other Parties springing up every now and then.  We do not know how many of these are still in existence.  They come and they go.</P>

      <P>Because they were prohibited by Deputy Tully from standing up, they made their contributions sitting down.  They alleged that the reason why the Fianna Fáil Government have been in office for the past 30 years was that the people voted on the basis of slogans such as &ldquo;Up Dev&rdquo; and so on. It is this inherent belief of the two Opposition Parties that the people are fools that keeps them in Opposition, and it is our acknowledgement of the fact that the people are intelligent and that they can appreciate reasoned argument that keeps us over here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, in his contribution today, alleged that this proposal of ours was desired by only a small section of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Even Deputy Fitzpatrick should know that is not so.  This proposition was put forward by a number of units of our organisation at our Árd Fheis.  It was passed unanimously, to my recollection, but if not unanimously, it was practically unanimously, and our Árd Fheis, unlike the Árd Fheis of other Parties is a democratically-constituted body consisting of accredited delegates from branches or cumainn, as we call them, all over the country.</P>

      <P>I know.  I knew he had spoken but, I admit, I do not know what he was speaking about.  It is very difficult to know what Deputy Dillon is talking about.  He appealed to the House to ignore statistics in regard to the Third Amendment.  His entire contribution consisted merely of abuse of the Government, of imputations of sinister, ulterior motives to the Government, <Col N="661" /> but he did not adduse one solitary argument in favour of the present system.  Of course he is not aware of any argument in favour of it.  His opinion of the present system is on record, that it is &ldquo;a fraud and a cod, the child of the brains of all the cranks in creation, foisted on us by a collection of half-lunatics&rdquo;.  He alleged that the object is to destroy the Labour Party.  How can a situation such as would exist in a single-member constituency destroy the Labour Party? Do they not aspire to be a majority Party?  Do they or do they not believe that their proposals for the conduct of the country's affairs are worthy of the support of the majority of the people?</P>

      <P>If they are worthy of support, is it not possible for them to obtain that support?  Why must they regard themselves as a permanent minority unless they believe that it is not conceivable their proposals could be acceptable to anything more than a minority of the people?  Of course, there is no reason inherent in this Bill why either the Labour Party, or even the Fine Gael Party, should be destroyed as a result.  If either of these are destroyed in the circumstances in which there will be a clear-cut confrontation of the Parties in 144 constituencies, then that is inherent in the Parties themselves, not in the proposed system of election and representation. The fact is every Deputy knows that single-member constituencies are best both for the people and for their representatives. However, a majority of one in the Fine Gael Party are afraid for their own personal seats, while the Labour Party have obviously become so resigned to scraping up votes here, there and everywhere over widespread constituencies and eventually obtaining the last seat with the aid of votes cast for all sorts of different candidates and Parties, that they have accepted for all time that theirs must be the rôle of a minority Party.  The fact is, as Fine Gael are beginning to realise, the views of the present Leader of Fine Gael will prevail in spite of the Fine Gael Party <Col N="662" /> itself and despite a defeat by one vote on this issue in the Party.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is, the Minister, and in case anyone might take him seriously I want to refute the snide suggestions which he has made in regard to the leadership of the Fine Gael Party and the view of the Party in relation to this amendment. May I say at once that Deputy Cosgrave, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, enjoys the absolute confidence of the members of this Party?  Any effort of the Minister to denigrate him will not succeed.  The Minister came into this House and never served as a backbencher.  On his first day in the Dáil he was made a Minister as a result of some bargaining which went on in the Fianna Fáil Party.  His conduct in this House ever since has been to belittle people, to indulge in personal attacks on them.  He adds no grace or conviction to any argument.</P>

      <P>The contribution by the Minister in support of this proposed amendment of the Constitution belittles the proposal.  A majority of one!  What does the Minister think this Party is that they would discuss matters with members of the Fianna Fáil Party?  It is not true.  The Fine Gael Party took a decision and it was a complete decision and the Party are absolutely united as to where they stand.  We believe that multi-member constituencies are known, appreciated and valued in this country.  People have grown accustomed to them.  The members <Col N="663" /> of each political Party value them. The members of the Fianna Fáil Party value the fact that they have not to be coerced into supporting one particular candidate.  If they want to vote Fianna Fáil, then under the present system they have a choice and they can exercise that choice.  That is something our people understand and appreciate.</P>
      <P>There may have been a point of view originally as to whether the single-seat system is better or not.  Certainly in this country, and we have had very nearly 50 years' experience of multiple-member constituencies, it would not be in the national interest to change.  The system was changed in one part of Ireland in the middle Twenties; the object of the change in the North of Ireland was to achieve the dominance of the political scene by one political Party and that has been the position in the North of Ireland ever since.</P>
      <P>There is no point in speaking further on this.  God knows, we have had enough debating about it.  The people have heard enough arguments about it. Ten years ago the people decided this issue.  I can see no prospect of them changing their opinion now.  Admittedly, only 50 per cent, or something in that order, voted the last time.  I believe a great many more will vote this time and my personal judgment is that this proposal will be decisively defeated again on this occasion.  It is in the national interest that this issue should go now to the people as quickly as possible.  The allegation that the Minister has been unduly prolonging this debate has been manifestly established. I have nothing further to say.  I should like to have a division on this so that we can get to the next amendment, although the Minister has already indicated his view on it.  But let us debate it.  Let us get on with our business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of insinuations made last night by Deputy Fitzpatrick that my amendment was not in keeping with the Second Reading of the Bill before the House, I think it was amply demonstrated by the Taoiseach that he was concerned mainly with the difficulties of the single-seat constituency when he spoke introducing this Bill. Indeed, he went to great lengths and dealt in considerable detail with the undesirable problems to which the multi-seat constituency gave rise.  He explained in considerable detail the hypocrisy in which Deputies were encouraged to engage by pretending to interfere in the day-to-day administration of matters in which they had little or no influence.  He explained that this was a source of great friction between Deputies, especially when these Deputies were members of the same Party.  By engaging excessively in this type of rat race to curry favour with <Col N="668" /> constituents, Deputies were tending to neglect their primary duties as legislators.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach explained that the single-seat constituency would encourage the Deputy to avoid appearing partisan for any one section of his constituents and that in time this would tend to build up a better community spirit and that the smaller area would lead to a greater knowledge of and intimacy with his constituents. Because of the direct comparison between one candidate and another at elections, the Parties would be encouraged to put forward candidates of the highest calibre and this would all help to improve the standard of the national Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at great length with the long counts which are a feature and are becoming more a feature of multi-seat constituencies. He mentioned the haphazard methods in transfers and the large element of luck involved, especially when you get results involving ten, 15 or 20 counts. He mentioned that the average person could not possibly decide the relevant merits of high preference votes.  He mentioned that at the Fianna Fáil ArdFheis resolutions calling for the single-seat constituency were passed almost unanimously.  He made a case for the single-seat constituency and mentioned the needless competition, the sham, the bluff and the pretence to which the multi-seat constituency gave rise, not to mention the greatly inflated cost of administration which arose from this unnecessary competition between Deputies and the consequent high costs which in turn lead to higher taxation. The Minister said, on two occasions, since the Bill was introduced, that he was mainly concerned with obtaining the single-seat constituency and less concerned with the actual method of voting.</P>
    <P>I agree with both the Taoiseach and the Minister in what they have said regarding the single-seat.  I am in favour of the single-seat constituency and the straight vote.  I believe that in a relatively short time this would lead to a two-Party system which would make democracy meaningful.  I think the present system of proportional <Col N="669" /> representation is an inefficient and cumbersome method of choosing Deputies.  Because I believe that at the present time the straight vote is not acceptable to the electorate as a whole and because I believe it would be a national tragedy if we failed to secure any type of parliamentary reform, I tabled this amendment which would give us, I believe, a happy and honourable compromise.  Those of us who believe we need the greater efficiency which the single-seat would give us would be satisfied, while those of us who believe in the necessity of retaining the principle of PR would also be accommodated.</P>
    <P>I think this is a reasonable approach to the problem.  I believe the public at large would be glad to accept it as a happy compromise.  Otherwise we will be in a position that, no matter who wins the referendum, it is obvious that there will be a large number of voters who will be dissatisfied.  We will have the unnecessary and pointless division of the people over something on which there could be unanimity. I know there are selfish men in all Parties who are not concerned with constitutional reform but are concerned mainly with themselves.  I know there are some Opposition Deputies who believe, rightly or wrongly, that if the Government can be stampeded into going ahead with the straight vote, they will be defeated and therefore they feel&mdash;putting their Party interest before the national interest&mdash;the Government should be encouraged to go ahead.  I can only hope the Government will not be so foolish as to take this misguided course.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies have insinuated that I should never have tabled this amendment.  Indeed, some have gone so far as to suggest I was encouraged to do so by the Minister himself or some other member of the Government. I can only reject this as childish nonsense.  I would like to inform the members of the Opposition that it is my right&mdash;and indeed, as I see it, my duty&mdash;to table this amendment and have it discussed by the House, even if in doing so I am endangering the selfish ambitions and the security of <Col N="670" /> tenure of some of those who shouted loudest because I have exercised my right and performed my duty in doing so.  The public interest which has been shown in this amendment is ample proof that I am not alone in this belief.</P>
    <P>I am not really concerned about the reflections on my character made by some members of the Fine Gael Party.  I will confess I was disappointed that one prominent member of the Fine Gael Party, an ex-inter-Party Cabinet Minister and an ex-colleague of my father at that, of whom I thought better and from whom I expected more, suggested that because I took a different point of view from that which he took, there was something dubious in the whole thing and that I had no right to hold a different point of view.  The crowning insult was when he dragged in my father's name and started attributing to him opinions and views which I know my father did not hold, in order to lend stature and respectability to this gentleman's out-of-date and old-fashioned ideas.  This Fine Gael gentleman was very careful not to attack the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave, for holding the same views on PR as I hold.  I wonder was this an omission or was it a calculated act on his part?  Was I being used as a whipping boy by this gentleman to attack his Leader&mdash;which he did not dare do publicly?  Was he afraid to attack the Leader of his Party, or is his own integrity suspect?</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said by Opposition Deputies about the moral right of the Government to introduce a referendum now, since it is only ten years since the previous referendum was introduced and discussed.  Indeed, so many Front Bench Members of both Parties made such a debating point of this that I feel I should like to refer to it.  I would think it is reasonable to assume that the average voter votes over a period of 50 years of his life.  If we assume that he commences to vote at 21 years and that he votes until he is 71 years, that would give us a period of 50 years.  It is obvious that not every voter will vote when he is 21, and that many voters will continue to vote long after they are 71, <Col N="671" /> but for a variety of reasons, it is also quite obvious that not every voter will vote for the full period either.  I would think that an average of 50 years is a pretty fair estimate of the voting life of most people.</P>
    <P>If we take 50 years as the average voting period, this means that in ten years the electorate would have a turnover of 20 per cent.  At the previous referendum 58 per cent only of the electorate in fact voted and expressed an opinion.  This means that not less than 42 per cent of the electorate did not express any opinion whatsoever.  If we add this 42 per cent who did not express any opinion to the 20 per cent who will have reached voting age since then, we find that not less than 60 per cent of the electorate have not in fact expressed an opinion or have not had an opportunity of expressing an opinion on this question.  If to the total of the 60 per cent we were to add the percentage of people who will have changed their minds since then, in either direction, on the merits or demerits of the straight vote, we find a position where possibly two-thirds of the people have not had an opportunity to express any opinion, or who could have changed their minds since then.</P>
    <P>If we bear in mind that the previous referendum was defeated by only two per cent of the electorate and that at least 60 per cent odd have not had the opportunity to express their opinion, it is obvious that the referendum is wide open.  The result might be anything, and the Government not only have a moral right but, indeed, on such a critical issue, a duty to introduce this referendum.  This point was carefully concealed by the Opposition, or perhaps they did not realise it or look at it that way.  It is certainly worthy of their attention.</P>
    <P>Another point raised was the cost of the referendum and a great deal of foolish and unnecessary talk was indulged in on that point.  A figure of £100,000 was mentioned.  At the previous referendum approximately 1,000,000 voted.  If you divide a cost of £100,000 by 1,000,000 people, it works out at approximately 2/- per <Col N="672" /> voter.  Does any Deputy seriously consider that the electorate are not worth considering because it would cost 2/-to get a man's opinion?  With our glorified fight for freedom, home rule and independence, can it be that after 50 years of self-government we do not think it worth spending 2/- per voter in order to find out the opinion of the electorate?  These points were so talked about and used to misguide the people that I thought I should mention them, whether or not they are strictly relevant.</P>
    <P>I put down this amendment simply enough and I took the wording in the Constitution, Article 12, section 2, subsection 3º, dealing with the method of voting for the election of the President. This treats the whole country as one constituency with one seat and declares:</P>
    <P>The voting shall be by secret ballot and on the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote.</P>
    <P>My amendment reads:</P>
    <P>The members shall be elected on the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote.</P>
    <P>I deleted the words &ldquo;by secret ballot&rdquo; because this is already provided for in the section.  My amendment has the merit of using a form of words which has already been approved in the Constitution, and about which there could be little or no valid argument.  I do not want to repeat the arguments which have been made <i>ad nauseam</i> on Second Stage as to the respective merits or demerits of PR and the straight vote.  I have already made it clear both in this House and outside that I am anxious to reform the Constitution in the interests of efficiency and political stability.</P>
    <P>I believe that we should have the single-seat system, that we should have the two-Party system, that we should have a system that would give us real democracy, that we should have a system which would give us a genuine Opposition which would offer constructive counter ideas to those proposed by the Government and not merely an Opposition opposing for opposition's <Col N="673" /> sake, an Opposition that would offer the people the choice of an alternative Government if they should so desire, an Opposition that would not use this Dáil as a status symbol club, an Opposition that would be really competitive and that would have fresh ideas and a sense of urgency, and not a club where all the power lies in the hands of the ruling few who are in danger of becoming complacent because there is no real or vigorous opposition.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the Taoiseach said the primary concern was not to maintain Fianna Fáil in office, that naturally he would wish his Party to continue to be the Government but that that was not the primary concern.  I accept that statement.  Like all Members of the House, I respect the Taoiseach's integrity and hold him in high esteem but I do not think the motivation behind this Bill is important. In any event, the result would be the same.  At election time this can produce big swings.  This will ensure that while the tide is running for the present Government they will have a larger majority, and when the tide turns against them we will have a complete break, a clean sweep, and a strong alternative Government.  We have become so stagnant in this Parliament that the danger is that the centre of debate will pass from the House to outside bodies whose members and motives might be more suspect than we are ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Carty)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 7 together.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the trade of Shannon Free Airport Industrial Estate consists of goods entering or leaving the estate direct by air from or to other countries without passing through any other part of the State.  Normal customs documentation, from which our trade statistics are compiled, is not available for this activity as the goods in question do not pass through the general customs area of the State at any point of their movement between the estate and the country of origin or destination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some information on this direct <Col N="680" /> trading by air is, however, obtained periodically by the Central Statistics Office by means of a voluntary inquiry designed to obtain from the individual manufacturing companies operating in the estate, the total value of their imports and exports by air; warehousing and other service agencies are, of course, excluded from the inquiry as these concerns are not basically involved in the import or export of goods on their own behalf.  Firms are asked to give approximate value figures where exact totals are not readily available &mdash; hence the term &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; as used in my reply of 29th May last. Returns from this inquiry covering all firms first became available for the year 1964.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the 1966-1967 annual report of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company the figures quoted there for the external trading of the estate were supplied by the Central Statistics Office.  The figures shown were those available at the time of the preparation of the report. Since then, certain rather substantial amendments have been found necessary in the original estimates and these have been incorporated in the figures used in my reply af 29th May. For convenience the figures in the statement were given to the nearest hundred thousand pounds while, in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company report, they were given to the nearest thousand pounds.</P>
    <P>It is understood that manufacturing activity commenced in the Industrial Estate in 1959 and that the first imports and exports from the estate were made in that year.  Particulars of trade for the years prior to 1964, comparable to those referred to above, are not, however, available.</P>
    <P>While I have no reason to doubt the general accuracy of the Córas Tráchtála estimate of £5 million for exports from Shannon Free Airport Industrial Estate in 1963, I did not consider it proper to include it in my earlier reply as the figure is from a different source and may not be comparable in coverage with the figures for later years.</P>
    <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose <Col N="681" /> to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing for each year 1964-1967 the values of imports to Shannon Free Airport Industrial Estate (a) by air directly from other countries&mdash;as derived from the special inquiry referred to and (b) by surface transport&mdash;as <Col N="682" /> derived from official transhipment bills.  The information available does not permit a distinction to be made between raw materials, semi-processed goods and components for assembly.</P>

      <P>I do not agree that the general appearance of the entrance to the Department of Social Welfare at Aras Mhic Dhiarmada warrants the description &ldquo;shabby and unclean&rdquo;. The floor and side walls to the <Col N="695" /> entrance lobby are faced with marble which presents a naturally dull appearance. The inner wall was redecorated last year and the glass doors and windows in the outer wall are cleaned every month.  The floor is vacuum-cleaned every morning and washed out at least twice a week.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to clean and lacquer the bronze framework of the doors and windows in the entrance lobby and to replace the seating in the lobby with modern furniture.</P>

      <P>In regard to the second part of the question, positive steps to encourage the teaching of modern continental languages have been taken by my Department over the past number of years by way of special courses for teachers, special grants for teaching aids and research into the most up-to-date methods of modern language teaching.

There is a rapid upsurge in French, and rightly so.  In 1967, 12,200 pupils took French for the intermediate certificate; in 1968, the figure was 14,300.  Therefore what the Deputy asks is being done.  At present we are preserving the position of Latin.</P>

      <P>I should like to answer that supplementary question, Sir.  The position is that when an industrialist comes along with a proposal, by virtue of the nature of the proposal, certain areas are automatically eliminated because they require, say, a particular volume of water which is not available, and therefore they are out, or if the industry must be located on the sea, then inland sites are out, and so various other factors operate to eliminate a great many places.  In regard to those places that would qualify, there are available from the Industrial Development Authority details, and in some cases very advanced and up-to-date brochures, about different areas and these are brought to the attention of the industrialist who usually chooses four or five of them and goes to visit and inspect some of them in the particular category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister direct the attention of the Minister for Health to the new problem that is arising as a result of the, I admit, unavoidable delay in providing accommodation? As we provide the new accommodation, these institutions prefer to take children at an early age, when they can be adapted to institutional treatment, with the result that children who have been waiting for admission for four, five or six years, are now finding it virtually impossible to get vacancies because the institutions feel they can best serve afflicted children by getting them at four or five years of age and so recoil from the responsibility of accepting children at eight, nine, ten or 11 years of age. Would the Minister consider giving local authorities, who are faced with the responsibility of accommodating children in the eight to 12 group, special facilities or, otherwise, these children will not be provided for at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree that a substantial effort is being made to provide additional accommodation, but there is arising a new problem.  As the Minister says, the homes prefer to get the children in the three- to five-year-old <Col N="709" /> group because they think they can better provide for them, but there is a growing residue of children who have been waiting four, five and six years for admission and they are now in the eight- to 12-year group.  The homes prefer infants.  In those circumstances, perhaps the Minister would give local authorities, who find themselves in the dilemma of having eight- to 12-year-olds, for whom they have not yet found accommodation, some kind of special facilities so that these children will be got into homes.  It will be a non-recurring problem, we hope.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether help will be given to medical practitioners and health authorities to establish and operate health centres with a view to providing an integrated health and social service in the community; if so, in what form; and what proportion of total health capital costs will be allocated towards providing and equipping health centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Health centres, as distinct from dispensary premises and depots, at which different forms of out-patient care are given, have been provided by health authorities throughout the country.  Grants amounting to two-thirds of the cost were given from the Hospitals Trust Fund towards the capital costs involved and the annual operating costs attract the normal grant payable in respect of health services generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the reorganisation of the general medical service, provision is expected to be made as regards suitable practice premises for participating doctors, including the use of health authority premises where appropriate.  It is intended also to make provision for joint participation by doctors by way of group practice or otherwise.  This kind of development will be encouraged where it would increase the <Col N="711" /> effectiveness of the services from the point of view of patient and doctor.</P>
    <P>I have already told the House that discussions with the profession regarding the reorganisation of this service are still in progress and that I shall announce the result of the discussions as soon as possible.  Until the future pattern has become clearer, it would be premature to attempt to decide on a specific allocation of capital resources towards future accretions to the present number of health centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I cannot disclose the figure which the Deputy is seeking.  It was given to officers of my Department informally by officers of the appropriate British authorities as part of the liaison arrangement which is maintained in this area.  I would ask the Deputy to accept my assurance that it is well below the figure of 10,000 curies monthly which he mentioned in a previous question to me on the same subject. On the subject of the rate or level of discharge, I should point out that measurement of the hazard of low levels of radioactivity is a very complex matter.  The curie is not an <Col N="714" /> absolute index of the danger from radioactivity, since any given number of curies of one radioactive substance could mean a lesser or a greater hazard than the same number of curies of another such substance.</P>
      <P>I should say also that the rate of discharge of radioactive waste in Britain is regulated by reference to the type of radioactive substances being discharged and how these might reach man, and that the levels of discharge are based on the safety recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection.  The British authorities apply very stringent safety standards in the interests of their own population, and in no case have the recommended safety levels been reached.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill, 1968: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This Bill proposes to increase the amount available for grants from £30 million to £40 million and, as Deputy Donegan and other speakers on behalf of this Party have already said, we are in full agreement with the increase and with the encouragement of the industrialisation of the country.  As has already been said by Deputy Donegan, it was, in fact, in the year 1956 that the parent Act was introduced, which is evidence of the fact that in that year the inter-Party Government were in full agreement with the promotion of industries in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to make that perfectly clear because I have a suggestion and a complaint to make about the allocation of moneys for industrial purposes. For example, I believe that grants should be earmarked for certain parts of the country and that those wishing to set up an industry should be told that a grant of x pounds or x hundreds of thousands of pounds is available for an industry in a given area where the manpower and unemployment in the area justify it.  In the past there has <Col N="717" /> not been sufficient persuasion or encouragement exercised on these industrialists to establish industries where they are needed.  That does not mean to say I am in favour of establishing an industry in an entirely unsuitable place, or that I am in favour of browbeating people into setting up an industry in a location where it would not be likely to succeed.  But I think it should be within the competence of the Minister and his advisers to investigate and ascertain what particular type of industry is suitable for a particular area. Having done that, the grant should be made available in that area and in that area only until the need is met.  In this way we would preserve a reasonable distribution of the population throughout the country.  It would prevent the flight from rural districts and the creation of a monster like Dublin city.  If that had been done over the years, I do not think we would now be wasting the time of this House discussing the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill which has become necessary because the people have been driven out of rural Ireland and the provincial towns into the large cities.</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to make is this: when the Government provide, through the Industrial Development Authority and the Grants Board, a substantial sum of money for the provision of a factory or an industry, the Minister, through his agencies, should see to it that the money is wisely spent and is not wasted.  Again, that does not mean I am of the opinion that the Minister should be able to guarantee in advance that there will be no failures and that every industry will succeed.  I do not expect such an unreasonably high standard.  I find in my own town of Cavan that the Grants Board have provided something in the neighbourhood of £200,000&mdash;certainly nearer £200,000 than £100,000&mdash;for the establishment of an industry which never got off the ground.  I am not slandering the industry or doing it any harm.  It is not a case of an industry that may make good if it gets a chance.  This is an industry that was opened within the past two years.  It never employed 50 <Col N="718" /> people.  When I last checked, the number employed was 11.</P>
    <P>I say there is something wrong there. A proper investigation must not have been made into the chances of success of this factory.  Indeed any sort of examination at all must have proved that it was unlikely to succeed.  The operation entailed the import of a partly processed piece of machinery. Some further work was done on it in Cavan and it was exported again.  At any rate, I am not a technical expert in these matters.  It is not for me to go into the reasons why this industry never got off the ground.  Suffice it to say that something in the neighbourhood of £200,000&mdash;as I said, nearer £200,000 than £100,000&mdash;of State money was invested in this concern and it has never given any worthwhile employment.</P>
    <P>Not alone is that a waste of public money but it is bad for the industrial morale of my constituency.  It shakes the confidence of the citizens, and of the general taxpayer in particular, in this type of project.  I believe that some years ago it would have been possible without any trouble to raise in Cavan town a very considerable amount of private capital to set up an industry there.  But I believe that as a result of this effort it would just be impossible to interest the people in investing money in a local industry for the promotion of employment and production. This factory, built largely, I understand, out of public funds, is now a white elephant.  I do not know whether the Government have any control over it, whether the fact they have put this large amount of money into it gives them the right to see to it that it is used for productive purposes and that it gives employment.  If the Government have not that right, they should take that right.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not think it is any interference with private rights for the Government to say: &ldquo;If we are giving you £150,000, we are giving it to you on the understanding that you will go into production in a certain area and give employment, and worthwhile employment, <Col N="719" /> and if it turns out that you never get off the ground&rdquo;&mdash;as happened here&mdash;&ldquo;and you do not give employment, then we reserve the right to make the factory and the works available to another undertaking which will go into production and provide employment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it would not be unreasonable for the Government, the Department and the Minister to compensate the proprietors of the undertaking which failed for properly vouched expenditure &mdash; and I say properly vouched expenditure&mdash;out of their own pockets. I do not think that is an unreasonable proposition.  At the moment it seems to be a dog in the manger operation. The people who are in possession of this white elephant are not giving any worthwhile employment.  Apparently they are not prepared to get out and make way for others who might be prepared to do what they set out to do and failed.  I put it to the House that that is not an unreasonable suggestion.</P>
      <P>I am told that the Minister and his Department have certain rights in respect of factories built out of public funds, but that these rights expire after a number of years.  Is the position then that a factory built largely out of public moneys for the purpose of providing employment and which fails to provide any employment, is to be passed into private hands after a short time to be used for any purpose whatever? If that is the position, I think it is an undesirable state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that all I am asking is that where large sums of public moneys are invested in an undertaking, there should be a duty on the Minister to see to it that that money is wisely spent, in a productive manner, and that it provides employment. I cannot see anything more damaging to the industrial morale of any district than to have an announcement made that a factory is to be established, to raise the hopes of the parents and the young people in the locality that employment will be provided for them at home, to have a grand opening of such an undertaking with ministerial pomp and much publicity, and then for the people of that <Col N="720" /> locality to find that the whole thing was a nasty dream, to find the building literally becoming a derelict site.</P>
    <P>I am against that.  I do not care who is in favour of it.  I do not expect miracles.  I do not even expect the Minister to guarantee that there will be no failures.  I know there must be an occasional failure but at least I would expect that the undertaking would get off the ground, and that at the time when the money was put into it, the building built, and the place opened, there would be a reasonable chance that it would succeed and operate for a reasonable time.  This never happened here and that is what I am against.  I would ask the Minister to make a statement on this kind of thing, to tell the House whether these grants are given without any undertaking being given, and if an undertaking is given, what is the nature of it, and to tell the House whether these grants are given without any rights in favour of the Department to see that the money is wisely spent and properly utilised.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister whether he accepts my suggestion that there should be attached to the giving of these grants an obligation that the money must be properly used and put into productive employment.  I am putting it to the House as a reasonable suggestion that where an undertaking of this nature fails, the Minister should be at liberty to make it available to some other undertaking prepared to provide employment, always compensating the proprietors for properly vouched expenditure.  If there are any repetitions of this nature in the locality from which I come, it will certainly be very bad for the industrial morale of the area.  Not only has there been the one to which I have referred, but there has been another, of which I am sure the Minister is aware, not in my constituency but only 20 miles away. I am glad to have had this opportunity to ventilate the grievance which I personally have and which my immediate constituents have in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the terms and limitations of present Government policy in the matter of industrialisation, we must, of course, support <Col N="721" /> this consolidation measure.  All of us must accept the fact that since this part of the country got some measure of independence, the major failure of all Governments has been a failure to provide adequate employment for our people.  That statement has been made time and time again, but it needs to be accepted on all sides that this is our major failure.  To some extent, we have been the victims of our own propaganda.  In considering the little advances we have made, with now and again one opening of one factory giving employment to 150 people, we must consider the fantastic demand there is for jobs, and must consider that against the puny size of our achievement in the creation of jobs since 1926.  Over that period 2,000 per year is the average.  If this country were run from some other part of the globe, it is doubtful that they would not have done better than 2,000 a year, which cannot be described as progress.</P>
      <P>We appear to jog along with some of the progress of the 20th century but one looks in vain for any improvement which one could say arose from the conscious policy of an Irish Government to make real inroads on the massive problem of unemployment.  Whole stretches of the country are given over to desolation.  Recently I was coming from a Congress of Trade Unions in Killarney and I had occasion to go through a constituency whose only notable point is that it returns strong Fianna Fáil members to the House.  I looked for some traces of concern by those members for that constituency. There was rush grass everywhere.  In the main town of Abbeyfeale, the only thing I saw&mdash;there were no factories, no industries, just a few public houses and a few shops with elderly people and children&mdash;was an advertisement in a store advising people where to go to the emigrants' bureau in England. This could be repeated over many western and south-western constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If our policy depends, as the policies of this Government depend in large degree, on acceptance in full of a private enterprise philosophy, if one accepts its limitations and conducts one's policy of expansion of employment <Col N="722" /> within these limitations, then the achievements of the Stormont régime, with a similar philosophy, are substantially greater in the matter of attraction of employment from outside in recent years.  The Northern Ireland Government have beaten us flat in the kind of industrial development they have got.  Where we can attract factory employment for 50 men or women they opened up factories which will employ 2,000 people.  Our local papers, the local cumanns, and so on, herald the news when we get one small branch factory open.  In Northern Ireland, basing most of their expansion on this kind of policy, they have done far better.  In this part of the country, we are the victims of our own propaganda. What the Sunday Press tells us has been achieved in industry, the promises of employment, and so on, we are apt to believe.</P>
    <P>In this matter of aid to and adaptation of industry, to some extent I think, within the limitations I have referred to, our role, if we cannot convert the Government on major issues, is to study improvements on the methods they are at present using which we do not believe give us the answer to the huge unemployment problem facing us. We are too prone to think that this help to industry must be vested purely in machinery and plant.  We do not understand fully, I think, the crucial importance of the various people operating these industries.  It is crucially important that management make correct decisions.  It is crucially important in the area of training, to have the right technicians.  It is crucially important to understand that many of the mistakes in industry have been caused by the complete omnipotence of the office.  The office says &ldquo;This shall be done&rdquo; without any real understanding or consultation with the people in charge of production in the different elements, the foreman and so on.  This is reflected elsewhere in our society.</P>
    <P>We have this complete adulation of the white-collar authority that is vested in the power of ownership of a company. There is too little regard for the practical man on the shop floor, for the technician in our industry.  Our wage structure leans to the administrative <Col N="723" /> side.  The attitude is that the administrative grades must get the major award without recognising that the technological side of our industry should get the real rewards.  There are fitters much more important than managing directors.</P>
    <P>We realise that our economic future will be dominated by exports.  Most of our optimism stems from imagining that we shall preserve our export market.  A lot of the export achievement of Irish industry exists&mdash;this is not merely my statement; <i>Challenge,</i> the recent booklet of the Federation of Irish Industries recently brought out this point&mdash;and can continue only with the aid of the present kinds of tax incentives we give them.  Without such assistance they are not an economic proposition.  Many firms that export depend for their profit on the home market.  As a result of the recent Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, the home market can no longer be secure in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, probably in Killarney, made the disturbing statement that, by 1971, one-third of our home market would be gone.  That means that 50,000 jobs would be gone and there is also the problem to be kept in mind of the attraction of industrialists from abroad.  It is vitally important that our industrial arm be strengthened but, in our Party, we do not have any great faith that present Government policies for expansion will have any marked effect in the future. This is not pessimism.  Considering our attempts at industrial expansion in the past, relving on classical private enterprise principles which have not done this country much good in the expansion of industry and which have not cut any ice in regard to unemployment figures, we do not see that present Government policies can help to any significant degree.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a certain statement.  We shall go farther and say we think that, where taxpayers' money is involved in a private firm, most certainly there must be a sharing of decisions between the State and that firm.  It is too rich altogether to see taxpayers' money taken and passed <Col N="724" /> into the hands of private shareholders in a company and, from that point on, to lose track of the exact effects and results of this money.  Ways must be explored to ensure that there is a share in decision-making from the point where the firm takes taxpayers' money.  This is pretty fair.</P>
    <P>If I am hard up for cash to extend my firm and if the State gives it, then, from then on, the State must have a share in the decisions.</P>

      <P>I am saying that Fianna Fáil policies as operated at present, do not work.  However, Fianna Fáil may continue with their expensive policies.  That is their business&mdash;so long as they are in Government.  So long as Fianna Fáil are left there, they are entitled to make their mistakes on behalf of the people.  Our function is, to the best of our ability, to refer to those mistakes.  When cash goes into the hands of an industrialist from abroad for the purpose of setting up a business here, is sufficient check made that the money is used for the purposes for which it was requested? I am aware of the position in which many industrialists coming in from abroad to set up industries suddenly spread into the hotel business.  We have found that one industrialist who came in here to manufacture a particular product, suddenly, a year or two later, began to carve out a whole section of the hotel industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We understand that industrialists come from abroad to make money here, and if they bring something we lack as well as give employment, that is acceptable as a bargain.  They come for profit, and we allow them to do so, so that we may gain employment and skills we do not have, but I question the wisdom of allowing industrialists to come here and set up industries, and in a year or two, to acquire Irish assets that we should be operating ourselves.  The example of a foreign industrialist coming here to manufacture certain products and then branching out into the hotel industry is an indictment of the present policy. I think that in the case of any foreign industrialist coming here to set up an industry, Ireland is the loser in the long run, although we may gain employment <Col N="726" /> in the short run.  Everything we sell at present we will lose in the future.  It may be good for the election records to say we have created so many new jobs but we must consider the future of these jobs and that industry. In the long run, how much money is lost to the country when Irish land is sold, Irish property sold to foreign enterprises, and what is, in the long run, the loss or gain to the country?</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of this matter which we must seek to see developed in Irish industry is marketing. I share the concern of others in the House about whether in fact before foreign industrialists set up here, we make sufficient investigation to ensure that there are export markets for the activity in which they wish to engage. We must give serious consideration to this.  If there is taxpayers' money involved and if, as at present, we have little control over the use of that money once we give it to the foreign company, it is all the more important that our preliminary investigation should be as foolproof as possible. Also, when we bring in foreign industrialists, our minimum request should be that they will understand that in this country people have the right to organise in trade organisations to protect their own living standards and that we have here gone to a good deal of trouble for 50, 60 or 100 years back &mdash;even to the time of Daniel O'Connell, when there were certain combinations in Dublin&mdash;to give this right to our people against British rulers and against native Irish employers, the right of ordinary people to organise in trade unions.  We do not want the type of industrialist here who wishes to change this system.</P>
    <P>A long time before the State was founded Arthur Griffith propounded this philosophy that all we were interested in was industrial expansion and that wage standards and living conditions of the people involved in this industrial expansion did not count.  Our Party has never sympathised with this viewpoint.  We believe that the human factor, the wages paid and the living standards achieved, are extremely important and foreign industrialists <Col N="727" /> coming in here must understand that this country is not in Europe the haven for low wages and that we do not seek to industrialise our country at the expense of low living standards for Irish men and women.</P>
    <P>I suggest also that in setting up new industries, it is very important to make a thorough examination of the area in which the industry is to be sited. Planking a factory in the middle of green fields, without worrying whether housing is available locally and whether the social infrastructure is available, is not sound policy because it is these things that decide in the long run whether the factory is an artificial institution or whether it can survive and expand.  This is especially true where women are employed in a newly-established industry.  Unless you can have a normal community associated with the employment source, you will not build up a permanent work force, but instead you will have a factory to give workers pocket-money which will enable them to take the boat to some other country.  I suggest that there are many factories in the south and west of the country that exist on a continuous influx of workers from surrounding areas, who work for two or three years before getting sufficient money to go to Britain or elsewhere.  They will not remain.  It is not the amount they are paid that is the chief problem but the social setting in which they have to work.</P>
    <P>In the past we thought&mdash;I suppose it is still true&mdash;that one area of the country by comparison with others could be described as underdeveloped. We must examine this whole problem afresh.  There are parts of West Wicklow that are just as underdeveloped as the wildest parts of Mayo or other places in the West.  We must consider what we mean by underdeveloped.  I suggest that a better term for parts of the country as they exist, with their population conditions and the type of activity, would be emergency areas.  I would say that emergency areas from the national point of view are those areas where there is no employment to be had and where the majority of the <Col N="728" /> population are becoming increasingly an elderly group and where the population structure of the community is impaired and abnormal.  I suggest that in much of rural Ireland at present we have abnormal conditions and communities where we have elderly people and young children, with none of the vital generations in between.</P>
    <P>Social scientists are coming more and more to realise that, where you have whole communities so abnormally constituted in their population structure that we can expect no leadership and no initiative, and consequently no industrial expansion, there is no answer to such a situation. Therefore I suggest that the term &ldquo;emergency areas&rdquo; is a more apt term to describe such places where there is no activity, places which are practically an extension of the local cemetery. On my recent journey from Killarney, I passed through West Limerick, a most woebegone part of the country, with great emigration and no industry and no hope for the young people, a point of departure for places abroad.  That is how I would describe West Limerick, and although it may continue to return Fianna Fáil Deputies forever, it is an abnormal community, with no possibility of the young people marrying and settling down to live there as they should.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with this Bill.  It may effect some slight improvement in the manner in which he at present places his faith in industrial expansion.  If his colleagues and he remain in Government for another ten years, he will be able to cite statistics to show we did better in employment creation in 1970 than in 1969, but, by and large, the picture will remain the same.  The policies pursued by the Government represent an attempt to hit a moving target, the moving target of people looking for jobs and the policies of the Minister's Government are unable to create a situation in which we shall have sufficient jobs for all the people needing them.</P>
    <P>The viewpoint of my Party is&mdash;it would take a larger discussion than this to open up the area&mdash;that the situation demands more than reliance <Col N="729" /> on foreign enterprise and native enterprise and that we should involve the State itself in bringing about the expansion needed to employ and maintain our people.</P>

      <P>In the earlier part of this debate, I was criticised for not mentioning when introducing the Bill a number of items which were considered to be relevant to industrial development.  Of course the reason I did not do so was that this is a relatively simple Bill.  The effect of it is simply to increase the total amount of capital which may be allocated to An Foras Tionscal, from the existing statutory maximum of £30 million to a new maximum of £40 million.  The detailed discussion on the whole policy of industrialisation would, I think, be more appropriate on the Estimate for my Department and on the legislation which will be brought forward, as I have announced, in connection with changes in our industrialisation policy. However, there are some matters which were mentioned and on which I think I must comment.</P>
      <P>First, I suspect that Deputy O'Leary and a number of his colleagues in his Party have become so blinded by their own propaganda&mdash;he was talking about our being blinded by our propaganda&mdash;that they do not realise what is happening in this country.  I suggest that there are not very many members of the Deputy's Party who realise that we have, in fact, between 1961 and 1966, over that five-year period, created an average of 12,000 new jobs in industry each year.  I do not blame him for not having been aware of this some time ago because the statistics available did not reveal this until they were collected some time after 1966.  The only year for which we have any kind of detailed analysis for grant aid to industry is 1966.  Grant-aided firms established up to the end of 1966 accounted for, in 1966, an output of £50.9 million, including exports of £37.7 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody charged with the actual responsibility of this knows that there are limits to the kind of conditions one can impose.  We would prefer that a foreign industry coming in here would work exactly in accordance with the way we would like it to work and that we would have an absolute guarantee of success.  There are all sorts of conditions one would like to impose, and this is grand in theory, but in practice we are trying to provide employment for our people and what we can get becomes the practical thing and the practical thing is to get reasonable conditions.</P>
      <P>The question was asked about what safeguards exist in regard to industries coming in and getting assistance.  The safeguards are operated between An Foras Tionscal and the industrial promoters concerned and every effort is made by An Foras Tionscal to ensure that conditions are satisfactory. One safeguard is that the factory premises and fixed assets may not be sold or disposed of in any other way for a period of ten years from the completion of the payment of the grant, without the consent of An Foras Tionscal.  In practice, what this usually means is that if a grant-aided factory closes down, another firm comes along and takes over the premises, and the grant is passed on from the first firm to the second firm, so that the one grant is paid in respect of the one premises.  This is how it normally works in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned that there are changes on the way in regard to our approach to incentives and other matters, and legislation will be introduced shortly in this regard.  Therefore I do not want to go into too much detail on this Bill.  Some of the changes are being made as a result of certain reports that have been produced on these matters and full information <Col N="738" /> will be available to Deputies shortly in regard to these reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of them. There seemed to be a suggestion in the debate that preference is given in regard to assistance to foreign firms as against home firms.  This is just not true.  One of the reasons why the idea may be common is, I think, that a new industry qualifies, of course, for a higher rate of grant.  In the case of the setting up of a new industry, the industry qualifies for an industrial grant, whereas an existing industry, which was expanding, used to qualify for an adaptation grant only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only sometimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of them did.  There were certain qualifications. The basis for these adaptation grants was to assist industries to prepare for free trade.  Those, therefore, not deemed likely to be subjected to extra competition in free trade did not qualify.  But the House will remember that I announced a new scheme of re-equipment grants at the level of 25 per cent in most of the country and 35 per cent in the undeveloped areas which will be available for all firms, whether Irish or foreign, in respect of expansion or modernisation.  These are on a continuing basis, not like adaptation grants which had a limitation in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are all industries included in that?  The information is pretty scanty.  If an industry here is re-equipping itself or expanding, it automatically qualifies for a re-equipment grant.  The practice in the North of Ireland is that, if you buy new machinery or if you extend your buildings, you automatically qualify and you are paid 25 per cent, or 40 per cent, or whatever the figure is.  To date here, you certainly did not automatically qualify, and I now want to know does this include every industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Laundries, bakeries and so on were all ineligible.  The reason given in the case of bakeries was that they were too near the Border and could not survive the competition from the North, which is the exact opposite of what the Minister says now.</P>

      <P>The point was made by a number of speakers about the development of industrial growth centres. One or two Deputies, in fact, took both sides of the argument.  They said they were in favour of industrial growth centres and, on the other hand, they were against them because they thought they would take away industry from the surrounding towns.  Of course, this is one of the problems on which one has to make up one's mind.  By the setting up of an industrial growth centre, one can direct some industries, which might otherwise go to individual towns, but I also believe that one can direct industries which would not otherwise go to the country at all. Furthermore, I believe that the development of these centres can lead to the growth of complementary industries in the manufacture of components and the provision of services in the surrounding areas, and at a fairly considerable radius from the centres themselves, and, on balance, if we are to make any really effective impact on the unemployment problem, <Col N="741" /> we have got to pursue the development of growth centres vigorously.</P>
      <P>The House is aware that, apart from the industrial estates already in existence in Shannon, Waterford and Galway, in the Limerick-Clare-North Tipperary area, the Shannon Development Company is being given responsibility for the promotion of industry in that entire region.  It is proposed then to divide the rest of the country into regions and set up regional offices of the IDA in the areas, with the same kind of responsibilities.  The fixing of other regions must depend on the Buchanan Report, which is expected fairly soon and which will be considered by the Government as soon as it is received.</P>
      <P>A great deal of play was made about the necessity to develop industry, small industry particularly, in the towns and villages.  I must say I was a little taken aback, listening to some of the Deputies&mdash;they were not all on the Opposition benches&mdash;because some of them apparently had never heard of the small industries programme.  Somebody accused me of not giving it enough publicity, and, if that is so, it would appear the criticism was justified, but, whatever about the ordinary public, I would have hoped that Deputies would be aware of the existence of the small industries programme, which is at present operating in Limerick, Clare, Sligo, Leitrim-Roscommon and Carlow-Kilkenny, plus the other counties in which there is a county development team.  The manner in which it is operating has certainly given hope that it can be a very important instrument in dealing with the provision of employment in small towns and villages throughout the country, and I hope it will be possible before the end of the year to extend it to the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that, in talking about the problem of industrialisation and the creating of new jobs, we, in the Government, are not inhibited by any doctrinaire approach and, broadly speaking, we are operating on the basis of (1) the attraction of foreign industry here; (2) the expansion of existing Irish industry and the encouragement of the setting up of new <Col N="742" /> industries by Irish people; (3) the expansion of the activities of the State companies and (4) the small industries programme.</P>
    <P>In connection with the expansion of the activities of the State companies, I want to make it clear that in so far as I could do so, I have made it clear to the various State companies with which I have any contact that they are expected to examine very closely the possibilities that may exist for diversification of their activites or the utilisation of expertise and particular technical skill and knowledge which they may have within their ranks for the purpose of developing new industry. It has been made clear that in so far as this can be done, money will not be an obstacle in the development of this kind of employment.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, be realised that more and more as one talks of the establishment of substantial industries, that is, fairly large-scale as regards employment and production, one is talking of very substantial investment and very substantial investment per worker engaged.  This is inevitable. With the growth in our economy, the area left in which substantial employment can be created in any one particular plant is such that they are fairly sophisticated operations which are capital intensive.  We have to recognise that that is so.  There are areas of activity open to the State companies but I think there are also some fairly substantial and very worthwhile industrial projects in the pipeline at the moment in consultation with foreign interests but, again, this Government are not dogmatic or doctrinaire in this regard.  We are prepared to contemplate any kind of arrangement, whether completely foreign-owned, partially foreign-owned and partially privately Irish-owned or a partnership between an Irish State company and a foreign company or a partnership between an Irish State company and private interests. We have no doctrinaire views on this.  The thing we are concerned with is the creation of new jobs and we are prepared to adopt any of these methods in order to do it.  The only test we want to apply is, is it effective?</P>
    <P>It is true that nobody would claim <Col N="743" /> that the operation of our policy has been 100 per cent effective in the sense that we have not got 100 per cent employment but it would be very unrealistic to suggest that because we have not achieved that aim our policies are a failure.  To get a true picture, one must look at the performance in recent years, look at the trend and see if the policy we are pursuing is getting reasonably good results and whether by stepping up that policy and carrying out certain activities on the lines I have indicated one could not achieve a much greater performance than by scrapping the whole policy and approaching the problem on some completely different basis, such as has been hinted at by Deputy O'Leary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">

      <P>Would the Minister mind if I reminded him that we certainly do not seem to be getting the results as far as the west of Ireland is concerned?  People are still leaving the land.  I cannot see any results in Mayo, particularly.  I do not want to embarrass the Minister in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No; the Deputy is not embarrassing me.  I am much more concerned with the actual pattern of what is happening than with theoretical ideas of what might happen, and I think the Deputy is also concerned with the facts of what the situation is in Mayo.  It is quite true to say that the amount of new industrial employment in Mayo in recent years has been relatively very small.  It is quite true to say that.  There are a number of factors, of course, which have been operating in this.  I believe that one of the important factors with regard to Mayo and many areas in the West of Ireland has been the freight charges. From my discussions with industrialists there and people interested in setting up industries there, I am satisfied that this is an important factor.  We are trying to find a solution to that.  It is not nearly as simple as it looks.  It is not merely a question of a straight subsidy because this would cause a flow into Dublin Port, clogging up there, and it would not be of any benefit to the West.  We are trying to work out something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> Another problem has been that there has been far too much dependence, in my opinion, on the idea of somebody waving a magic wand&mdash;whether it be the Minister for Industry and Commerce or a local Deputy or the IDA or somebody else&mdash;and producing out of thin air a nice big shiny American factory.  There has been far too much dependence on that idea when a great deal of the possibilities were being overlooked, the possibilities of existing small industries&mdash;nothing spectacular about it.  The development of small industries in some parts of Mayo could very substantially contribute, I believe, to the provision of worthwhile jobs in Mayo for people living there.  I do not say it is the full solution but I do say that the potential involved has not been by any means explored fully yet.</P>
    <P>I also think that the regionalisation programme in connection with the IDA which I have announced should help very substantially because in whatever region that, say, Mayo will be located, there will be a central office of the IDA; there will be, I hope, a complete integration of all the local bodies, both the local authorities and voluntary bodies, who are interested in the development of industry in the area; a co-ordination of their efforts and a concentration, even in publicity, on that particular region and on the advantages of that region, to the exclusion of all other regions of the country, as well as which the activities, say, of the local authority in connection with the provision of water and housing will, I hope, be geared much more directly to the industrial development of the region.  I am just mentioning these offhand as factors which I think have operated in the past against the provision of industrial employment in Mayo and some other factors which will operate in future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one other point that was raised by Deputy Treacy in regard to a particular firm.  He was talking about the lack of assistance from myself and <Col N="745" /> my Department and the agencies operating under me in this case.  He said that all that was required was an injection of capital in this firm.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that you could take the most bankrupt undertaking in the country and say, very simply, that all that is required is an injection of capital but there is a great deal more required in a bankrupt concern than just an injection of capital.  The Deputy knows that there were many other factors in the case to which he was referring.  Some of them have been eliminated; some of them are in process of being eliminated at the moment.  Until those things were eliminated, there were faults of management and costing there which were such that unless they were eliminated, no matter what capital you put in, you would be pouring it down the drain.  Therefore, it was not just a question of more capital.  I think the Deputy is aware of the very strenuous efforts made by me and my Department and the Industrial Development Authority to locate abroad possible alternative sources for taking over this factory and carrying it on on a viable basis.  None of these efforts was successful, but this does not mean the efforts were not made.  In fact, very strenuous efforts were made over a fairly long period.</P>
    <P>I would not like it to be thought that there was any industry in this country which found itself in difficulty and which felt no effort would be made by either the Minister or the Department of Industry and Commerce or the agencies operating under them to assist.  In the particular case to which Deputy Treacy referred, it would not be true to say that no effort was made to assist.  As I have said, the fact that the efforts to obtain people abroad to take over were not successful is not a reflection on the efforts made out rather a reflection on the condition of the particular industry. Circumstances which have occurred in that factory now, while they have not solved the problem, have certainly made it much more easy of solution. There is a certain proposition under consideration at the moment in relation <Col N="746" /> to it, and the Deputy can be assured that in so far as I can do anything to assist in that regard, it will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for interrupting the Minister, but may I simply ask him this?  He is aware that a new company has now been formed in respect of the industry concerned, and of the local effort made by the chamber of commerce to raise capital. My regret was that the Minister in those circumstances did not more speedily come to the aid of the firm concerned.  I express the hope that this help will be speedy, because time is not on the side of the firm.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recent developments, but the Deputy knows that what he and I have been talking about has been going on for six months at least, and perhaps longer, and that the developments he is now referring to have occurred only within the past month or month and a half.  I do not think I need detain the House any further.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress, I had given the reasons which prompted me to table this amendment to the Government's Bill.  I had explained to the House that it was the interests of greater efficiency and greater stability which had motivated me.  I agreed with the Government in the principle of what they were trying to achieve but said I did not believe at this moment the people were prepared to accept the straight vote.  Because this could only result in defeat <Col N="748" /> in the referendum and a stop to all reform, I felt the Government would do well to compromise and to accept my amendment, which I feel would be acceptable to most of the people.</P>
      <P>If the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party reject my amendment, they will live to regret this decision.  I believe, in, and agree with, the necessity to reform the Constitution&mdash;it is in the national interest that we should do so &mdash;but I do not believe as of now that the public are prepared to accept the straight vote, quite regardless of its merits.  To proceed with the straight vote can only result in a defeat for the Government and a continuance of the present unsatisfactory system, with all its faults.  I suspect that some of those on the Fianna Fáil backbenches who are encouraging the Minister to persist in his folly are not really interested in reform at all and merely want the present system to continue and that they want to continue in the mediocre security they are in at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Fine Gael Party, if they are rejecting this amendment for purely Party purposes, are cutting their own throats.  The signs are, for those who can read them, that the Fine Gael Party are no longer fulfilling any political need.  The Labour Party are catering for some section of the trade union vote.  Fianna Fáil, on the other hand are catering for another section of the trade union vote and, because they are a broadly-based Party, are catering for most other sections of the community.  Being in office, of course, they are operating from a position of power.  I do not think Fine Gael can ever expect under the PR system to win an election on their own and become the alternative Government.  The most they can hope for is a coalition and, however sad and disappointing it may be for them, nobody wants to coalesce with them.  There may be one or two members of the Labour Party who would like to see themselves Ministers but I do not believe the Party as a whole will be prepared to coalesce with Fine Gael; nor indeed after the broadcast of the Labour Party candidate for Dublin South-East on television the other night, in which he mentioned a whole list of industries <Col N="749" /> and factories and gave specific cases, do I think such a coalition would be particularly acceptable to the bulk of Fine Gael supporters.</P>
