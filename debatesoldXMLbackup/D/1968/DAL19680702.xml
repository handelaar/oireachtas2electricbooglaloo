    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have any immediate plans to provide emergency supplies to relieve starvation and malnutrition throughout the undeveloped world; and, if so, if he will give details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In each of the past two years, the Government have contributed over £1 million to international organisations concerned with aiding developing countries and relieving hunger and malnutrition in those countries and it is our declared policy to increase this flow of aid according as our own economic capacity grows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards emergency aid, the Deputy will be aware that it was announced on Friday last that the Government are providing an additional £100,000 for the purpose of sending emergency supplies to help relieve distress in Nigeria, particularly <Col N="2" /> in the Eastern area.  I might also mention that within the past month, in response to an urgent appeal by the United Nations and the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the Government have offered to send £10,000 worth of skim-milk powder to help feed refugees in the Middle East.  We also made special contributions totalling about £18,000 to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees and the United Nations Children's Fund for emergency aid for refugees in that area following the outbreak of hostilities there in 1967.  These latter contributions were additional to our normal annual contributions to those organisations.</P>
    <P>A proportion of the resources of the World Food Programme, to which we are currently contributing cash and foodstuffs to the value of £200,000 per annum, is used by the Programme authorities for emergency feeding purposes <Col N="3" /> and part of the food which we supply each year under our pledge to the Programme is used in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say what agency is being used to provide emergency supplies to Nigeria and Biafra?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has another question down to which this would probably be more appropriate and relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be correct in assuming that the Red Cross is the main agency used by the Government in all these contributions given by the Government, apart from one or two direct contributions to some of the subsidiary bodies of the United Nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree with me that, while it is an excellent and desirable thing to contribute from such abundance as we dispose of to relieve starvation and malnutrition throughout the world, the most important contribution towards the resolution of that problem is the contribution of trained personnel to teach the people in these areas how to produce the food necessary to feed themselves, which can be done if modern methods of irrigation, fertilisation and seed provision are employed?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will agree that that will not solve the immediate problem in Biafra?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is referring to the subject matter of Deputy Corish's general question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not this sort of assistance organised by the United Nations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give details of the countries of origin, together with the quantity and value in each case, of motor cars and lorries imported into the State during each of the years 1946 to 1967 and up to the latest available date in 1968.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the available relevant data for each year 1965 to 1967 and for the period January-March, 1968.</P>
      <P>All the data available for earlier years have already been published and are shown in the annual Trade and Shipping Statistics Reports, copies of which are available in the Library. Over such a relatively long period of years there have been some changes in the headings under which the imports have been brought to account.</P>

The quota for Irish emigrants for each of these years was 17,756.

      <P>The Government are keenly aware of the sufferings of the people affected by the conflict in Nigeria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two months ago, Cumann Croise Deirge na hÉireann gave £5,000 in cash from the Emergency Relief Fund to the International Committee of the Red <Col N="17" /> Cross to help the victims of the Nigerian conflict.</P>
    <P>On 28th June, the Government informed Cumann Croise Deirge na hÉireann that they are making available to it an additional contribution of £100,000 for the purchase of food and medicines in Ireland for despatch to Nigeria, and particularly to the distressed districts in the Eastern area.  It is to be hoped that these supplies can be delivered before long but at present delivery by boat to Port Harcourt is not feasible.</P>
    <P>The Government hope that the Committee's appeal for subscriptions and gifts for this purpose will continue to meet with a generous response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May we assume from what the Taoiseach has said that the position as described by the Minister for External Affairs last week in regard to delivery is still the same?  Is there any breakthrough in the matter of delivering these food supplies to Biafra or any other part of Nigeria where people are starving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The delivery system is much the same as the Minister mentioned last week.  The International Committee of the Red Cross are operating on both sides, in the Federal area and the Biafran area, and they have certain means of getting supplies in.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lagos authorities have permitted supplies to <Col N="18" /> be delivered to Biafra through Lagos, but subject to their inspection.  I think it is generally known that the Biafran people are not satisfied with this inspection because they have certain fears of what might happen the food, but I do not think it would be possible to ensure any better system than inspection by the Lagos authorities of supplies going into Biafra.  However, in the meantime there are other means of getting supplies into Biafra which are obviously acceptable to the Biafran people.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach or the Department of External Affairs considered the desirability of channelling some of the aid through other relief organisations than the International Red Cross?  I understand that a body such as Caritas Internationale is acceptable to the Biafrans and that there is a likelihood that it would be easier to channel some of the relief through that rather than through the International Red Cross.</P>

Could he give any indication to the House that this relief which is so urgently needed in Biafra to avert starvation will get any further than Federal Nigeria itself?  There does not appear to be any definite information that there is a corridor of communication between the two parts of the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have answered that already.  It is true that <Col N="19" /> much of the supplies came via Lisbon originally, but, as I said in reply to Deputy Corish and Deputy Cosgrave, the International Red Cross and Caritas International have their own means of direct delivery.  I have no doubt that the supplies we are making available are arriving where they are most needed.  I am not suggesting they are earmarked only for Biafra; they are for relief of hunger and hardship on both sides.</P>

Does he not consider it possible for our representative in Nigeria, who is in residence, I understand, in Lagos, to endeavour to ensure that this very much needed supply of food to the starving millions in Biafra will be looked after by him and will get into the country, because there is no guarantee at the moment it will go any further than Nigeria?</P>

However, following the publication of the Government's first Programme for Economic Expansion confidence was gradually restored to the building industry and to local authorities.  This restoration has enabled the Government to increase its provision for housing from State capital budgets from a total of £7.3 million in 1958-59 to an estimated £28.81 million in the current financial year, and to pay a further £12 million approximately in subsidies this year mostly for <Col N="27" /> those unable to afford the full cost of their housing&mdash;as against just over £5 million in 1958-59.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate as much as anyone the difficulties of young persons setting out to purchase their homes.  The problems referred to by the Deputy are kept under constant review by my Department and, despite the difficulties involved, appropriate action is taken as required.</P>
      <P>Discussions are held from time to time with building societies and other agencies.</P>
      <P>I would however draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the total number of new house grants allocated by my Department in 1967-68 was an alltime record.  This shows that despite the difficulties more persons than ever before are succeeding in buying their own homes.</P>
      <P>In regard to deposits and what the Deputy terms &ldquo;the difficulty of raising loans&rdquo;, I would refer him to my recent announcement of increases of £200 or £300 according to area, in limits applicable to local authority house purchase loans.  All local authorities and, so far as I am aware, the principal commercial agencies are at present accepting loan application for new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as interest rates are concerned, the rate of 7½ per cent currently charged by local authorities generally for house purchase loans <Col N="29" /> represents a reduction of ¾ per cent on the rate charged by authorities during the period from November, 1966 to June, 1967.</P>

It is also correct to say that scrap metal dealers as a class must be licensed by the court and must keep exact records. I am aware that there is another class of people who buy and collect these things.  These are the tinkers who are very difficult to control.  They are not licensed although, strictly speaking, I imagine they should be.</P>

It is under examination by various bodies in this country, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is also under consideration by the International Labour Organisation.

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy, which presumably relates to incomes as assessed for tax purposes, is not available. Certain surtax statistics have, however, been extracted for the year of assessment 1966-67 which show that, as at 31st August, 1967, there were 1,818 persons assessed to surtax whose total incomes as defined for purposes of that tax exceeded £6,000 and 1,243 persons whose total incomes exceeded £7,000. The income assessable to surtax for 1966-67 would to a great extent have arisen in the preceding year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the percentage increases between 1963 and 1968 (a) in the personal allowance for single persons for income tax purposes and (b) in the maximum deduction for the remuneration of a director controlled company for corporation profits tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) There has been no change in the personal allowance for a single person in the period referred to by the Deputy.  (b) Over the same period, when regard is had to the increase proposed in section 27 of the Finance Bill, 1968, the limit on deductions for corporation profits tax purposes in respect of remuneration of directors of director controlled companies has been increased by 166? per cent.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that there is no basis for comparing the personal allowances for income tax purposes and the limit referred to.  This latter limit merely affects the amount of corporation profits tax paid by a director controlled company.  Any remuneration received by a director of such a company is chargeable to income tax and surtax in his hands in the ordinary way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the fact that the 1966 recession in the building industry reduced employment by 5,000, he will now investigate the use of a more flexible public capital programme to counteract rather than reinforce the instability which hinders this vital industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A reduction in activity in the building and construction industry in 1966 followed on the action taken, by the adjustment of the public capital programme and otherwise, to reduce the excessive demand that had built up in the economy and was leading to a balance of payments deficit of the order of £50 million in 1965.  As was pointed out in relation to building and construction in the White Paper on Public Capital Expenditure (Pr. 8562) which was laid before each House of the Oireachtas in October, 1965&mdash;</P>
      <P>Even if balance of payments difficulties had not arisen, the recent rate of expansion could not have been maintained.  Some regulatory action would have been needed to ensure that building outlay, by expanding at an excessive rate, did not react unfavourably on the availability of capital for other headings of the public capital programme and for the private sector.</P>
      <P>When the remedial measures had become effective the Government took action to maintain the level of building activity generated by the public sector by increasing the allocation for housing and ancillary services in the 1966-67 public capital programme by £1.5 million over the budget estimate for the year.  The budget provision for 1967-68 showed an increase of £3½ million or 10 per cent, on 1966-67 expenditure and during the year 1967-68 additional allocations for housing and ancillary services and for secondary school buildings were made so that, in the event, expenditure on building and construction in the public capital programme in 1967-68 exceeded the 1966-67 expenditure by £6½ million, or more than 18 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public capital programme, particularly <Col N="58" /> the building sector of it, involves commitments for years ahead and cannot be regarded as possessing any great deal of flexibility.  It is exceedingly difficult, and may be wasteful, to reduce the programme at short notice and financial policy can realistically be concerned only with the stabilising or controlling the rate of expansion of the programme.  The Government action I have mentioned illustrates this point.</P>

    <P>The increase in the expenditure is due in the main to the necessity to <Col N="60" /> lease office accommodation in Dublin for the staffs of various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that because of the establishment of new services and the extension of others coupled with the fact that some old buildings which had been in use as offices did not conform to statutory standards all of the additional space which has been acquired is essential.</P>
    <P>As I stated when introducing the Estimate for Public Works and Buildings for 1966-67 the alternative to the renting of space in new buildings would be that the State would design and erect its own buildings.  While that would undoubtedly be the ideal solution of our accommodation problem the amount of capital required to carry through such a programme would be enormous.  In recent and present circumstances, it could be made available only at the expense of vital services. Clearly, then, the only practical solution to the problem though not, as I have indicated, the ideal one, lies in the renting of space in modern office blocks constructed by private enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 4, line 15, to delete &ldquo;seven shillings in the pound&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two shillings and ninepence in respect of the first £100 of taxable income, five shillings and sixpence in respect of the second £100 of taxable income and seven shillings in respect of any further taxable income.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 1 provides that income tax shall be chargeable for the coming year at the rate of 7/- in the £.  The situation, as I recall it, was that up to 1959 it was the practice to have a reduced rate of tax chargeable on the first £100 of taxable income.  At that stage the rate on the first £100 was 2/9d, on the second £100 of taxable income, 5/6d, and from that on, 7/-.  In 1959 that system was altered to provide a flat rate of tax in relation to all portions of taxable income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe everybody appreciates that the burden of income tax today is no longer the cross borne by those who used to be regarded as well off and in the moneyed classes.  Income tax is a very definite known burden to thousands of workers who find the impact of the tax affecting their weekly take-home pay.  It should be borne in mind that the personal allowance has not been changed since 1960 or 1961. The allowance in respect of a married <Col N="70" /> person has remained at £394 up to the slight alteration which the Minister proposes in this Bill.  With the fall in the value of money and in the case of personal allowances at the rate they have been, a situation has been reached in which a very heavy burden is being borne by the people who are earning the smallest amount of taxable income. I would urge the Minister to consider this matter favourably and to accept this amendment.  It would be restoring the position which used to obtain and I think it would give relief where relief is certainly needed.</P>

Furthermore, I wish, once again, to deplore the glib manner in which the Minister in his Budget Statement, and again on the Second Stage of this Bill, a fortnight ago, endeavoured to give the impression that the surtax relief being brought in was one solely for the benefit of technological executives.  It is a relief which is as much for the benefit of shopkeepers, professional men and Dáil Deputies as it is for technological executives.  If the Minister <Col N="71" /> wished to bring in a surtax relief for technological executives, and encourage their employment in industry, he could bring in a relief which could be confined to technological executives. There are far more urgent priorities in the matter of personal allowances and reliefs than relief for surtax payers, great and all as their need may be. The Minister has no comment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 4, line 30, to delete &ldquo;industrial&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section, as Deputies will recall, seeks to implement the relief and the concession provided, or indicated by the Minister in his Budget Statement, to deal with know-how &mdash; this awful new word &mdash; and the purpose of the section is quite clear.  It is to give tax concession in relation to the use of know-how in industry.  With the amendment which I propose, the section would read:</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; means information and techniques likely to assist in the manufacture or processing of goods or materials, or in the carrying out of any agricultural, forestry, fishing, mining or other extractive operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter of know-how and the development of research facilities for industry and for the commercial life of the country generally has been referred to in the Report on Science in Irish Economic Development and it appears from the information covered in that report that at present 76 per cent of industry, by output, does not in fact carry that under research or development. The research and development which in fact are carried on are mainly concentrated in the brewing and confectionery industries and they account for some 50 per cent of industrial research and development.  That report states that with regard to these industries, <Col N="72" /> brewing and confectionery, the present excise regulations are constraints on modern maintenance and technological development.  In other words, the report makes the case that in the category of industry where most is being spent on development, the benefit is not reaped because of our excise regulations.  I raised this matter by way of Parliamentary Question on 12th June; it is reported in volume No. 234, No. 7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that to some extent it is overlapping, but, in relation to know-how, my object in this amendment was to suggest to the Minister that know-how as defined here will be confined to utilising the finished product, that in fact there is need, and a great need, for the extension of the term &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; to cover the necessary expenditure and development to acquire it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we could deal with it to some extent.  It seems to tie up here, but perhaps it will be more relevant on the later amendment.  In any event, can the Minister explain why in this section it is necessary to confine know-how to industrial information?  Is the section in any way impeded or made difficult if the word &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; is in fact deleted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. What we are concerned with here is encouraging manufacturing industry to acquire the latest techniques in the systems of production.  At the moment, the expenditure on know-how is allowable, by and large, as a charge, and we are merely putting the matter beyond doubt and clarifying the situation by spelling out in so many words that the acquisition of know-how in manufacturing and processing industry is fully allowable for the charge.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 4, line 35, after &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, including development expenditure in relation to the acquisition and exploitation thereof,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is what I am referring to.  The object of this amendment is to insert in subsection (2) (a) the words which if accepted would make the section read:</P>
      <P>Where on or after the sixth day of April, 1968, a person incurs expenditure on know-how, including development expenditure in relation to the acquisition and exploitation thereof, for use in a trade carried on by him...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment, I have in mind the limited use of know-how, the very great need that exists to encourage the development and the seeking of know-how in the industrial field.  If know-how from the tax concession point of view covers necessary development of the service, the development of know-how should cover the research necessary to acquire it and so not merely be confined to its exploitation or use, although it would have quite a profound effect.  What I fear, if the views contained in the report I have mentioned are correct, is that this concession will not in fact operate.  It will be pretty well squeezed out of existence in relation to the industries which at present have developed know-how because of the co-existence of our present excise regulations.  If we can encourage in the field where this service has not been sought a change of attitude in that regard by getting people in industry to appreciate the <Col N="74" /> development of research and development, the search for know-how, that in itself will be regarded as entitling them to a tax concession because it would in fact add up in the national interest.  The Minister is quite right in saying that it is in relation to this amendment that I seek these facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can put the Deputy's mind at rest on this matter. What we are concerned about here is largely the acquisition of what might in some circumstances be regarded as a capital asset.  The danger under existing legislation is that a firm expending money to acquire know-how might be told by the Revenue Commissions &ldquo;That was an asset you acquired.  That was a capital transaction and it is not allowed.&rdquo;  Our concern is to express clearly that if money is expended on the acquisition of know-how, that money will be fully allowable in the books or the accounts of the firm acquiring it.</P>
      <P>What normally happens is that one firm would develop and exploit a process to the point where it was know-how and would then sell it to the other fellow.  I am concerned with the acquisition by the second fellow.  I am concerned that that acquisition of the know-how, developed and exploited by the first firm, is fully allowable in the case of the acquiring firm.  The first firm develops and exploits some process and then sells it.  The income from the sale would be regarded as taxable but the money spent exploiting the process would be fully allowable.  I submit that that situation is not strictly relevant to this section.</P>
      <P>Our concern is with a firm acquiring know-how.  We are concerned to make sure that the money it expends on the acquisition is allowable in its accounts as a legitimate charge.  If, subsequent to its acquisition, the firm which has acquired it goes on to do more development and exploitation work then that development is fully allowable. The only thing I am seeking in the section is to make quite sure there is no confusion about the case of acquisition of know-how.  I am ensuring that it will not be disallowed by the Revenue Commissioners because of its capital nature.</P>

    <Col N="75" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister extending this relief to cover professions? I have received representations that, as the section stands, it is confined to the acquisition of know-how for use in a trade or industrial undertaking. Nowadays, with modern developments in industry of one sort or another, professional persons &mdash; particularly engineers, scientists, architects and other skilled personnel of these categories &mdash; acquire professional knowledge or highly-skilled technical knowledge which is applied by them to industry or applied by the firms who engage them.  As the Minister knows, many are employed in the firms on a permanent basis but, irrespective of whether or not individuals of that character are employed in a firm in a whole-time capacity, it has been suggested to me that the know-how acquired by professional people should qualify for taxation relief.  If necessary, the section could be amended or a suitable subsection could be drafted which would allow relief only where the know-how is applied to industry.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is conceivable that some scientific or technical knowledge might be used for other purposes &mdash; medical or other very desirable but not industrial uses.  It has been suggested that the section should be amended to add the words &ldquo;or profession&rdquo; on the one hand or, alternatively, to extend it in such a way that professional knowledge held by persons and applied to industry would be included within the ambit of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I am quite clear on what the Minister said in reply to the points I was making.  I am concerned principally with what is stated as an objective comment in the Report on Science in Irish Economic Development. Attention is drawn in that report to the fact that the failure of many public enterprises to give a sufficient lead in technological change is a major obstacle to proper progress here.  What I had in mind, if I thought this concession in the way of an allowable expense is being confined merely to the use of know-how in trading, whether it is purchased or developed in the particular <Col N="76" /> industry itself, if it is confined merely to the use of know-how then it is not a sufficient encouragement to those firms that, in fact, up to this, have not bothered at all about this essential equipment for the competitive situation now facing us.  Does the Minister assure me that that is not so? That is all I want.</P>

      <P>Yes.  You see, in the case of any firm which sets out to equip itself properly to do its job, to do research and development work, and so on, all that expenditure would fully be allowable.  The setting-up of a laboratory, the employing of technicians, scientists, chemists, anything of that nature, would fully be allowable. If in addition it goes out and buys somebody else's work, we are ensuring that the cost of the acquisition of that other work would be allowable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() This section shall also apply to a company which was set up in the previous year and which ended its financial year subsequent to the 6th April, 1968.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that where a company commenced business subsequent to 6th April, 1968, but where its financial year does not conclude until a later date, it will be entitled to qualify for the relief.  As I understand it, the position at the moment is that if a company commenced operations, say, in May, 1967, and concluded its financial year on 30th April, 1968, or if a company commenced, say, any time between then and December, 1967, and does not end its financial year until as late, possibly, as November, 1968, it will qualify for the purposes of Case I of Schedule D.  As the section is drafted, I think the companies which commenced within the dates I have mentioned, but whose financial year does not end until a later date, may not qualify.  It is for that reason that this amendment is being put down, to ensure that the companies so circumstanced will qualify for the relief.</P>

      <P>Arising from a re-organisation a loss of income can be allocated to some holder of an office and he gets payment related to that loss of income.  The relief which the section proposes deals with such a problem.  It is a relief which it seems to me operates only by way of repayment of tax.  My object in putting down this amendment is really just to provoke a discussion as to why the same relief cannot be achieved by way of an adjustment of the tax liability if the circumstances so permit it.  Why should the man have to pay his tax and then get it back if in fact the circumstances permit an arrangement for the adjustment of his tax liability along the lines envisaged by the section? Why not just do that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be heartened to know that I also asked <Col N="79" /> this question when I first saw the draft from the draftsman.  The reason for putting it in this way is that the employers have to make deductions of income tax under the PAYE system and they regard this as a fairly onerous task, which it is.  If we did not stipulate that this relief was to be given by way of repayment, it would mean that the employer would have to do these very arduous calculations in addition to the ordinary PAYE calculations which he has to do.  The Revenue view is that it is better that the tax should be deducted and paid, in the normal way, repayment being made subsequently on a claim.  In this way, the burden of making the calculations is borne by the Revenue authorities rather than the employer.  I am assured that it does not mean that it can only be done by way of repayment; it could be achieved by an adjustment of future liability and, where this is possible, I am assured that it would normally be done.</P>

      <P>I wonder is the Minister's advice correct?  The subsection says that relief from tax under this section &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in all cases be given by way of repayment.  It does not say &ldquo;may&rdquo; or anything like that, and as I understand it, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in those circumstances does not allow for any discretion.  I have in mind the unfortunate man who by reason of re-organisation is going to find his income reduced and is given £1,000 to compensate him for the loss of income involved.  I can understand how advantageous it may be to the employers perhaps and also to the income tax authorities, but it seems a bit thick that they can deduct from him the full burden of tax attributable to the £1,000 and perhaps upset some little plans he may have had of his own.  He has to wait, having first had to pay the tax, to get it back.  I would urge the Minister to have another look at this.</P>

      <P>As I understand the section as drafted, it adds two or three further columns to the wear and tear computations.  This was referred to in the Minister's speech and the suggestion was made &mdash; I think the Minister will remember &mdash; that the changes envisaged would simplify headings under which rates would be applied. As this section stands, the existing rates will apply to plant and machinery already in use as of 1st April, 1968, and all secondhand purchases of plant and machinery made after 31st March, 1968, so that there will be a continuation of the existing rates but also the computations in respect of wear and tear to comply with the wording of the section as drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> It is suggested to me, and I mention it now, so that if necessary I can insert an amendment on Report Stage, that, to prevent difficulties in future in distinguishing between different items, the new rate should operate for all plant and machinery in use as from 1st April, 1968.  If necessary, instead of the phrase used in the section &ldquo;provided for use&rdquo;, those three words might be substituted by the single word &ldquo;used&rdquo;.  I mention this now so that, having raised it, I can put in an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

What one would like to do is, of course, to bring these new rationalised rates into operation from 1st April and apply them to everything but, unfortunately, that would result in one of two things: either certain people who are on certain rates at the moment would lose or I would lose.</P>

      <P>I agree, and I was not prepared to worsen the position of individual firms by putting them on to a rate which was lower than they are getting at the moment.  On the other hand, I wanted to achieve rationalisation without any cost to myself and this was the only way in which I could do it.  Admittedly, there will be a period during which there will be a great many rates in existence, but the old ones will die out fairly quickly and we will then be left with these three new rates which will apply to everything.  However, there will be no harm in Deputy Cosgrave exercising his ingenuity in regard to an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that the income derived from large office blocks will be regarded as trading income and taxable under Schedule D in accordance with part of the recommendation made in the White Paper on direct taxation.  I wonder would the Minister tell me, taking the abolition of Schedule A and Schedule B in the sense in which the Minister says it applies, what about the other part, the more or less <i>quid pro quo</i> suggested in paragraph 24 of the White Paper, which provides as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> If, on the abolition of Schedule A liability on owner-occupation, the reliefs in respect of interest on house purchase loans and in respect of premiums on endowment assurance by which such loans are secured continued to be given, the question of granting some measure of allowance to the tenant-occupier in respect of the rent he pays would have to be considered.  An easement in this direction would be likely to entail very substantial cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister indicate that, in the proposition he makes in section 5, which takes the first step, as it were, the Government considered the recommended relief regarded as necessary in the White paper to deal with the position of tenant-occupiers and when may tenant-occupiers expect that relief to be given?  There is, as the Minister appreciates, growing concern with regard to rents and the problems of those who, as tenants, occupy houses owned by others.  If a concession of this kind is being given it would seem that the particular position of tenants should, in justice, attract the attention of the Government.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate what the position is in that regard.</P>

Fair enough, the Minister is giving relief here to the person of property, the person who owns and occupies property.  I do not grudge that relief.  It is understandable but, from a social point of view, this whole problem of the justice of our income tax system, and its projection into the future, was considered in 1961 and became the subject of a White Paper, and this very problem was raised, that if you deal with the problem of those who have in relation to property, if you give a concession in relation to Schedule A and Schedule B, you must remember the position of the tenant occupier who has not.  I am sorry that the Minister is disappointed in my approach to this but I am a member of a Party who believe in our policy.  We believe in a just society.

I, certainly, have never been able to persuade the ordinary man-in-the-street of the justice of that position and, of course, there is the further point that, very often, indeed, I would say, in the vast majority of cases, the man who owns and occupies his own house has borrowed the money to purchase the house and is paying back mortgage and interest on his house.

With regard to the person who gets that roof by obtaining a loan to purchase his house or gets it through an insurance company, or whatever it may be, and who then, of course, has the liability, and will continue to have it, for Schedule A and Schedule B tax, our code says, &ldquo;We will make him an allowance in respect of the loan charges or the insurance premiums&rdquo; and that is perfectly <Col N="86" /> understandable and perfectly fair.

There is the other class of persons, and there are hundreds of thousands of them in our cities and towns, who set out to do exactly the same thing&mdash; provide a home and house for themselves&mdash;but they do it by means of paying a rent to somebody else.  They are making the payment for precisely the same purpose &mdash; to provide for themselves and their family a roof and a home, frequently merely a room. Why have we not reached the stage where an allowance should be made from an income tax point of view in respect of the payment which such person makes when he makes it as rent?  That, I understand, to be the recommendation made in paragraph 24 of the White Paper of 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension here.  At present, we create a fictional income for a man who owns his own house simply because he owns his own house and we proceed to tax him on that.  I do not care what any White Paper says, I have my own views on income <Col N="87" /> tax.  We are making certain changes that were not visualised in former years.  The Deputy then goes on to say that we allow that person the interest that he pays and the insurance premiums, and so on, but that has nothing to do with his ownership of his house or the fictional income that we create in regard to his ownership of the house.  We are in any event allowed interest paid against our income tax. Any of us who pays bank interest is allowed that bank interest against his income in any year, whether he owns a house or whether he does not.  If we have insurance premiums, we are given an allowance in respect of those insurance premiums, whether we own a house or whether we do not.  The allowance which one gets for income tax purposes for interest payments or insurance premiums in any year has nothing whatever to do with the ownership of a house or the payment of income tax on a fictional income which one is supposed to derive from the ownership of the house.</P>
      <P>I have never been satisfied in my mind that it is a right thing that, because a man, out of taxed income, bear in mind, out of income which is fully taxed, saves a certain amount of money and buys his own house should be taxed again because he owns his own house and lives in it.  It is time to get rid of that anomaly and that is what is being done here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy can put forward arguments for all sorts of desirable allowances for income tax purposes. Deputy Tully has a favourite one which he always speaks about, that is, an allowance for the cost of travelling to and from work.  That is a perfectly arguable case.  I think it is far more arguable, indeed, than the case the Deputy is making, that the tenant-occupier should be allowed to charge his rent against his income, because one man will occupy a very small house and perhaps pay a small rent and another man may occupy a mansion and pay an enormous rent.  Where is the social justice between those two? I think it is altogether a separate issue from what we are dealing with in section 5.  We are simply getting rid of <Col N="88" /> this, as I think anyway, old-fashioned concept and, indeed, unfair idea, that because a man is sufficiently prudent and thrifty to save or to borrow money and buy and occupy his own house, he should be deemed to be driving some income therefrom on which he is taxable.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister clarify my mind on this?  I personally am in favour of this abolition of Schedule A tax, but up to about five years ago if one owned a house and let that house, the income tax payable on it was on Schedule A alone.  Subsequently, I think when Senator Ryan was Minister for Finance, he introduced a system whereby the owner of the house paid tax on Schedule A and paid tax on the profit rent as well.  In other words, he paid a double tax.  Am I right in saying that what section 5 proposes to do now is to abolish the tax entirely on Schedule A and that the residual profits tax still remains?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins's point, to take it a bit further, is that he does not object to the removal of the Schedule A tax; but what he maintains is that the person who is occupying the house, who does not own it himself but is paying the rent to the Minister for Finance, if he owns it, or to Deputy O'Higgins or myself, should be allowed a remission of income tax for the rent he pays. That seems to be a reasonable point. I gather from the Minister he does not accept that?</P>

      <P>There is something else said about those who repeat things, but we will not go into that. Paragraph 24 of their White Paper envisages relief, and I do not accept what the Minister said.  The Government refer to relief in respect of the interest on house purchase loans.  If that kind of relief is to be continued after the abolition of Schedule A and Schedule B tax, in other words, if a person who purchases his house is to continue to get relief in respect of the interest on his purchase loan, this says in effect that in fairness in respect of the person who has not bought his house, who is merely a tenant in a house, some measure of relief should be recognised with regard to the rent he pays.</P>
      <P>I think that is eminently fair and reasonable and I have no doubt that sooner or later it will be done.  That is not to suggest that every wage earner should be entitled to deduct this weekly rent as an income tax allowance from his income tax liability.  The recommendation here is that some percentage allowance should be recognised on such grounds.  What each income tax payer is doing is precisely the same thing.  He is providing for himself and his family necessary accommodation. One is doing it through a capital investment, secured either by loan or otherwise; the other is doing it by means of a weekly or monthly rent. What each is doing is precisely the same.  Each is providing for himself and his family.  I am referring the Minister to the solemn declaration of the Government contained in the White Paper.</P>

      <P>The situation is that anyone who borrows money from the bank or anywhere else and who uses the borrowed money for the purpose of purchasing his house gets, as is set out in the Government White Paper of 1961, relief in respect of the interest he is charged.  I agree that he would get it even if he used the money for some other purpose.  In fact, he gets it in relation to using the money for the purpose of purchasing his house.  It was that particular social problem which the Government seven years ago had in mind and solemnly suggested that they could not give this concession at the time because, if they did, in justice they would be forced to consider the position of the tenant-occupier. <i>Litera scripta manet:</i> these words remain.  They are written down there and on the record.  The Minister has now proceeded to abolish Schedule A and I am reminding him of the Government conscience and the scruples that were written down seven years ago and I am asking him, what about the tenant-occupier.</P>
      <P>There is today throughout the country mounting anxiety in regard to the very high burden which rents mean in so many families and it appears to me that in social justice the Government should now, having considered the recommendation with regard to Schedule A, bear in mind what they foretold they would have to do seven years ago and bear in mind that the position of the tenant-occupier still requires attention and some measure of relief should be given.</P>

      <P>At this stage to do something along the lines that Deputy O'Higgins suggests would be the least socially just thing we could do because it would mean that we would give an allowance to a millionaire occupying a mansion in preference to making some far more justifiable concession such as giving relief to those in whom Deputy Tully was interested in regard <Col N="93" /> to their travelling expenses to and from their place of employment.

      <P>If so, I want to ask why this relief in relation to Schedule A and Schedule B was not given seven years ago?  It was recommended by the Commission on Income Taxation.  It was turned down by the Government&mdash;on a spurious reason, according to the Minister for Finance now, a phoney reason.  The situation now, out of the Minister's mouth, is that successive Fianna Fáil Governments and Ministers for Finance are convicted.  They would not listen to the Commission on Income Taxation seven years ago.  They would not do it and they said they could not do it because if they did it, they would have to give a concession to tenant-occupiers.  The Minister says that is all cod and rubbish, that it was a spurious reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring precisely to the reason given by the Government in the White Paper on Direct Taxation laid before this House of the Oireachtas on 18th April, 1961. They said they would not give the relief recommended by the Commission to abolish Schedule A up to a valuation of £30 because if they did it, they would have to give some allowance to tenant-occupiers.  That was a phoney reason, according to the Minister.  If it was, why for the past seven years has liability to Schedule A and Schedule B tax been continued?  The millionaire who rents a house would get an allowance in respect of his rent but the millionaire who owns a house is now getting his Schedule A and Schedule B liability wiped out.  That does not mean that there is not a social purpose in the relief given in section 5, nor would it mean that if some allowance were given in respect of tenant-occupiers, merely because some who might not need the concession might benefit, there was not a real social need for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plain fact is that, according to the Minister, now we know that the <Col N="94" /> Government seven years ago turned down the Income Taxation Commission recommendation for a reason which the Minister says was phoney. The Minister says it was phoney, I suspect, merely because I raised it here and it is for that reason he says there is no social justification for it.  I suggest to the Minister that there is a problem of tenant-occupiers paying increased rent merely to provide a home and accommodation for themselves and having to pay their income tax out of their weekly wage.  This problem is going to engage the attention of a Minister for Finance at some time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment I suggest that the &ldquo;other activity&rdquo; should be expanded to include capital gains, appreciation of assets and business expenses and that records in that connection should be kept.  May I remind the House that this particular section comes from the NIEC report and the recommendation which they made in relation to an incomes policy?  It was in the context of a prices and incomes policy that they recommended that this statutory obligation regarding the keeping of records should be imposed. In regard to incomes, the position in relation to capital gains and the appreciation of assets and business expenses generally is something which would <Col N="95" /> have to be considered fully in relation to the development of any sound incomes policy.  I move the amendment in order to ensure that the expression is expressly extended to include these particular matters.</P>

      <P>It would be most undesirable and completely unnecessary at the moment.  We have no such thing as a capital gains tax in operation here.  I have given my view that in our circumstances, the introduction of any such tax would be entirely inappropriate.  For a country that is seeking capital, seeking investment and seeking development as we are, to introduce a capital gains tax at this stage of our development would be bordering on lunacy, in my opinion. Therefore, if we are not going to have capital gains tax&mdash;and I do not think we should have it&mdash;why should we put an obligation on people to keep records relating to capital gains or transactions of that sort?</P>

      <P>There is a phrase: <i>Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis.</i> The taxation policy should be a flexible instrument, an instrument that would change and evolve in accordance with the change in our situation and in our economic growth.  Let us not have this silly old Fine Gael nonsense that what you said in 1924 is going to be around your neck for ever more. I used to hear Deputy McGilligan, when I was a young fellow, quoting here from old yellow pieces of paper what Deputy Seán MacEntee said in 1928 or 1929, as if that were relevant today.  The sooner Fine Gael get away from that codology the better.  There may come a time when various considerations will necessitate the introduction of a capital gains tax here.  I do not rule it out forever, but at this point of time and in our circumstances, it would be quite disastrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore&mdash;and I do not like criticising the activities of friendly Governments&mdash;I think some countries who have introduced this type of taxation <Col N="96" /> have got into serious trouble in the administration of it.  I should like to see how the thing worked out elsewhere before we would even think about it.  However, there is no question of our introducing a capital gains tax at the moment.  Therefore, to compel people to keep records would be placing a completely unnecessary obligation on them.  In fact, one of the doubts I have on the section is that it will perhaps put an obligation on people to keep records which will be unnecessarily onerous on them because they would be people in a very small way of business and might not be liable for taxation in any event.  On the whole it is desirable to bring in this provision, but certainly I do not think it should be extended in the way Deputy O'Higgins suggested to cover something which we will not be taxing in any event.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to deal with the matter which the Minister mentioned a moment ago.  The obligation to keep records is one which reasonably-sized or large firms can undertake because they have an adequate staff to carry out the work, but the House appreciates and the Minister is aware, and certainly the Revenue <Col N="97" /> Commissioners are aware, that a great many small traders find it extremely difficult to keep the various records required, particularly nowadays with the problem of covering both the wholesale and turnover taxes.  In cases where the turnover tax only applies, the obligation to keep records places a very considerable burden on small traders.</P>
    <P>With the change in the type of business operated nowadays and with the growth of supermarkets, the prospect of many small traders surviving is by no means rosy; indeed in many areas throughout the country, in cities and towns and even in villages, the advent of the supermarket, while conferring some advantages on customers, nevertheless, has caused very serious problems for small traders unable to adapt themselves and to provide the services which supermarkets are in a position to provide.  These people are faced with mounting difficulties of one sort or another.  In most cases the size of the business is not sufficient to justify the employment of a bookkeeper or other person who would keep the necessary records.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to make the type of accounts or records kept flexible enough to enable a professional accountant or other person who would be engaged by the trader concerned to prepare a reasonable estimate of profits.  I know it is difficult to differentiate between large and small businesses in the keeping of records, but there is no doubt that the obligation to keep the same type of records places a much heavier and more onerous duty on a small trader than it does on a large one.  I think there is a case for some alleviation such as I suggest.</P>

      <P>I have some sympathy with the Deputy in what he is trying to achieve, but I am not sure if he would really succeed in this amendment in doing what he wants here.  The first consideration which strikes me about it is that the people we are concerned with here, the small trader and so on, will probably not be employing professional accountants at all, and the incorporation of the notion of professional accountants is really going away <Col N="98" /> from what the Deputy is concerned about.  I have set out to keep the section as simple as possible, and if Deputies would refer to subsection (1), paragraphs (a) and (b), they will see that what is required to be recorded is very simple indeed.  Furthermore, there is a proviso at the bottom of the page, in subsection (5), to the effect that a penalty shall not be imposed under this subsection if it is proved that no person is chargeable to tax in respect of the said profits or gains for that year of assessment.  In other words, if a trader is not liable to tax, he does not have to keep records at all.</P>
      <P>I would be against Deputy Cosgrave's amendment, even though, as I say, I sympathise with what he is trying to achieve.  I do not think it would be helpful to the people he is concerned about.  All we are asking them to do is to keep very simple records so that true returns can be made.  Deputy Byrne will probably agree with me that this does not even involve the concept of profit or loss.  So long as a trader would be in a position to make the bare bones, as it were, of the return of his trade, he would not even be required to produce an estimate of profit or loss. Presumably the inspector of taxes would do that if the very minimum of records were kept.</P>
      <P>On the whole, I think the section is reasonably fair to this type of person. I do not think it will place any exceptionally onerous obligation on him or her.  I do not think I would be too happy about accepting Deputy Cosgrave's amendment, particularly as it seems to bring in the idea that a professional accountant would have to be employed in every case.</P>

      <P>I would be opposed to Deputy Cosgrave's proposal for the same reason as the Minister has just stated.  It appears to me that it would be necessary to bring in a professional accountant if the amendment <Col N="99" /> were inserted.

Because they are able to do that, there is a rough idea of profit or loss.  That does not suffice if the section is amended.

      <P>In subsection (2), page 8, lines 18 and 19, to delete all words after &ldquo;Commissioners&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;subject to a right of appeal to the Circuit Court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is really to seek an assurance. Maybe it has precedent but I am disturbed by the provisions in subsection (2) (a) which provide that in the circumstances set out the claim shall be referred to the decision of the Appeal Commissioners and there the decision shall be final and conclusive. I thought the position was that up to now there has been a right of appeal to the circuit court.  Under this proposal it would appear that in this respect no circuit court review of the Appeal Commissioners' decision is contemplated and I propose an amendment providing for such a review.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy's amendment is necessary here. This is a new thing.  The situation at the moment is that a person is supposed to calculate the money he owes under PAYE and to send in the calculation to the Revenue Commissioners and say: &ldquo;I owe so much under PAYE and here is my cheque.&rdquo; At the moment, if the person does nothing, sends in no return, there is nothing the Revenue Commissioners can do about it.  What we are providing here is that in future if the employer does not send in any return the Revenue Commissioners may make an estimate of the amount due.  If the person wishes to dispute the estimate he can go to the Appeal Commissioners. He cannot just send in a return saying there is nothing due.  The <Col N="103" /> Revenue Commissioners will decide whether there is or not.  If he sends in a return with a cheque saying, &ldquo;I calculate that this is the amount I owe ...&rdquo;</P>

It is really the machinery of the collection of PAYE that is involved&mdash; it is money which an employer has deducted from his employee and is due to hand over to the Revenue Commissioners. It would be unnecessarily cumbersome to bring the courts in at this stage.  What happens is that at the end of the year the total for the year is added up, reviewed and revised, and at that stage the employer can appeal to the Appeal Commissioners or to the courts or to anybody he wishes, but in the intervening period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that interest payable under section 129 of the Income Tax Act is admissible like bank interest for relief from taxation and that it is, in fact, payable out of taxed income which, in effect, means that the effective rate of interest can amount to as much as 18 per cent gross per annum.  In some cases, because of the failure to meet commitments&mdash;this applies very often even to State concerns and local authorities where there is delay in payment&mdash;the taxpayer may be assessed tax on the basis of the business done or the income, but in actual fact because of the delay in payment, has not been paid.  That is the reason I mentioned that interest should be allowable for a reduction in computing liability to tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that a very vexed position exists in relation to taxation of directors' fees. As far as I know, there is a decision pending in the courts in respect of a test case.  Directors' fees are currently assessed under PAYE with double effect and this is terribly unjust.  We will have to wait to see the outcome of the case at present before the courts.  I am somewhat behind in my information on that because it is several months since I heard of the case but I am aware that many people are eagerly waiting to hear of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say, and the Minister knows, that in the case of small businesses, about the only real service which the professional accountant can give to his client is to say: &ldquo;Siphon off so much profits in directors' fees so that you will get earned income relief on the income in question rather than leave it in the company to be taxed.&rdquo;  This is a perfectly proper exercise.  The directors in question may have drawn money from their company during the year by way of loans, payments on accounts, call it what you like.  It is wrong that such payments should be brought into the PAYE net because the final outcome of the year may show a small profit or a loss <Col N="107" /> position which will not sustain the directors' fees up to the maximum for earned income relief purposes of £2,000.  I feel it is a hardship to restrict this exercise in any way.  It would be a hardship on small business people.</P>
    <P>I am worried about these provisions because I apprehend a situation arising where the Revenue Commissioners might be empowered to say to a company: &ldquo;You have charged in your accounts for the past two years directors' fees of £2,000 for the proprietor and because of that we apprehend that you are going to have a similar fee charged in your current account and we want PAYE on one-twelfth of £2,000.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister bear in mind that what is being paid month by month may be an advance to the director which he does not choose to regard, rightly, as remuneration until he has taken out his final accounts at the end of the year to ascertain whether or not his company can afford to pay him remuneration.  In those circumstances if he is having a bad year why should he not borrow from his company rather than create a liability on himself under PAYE, creating a loss in his company for which he does not get relief?  This is a vexed situation.  I believe that there is a case in the courts. I am aware that the same remuneration can be taxed twice pending review perhaps a year later and I would like the Minister to look into it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I shall, but it seems to me that at the moment if he pays himself a salary month by month, the company very properly must return PAYE in respect of that amount. PAYE is not deductible in regard to advances made to a director or borrowings by a director.  I can see that the line between advances made and a month by month salary is probably very thin from time to time but the position is that if it is an advance, strictly speaking, then it should not be brought within the PAYE net at all, only if it is a salary paid month by month should it come in for PAYE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to authorise the increase to £50 million of the existing statutory limit of £42 million on the expenditure which the Electricity Supply Board may incur on the electrification of rural areas.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the rural electrification scheme at 31st March, 1968 was nearly £41½ million and the Board will soon reach the existing statutory limit of £42 million.  The Board is at present doing a systematic post-development scheme in the course of which all unconnected householders will have a further opportunity of taking supply. The increase of the limit to £50 million should enable the Board to complete the scheme.  This will take another five years as the Board will have to go back over the areas already covered by the post-development scheme so that all householders will have an opportunity of taking supply at the improved terms recently announced.  I shall refer to these improved terms later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of rural houses connected <Col N="113" /> at 31st March, 1968 was 334,000, which is about 87 per cent of the estimated total of 384,000.  By the time the scheme is completed, electricity at a reasonable cost will be available to 97½ per cent of rural homes and, on the ESB's estimates, approximately 92 per cent of the existing total of rural houses will have accepted the terms offered.  I may mention that, of the number not expected to take supply, nearly half could have it at the normal standard charges, that is to say, without any special service charges, and a great many others at very little more than the standard charges.</P>
    <P>The Government have been concerned to arrange that, within practical limits, electricity is available to the maximum number at reasonable charges.  The ESB system of charges consists of a fixed charge, to meet the costs which arise from connecting the consumer to the supply, and a unit charge, which is the charge for the actual current used.  The charge per unit is the same for all rural consumers. In some cases, because of the high cost of connection, the normal fixed charge related to the size of the premises, is not sufficient to meet the annual fixed costs to the ESB and the ESB find it necessary to impose special service charges.  The Government considered the question of these charges.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that special service charges should be abolished and that everyone in the country should be entitled to electricity at the same cost&mdash; on the analogy that letters are delivered at a flat rate to all rural as well as urban areas.  However, this is not a valid comparison.  The delivery of letters to isolated areas does not involve heavy capital outlay and substantial annual maintenance costs, irrespective of the use made of the service.  A flat rate is therefore possible.  In the case of the telephone service, however, which is an analogous service and which, like electricity, involves heavy capital costs, the customer in an isolated position has to pay an additional charge because of the extra costs involved in providing the service and then pays the standard rental and rate for calls made.</P>
    <P>Similarly an electricity consumer in <Col N="114" /> an isolated position, who receives current at the standard rate, must expect to contribute to the extra high cost of connecting him to the electricity distribution system.</P>
    <P>If there were no special service charges the ESB would have to incur heavy capital expenditure in bringing supply to very isolated houses &mdash;in some cases the capital cost could be £1,000&mdash;and then receive an utterly inadequate revenue from the connection.  In these areas the very substantial subsidy from taxpayers and consumers which would be incurred would be out of all proportion to the benefits received.  Indeed the ESB have found that many of the isolated houses are inhabited by old people and seem likely to be abandoned when the present tenancy ceases.  The heavy capital expenditure involved in providing supply would in such cases be wasted.  I may say that in one form or another special service charges are to be found in electricity tariffs the world over.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Government are very conscious of the fact that the special service charges payable by some rural consumers were very high. It was estimated that at 31st March, 1967, there were about 22,500 unconnected houses the special service charges for which would add 50 per cent or more to their two monthly fixed charges.  I do not know what the upper limit might be, but over the 22,500 houses the average two monthly fixed charge would amount to about five times the normal charge based on the size of the premises.  The Government, therefore, have decided to reduce the level of special service charges.  Where special service charges, as previously calculated, are over half the normal charges, reductions are being granted.  The consumers who will gain most benefit are those who would have to pay the highest special service charges; in many cases these charges will be reduced by a half to two-thirds and even more in some cases.  Those whose charges, as previously calculated, were only slightly over half the normal charges will gain small reductions; special service charges which are half or less of the normal fixed charges remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> To show clearly how much rural consumers are going to benefit, I think I should give the House some typical examples of the reductions which will result.  The occupant of a county council cottage paying, two monthly, 14/- fixed charge and £1 15s 6d special service charge will have his special service charge reduced to 11s 5d.  A consumer, similarly housed, but who because of higher connection costs, was previously liable for a special service charge of £2 12s will have it reduced to 16/-.  A consumer with a mediumsized farm paying, two monthly, £1 5s fixed charge and £2 14s special service charge will now pay a reduced special service charge of £1.  A large farmer, with a fixed charge of £2 5s and a special service charge of £2 18s 4d will now pay a special service charge of £1 9s 11d.  The House will see therefore that the reductions are quite substantial.</P>
    <P>These reductions are being introduced by agreement with the ESB and do not require amending legislation.  It was therefore decided to introduce the revised terms immediately&mdash;as from 1st June, 1968 for new consumers. Existing consumers will benefit from and including their accounts for the September/October and October/November billing periods.  These are the earliest dates from which it is practical for the ESB to introduce the modified charges.  By the end of the post-development scheme, the reductions will add about £300,000 to the Board's annual loss on rural electrification. This will have to be borne by the Board's consumers generally and no increase in the statutory State subsidy payable to the ESB is contemplated.</P>
    <P>The ESB while they are forbidden by law to make profits, are, also by law, required to avoid losses and the additional loss expected on the extension of rural electrification will require to be met by surplus revenue from existing consumers.</P>
    <P>Any householders who did not accept supply because of the high special service charges when the ESB were re-canvassing their areas and who now wish to obtain connection, may get in touch with their local ESB offices.  I think I should stress, however, that <Col N="116" /> while some householders may be able to get supply at the revised terms without delay, people in general will find that they will have to wait until the ESB come to do their areas.  In carrying out the post-development scheme, the ESB are re-canvassing the country in a planned sequence of areas so as to ensure orderly development and to keep costs to a minimum.  Any departure from the planned arrangements upsets the Board's programme and increases the costs involved.  Preference for any area can be arranged only by delaying supply to other areas.  It is clearly impossible for the ESB to connect immediately all who will now seek supply.  The Board expect that it will take them nearly five years to give all unconnected householders in the country an opportunity to take supply at the revised terms.</P>
    <P>As I have explained, the new arrangements for rural electrification are going to mean substantial reductions for those who would have to pay high special service charges.  There may be some householders, however, in areas isolated from the Board's network, who will consider even the reduced charges still too high.  For these people we are increasing the subsidy for the installation of bottled gas to £35.  The former subsidy of £10 was intended to provide only a basic installation.  In this way it was the equivalent of the rural electrification subsidy which provides only for the connection of a premises as far as the meter, leaving wiring and fittings on the consumer's side of the meter to be provided by the consumer himself.  The higher subsidy of £35 will pay for a more complete bottled gas installation. It should cover the basic equipment and three, or perhaps more, consumption points, depending on the circumstances, which may be used for lighting, heating, cooking or other appliances.  This grant will be available to all rural householders whose special service charges for electricity, under the revised terms, would still be more than 100 per cent of the normal charges.  Inquiries about the increased grant, which does not require amending legislation, should be addressed to my Department.</P>
    <P>While the cost of rural electrification <Col N="117" /> is high, the benefits to the rural population are considerable.  It has spread the amenities of modern living all over the country.  This is clearly illustrated by the fact that there are now 140,000 television sets, 240,000 electric irons, 160,000 electric kettles as well as many thousand washing machines, electric cookers, refrigerators and storage heaters in rural homes.  On the other hand, electricity has provided the rural population with greater opportunities for relaxation to enjoy these benefits, with the aids which it has made available for easier farming and simultaneous increased farm productivity. In milking, for instance, the use of electric milking machines has increased from about 18,000 in 1963-64 to nearly 30,000 at present.  There has also been an increase in the use of electric milk coolers.  Piped water is, of course, essential for efficient farming operations and this is easily provided by electricity; about 60,000 electric water pumps have now been installed.</P>
    <P>I think I need say no more about the benefits of rural electrification.  As I have said, the purpose of the Bill is to authorise the ESB to incur the capital expenditure necessary to complete the current post-development scheme. The present proportion of rural households connected, 87 per cent, must be considered very good when one has regard to the fact that our farmhouses tend to be isolated and not sited in groups as in some countries.  Over the next five years we expect to raise the proportion to about 92 per cent, with connection available to many other houses which could bring the total even closer to 100 per cent.  At that stage we should be among the most advanced countries in the matter of rural electrification.  In fact with the revised charges and the continuation of the subsidy, the Government is seeing to it that practically every unconnected householder in the country will now be able to enjoy the benefits of electricity on reasonable terms.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the value of rural electrification we must all be very keenly aware, and it is for this reason that we on this side of the House welcome <Col N="118" /> any legislation that proposes to increase the scope of rural electrification and, consequently, increase the many amenities that flow therefrom.  I personally am extremely glad that concessions are being made in the case of special service charges.  For very many years now, I have been pleading the cause of the people so affected, and particularly so as I come from a part of the country, and represent a constituency, where there are many isolated villages and, indeed, isolated houses and where the special service charge has proved to be an extremely heavy burden.  In fact, apart altogether from its being a burden, it has prevented many people from availing of the service by reason of their fear of not being able to meet the charges.</P>
      <P>I can see the value of the Minister's argument that the postal service is not strictly analogous having regard to the lack of comparable capital outlay.  At the same time, the telephone charges argument is not quite valid because people in isolated areas, where there is a sub-post office, have the advantage of making their telephone calls from the post office at the same charge as people in much more advantageouslyplaced positions.  Nevertheless, I do not think any great advantage can be gained by arguing the pros and cons of matters of this kind.  It is satisfactory that, once the money is made available, the special service charge is reduced and the burden, therefore, lightened.</P>
      <P>I want particularly to stress the necessity for reducing these special service charges in isolated areas.  I hope this step is but an earnest of further early reductions.  Some of our best tourist amenities are available in these isolated areas.  If the special service charges were not so high, people might go in more for the chalet service, under the aegis of another Department, and guesthouses, which Bord Fáilte assist, and, altogether, tourist development in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to see the amount of subsidy for bottled gas increased from £10 to £35.  I think, for the moment at any rate, bottled gas is really a concern of the islands, more or less.  I think nobody on the mainland, however <Col N="119" /> awkwardly placed, should be deprived of electricity as we know it by reason of the special service charge and the burden thus created.</P>
    <P>We, in the rural parts of Ireland, shudder a bit at the Minister's assertion that, in most houses in isolated parts of the country, there are old people.  This is true of a great many of them.  I shudder because, to me, this amounts to an acceptance of the trend which is becoming a permanent feature of our countryside that, where the old people are, the young people will never return and we can look forward to seeing on our promontories, our hillsides and in our valleys the ruins of houses where once young people lived and grew up and left and the houses are now falling into disuse.  It is a poor outlook for rural Ireland but it is the pattern that is taking shape.  I am sure the Minister deplores it just as we all deplore it.  I am sure he does not welcome it.  Nevertheless, any argument in favour of any piece of legislation that presupposes the acceptance of such a state of affairs as a permanent part of our future is certainly something about which we must feel far from happy.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the convenience of rural electrification from the point of view of farming.  That is so.  He talked in terms of milking machines, milk coolers, and so on.  On the smaller holdings, where cows are still milked by hand and where they are fed in the byres, rural electrification has tremendous advantages, particularly to the housewives who generally do these things by hand. People do not now have to go out at night with the storm lantern and the problem of candles flickering and blowing out does not now arise.  Instead, by the simple manipulation of a switch, they have the comfort and security which rural electrification brings to them.  All in all, I think the progress of the Electricity Supply Board, since its modest beginnings, has justified the faith of its promoters&mdash; whether it be the provision of power to houses, power to factories, and so on. Whether it be the giving of light and power to the most remote areas in the land, it is a tribute to the faith of the <Col N="120" /> promoters in this concept from the beginning.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I welcome the Bill and look forward to the time, in the not so distant future, when there will not be any special service charge and, thereby, no burden and the little irritations that cause all of us to receive complaints from time to time about these kinds of things.  This is a good measure.  It should be accepted by the House.  It will give considerable comfort and great amenities to our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister will have any trouble with this measure.  His comments and those of Deputy Lindsay are very appropriate to the future of the proposal contained in this amending Bill.  If nothing else, it will reduce the number of questions on the Order Paper with regard to the special service charge.  If we had that sort of debate, I am aware the Minister could accuse the inter-Party Government of introducing these fixed charges: we could have counter argument and accusation across the floor of the House.  The main thing is that something is being done.</P>
      <P>I join Deputy Lindsay in expressing the hope that it will be possible for the ESB, through the Minister for Transport and Power, in time, to abolish in its entirely the special service charge.  I read his brief, according as the Minister read it, and was fearful that, with all the arguments he was putting up as to why this charge should not be abolished, it would be increased or at least left alone.  It was a pleasant surprise, after all his arguments over a good number of years, to note that he came down on the side of having it reduced. I do not know what the real effect will be on individuals but, from the example the Minister has given, it seems to me it will be pretty substantial indeed and certainly will be welcomed by those people in the rural areas who complain bitterly about these special service charges&mdash;particularly those to whom the Minister referred, the people who would not at all accept electricity because the all-in cost would be too big for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister's analogy of the telephone service and the eleclarl <Col N="121" /> tricity supply service is valid.  Electricity is a necessity.  Power is a necessity. I know that we can get turf and coal and that we can use candles, and so on, but, in 1968, it is absolutely essential that, as far as possible, all our people, no matter what their occupation or where they live, should have the modern advantage of electricity.  Not everybody wants a telephone.  I suppose that 95 to 99 per cent of the people who want a telephone want it because of the nature of their business but practically everyone in the country, particularly in the isolated areas, has a local post office where telephone calls can be made.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters on which I should like the Minister's views.  I think it can be said that, when the Minister for Transport and Power is asked to give a view he gives a very objective view&mdash;particularly in a cosy debate such as this where we all agree on the measure that has been introduced.  I have always been concerned about the grave possibility of the effects of defective wiring in houses, particularly. I have no great criticism to make in that respect but there are a number of amateurs going around the country who are providing the wiring of houses, cottages, residences and places of business.  There should be some strict supervision by the Electricity Supply Board, as the agent of the Minister for Transport and Power, or, indeed, by the Department of Transport and Power itself.</P>
    <P>One shudders to think what might happen if this defective wiring, which must exist in many thousands of houses throughout the country, were the cause of an accident through fire, with consequent loss of property and more seriously still, loss of life.  This is particularly so in the case of older houses and establishments.  Electricians in the local areas would confess that they would not have an idea where to start in regard to the electrical wiring of these houses.  It must be defective.  People are reluctant to have an examination because it would cost quite a lot not only for the examination but for the renewal of the wiring and fittings.</P>
    <P>I have raised this on other occasions but I do not think it can have had <Col N="122" /> many results from this or any other Minister.  Let me again stress that there are laymen who are wiring houses and who are not doing a proper job.  There are houses which were wired years ago and the wiring in which could lead to loss of life and loss of property.  Either the Minister for Transport and Power or the ESB&mdash;it is difficult to know which would have the responsibility&mdash; should advertise this danger of accidents through fusing, on television and on the radio.  Those of us who have the benefit of receiving three stations on television see such warning on the BBC and on Independent Television. People are warned about taking certain precautions particularly before retiring at night in order to ensure that these accidents will not happen, particularly when they cannot be quickly and readily recognised.  It is most important that there should be a warning and supervision.  There are people who do not know whether the wiring in their homes is safe.  As far as I know, although I would not be too positive about this, the ESB say that they have no responsibility in this matter.  Who has responsibility?  If it is the owner, let us make that very clear, that the ESB are not responsible for wires fusing or for any other defects that may cause an accident.</P>
    <P>I also wanted to mention the question of support for the board's exhortation to people to use more electricity. In the factories and on the farms this is being done and one can relate the amount of electricity used to the charges made.  Whether it is used or not, there is always the fixed charge or the bi-monthly charge.  Unfortunately, there are people who are paying a big price for electricity merely because they have lights or use it for televisionor the radio which consume virtually no electricity.  To get the maximum value from the installation of electricity one should go to great pains to employ all the machines and gadgets one can, within reason.  I have often seen ESB Bills for about 16s 6d or 22s for two months and then discover that between the fixed charge or the special service charge the people are paying £2, £3 or £4.  These people would be better off using paraffin oil or candles.  On the <Col N="123" /> other hand, they buy coal or other types of fuel, or use other methods to generate power.  Anybody who has electricity in his house, office or on the farm should use it to the greatest possible extent to get the greatest possible advantage from it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to pay tribute to those employed in the board and although I am not very conversant with the work being done by those in the offices of the ESB I feel I should pay tribute to those who in emergencies have to work late into the night or maybe into the next day to ensure that the electricity supply will be preserved. It should be said of the ESB that when there are breakdowns through storms, freak storms or otherwise, that the speed with which they can get on the job and have supplies resumed is amazing.  Therefore, we should express the thanks of this House to those engaged in the field and those who make it possible for us to have a continuous supply of electricity.  I congratulate the Minister in the step he is taking but might we hope that he will return in the near future and abolish the special service charge entirely?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the very kind reception they have given to this Bill.  The question of abolishing altogether the special service charge has been raised. I have discovered that the special service charge exists in most countries and if one were to look at the future very optimistically and express the hope that we might have a very considerable development in industry, the impact of that would make it possible for us to make a further adjustment but it would be wrong for me to offer any specific hope of a reduction or any change in the present arrangements within the next two or three years.  Deputy Lindsay spoke about our attitude towards the stabilisation of the population in the West and that we should not carry out policies on the basis that people eventually are likely to leave a vacant house when they leave it.  This is a feature of life in every country in the remote rural areas of Europe and <Col N="124" /> there is nothing uncommon about it. The extension of rural electrification as proposed in the Bill will add one more measure to the many measures the Government have been taking to effect what might be described as the maximum stabilisation of the population in the West consistent with realities. Other policies include the establishment of growth centres for industry and tourism and other things which do not affect us in this Bill.  We are doing all we can with the £35 bottled gas subsidy and the reduction in the special service charge and we are taking very definite steps towards bringing electricity to people in the remoter areas or bringing them energy in one form or another, either gas or electricity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish raised the question of the possibility of defective wiring in many rural areas.  In fact, the owner is responsible for the wiring in his house. The ESB undertake to inspect the wiring up to the meter which they install in the house and they will inspect the internal wiring on request. I am glad to say that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards are considering the question of providing standards for the quality of wiring used under various circumstances.  I will take up Deputy Corish's proposal that we might have some public relations on RTE in connection with the danger of defective wiring.  I note that it has been done on the BBC and I will ask the Department to see what can be done about this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish also spoke of the value of people making the maximum use of electricity.  He will be aware that there is a publicity campaign on RTE, and also local publicity campaigns, conducted by the ESB and when selling various appliances they go around and put equipment on an experimental basis in various houses in the country in order that the greatest possible use can be made of electricity in the way Deputy Corish suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with everything Deputy Corish said about the splendid emergency service and the breakdown service of the Electricity Supply Board. It has a very fine reputation in that regard and can compare favourably with any other electricity services in <Col N="125" /> Europe.  I thank the House for their reception of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give Bord na Móna temporary relief from their obligation to pay interest on State advanced capital and to defer repayments of capital to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Turf Development Acts, Bord na Móna are obliged to pay interest at fixed rates on advances of capital from the Minister for Finance. The board are also required to commence repayment of capital as soon as the bogs in which the capital is invested have been developed and come into production.  It should be noted, therefore, that all the board's Stateadvanced capital is subject to a fixed annual interest and is repayable on a 25-year basis.  The board has no share or equity capital.  The board is required, therefore, to meet a definite financial target each year.  Since the establishment <Col N="126" /> of the board, capital repayments have totalled nearly £4 million while, in the same period, interest paid on capital totalled about £8½ million.  The board have met in full their obligations for interest and capital repayments in the normal way up to the payment made on 1st April, 1965.  Since then, however, they have been unable to meet from normal revenues the payments due to the State and have been compelled to use capital funds for this purpose as far as they would go.  A total of £2,235,000 was so used.  The last remittance for interest and repayment of capital was that due and paid on 1st October, 1966.  Payments totalling almost £2,600,000 are still outstanding in respect of the amounts due on 1st April, 1967, 1st October, 1967, and 1st April, 1968.  In the case of advances to the board from sources other than the State, the board's obligations have continued to be met in full.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna's difficulty is that all their production operations depend fundamentally on natural drying conditions. This is particularly so in the case of milled peat production, which is very vulnerable to adverse weather. Heavy rain can cause substantial losses.  In addition, briquette production is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of milled peat.  A measure of the suitability of weather for peat harvesting is given by an index known as Poulter's Index.  This is a figure derived from three of the main weather factors which affect drying&mdash; temperature, duration of sunshine and rainfall.  In the period from 1880 to 1960 the index for central Ireland did not fall below average on more than four successive years.  Unfortunately since 1960 there has been a deterioration. The summer of 1967 was the eighth successive summer in which the index was below average so that, since 1880, the worst peat harvesting period has been the period from 1960 to 1967.</P>
    <P>To Bord na Móna the succession of poor peat harvesting seasons has meant men and machines lying idle and work partly done but written off because of the interruption of work schedules by bad weather.  The board have been unable to meet their production targets &mdash;in the last five years, for example, <Col N="127" /> the overall percentages of targets reached have been only 77 per cent, 81 per cent, 57 per cent, 75 per cent and 89 per cent respectively.  The overall result has been the development of a financial situation such that, at the end of 1967-68, the board's accumulated debit balance is in the region of £5 million.</P>
    <P>I should point out at this stage that Bord na Móna have made many efforts to counteract the effects of the unsuitable harvesting weather.  In an attempt to maintain the scheduled deliveries on which the capacity of the milled peat fired generating stations was based, they increased the area of bog under production by developing tracts on the fringes of the bogs, thereby accepting a reduced annual target of 70 tons of milled peat per acre compared with the original target of 100 tons.  The board have carried out experiments in the milling and harrowing of milled peat for the purpose of establishing methods which would ensure the most efficient use of available natural drying.  The size of the particle milled has proved to be crucial in this context and further work is being carried out by the board to determine the optimum particle size for the climatic conditions.</P>
    <P>The board have also carried out investigations into drainage of milled peat areas and milled peat pile compaction and protection.  These investigations have led to a standard procedure for the protection of turf stock piles during the winter, involving the introduction of polythene covering for milled peat piles in an effort to defeat both high winds and heavy rains.  Without this covering, losses would have been much heavier.</P>
    <P>Finally, Bord na Móna have embarked on a new experimental method of milled peat production&mdash;the Fóidin method.  This involved the designing of new machines to produce, on milled peat bogs, turf in the form of small sods which, in the process of drying, would develop a surface resistant to weather like ordinary sod turf.  The small sods so produced are subsequently crushed to form milled peat. This harvesting technique has been developed to supplement normal milled <Col N="128" /> peat production in poor harvesting conditions; 85,000 tons were harvested by this method in 1967 at the board's works in county Mayo and at Boora and Derrygreenagh works in County Offaly.  Of course, the Fóidin method is more expensive than direct harvesting of milled peat, but it should ensure a minimum harvest irrespective of weather conditions.  The board are pleased with the results obtained so far and this year they are extending the application of the new method to their works at Blackwater, County Offaly and Mountdillon, County Longford. All these efforts to overcome adverse weather conditions naturally increase the board's costs and are reflected in the present debit balance position.</P>
    <P>In view of the heavy and continuing losses suffered by Bord na Móna in recent years, I think it is very necessary to have a new and searching look at the overall operations of the board. To this end, I am arranging for the appointment of a firm of consultants to examine the turf production programme both from the engineering and financial standpoints, and to assess the likely results of future operations.  I should make it clear that, over the years, Bord na Móna have themselves employed consultants on various occasions to examine and report on different facets of their operations.  The new investigation will be concerned with the totality of the board's operations. When this investigation has been completed and reported on, it should be possible to decide on the most appropriate financial structure of the board for future years and so ensure the continuation of the board's activities on a sound basis and preserve employment and other benefits in areas which otherwise provide very little opportunities. The purpose of the present Bill is to afford some immediate relief to the board in their financial difficulties pending the outcome of the report.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that Bord na Móna be given full or partial relief during a period of four years, from 1st April, 1967, from their obligation to pay interest&mdash;now about £1.2 million a year&mdash;on State advances.  In addition, the board would, if necessary, be permitted to defer all or part of the <Col N="129" /> repayments of State advances, about £400,000 a year, due during the same period.  The Minister for Finance would take a decision on the extent of the relief in respect of each year on examination of the board's financial position and after consultation with me.  The relief would not apply to capital advanced to the board by the State for the provision of houses for their workers as it is separate from the board's main function of turf production, on which the losses have occurred, and the board would continue to make the small annual payments involved.</P>
    <P>The relief would be given by means of orders&mdash;which may include conditions suggested by the circumstances at the time&mdash;which would be made by the Minister for Finance and laid before the House in the usual way.  The annual accounts of the board would also bring any waiver or deferment to attention.</P>
    <P>In 1965, on the occasion of the last Turf Development Bill, the House was given particulars of the projected development of the board's activities. The moss peat factory at Coolnamona near Portlaoise has since been completed and is now in production. Further development of the board's programme has, however, been somewhat disrupted by the succession of bad summers.  As a consequence, the erection of an additional briquette factory has not been proceeded with.  In any event, because of supply difficulties resulting from bad harvesting weather and also perhaps because of the fall in popularity of solid fuel generally, demand for peat briquettes has not increased as much as was expected. It is necessary, therefore, to make a careful re-examination of the prospects for sales of peat briquettes before substantial capital investment is made in a new briquette factory.  This is one of the matters that, I hope, will be reported upon by the consultants.</P>
    <P>Now, despite the setback which is the reason for the submission of this Bill to the House, there is ample evidence of the success which has attended the endeavours of Bord na Móna in carrying out the duties assigned to them in 1946.  They have <Col N="130" /> now about 100,000 acres of bog in production, and they pay over £4 million a year in wages to 7,000 workers of whom over 4,000 are permanent employees.  Their contribution to the national fuel requirements, both for direct consumption and for electricity generation, is substantial.  The board naturally expected to have bad years among the good years, but the recent succession of bad years has involved them in losses which demand that there be a thorough examination of their prospects.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, it is essential that the board be afforded some provisional financial relief.</P>
    <P>I hope that the recommendations of the consultants, coupled with the measures already taken by the board, will provide a basis for the avoidance of losses in the future and enable the board to meet their financial obligations.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister's statement that Bord na Móna has a payroll of 7,000 and expends about £4 million per annum in wages and makes a contribution to the national fuel requirements, it is nevertheless, disappointing to find that 22 years after its inception the board, through the Minister for Transport and Power, is presenting a rather gloomy story to the House.  Bad weather is blamed for it and the Minister supports this argument by citing the average figures since 1880 to 1960 and from 1960 to date.  We cannot, of course, dispute these average assessments but it is rather regrettable that, while we must take the good year with the bad year, there should be a succession of bad years <i>vis-à-vis</i> Bord na Móna activities as we have had outlined by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For four years we are asked to give Bord na Móna a bit of breathing space so that they will not have to repay moneys during that time which amount now to £1.2 million and £400,000, so that at the end of the four years, if payments are not being made by the board of these figures and assuming that their operations in the meantime break evenly, there will be a debt of <Col N="131" /> something approaching £6½ million.</P>
    <P>That is a serious situation.  I always thought that the general line of policy in this country was that, while parties may differ in details of administration, we were a private enterprise country and that it was only when private enterprise was either unable or unwilling to undertake work of this nature or that the work was so vast that it would not be within the competence of private enterprise to undertake, that we would have public enterprise of the nature of Bord na Móna, the Electricity Suppy Board and others.</P>
    <P>One has to contrast, on the one hand, the success of the Electricity Supply Board as a corporation undertaking the generation of light and power, with Bord na Móna on the other hand which, while an independent operator, nevertheless, can be called a subsidiary in many respects of the ESB.  On the one hand there is success but in the other case the figures here are certainly alarming.  I hope that when these consultants which the Minister in his wisdom is bringing in to examine the whole position give a full and frank report of their examination and observations, the Minister will immediately take such steps as the consultants advise him to take, that is, of course, if he is satisfied that the advice being offered by the consultants is the proper advice and advice that must necessarily be accepted.</P>
    <P>On this, I must sound a note of warning.  Consultants very often bring in reports which automatically involve reduction in employment and savings here and there.  All of these things constitute a hardship if put into operation. I have seen it in my own constituency. I am sure the Minister knows about it. His Parliamentary Secretary met a deputation from my constituency in relation to a portion of bog which was developed for some years and then had to be abandoned, I suppose in the interests of economy and everything else.  People were thrown out of work&mdash; fathers of families&mdash;not very many but still enough to upset the general pattern of that countryside.</P>
    <P>In all of these corporations, particularly <Col N="132" /> in Bord na Móna as, indeed, in the ESB, on the rural electrification side of it, with which we have just been dealing, there is a great element, and necessarily so in a country like this, of a social service.  Indeed, the initial conception in relation to Bord na Móna was the provision of employment in rural areas side by side with the development of our bogland tracts.  That being so, whatever the consultants say, the social side of these operations should not be abandoned or lost sight of.  It is for that reason that I am sounding a note of warning in that regard. The losses here may not be losses, of course; they are just deferred payments which one would hope Bord na Móna would be able to make up, given good weather, greater expansion and all of the other things necessary to increase profits and, also, to increase capital.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if the weather changes&mdash;and bad weather seems to be the main basis for the setback outlined here by the Minister&mdash;there will not be losses but, whether there are losses or not, I should not like to see an operation of the kind run by Bord na Móna being so curtailed in its activities as a result of consultants' reports as to interfere with employment content in areas where that kind of employment content has now been established and has become part of the pattern of the areas where the work is being done.  I would, therefore ask the Minister that, in the event of his receiving the consultants' report, it would be widely circulated prior to his bringing in any legislation which would be necessary following the consultants' report.</P>
    <P>It is clear, of course, that in the meantime, as the Minister has said, the board must be extended some provisional financial relief.  It is to be hoped that at the end of the four-year period, coupled with an improvement in weather conditions and an improvement in the design and operation of machines, the board will be in such a sound position as to justify the measure of relief we are giving them today.  I should have said at the beginning that we are willing to give this provisional relief, but only on the basis <Col N="133" /> that the social side of this operation will not be lost sight of, that the employment content will be carefully watched and that every possible measure will be taken to see that these losses are made up.</P>
    <P>It is a very bad image to have created for a public body such as this into which public moneys have been put to be in this position.  It is not easy to ask the public with any degree of confidence to simply accept bad weather as the reason.  Bad weather has been given as the reason and I accept this.  But I think possibly there may be other things as well as the bad weather in this whole operation that have resulted in the gloomy picture presented to us.  Nevertheless, having regard to all the circumstances and the importance of this industry, I, speaking on behalf of my Party, am willing to give the Minister the provisional relief he asks for the board in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that the Government have decided to introduce this measure.  The Minister may remember that on more than one occasion in this House over the last few years I have suggested that something like this should be done.  As a matter of fact, by a series of questions when a dispute was taking place with Bord na Móna in the spring of this year, I attempted to highlight the fact that the board were being made the scapegoat, if that is the correct term, of the other State companies by having to pay the interest and repay the premium no matter what conditions they were operating under, despite the fact that other State bodies with less stress on them were not being required to do the same.</P>
      <P>In addition, we had reached the ridiculous stage where Bord na Móna, as the Minister rightly stated, were using capital moneys to pay interest. This just could not continue.  Another couple of years and all the balance of the capital funds at the disposal of the board would have been paid back to the Government in interest.  The board would have been placed in an impossible position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the matter was allowed to go too far.  It is all right taking average <Col N="134" /> production on the basis of the weather conditions which have been operating for eight years.  But the cycle of weather changes very much and it has been proved now that we have had eight bad years in a row.  We hope that, like the year of the famine in the Bible, they will be followed by seven good ones.</P>
    <P>Everybody has evidence enough to show that Bord na Móna are running into serious trouble, despite every effort made by the big work force. While I agree with Deputy Lindsay that there is a large measure of the social welfare element in the employment they give and that they are giving employment where it is otherwise difficult to find work, nevertheless the social welfare element ends there.  Bord na Móna employ now almost entirely highly-skilled technical men, men who are handling machines that cannot be handled by those who have not been trained properly to handle them.  For anybody to get the impression that it is another form of social welfare&mdash;I am sure Deputy Lindsay did not mean that&mdash;it would be entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have been in the unfortunate position that they have been attempting to repay the principal and to pay the interest.  According to the Minister's figures, they have so far paid back £12½ million.  It would be interesting to know what the initial loan was.  How much did they borrow on which they have been repaying?  If that figure is available, I should like to have it from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The other thing which should be borne in mind and which cannot be repeated too often is that Bord na Móna have been supplying turf and other types of fuel to the ESB.  One of the causes of the labour trouble we had with Bord na Móna was that, despite the fact that the ESB were paying much higher rates of wages, for some extraordinary reason Bord na Móna were and continue to be under contract to supply fuel at much less than the production cost.  The Minister may say that it would not be economical for the ESB to use the fuel unless they got it at this price.  That may be so, but the point I want to make is: why should the loss not be shared with the ESB? <Col N="135" /> Why should Bord na Móna have to carry the full loss?  This is exactly what has been happening over the years and it is partly the cause of the serious position into which Bord na Móna have run.</P>
    <P>At present an investigation is being carried out by another Department into recent disputes in Bord na Móna.  No matter what the outcome of that, the Minister for Transport and Power should ensure that direct negotiations in regard to the production of fuel should take place between the group of unions representing the men and people who are in a position to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; on behalf of the board.  I am sick and tired, as are many other people, of having even senior officials being made front men, who come along and who have to refer back to some mythical body we have not seen before a decision can be made.  All this helps to bring about losses.  If there is a stoppage, a delay or even dissatisfaction amongst the people working machines, it naturally results in a loss of production. This could and should be avoided.  I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that when negotiations take place and when one side send their top men to negotiate, the other side should do the same.  I am casting no slur on the excellent officials of Bord na Móna who are doing their best under difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>The period referred to here is four years.  This reminds me of CIE, who some years ago were supposed to be able to pay their way in three or four years.  Again and again Bills had to be introduced here for the purpose of allowing them a further period.  Why did the Minister not introduce the Bill for a period of ten years, particularly as the assistance being given to the board cannot be put into operation unless by ministerial order which must be placed before this House?  Why was the period not extended to ten years? Why should it be four?  Was this putting a gun to the head of Bord na Móna and saying: &ldquo;You must pay your way in four years; otherwise you are on your own again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Finally, I shall refer to a matter that Deputy Lindsay has already touched <Col N="136" /> on.  It was mentioned in the last paragraph of the Minister's speech in relation to consultants who are to examine everything being done by Bord na Móna and make recommendations to the Minister.  He should be very careful about the consultants.  Most of them are experts in their own field, but he can take it from me that field is not a bog on a bad wet night.  Their field is not working in bad conditions on their own, four or five miles from anybody else in the middle of a bog where one false move may put man and machine in a very precarious position. My experience of some of these people who claim to be experts on various types of work, particularly work study, is that they try to study it under what they term ideal conditions.  That would mean a very fine day in a very safe bog which is a different thing from a bad night in the middle of a bad bog.  They would not be bogs if they were not bad.</P>
    <P>For that reason I hope the Minister will be careful about making a snap decision on a recommendation from some consultant.  I would particularly recommend the Minister to be very careful not to be used by a certain element in the country only too anxious to make the case that fuel from peat is too dear for generating electricity.  The Minister is aware, as I am, of the school of thought that would use Bord na Móna's output only when a peak load is required.  Whatever the Minister does, he should not be caught by the gentlemen who are trying to put across that view because the loss of employment in rural Ireland which would result from any reduction in Bord na Móna output is something to which, at present anyhow, I can see no answer.</P>
    <P>It is rather a pity that something seems to have gone wrong about peat briquettes.  I do not know if the story I heard is true that peat briquettes could be exported and sold if a guaranteed output could be maintained, but that there seemed to be a big home market for a while and the effort to sell elsewhere appears to have been reduced, with the result that when the home market, which at best is rather fickle, dried up, the cross-Channel market which was being captured had disappeared. <Col N="137" /> If that is true, it is rather a pity.  Bord na Móna should make an effort to encourage the use of briquettes on a far greater scale.  There are so many things to recommend it.  Even the pricing could be handled in a different way.  At present it is possible to find a difference of nearly 25 per cent in the price of briquettes as between one supplier and another. There is still a future for this type of fuel and I should like nothing better than to see the factory, the erection of which was deferred, being started and in production.  Things like that, depending on our own natural resources, are far more useful than some of the factories producing goods for which the raw materials must be imported, and an attempt then made to sell the goods abroad in the teeth of competition from those who have the raw materials on hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly the purpose of the Bill is to give Bord na Móna temporary relief.  I hope it is temporary but all the history of Bord na Móna makes me doubt that.  Like the previous speaker, I wonder how are these consultants consulted or in what field they become experts.  Many of them are swivel-chair experts who never go out into a bog.  Some of them would never return if they did.  I have my doubts about them.  I have seen these experts appointed to streamline certain matters in my own county.  They were brought in with a flourish and we were told of the great savings they would ensure.  We have seen the results and conditions are worse than before they came in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should examine the history of Bord na Móna more thoroughly to see why it is in the red.  I raised a question some years ago when I first came to the House.  It would have been hushed up but that I was in touch with the particular bog and would never have come to light.  I raised the question of why machines were purchased for £90,000 and delivered to the bog and were never removed from their wrappings until the scrap merchants were sent around to cut them up and take them away.  I was near that bog and saw this happen&mdash;£90,000 worth <Col N="138" /> sold for £2,000 or £3,000.  That is where the losses come in.  Will the experts we are now bringing in look back at these things and ensure there will be no repetition?  I hope it will not result in an approach like that of CIE to savings and that savings will not be made at the expense of the unfortunate workers.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if I am thinking of the right people but I should like to praise Bord na Móna or the Sugar Beet Company&mdash;they were certainly involved&mdash; for hiring out turf-cutting machines. That is a wonderful thing.  It has helped to step up production and has helped farmers and others&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is a sore point.  Bord na Móna could go into this field of enterprise just as the Sugar Company have done, giving farmers more time to attend to their crops by having the use of these machines.  This is something that should be encouraged also in regard to turf.  We have become too dependent on oil.  I dread to think what would happen if we had another war.  We depend on oil for our railway engines.  We have turf to burn in train engines but not as much as one steam engine in which to burn it.  At least that was the Minister's answer to a question I asked some time ago.  We should not put all our eggs in one basket but should ensure that we have something to rely on in the event of war.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna should be kept on its feet as a safeguard in the event of war.  I hope the people of Dublin, if we do have a war, will not have to suffer the sort of turf which came up during the previous war years because they got a very bad taste of it.  We must maintain the board but let us hope their losses in future will dwindle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for their reception of this Bill.  I can assure Deputy Coogan that I have had nearly seven years' experience of Bord na Móna and its administration.  I have met the board on a number of occasions, and the Parliamentary Secretary is also in close touch with them. I have also been out on the bogs, and I have examined their annual reports and their expenditure.  I think it can be said they are a highly responsible organisation.  I have never met any group of executives who could be more enthusiastic about trying to get their system as efficient as possible and to keep down the cost of turf, which is so important from the point of view of electricity production and enabling the briquettes to compete with other forms of fuel.  They have never been afraid to take decisions in regard to changes in method.  I recognise that there are industrial consultants who, because of their lack of qualification, should not be invited out to lonely windswept bogs, as Deputy Tully says, but as Deputy Tully will know, Bord na Móna have had some very successful consultant operations, by people who did go out on the bogs and who were acquainted with the characteristics and all the difficulties of turf production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not satisfied that any of them were there at 12 o'clock on a wet night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not at that desperate hour.  Bord na Móna have already made a big effort; the weather slightly improved last year, and they got 89 per cent of their total target, partly because of slightly better weather and partly because of the harvesting of a greater area per machine.  I am hoping that the new Fóidín will be successful.  There are many complications in respect of the type of turf that can be used for this form of operation.  Certain qualities of turf in the midland bogs are not so susceptible to treatment by Fóidín operation as others.  Although I appreciate what Deputy Tully said about Bord na Móna being made liable to pay interest on principal, I think he knows the reason, that whereas there may be some other State enterprises <Col N="140" /> where one could argue for or against equity capital as a substitute for the repayment of interest on principal, in the case of Bord no Móna the bog lasts 35 years, and therefore repayment of the capital is desirable.  One can argue again that if all the bogs are planted for forestry that would yield in 50 years something like £100 million in forestry receipts, to work out how one would apply that in order to decide whether or not they would pay interest on the capital would be beyond me and I think it would be beyond Deputy Tully as well.  The reason for making these charges was a natural one in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay spoke about the effect of the consultants' report on employment in the bogs.  He may take it for granted this report will be very carefully examined by the Parliamentary Secretary, by myself and by Bord na Móna, and that we do not intend to destroy this very valuable form of employment.  We want to hear what can be done technically and otherwise, and what form of financial set-up Bord na Móna could adopt in respect of its operations for the remaining life of the bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully asked about the total amount of capital invested in Bord na Móna so far.  The amount is £28 million.  I agree with Deputy Tully that we can hardly call this a social welfare investment, although we know what Deputy Lindsay meant by that.  He meant that it was an investment in the preservation of a valuable form of employment in the midland areas and in Mayo.  At the same time, as Deputy Tully says, a very large proportion of these workers are highly skilled, and this is an industry we want to see operated successfully.  I cannot make any promises as to what would happen at the end of four years after we have examined the whole position.  There is quite a possibility Bord na Móna would be able to resume on a profitable basis after, perhaps, taking some advice from the consultants, due regard being had to all the circumstances involved. Deputy Tully referred to matters concerning labour relations.  I think it preferable that the Minister for Labour should consider these, which I <Col N="141" /> know he is doing.  I do know that the local grievance procedural arrangements are not unsatisfactory in themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The smaller grievances procedure works reasonably well; it is only when one gets stuck down in the really serious one that dissatisfaction arises.  It is annoying to approach a senior official who says he has to go back to the Board.  This was the main cause of the serious stoppage this year.  When these officials come along they should be able to give a decision, yes or no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows it was the Labour Court that made the proposition, which was turned down. However, it does not arise on this Bill. Bord na Móna are making efforts to sell peat briquettes wherever they can. They have been selling in Northern Ireland; there are some technical difficulties about selling in Great Britain, in preserving the peat briquette unbroken in its passage across.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  To recap slightly, I want to refer to the Seventh Report of the Commission on Income Taxation.  Paragraph 34 reads:</P>
      <P>The personal allowance for a married man (£394) is at present less than twice that for an unmarried person (£234) but from 1956-57 to&mdash;</P>
      <P>It says 1956-60 but I assume it means 1959-60&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;inclusive the married allowance was more than twice, and from 1951-52 to 1955-56 it was exactly twice, the unmarried allowance.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 36 reads:</P>
      <P>We recommend that the personal allowance for married persons should be at least twice that for unmarried persons.</P>
      <P>I should like to start off by saying I am glad to see from the letter columns in the evening newspapers that they have been paying some attention to what is in my mind at the moment. There are good arguments in favour of the proposals in the amendments.  I take it amendments Nos. 12 and 13 can be dealt with together because the arguments are much the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the first one is lost, I probably will not move the second.  As I was saying, I was glad to see that some of the evening papers, the <i>Evening Herald</i> in particular, have been publishing letters on this subject. There are two lines of argument.  One is that while we have unemployment, which we have unfortunately, a married woman should be discouraged from working, thereby making more jobs available for men.  On the other hand, people with particular skills and abilities are penalised by the present taxation on married women to the extent that it might discourage them either in the first place from getting married, or in the second place, from seeking employment after they are married.</P>
      <P>When I raised this matter before, the Minister said such an amendment was unnecessary and undesirable because, in his opinion, they would have to be earning a great deal of money before they would be affected by this provision if the married allowance is less than twice the single allowance.  On Second Stage of the Finance Bill last year, I expressed the wish that the Government would recognise the fact that people with high technological skills and special managerial experience should be given extra concessions in taxation because they are the people we need to create extra employment. If the Minister's argument is correct, that the working husband and the working wife would have to be in a reasonably high income bracket before they would be affected by this discrimination, I say the Minister is contradicting what he has done in this Budget by recognising the necessity to give encouragement to people with top managerial experience and top technological experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put it in slightly different words, if a girl goes through the university and qualifies in science, or architecture, or managerial subjects, that is the type of girl in whom the State has invested a great deal of money to give her those skills.  She marries a man with equal skills and because she gets married to that man, the income tax law will discriminate <Col N="145" /> against them for getting married. If they lived together and did not get married at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not even raising my eyebrows.  I am amazed that the Minister thinks such a situation could arise.  I have known the Minister for a long time, and the Minister has known me too.  However, perhaps that type of rare situation could arise.  In our Constitution we make special reference to the Roman Catholic religion.  We know exactly what the Roman Catholic views are on the question of marriage.  In fact, I am quite surprised that the Irish Roman Catholic Hierarchy have not already objected to this discrimination against married women shown by the Government. These women may wish to work at all levels.  There are women who want to work on the factory floor. There are women who want to work in the universities lecturing and passing on their own knowledge.  There are women who want to work in research. There are women who want to work in other fields and in so working make an important contribution to our society.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately sex differentiation in this country has not changed in 50 years so far as women's rights are concerned.  I am sorry to see the Government endorsing what the trade unions do in practice.  The trade unions have a slogan about equal pay for equal work.  We have signed a Council of Europe international agreement aiming at equal pay for equal work.</P>

      <P>We have, mainly through the trade unions, become a class society in which a woman is treated as inferior.  The relationship between men and women in employment and in every field has become tough and lasting and it is time we made some change or at least that we should revert to the situation we had between 1956-57 and 1959-60 and between 1951-52 and 1955-56.  I should prefer the slogan of equal pay for equal ability to equal pay for equal work because it was shown by a Royal Commission in England in 1946 that in some jobs women could produce as much as men.</P>

      <P>What I am seeking to do is that which was recommended by the Seventh Report of the Commission on Income Taxation &mdash; simply that if incomes be taxed individually and one gets married, this should not leave the woman of ability or skill at a disadvantage in taxation as she is because of negotiations by her trade union, should she be in a trade union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Lemass has made his case on the basis of wives who go to work and, as he put it, make a contribution to the economy, to society.  I am afraid that the amendment as framed would mean that all married couples would get this increased allowance whether the wife was working or not.  To that extent, the case put forward for the amendment is defective.  Deputy Lemass wants to argue for the amendment along the lines that married women make a contribution to the economy and therefore are entitled to some recompense under the income tax code.  Under that code, if he wants his amendment to be effective he must frame it differently.  I have said it before, and I repeat it here, in regard to all these matters of income tax allowances, the primary consideration to which I must have regard is that of cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of implementing the proposal enshrined in the amendment of Deputy Lemass would be £1.4 million per year and I could not contemplate a change of that nature at this stage&mdash; a change involving a cost of that size at this stage.  This is only one of many alterations in the scale of allowances which I am sure Deputies would like to put forward.  Different Deputies have their own favourite proposals in this respect.  The trouble about them all is that they nearly all cost a great deal of money.  We could not think in terms of a substantial alteration in the structure of personal allowances unless we were prepared to have some fundamental review of our total tax structure.  I do not despair of achieving such a review and perhaps of making some very <Col N="148" /> fundamental revisions in the whole of our taxation code.  However, short of some such fundamental review, some complete revision of the structure as a whole, I do not think we can afford to be tinkering around with this or that personal allowance which appeals to the sense of fair play of some particular Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the amendment is being debated here to-night because on numerous occasions we have attempted to get amendments to the Finance Bill and have had them ruled out.  There were amendments which we in Labour felt we should like to put before the House but we did not.  It is here that Deputy Lemass chanced his arm and got away with it.  I am glad he did&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because it gives the House an opportunity to discuss this aspect of it.  The suggestion which has been made by Deputy Lemass on this amendment is that this would apply to professional people mainly, or to people who are working for large salaries.  I do not go the whole way with him &mdash; it is his amendment and he is entitled to put his own interpretation on it &mdash; but the biggest trouble I see is that normally in the case of professional people earning big salaries, whether the wife is working or not, the amount being deducted in income tax is far greater than in the case of a man who is earning £10 a week and attempting to rear a family and whose wife finds a part-time job.  At the present time, quite a number of women are working in Butlin's holiday camp, and are earning wages which may be, for a short week, about £6.  A lot of them are married women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing happens in domestic service at the present time.  As the Minister is aware, there is a scarcity of labour both in domestic service and in female land workers because the Minister for Social Welfare will not allow unemployment benefit to be paid to domestic servants or female land workers.  If they go to work, if they are married and if their husbands are <Col N="149" /> earning £11 per week, the wife will get only 30/- a week tax free.  This is an utterly ridiculous situation.  On the other hand, the husband, who has a reasonable salary and because of that the wife is able to stay at home and look after the family, the husband is caught because the income tax being deducted is so small that he does not get double what he would get as a single man, and the amount being deducted is therefore greater than it should be.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it would cost a lot were all these suggested amendments accepted.  We all have our pets in this matter and they would all cost money, according to the Minister.  Of course they would but the big snag with this and previous Governments is that they do not seem to have got their priorities right.  The whole tax code has got to be re-thought and a new system devised because the present one is unfair.  I do not think even the Minister would argue that a tax code which taxes a man and his wife on £11 10s. per week, while it gives a remission of tax to people with far greater incomes under another heading, could be right.  It is not included as an amendment for the reasons I have stated.  Similarly, my friends, the workers, who use vehicles to go to work do not get a tax remission.  A man who is living with his sister, looking after an aged mother who has no allowance, maybe not even an old age pension, is treated as a single man.  This is the sort of thing which means that the tax code is all wrong and should be recast.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made changes from time to time and I consider the Minister is pretty able, but I would not accept the pat answer which he has given to this and various other suggestions: &ldquo;It would cost too much.&rdquo; That is no answer.  Even though it would cost too much, somebody else must be made to suffer but somebody in a better position than those who are, at the present time, being taxed on a far greater scale than they should be.</P>
    <P>For that reason if Deputy Lemass cares to put the proposal to a vote, I will be only too glad to go into the Lobby with him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass's proposal, as I understand it, is to double the earned income relief in the case of a married couple.  As I understand section 134 which he seeks to amend, it provides that the earned income relief in respect of assessable income shall be a sum equal to one-fourth of that income, but not exceeding, in the case of any individual, the sum of £500.  Deputy Lemass proposes to add on at the end of that &ldquo;or in the case of a married couple, the sum of £1,000&rdquo;.  More power to him.  If he wishes to have a division, we will support him.</P>

My intention when I framed this amendment, and apparently I framed it incorrectly, was an allowance of £500 for the husband and an allowance of £500 for the wife, that is if the wife was earning.  Apparently as I framed the amendment, whether or not the wife was working, the allowance would automatically be payable.  Therefore, with the permission of the House, I would like to withdraw amendment No. 12 and I propose to move amendment No. 13.</P>

      <P>Wait now. With all due respect to Deputy Lemass, he will not get away with that.  Deputy Lemass, I assume, is of mature age.  He comes in and he puts down an amendment to section 134 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, that the words &ldquo;or in the case of a married couple, the sum of £1,000&rdquo; be added.  Section 134 is quite explicit and it is a short section.  It is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An individual who makes, in the manner prescribed by this Act, a claim in that behalf and makes a return in the prescribed form of this total income shall, for the purposes of ascertaining the amount of his assessable income for the purposes of income tax, be allowed a deduction <Col N="151" /> from the amount of his earned income as estimated in accordance with this Act of a sum equal to one-fourth of that income, but not exceeding, in the case of any individual, the sum of £500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a pity that Deputy N. Lemass was not satisfied that amendment No. 13 met his point of view.  It was unfortunate that last year Deputy N. Lemass found himself not in the House when a similar amendment might have been moved by him.</P>
      <P>The Minister is this year providing a measure of relief in the year of marriage for the person who gets married. This marriage relief has like many other reliefs under the income tax code, remained unaltered for many years and with the fall in the value of money the fact is that deflation itself has become a source of income to the Minister for Finance.  This year in relation to the particular year of marriage he is increasing the allowance to a married person from £394 to £494.  Deputy N. Lemass used to advocate the problem of the wife's earned income allowance.  This is just an example of the kind of problems the Minister for Finance is dealing with in Section 12.  The wife's earned income allowance stands at £45 as it has stood since the Finance Act of 1920 and so it is like many other allowances under the Income Tax Code.  They have not been altered.  They have never been changed.  What is proposed in this section is a very limited, a very small, measure of relief and it certainly does not in any way measure up to what is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to have seen Deputy N. Lemass move amendment No. 13. It might have provoked a useful debate. At least this time he was here to say <Col N="155" /> that he was not moving it.  Maybe next year, if the Minister for Finance is still there, without seeking advice Deputy N. Lemass may be able to put down an appropriate amendment. Certainly, I intend, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle to put down an amendment on Report Stage which I hope will evoke support from Deputy N. Lemass and the people in the Government Party who support him.</P>

      <P>It would be a great help if the Minister displayed some courtesy.  I know he is annoyed. He should take it up with Deputy N. Lemass, not with me.  In any event, this section in its limited relief will not, of course, be opposed by us but we do raise the whole question of the different personel allowances which, in fact, have never been changed, largely speaking, and with the fall in the value of money have nosedived into nothing.  I know there are other aspects in relation to the personal allowances which perhaps other Deputies might like to raise. This is the very section I think on which they can be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be involved and I have tried to avoid the flashing knives across the floor.  I would, however, like to comment on something on which the Minister might enlighten me.  It appears that if a couple marry before the week ending the 5th April they achieve what the Minister proposes here.  Secondly it represents a rebate of £25.  Perhaps the Minister would say if that is correct. Many people talk about income tax and income tax reform.  When they talk about £100 they talk about £100 savings.  In this case it is at the standard rate; it is £25.  Perhaps the <Col N="156" /> Minister would say if this is correct, just to clear the air.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that the Minister, whether he likes it or not, if he remains until next year as Minister for Finance, must get down to the problem of changing the whole tax code.  It is an extraordinary thing that at the present time it appears as if it is the lower paid worker who is, in fact, paying income tax.  The higher paid men or women are able to get professional advice to ensure that they get the full value, and a little over, of whatever allowance they can get while the lower paid worker in receipt of from as low as £6 10s. to £14 or £15&mdash;appears to be paying and this has not been contradicted.  It appears that the money that PAYE has produced is collected from that wage or salary group.  The fact is that since PAYE was introduced the amount collected has gone up by leaps and bounds.  I heard on the radio a few days ago that PAYE produced £17 million.  It seems an astonishing amount to be collected from those people.  That might be the answer to what the Minister has been stating, that it would cost too much to do anything for those people because there are so many involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is not an easy problem.  The money must be found and if they get a rebate somebody else must pay.  I would appeal to the Minister to look at this problem and see that, in fact, he is taking money from people who cannot afford to pay it.  Let us look at the situation which has been mentioned here on more than one occasion. Twelve years ago an unskilled rural worker's wages was £5 per week.  His fore, he was earning 25/- overtime before he was taxed.  Now the rural wages average around £10 per week and the tax free allowance is still £6 5s.  Not alone are you taxing on over £6 5s. but you are taxing money which is required by these people to eat, to live, and clothe their family.  I do not want to detain the House on this as there are other amendments to be considered but it does appear to me that we have been treating this question of income tax as if it were one of whether we dare not hurt our friends. <Col N="157" /> Those who have money, we dare not be too hard on them.  The soft people are those who have very little money, who can be caught and who will not protest.  Therefore, I think the Minister, whether or not he likes it, must do something about this problem in relation to the personal allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I carefully read the Minister's statement on Second Stage of this Finance Bill.  The Minister gave a very detailed account of what he intended to do about our tax structure and mention was made of the setting-up of various committees.  I gather he is inclined towards eventually going over to the added tax system.  This will take a lot of work and research and will involve a big change in our tax structure and perhaps maybe even in our fiscal and financial codes.  The Minister may be in a position to do that next year.  In the event of his not being in a position by then to make radical changes&mdash;I realise that this is quite possible&mdash;I do agree that some of the allowances that are being made should be examined with a view to being increased, that is, the personal and earned income allowances.</P>
      <P>In regard to my amendments here, I should just like to say out to the various women's organisations in the country that their slogan is contained in Appendix I of the Seventh Report. If there is enough support for this slogan then I am quite sure that any Government will go along with it.  The slogan in Appendix I is: &ldquo;One taxpayer and one charge.&rdquo; That is the only thing I was concerned about.  I was not concerned about doubling the marriage allowance.  If that slogan is adopted and taken up, that will be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a couple whom I was talking to not so long ago.  They were not blessed with children.  After some years of marriage, the wife became a bit bored in the house and decided to take up a job.  They are doing fairly well: they are paying £12 a week income tax. They have not any children.  If they were not married, they would pay only £10 a week: there are a few shillings either way but that is the round figure. This could mean a cost to the <Col N="158" /> Exchequer but I think the slogan &ldquo;One taxpayer one charge&rdquo; merits consideration.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy O'Higgins, I welcome the additional personal relief for married people in the year of their marriage that is provided for under this section.  However, I want to express some disappointment that, in this section, no provision has been made for relief for students who work in the day-time in order to get the necessary fees to take out a degree at night.  I took up this matter with the Minister when speaking on the Budget. I am very disappointed that, under this section, no relief has been provided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  I merely express disappointment.  This is the section under which the other allowance could have been brought in. I hope, before Report Stage, the Minister will seriously consider bringing in this measure of relief for a very deserving section of the community.  I have had several approaches by students on this matter since the Budget.  I hope the Minister will take another look at this particular aspect of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy N. Lemass has left the House because the amendment which he did not move proposed to delete subsection (3) of section 138 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That subsection provides that if the total income of the claimant includes any earned income of his wife the deduction to be allowed under this section shall be increased by an amount equal to three-fourths of the amount of that earned income but not exceeding in any case £45.  Deputy N. Lemass has not seen fit to move the amendment.  However, it is right that we should raise the point that that earned income relief for the wife was fixed under section 18 (2) <Col N="159" /> of the Finance Act, 1920.  It is 48 years old.  It has not been changed since except that, when PAYE was introduced, the fraction was changed to 4/5ths but the maximum of £45 was retained.</P>
      <P>It does seem a bit odd that £45, which was regarded as adequate away back in 1920, should still be the maximum relief in respect of a wife's earned income.  Had Deputy N. Lemass framed his amendment correctly, I know he would have been strongly in support of the point of view I now express.  On Report Stage, I shall move an amendment to deal with the inadequacy of this allowance and to suggest that it should be brought more into accord with the reality of our money values now.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>Before section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All personal allowances shall be adjusted from year to year in accordance with Consumer Price Index movements.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to insert a new section to achieve that all personal allowances be adjusted in accordance with cost of living changes in the value of money.  It seems to me inappropriate, for instance, in relation to a wife's earned income allowance of £45 which was fixed almost 50 years ago, that we should still retain that limit while money values have changed. Fifty years ago, I am sure a sum of £45 had a purchasing power equal to that of £150 or £160 nowadays.  The allowance of £394 in respect of married people has been unaltered over the years and, again, the fall in the real value of money has meant, in effect, that deflation has increased the tax liability of the taxpayer and deflation itself has become a tax gatherer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we think it right, in the income tax code, to make an allowance in respect of the married status of a person, or the fact that the income is an earned <Col N="160" /> income, or with regard to the dependants a taxpayer may have, if we proceed to fix a money value on these allowances we should have regard to the fact that the real value of money changes and that these allowances, which are very near to each taxpayer, should be kept in accordance with the cost of living changes.  This is the object of this amendment which may not be happily or properly worded but it is intended to achieve this result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment for a reason which has been raised here and in other places. I do not know whether the Minister is aware that what is called by some people the eleventh round of wage increases is almost completed and the increase ranges between £1 and £2 a week according to the length of time for which the agreement stands.  I am talking now about ordinary workers. The extraordinary thing has come to light that practically every female and a very big number of male workers are only getting 15/3 for their £1 increase. This is one of the things that PAYE has done: it has ensured that when trade union officials like myself are negotiating wage increases, not alone have we to talk about a take-home wage but we have to watch whether or not the person for whom we are negotiating is paying income tax.  If he is we have to up the demand in order to cover the loss he will suffer. It is ridiculous that when an effort is made to get a living wage for workers because of the increase in the cost of living, the State should then come along and take one-quarter of it away and say: &ldquo;That is ours and you can do what you like with the remainder&rdquo;. The Minister must do something to deal with this situation.  Whether Deputy O'Higgins's proposal is the ideal way to do this or not, I do not know, but unless the Minister does something about it it will cause serious unrest particularly among the lower wage groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to support this amendment.  It is really the root of a lot of our problems today.  There is no doubt that the <Col N="161" /> absence of a change in the allowances for salaried workers and those on fixed incomes is responsible for the rise in the cost of living today.  As Deputy Tully, speaking primarily on behalf of the small wage-earners, stated, he has to negotiate any increase, taking into consideration what they are actually going to get in cash.  This involves a lot of hardship, particularly for the smaller people, because it takes from them money which they use to buy food for themselves, and for all sections of the community it creates an undesirable situation.  As it stands at present without an increase in the allowances, it is a direct incentive to inflation and nothing else.  Under the present income tax code, the greater part of any increase, no matter how big, is returning to the State revenue itself and as such, is increasing the overhead charges and so on by upping the cost of living and conferring no real benefit on those on whom it is intended to confer benefit.</P>
      <P>Although I appreciate that the Minister has done a lot, and in fact has gone quite a long way to meet the requirements of families, if we are still fixed with a code which we have had for nearly half a century I cannot see how we can make any real progress in relation to the tax code.  I do give the Minister credit for a little forward thinking and I am surprised that he did not think of this very necessary change in the tax code himself and I am also surprised that those who advise him did not advise him that this is the very problem our financial situation is facing today.  I would ask him to give every consideration to this amendment and try to meet the situation, if not now then between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to support this amendment.  Many times here I have argued the case for keeping these personal allowances in pace with inflation, for it is unfortunately true that today you have people who are trapped in the tax net by reason of the impact of inflation on their earnings, people who in real terms should not be so trapped.  I have a certain sympathy with the Minister in regard to the difficulty <Col N="162" /> in which he is placed, for he is hoist, so to speak, by the negligence of his predecessors.  He told us some time ago that to increase the personal allowance by £10 would cost approximately £1 million and he argued that an increase of £10 in the personal allowance was a trifle.  The major personal allowances have not been increased since 1954.  In saying that, I overlook the increase made in 1960 because that was for technical reasons, merely to compensate for the abolition of the reduced rates relief about which Deputy O'Higgins was speaking earlier, and it had no real effect.  I am sure the Minister will concede that to me.  Therefore, we are in the situation that the last real increase in these allowances was made in 1954, 14 years ago.  The impact of inflation on the pay-packet in these 14 years has been very severe indeed.  By reason of the failure to keep these allowances in pace with inflation, a grave injustice is being done to the lower-paid sections of the community in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that Deputy O'Higgins's solution, to draw a line as of 5th April, 1968, and from there on to keep the personal allowance of £234 for single persons pegged to the cost of living index number, is a very practical and realistic approach to the problem, and I commend it to the Minister.  The Minister today, and also on the Second Stage, indicated that the cost of significant improvements in the allowances was prohibitive, and he further indicated that these allowances could be significantly increased only if drastic changes were made in the tax structure. He indicated that added value tax might be the solution.  Deputy Lemass, half an hour ago, on the principle of live horse and you will get grass, said he hoped that the Minister would do something next year about the reforms he was advocating if by then he had introduced an added value tax.  It is quite clear that Deputy Lemass has not read the White Paper circulated by the Minister over the weekend because my understanding is that added value tax is proposed not as a substitute for income tax in its present form but as a substitute for wholesale tax and turnover tax so that we will still be saddled <Col N="163" /> with our present archaic code of income tax unless the Minister, and I believe he is capable of doing it, takes a very hard, detached, objective look at the code in a spirit of determination to rectify the crude injustice under which certain taxpayers are at present labouring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I have anything to say.  There is a fundamental, basic dishonesty in the approach of Deputies opposite to this matter.  They know, as well as I do, that if anything substantial is to be done with regard to personal allowances, the money will have to be got somewhere else or else services that are provided will have to be cut down.  I have paid tribute to the Labour Party on other occasions, and I repeat now that, when we come along with proposals for increased taxation to improve social services, the Labour Party follow us into the Division Lobby.  The Fine Gael Party, however, want it both ways; they demand reductions in taxation and, at the same time, they demand increases in all sorts of services. If they want a substantial overhaul of the income tax code, as Deputy Byrne says, then let them demonstrate to me where I will get the money.  If I were to double the turnover tax, I could make marvellous improvements in the entire income tax code, but it is no good coming in here, bleating about archaic codes and using emotive phrases to back up complaints without putting forward any positive suggestions as to where the money is to come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time past Deputy Tully has been suggesting that the lower paid worker is paying an undue amount of income tax.  I, of course, would like to see the lower paid worker, first of all, getting more money, if he could possibly get it, and, secondly, paying less income tax, if that were possible. I do not imagine for one moment that Deputy Tully would suggest there is a reactionary, conservative Government in office in Britain, or a Government who favours the rich at the expense of the lower paid worker, and I propose now to take the case most commonly <Col N="164" /> quoted in discussions of this kind, the case of the married couple with two children.  Here, right up until one comes to the £5,000 per year bracket, the tax payable on any income is less than it is in Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because the standard rate is lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Deputy the facts.  The tax payable by a married couple with two children on an income up to £5,000 per year is less here than it is in Britain.  When you go over the £5,000 limit, it is higher here than it is in Britain.  We must presume that a Labour Government in Britain are regulating matters as fairly as they can in Britain.  At £700 a year the tax payable in this country by a married couple with two children is nil.  It is £2 1s 9d in Britain.  At £800 it is nil here and it is £17 10s 10d in Britain.  So it continues up along the line until one reaches £5,000; then the situation changes.  The tax payable here by a married couple with two children after the £5,000 a year bracket is higher here than it is in Britain. Deputy Tully, therefore, cannot suggest with any degree of legitimacy that in this country we are harder on the lower paid worker where income tax is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt?  As far as I could gather, Deputy Tully was concerned about even the single man who, after £6 10s per week, has to pay tax.  His point was that it was ridiculous and unfair that a man should have to pay tax on moneys he spent on essential foodstuffs and clothing. That was his point.  Can the Minister give any comparative figures for the single man in Britain?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On £7 a week, the tax payable here is less than it is in Britain. I am not for one moment criticising the British income tax structure; that <Col N="165" /> is their own business.  They work out the code there as they see fit, as they think best suited to their circumstances We do the same here.  I want to rebut the argument that we do not deal fairly from the point of view of income tax with the lower paid workers and I make the point that at the lower end of the scale the income taxpayer here is treated more favourably than is his counterpart in Britain.</P>
      <P>I do not see how anybody could incorporate a section in a Finance Bill on the lines of this amendment. To me it is quite meaningless.  It is a directive principle, the laying down of a guideline for the Minister to follow in preparing the Finance Bill.  I cannot understand how we could let out a Finance Bill with a section of this kind incorporated into it.  The Finance Bill must lay down precise amounts&mdash; allowances, rates and so on&mdash;and, to me, a section like this would be pointless in a Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister was reluctant about rising to deal with this amendment, but he overcame that reluctance and spent some time talking about things that are not in the amendment. He ended by dealing with the amendment and saying that he just could not see how we could put an amendment like this into the Finance Bill, that it is a directive principle.  What are we doing here?  We are supposed to be legislating.  We are supposed to be laying down directive principles. Is there anything wrong with the Minister accepting the principle that the personal allowance, whatever it may be, is intended to give the named relief to the income taxpayer?  If it is to be a relief of £150, the legislation should provide that that amount of relief is given.  If the real value of that relief is, in fact, corroded because the Government are unable to maintain the real value of our currency domestically, what is wrong with increasing the allowance so that in each year the real allowance is allowed to the taxpayer? Personal allowances were last dealt with in 1954; since May, 1954, to mid-May of this year the Consumer Price Index has risen from 124 to 200.  That is a very dramatic increase in the Consumer <Col N="166" /> Price Index and a corresponding dramatic fall in the value of the allowance then fixed.</P>
      <P>The same is true of the various income tax allowances&mdash;the £45 I have mentioned, the £394 which the Minister is giving in a special year, as dealt with in section 12.  All the various allowances were fixed years ago.  They were fixed because it was thought at that time by the Government, the Minister and the Dáil that it was right to give a named cash allowance by way of relief to an income taxpayer.  In the years since, that relief has been corroded because of the increase in living costs.  What is wrong now in bringing the Minister for Finance, if necessary, up against the fact that in this situation of rising living costs, and so on, there is someone who is always neglected and that is the unfortunate income taxpayer?  It does not matter to the Minister for Finance.  The more inflation you have in this country, the larger will be his revenue as Minister for Finance.  The more you have galloping inflation in this country, the higher the income tax yield will be. The Minister for Finance, as such, never worries about these things because he will balance his Budget without imposing any increased taxation because of a rising income.  The toe that will be pinched is the toe of the unfortunate taxpayer who is supposed to be benefiting by a relief which is fixed years back&mdash;if I take the £45 that a wife earning an income gets&mdash;48 years ago.  Today, in 1968, the relief is precisely the same figure.  So it is with all the other allowances.  I think it is unconscionable.  I know the Minister may say: &ldquo;It is going to cost me money&rdquo;.  If inflation affects our community, why should inflation just benefit the Minister for Finance?  It is a very good curb on allowing that situation to develop if we have some device whereby these allowances are made real allowances irrespective of falls in money values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that the formula I have suggested here is appropriate.  I am sure it is not.  The Minister is entitled in making any debating point he wants to make to ask: &ldquo;How can we put an amendment worded as this <Col N="167" /> is into the Finance Bill?&rdquo; If the principle were accepted maybe it would mean that an adjustment was automatically necessary from year to year to ensure that allowances would have the same value in each year of assessment as they have when they are first decided upon.  I am certain that it is possible to work out something of that kind.  In fact, what I am concerned about is the principle of the amendment and have moved it accordingly.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand how Deputy O'Higgins can in conscience move this amendment, because, as I see it, it is quite meaningless. This Finance Bill is setting out to regulate the income tax and the allowances for the coming year.  The amendment speaks of adjusting personal allowances from year to year.  It speaks vaguely: &ldquo;All personal allowances shall be adjusted from year to year in accordance with Consumer Price Index movements&rdquo;.  I just do not see how that could possibly be administered. I think the Revenue Commissioners would be placed in an impossible position if these words were to be allowed into the Bill.  Does it mean that all the various personal allowances are to be forever more adjusted in accordance with Consumer Price Index movements?  Who is to decide by what amount they are to be adjusted?  In fact, I am surprised that the amendment was allowed on the Order Paper at all because it seems to me to be completely devoid of meaning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>Before section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 134 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the <Col N="168" /> addition of the following subsections:&mdash;</P>
    <P>`(2)  An individual who is a widow having the care of any child shall for the purposes of ascertaining the amount of her assessable income for the purposes of income tax be allowed a deduction from her unearned income of a sum equal to one-fourth of that income, but not exceeding in the case of any individual the sum of £500, provided that the deduction under this subsection shall not be greater than the amount by which the deduction, if any, under subsection (1) hereof falls short of £500.</P>
    <P>(3)  In this section `child' means a child in respect of whom a deduction is allowed under this Part.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment designed to give a measure of increased relief to a widow having the care of a child.  The Minister has made the case that he cannot holus bolus increase all of the allowances, that the cost would be stupendous.  I suggest to the Minister that there is a very strong obligation on him to remove from the scheme of allowances the more vexatious anomalies which exist in it, anomalies which create a sense of acute grievance on the part of those who labour under them.  This is creative of a very unfavourable atmosphere which is socially undesirable, a feeling that people are badly done by as compared with, say, their neighbours, in respect of certain allowances.</P>
    <P>The three amendments which I have put down&mdash;amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 17&mdash;are all designed to remove this chip from the shoulder of certain aggrieved persons in our community. Amendment No.  15 is, as I have said, for the benefit of the widow having the care of a child, a person for whom we ought to feel the utmost compassion.  I hope the Minister is not going to tell me that I am using emotive terms when I speak of compassion in respect of widows and orphaned children.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, there are two rates of taxation operated in this country on most income.  There is the PAYE rate of 5/3d on earned income <Col N="169" /> up to £2,000 and the standard rate of 7/- thereafter.  A pension or a superannuation benefit in the hands of a widow qualifies as earned income and is subject to this lower rate of 5/3d. Therefore, the widow of a man fortunate enough to belong to a superannuation scheme is taxed at 5/3d in the pound.  But the self-employed man who endeavours to provide for his widow and children, to ensure that she shall not be a burden on the community, to face up to his obligations to his dependants, commonly takes out what the insurance companies are now terming a family protection policy.  It is a modest form of provision to make for one's widow, and many of us here possibly have it.  The annuity payable under this policy is taxed at the full standard rate, even if it is only a wretched annuity of £6 or £7.  No matter how modest, it is taxed at the 7/- rate, whereas the equivalent superannuation benefit in the hands of the widow of, say, a civil servant or a bank clerk, somebody in gainful employment during his life, is taxed at the lower rate.</P>
    <P>This is a vexatious anomaly.  I give the Minister full credit for being fully capable of exercising an imaginative and bold approach towards these petty grievances.  I would appeal to him to study the scheme of allowances and rid it of all these pettifogging little distinctions. I am going to refer to another of them on a later amendment. This present one is certainly pettifogging. It could be removed at little cost.  It is something which ought to have a higher priority in the Minister's scheme of things than relief for surtax payers, as introduced in section 1 of the Bill.  That is my complaint against the Minister.  His scale of priorities in respect of such reforms as can be effected at modest cost is awry.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the widow in receipt of an annuity.  There is also the case of the widow who has a modest investment income from, say, Government securities, which she has purchased from the proceeds of an insurance policy which her husband has left her. This relief would largely be for the benefit of the widow of non-superannuated <Col N="170" /> persons outside the scope of employment pension schemes.  I have hedged it with the restriction that the widow who qualifies for the relief would have to have the care of a child. If she has no child or if her children are over 16 she would not get this relief.  It is a reform I would commend to the Minister and I hope he will see fit to introduce it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much at a loss to understand this continual harping by Deputy Byrne on the question of my priorities, the allegation I have got them wrong and his continual reference to the alterations made in the surtax rates this year.  I realised when I set out to do something about surtax rates that what I did would be open to misinterpretation.  I was fully aware of the political risks involved in what I was doing.  But I did not think any attack would be made on me by somebody like Deputy Byrne who knows the score in this regard as well as I do, and probably better because he is more in touch with commerce, business and industry now than I am.</P>
      <P>The simple fact of the matter is that the situation in regard to surtax here was beginning to operate dangerously to our disadvantage where Irish industry was concerned.  I forget the man's name, but some very important man concerned for the future of Irish industry made a speech about this some time ago.  He pointed out that unless we did something Irish industry was going to be at a serious disadvantage in regard to getting the type of people it wanted for certain executive and managerial posts.  What was done in regard to surtax on this occasion and last year was done mainly at the expense of other surtax payers, surtax payers with unearned income.  The amount allocated from the Exchequer, as it were, was a very small part of the whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I want to make a comparison between our situation and that in Great Britain.  Even after we have made the adjustments in the surtax rates I am proposing in this Bill, the amount payable here by income tax and surtax payers over £5,000&mdash;by and large I am taking family circumstances into <Col N="171" /> account&mdash;will still be greater than it is in Great Britain.  There is a Labour Government in office in Great Britain and we must assume they have as keen a sense of social justice as Deputy Byrne or anybody else.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not think it is fair for Deputy Byrne to keep coming back to this aspect of the Finance Bill.  He knows the facts in this regard as well as and probably better than I do.  I knew what I was trying to do would be misinterpreted and that there was a sort of political risk inherent in it. But I knew it was the right thing to do and I did it.  I did not think the attack would come from somebody like Deputy Byrne.</P>
    <P>I do not think this proposal of Deputy Byrne's can be defended.  I cannot see how I could be asked to give a concession in regard to unearned income&mdash;that is what is involved&mdash;to a widow with children which I am not prepared to give correspondingly to a married couple with children.</P>

      <P>They are not different. It is unearned income in both cases.

But if she is, certainly a married couple with children and unearned income would obviously be entitled <i>ipso facto</i> to the same concessions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.16:</P>
      <P>Before section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 139 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the insertion in line 53, after `female person' of `(who need not reside with him)'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I said a few moments ago that the tax code bristled with vexatious anomalies. This amendment to section 139 deals with one such anomaly.  The section provides relief to a widow or widower of £100 to enable him or her to employ a housekeeper to look after the motherless or fatherless children.  For some peculiar reason which I cannot fathom &mdash;it is irrational&mdash;the housekeeper must be resident with the taxpayer in order to qualify for this relief.  The Minister knows that only the very wealthy nowadays can afford resident domestic help and even they find it very difficult to find resident domestics.</P>
      <P>I put down the amendment because last week I was telephoned by a friend whose wife died over a year ago and left him with the care of six small children.  Completing his income tax return a few weeks ago, he claimed this housekeeping allowance in respect of his domestic help who comes in every day while he is out at work, but he is not entitled to this housekeeper allowance because case law, not section 139, stipulates that the housekeeper employed must be resident.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to bore the House with details of this pettifogging complaint. It is one which should not be there. It should be removed and, by accepting this amendment, the Minister can make this section a little more equitable.</P>

It would be difficult to do anything about it in this Finance Bill as by now the various PAYE allowances and so on have been made up <Col N="173" /> and sent out, but I would be prepared to give an undertaking to look at this very sympathetically indeed in connection with next year's Budget and Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>Before section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 141 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the insertion in line 42 after `establishment' of `or is incapacitated by infirmity from maintaining himself'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is another such anomaly.  Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke of it on the Second Stage and it is indeed an anomaly of which I have heard several Deputies complain from time to time.  It relates to the position of the mentally defective or otherwise infirm child.  While such a person remains a child, up to the age of 16, his parents qualify for an allowance of £150 a year.  In passing, at this stage in respect of child allowances, it is right that we should acknowledge that what we have said here this evening about the allowances not having been increased since 1954 is not true of the child allowance: it has been increased over the years.  It was increased last year and I think in the previous year.  It now stands at £150, but as regards the infirm child, once such a child passes the age of 16, he ceases to qualify as a child and there is only available for him the dependent relative allowance, the much lesser amount of £60.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will readily accept that as the infirm child grows older, the cost of his upkeep is greater on his parents, but rather than consider proposing an increase in the dependent <Col N="174" /> relative allowance which covers one's mother-in-law and one's parents and quite a wide field, I felt it would be more acceptable to the Minister if I proposed that the infirm child should continue to be treated as a child as long as he remains infirm and solely dependent on his parents.  As the Minister knows, if he has an income of his own, he will immediately cease to qualify for the allowance.  I commend this to the Minister.</P>

Unfortunately, again it is not possible to do anything this year but I give an undertaking to look very favourably at it in connection with next year's Budget.  Perhaps I could go a little further in this connection and guarantee that unless something unforeseen turns up to prevent me doing so, I shall make this change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter on Second Reading when I asked the Minister for information which I did not really get.  In fact, the information I got came from Deputy Booth.  I take section 13 to mean that originally it was unnecessary for a bank manager to disclose funds held on deposit by a client, provided they did not produce an income of more than £50 per annum.  I am not quite clear as to how long that sum has been fixed but I think that about a year ago the amount payable on a deposit in a bank was about 1½ per cent which, according to a rough calculation, means that a client could have up to £2,500 on deposit without the manager having to disclose that fact to the Revenue authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bank rate at present on deposits <Col N="175" /> is 4½ per cent and I estimate that on this section 13, where the sum is being changed from £50 to £70 per year, a depositor could now have about £1,600 on deposit without the manager having to disclose such fact to the Revenue Commissioners.  Before I go any further than that I should like if the Minister would clarify the position for me, and then I shall see if I have anything further to say on the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are concerned with here is the obligation on a bank to make a return of deposit interest paid.  The lower limit has been at £50 since 1965.  In effect, if the deposit interest payable to any depositor at the moment is less than £50, the bank need not make any return of that deposit interest to the Revenue Commissioners.  Last year we increased the tax-free limit from £50 to £70; in other words up to last year if the person got bank interest to the extent of £50, he did not have to pay any tax on that £50. Last year we increased that limit to £70 so that now anybody who gets bank interest of £70 or less is free of tax on that account.  What we are doing here is bringing two things into line: (a) the first £70 of bank interest will not attract tax; and (b) the manager of a bank will not have to make a return on any amount of deposit interest which is less than £70 in the year.  The background to that is that the £50 was brought in at a time when the Post Office were paying 2½ per cent and was equivalent to a deposit of £2,000 at 2½ per cent.  We increased the Post Office Savings Bank interest to 3½ per cent, which on a deposit of £2,000 was equivalent to £70, and as a consequence the £50 was increased to £70 for that purpose.  Now we are increasing the £50 to £70 for the other purpose as well.</P>

The bank manager should not have to disclose the amount up to a rate of income of £100 a year at 4¼ per cent for such time, if the Minister wishes it so, as the bank rate remains fixed. That will achieve three objects: first, it will increase the amount of deposits, which the Minister will accept as desirable; secondly, it will free the bank from the obligation of having to disclose the investments of its clients up to that sum, at 4¼ per cent, and returning an income of £100 a year.

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 7, after &ldquo;research&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or support any scheme of scholarships, grants or other forms of assistance to persons undertaking research provided such schemes are offered for public competition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to simplify to some extent the purpose of section 14.  Section 14 is amending section 244 of the Income Tax Act of 1967.  It makes an allowance for scientific research, and while the Minister's proposal is to be welcomed and would have our support I wish to amend it. It reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...&ldquo;(2A)  Where, on or after the <Col N="178" /> 6th day of April, 1968, a person carrying on a trade&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) incurs non-capital expenditure on scientific research or pays any sum to a body or university referred to in subsection (2) (b) in order that the body or university may undertake scientific research.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the words in my amendment above be added.  In relation to the reliefs allowed under the income tax code, if the idea of research, not merely confined to universities but research which can be undertaken outside the universities is the proper kind of activity to be encouraged, and if it is embarked upon, it should qualify for the same kind of allowances as are provided in section 244 in respect of scientific research.</P>

      <P>The amendment is pretty clear.  I understand that in previous legislation of this sort the date of the Budget was, in fact, the date of operation.

      <P>I do not want to be difficult about this but the invariable practice has been that concessions granted become operative only from the date of the passing of the Act. There has been one exception only and it involved a case where it was realised hardship was being inflicted and, therefore, the concession was made retrospective.  Otherwise, the rule has always been that the date of the passing of the Act was the operative date. There is no difference here, this being a concession of the type with which we normally deal.  For instance, nobody could say: &ldquo;You announced this in your Budget speech and, therefore, I decided to die immediately afterwards.&rdquo;  That situation could not arise.  People might say: &ldquo;This was announced in your Budget speech and, therefore, I anticipated such and such a situation.&rdquo;  In that case there would be some justification for making the <Col N="182" /> provision operative from the date of the Budget but that does not arise in this instance.  The invariable practice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been the invariable practice.  The Minister knows the 1966 Act in which the concession was from the date of the Budget&mdash;there was a hardship case involved. I am sure the Minister would not ask me to mention the hardship case which brought this to my notice. If he needs it I will give it to him afterwards.  Very grave hardship will be imposed if this is not amended to make it retrospective to the date of the Budget.  In addition, we must recall that the Minister said that somebody could not say to him that because the matter was announced in the Budget speech the person had acted accordingly.  The main feature of this would be against the Minister.  It would be the other way round.  For that reason I ask the Minister to have another look at it.  There was good reason for putting down the amendment and because the cost to the State would be very small, the Minister should reconsider it.  Throughout the afternoon he has been making the argument that to do certain things would cost the State too much and I am hoisting him on his own petard in this matter.  This would cost very little and I ask him to have another look at it.  If he prefers to bring in an amendment of his own, worded in a different way, I am prepared to withdraw this amendment, but there is no good reason why the principle should not be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>Before section 26, but in Part III, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 10 of the Finance Act, 1894, as subsequently amended is hereby repealed, and in lieu thereof the following provisions shall take effect:</P>
      <P>`(1)  Any person aggrieved by a determination of the Revenue Commissioners regarding the value of an estate, or of any part of an estate, for death duty purposes, or regarding the rate of tax charged on any such estate or part of an estate, as the case may be, shall be entitled to appeal to the Appeal Commissioners appointed under section 156 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, on giving notice within twenty-one days of issue of a determination by the Revenue Commissioners in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Appeal Commissioners shall from time to time appoint <Col N="184" /> times and places for the hearing of such appeals.</P>
    <P>(3)  The provisions of sections 416 to 419 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, shall, so far as appropriate, apply to all such appeals.</P>
    <P>(4)  Any person who is aggrieved by a determination of the Appeal Commissioners in any such appeal may, on giving notice in writing to the Revenue Commissioners within ten days after such determination, require that his appeal shall be reheard by the Circuit Judge in whose circuit the estate of the deceased person is situate.</P>
    <P>(5)  The said Judge shall with all convenient speed rehear and determine the appeal, and his determination thereon shall be final and conclusive, subject to the right of the appellant or the Revenue Commissioners to have a case stated on any point of law for the opinion of the High Court.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>This deals with appeals provision in cases where there are disputes as to the value of an estate for purposes of death duty&mdash;disputes between the personal representatives of the deceased and the Revenue Commissioners.  The present appeal provisions are most inadequate and as will be seen from the amendment they hark back to the British Finance Act of 1894.  Subsequent amendments to it were also British amendments of 1896, 1909 and 1910.  There has been nothing since then.</P>
    <P>The position is that where the value of the estate does not exceed £10,000 appeals in dispute as to value lie only to the High Court.  Where the total value is less than £10,000, the appeal is to the circuit court.  As a result of the impact of inflation, the cases in which disputes arise are usually of a substantially greater total value than £10,000.  Appeal to the High Court is cumbersome and expensive and there is great need for less formidable and less expensive forms of appeal for members of the public.  The type of dispute I have in mind is one with which the Minister is familiar&mdash;the value of shares in unquoted companies, <Col N="185" /> the public house at the corner being a small limited company.</P>
    <P>In my view and in the view of others who know about this, there has been a considerable stiffening in the attitude of the Estate Duty Office on valuation matters in recent years and I regret to have to say it, but I must, I believe the cumbersomeness and the expense of the appeal machinery is being exploited by the Estate Duty Office to the disadvantage of members of the public who may be affected. The Estate Duty Office go through the motions of discussing the pros and cons of cases, then the papers are folded up and the people concerned are told: &ldquo;Take it or leave it.  You can take it to the High Court but it will take a long time and it will cost a hell of a lot of money&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to give a right of appeal in the first instance to the Appeal Commissioners but it does not suggest that we take from the ultimate right of appeal to the courts.  There is a cast iron case for this amendment.  The valuation limit under which one could go through the less expensive and less cumbersome form of appeal to the circuit court is £10,000</P>
    <P>This limit of £10,000 was set in 1894 and&mdash;again this is relevant to all that has been said here on previous amendments in the past few hours&mdash; yardsticks, measures of cash value which were set years ago ought to have kept pace with inflation.  Clearly, the intention of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he brought in the Act of 1894, was that in the really big estates there should be the right of informal, easy appeal to the lower court.  I am suggesting that this appeal should be to the Appeal Commissioners and that if either side is dissatisfied with this there should be appeal from that to the circuit court and thereafter, on a point of law, to the High Court if necessary but only on a case stated on a point of law.  My argument is reinforced by the fact that the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which is my professional body and the Minister's has urged this particular change and it is one which I commend to the Minister.</P>

Deputy Sweetman is often critical of the Office in that respect not indeed of the individual officers but just of the Office and of the system.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that if we were to insert this additional cog into the machine it would only have the result of slowing things up even more.  At the moment the Office exercises a certain discretion on the basis of their experience and on the basis of precedents. If the Office had to operate on the basis that everything was going to go to Appeal Commissioners it seems to me that a great deal of the discretion which they exercise would be removed and they would have to look on things in much greater detail and be absolutely certain that the law is being adhered to to the nth degree and that in fact there would be greater delay and perhaps less flexibility than there is at the moment in dealing with cases.  The situation at the moment is that anybody who really feels aggrieve can go to court.</P>

      <P>I really do not think that the insertion of a new factor such <Col N="187" /> as Appeals Commissioners into the situation would help.  It certainly would not help to get things done with greater expedition.  It would only serve to accentuate what delays there are at present and indeed I feel that it probably would have the opposite effect to that which Deputy Byrne seeks to achieve namely if the officers were operating on the basis that there was an Appeal Commission there to which practically every case would be appealed they would probably be much more rigid and less flexible than they are at present.  We shall think about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hasten to assure the Minister that my concern is not with regard to the time factor at all.  Deputy Sweetman, of course, knows far more about the delays than I do.  The Minister will appreciate that I am at one remove from the Estate Duty Office in matters of share valuations but it is true that as a result of the impact of inflation the shop on the corner is now, if it is a limited company, as it is quite likely to be, involved in this valuation exercise and I believe that there is an academic approach to valuation matters.  One is quoted price earnings, ratios and sophisticated statistics of what happens on the London Stock Exchange, what yields are available on the London Stock Exchange and gigantic companies when one is concerned about the valuation of a two-pence halfpenny business in rural Ireland.  This is a situation which is far removed from reality.</P>
      <P>It is very desirable that where personal representatives in any estate are aggrieved there should be, as was envisaged by the 1894 Act, an informal and inexpensive appeal machinery available to them.  If nothing else I would suggest to the Minister that the ceiling of £10,000 above which one goes to the High Court rather than the circuit court laid down in the 1894 Act ought now be jacked up to £50,000. Such a provision would go a long way towards meeting my point in the matter.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>Before section 26, but in Part III, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment the first £7,500 of any estate shall be exempt from estate duty where it is shown that at least 50 per cent of the assets of such estate are invested in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is very much on the same lines as an amendment I moved 12 months ago.  I believe and I have always believed in the abolition of estate duty.  I know it would be only wishful thinking on my part to bring in an amendment suggesting the total abolition of estate duty with all the benefits that would accrue from it because it would not have any chance of acceptance whatsoever.  Last year I introduced an amendment something on these lines.  I have extended the scope of it somewhat this year in the somewhat vague hope that the Minister might see his way to accept it, or at least accept the principle in this particular amendment. I have always felt that any reliefs we give in this country, any of the benefits we confer on taxpayers ought to be made as equitable as possible.  I can never accept the fact in regard to the rate that is payable in income tax, if somebody is a few pounds over that rate, that he has to pay the full amount whereas anyone who comes within the scope of the particular relief is entirely free.  Therefore, any sum which is remitted as estate duty, no matter what that amount is, to my mind is not equitable unless it is deducted from the whole estate.  That is the kernel of this amendment and the principle I want to establish here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never had from any Minister for Finance, although I have mentioned this in the lifetime of several of them, a number of different members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have been in <Col N="189" /> Government over recent years, a satisfactory reply from any one of them as to why this sum should not be deducted from the overall estate.  I have had long explanations of the different reliefs given under different sections of the Act but there has been no real explanation as to why what I suggest should not be adopted.  I said I had altered my amendment slightly so as to ensure it would have the widest coverage possible.  My fundamental reason for introducing this amendment, apart from the relief that it gives to the taxpayer, is that I believe that any fundamental relief we give in relation to estate duty will ensure an inflow of capital into this country.</P>
    <P>I believe that in any fair sized industrial town in England the amount of income tax and surtax paid would very nearly reach the total amount paid in such sums into the revenue of this country.  When we realise we live alongside what was once a rich industrial nation&mdash;it still has considerable financial resources at its disposal and considerable financial investment and also an inflow of capital&mdash;our aim and object should be to induce people to live here and spend the latter part of their days here and to invest money in this country from which the State would receive a considerable return. It was mentioned the other day in reply to a Parliamentary question that the total revenue in estate duty in this country was £6 million.  The Minister knows as well as I do that is a very fluctuating figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fairly constant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It could fluctuate quite a lot.  I do not want to mention anybody who has a lot of money who is likely to die but it could vary from year to year.  Even if it reaches £6 million we spend enormous sums of money trying to induce industrialists to come in and set up industries here.  The other day the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Colley, brought in legislation increasing the amount from £30 million to £40 million.  When compared with that, £6 million is not very big.  If the Minister were to accept my amendment, <Col N="190" /> it would induce people to come here to live, to build houses which they would have to do because there are no houses big enough for them to live in, give employment and as such give the Minister a big return in income tax. Also the majority of the people I have in mind, who are the wealthier type of people, would have estates far in excess of £7,500 a year, which is the modest sum I mentioned in my amendment.</P>
      <P>I submit to the Minister that he would be taking a courageous step to accept my amendment.  I submit further that the covering clause I inserted, half of the estate, subject to this amount being limited from the total estate, should be invested in this country.  If the Minister pauses to think for a moment, he will see that I am offering him a gift horse for not alone have I said in my amendment that it should be invested in this State but in Ireland.  For the purpose of my amendment I am suggesting that we should treat this nation as one.  If this 50 per cent of the investment was in the State as a whole, in the Six Counties as well as the 26 Counties or, as in those days I understand the Government prefer to call it, Northern Ireland, the Minister will see that those benefits will accrue to us here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Estate duty has not been a success in any country.  In fact, the tendency is, although I have been told to the contrary by different Ministers here, to do away with it.  It has not achieved the object for which it was intended. Estate duty is a confiscation of capital and nothing else.  In addition to that, it inflicts tremendous hardship and it inflicts more hardship on the middle-age group and particularly on the middle-income group than any other section of society.  Some years ago very few people were involved in estate duty.  It was not popular to talk about it.  There were no voting capabilities in regard to it but now practically everybody in this country who is thrifty enough to save money, who has a small estate, a small shop or a well-stocked farm comes within the ambit of this estate duty.  I want to point out to the Minister, if he does not know it already, and, perhaps, being a city <Col N="191" /> Deputy he would not realise it as much as a rural Deputy who has to deal with a more mixed fraternity than many of the Deputies in the city, and perhaps where people are not as well off and have to struggle to make ends meet, that the people in rural Ireland are very much aware of this hardship.</P>
    <P>I have introduced this amendment for three years running.  In fact, I put it down for four years and I think I am more or less flogging a lone horse on my own.  The Minister would be surprised at the same time at the number of people who have written to me and thanked me for what I am trying to do, which they believe is right not alone in the interest of the individual but of the State as a whole.  They have expressed considerable surprise that Ministers for Finance have not acceded to this very modest request I am making.  I would be quite happy to settle with the Minister on this amendment if he would agree to deduct a lesser sum, say £5,000, which is the sum which is free of income tax now, and surely by doing that he would only be doing something equitable and just. Why should a person whose estate is £5,100 have to pay a rate of estate duty where somebody with £4,998 pays nothing?  In all seriousness I ask the Minister to accept this amendment, to give it favourable consideration and create a new line of thought and advance in our estate duty laws in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shudder to think what Deputy Byrne would say about my priorities if I were to make any substantial inroads in the revenue available to me in order to give an across the board concession, because the tax concession Deputy Esmonde is now advocating would of course apply to all estates.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would apply to estates of £500,000, £100,000, and so on.  I do not think that Deputy Esmonde would get Deputy Byrne at least to agree with him.  There are several different points of view I could <Col N="192" /> put forward in reply to the case made by Deputy Esmonde.  One point I want to mention is that the condition that 50 per cent of the estates should be invested in Ireland is not relevant. There are very few estates liable to duty in which less than 50 per cent of the assets are not situated here.  In the financial year 1966-67, at least £27 million of the gross total of £34 million represented property which was situated in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The concession the Deputy proposes would apply to everybody. I want to suggest that we are going about this in the right way in what I am doing.  We are dealing with cases where hardship would arise in the operation of the estate duty code. That is, where a widow and children are left we are making substantial concessions in their case.  That is the way to tackle this problem.  If Deputies can point out that the operation of the code is causing hardship, then I think we should try to deal with the particular cases of hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the only real case of hardship that arises under the code is where a man dies leaving a widow and children, and where perhaps the estate duty provisions cut too severely into the estate he leaves behind, to the detriment of his widow and children.  We are making fairly generous provision on this occasion to deal with that type of case.  The across the board type of exemption which the Deputy proposes would be very expensive and would not really be justified because there are quite a few estates on which estate duty could be levied with no hardship to anybody. The whole concept of estate duty, as I understand it, when it was introduced first was that an estate was as it were, looked at as if it were in a vacuum.  It does not belong to anybody. The person to whom it was left does not own it yet.  You levy tax on it because it does not belong to anybody.  That is the fairest type of tax.  There are philosophical arguments <Col N="193" /> into which I do not want to go but what the Deputy suggests would be very expensive and would not be channelling alleviation into the sort of situation he would wish.</P>

The main point here is that I understand there are some companies which are not quoted and which investment trust companies would like to help along by investing in them with a view to eventually floating them and having them quoted on the Stock Exchange.  The original figure of 95 per cent for quoted securities would undoubtedly be restrictive and would limit the scope for these trusts to help along companies not quoted on the Stock Exchange.  We have been urged very strongly to make it 85 per cent, as we are now proposing.</P>

      <P>The above amendment is moved on behalf of Deputy Cosgrave.  My amendment, No. 31, reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 19, line 18, to delete &ldquo;Minister for Finance&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the idea behind Deputy Cosgrave's amendment and my amendment is the same.  As the section stands at the moment, it appears to give very arbitrary powers to the Minister.  It enables him to authorise relief in respect of any period provided by the section notwithstanding that the conditions in subsection (2) are not observed. There may be a reason for giving such a power but it seems to me that, if that power is put into the Bill, it should not be exercised by the Minister. <Col N="197" /> If it is exercised at all, it should be exercised by the Revenue Commissioners. That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This relief is something very new.  We are trying to meet a certain situation which has arisen and which is causing difficulty.  We are prescribing fairly rigid conditions.  In fact, already, as Deputies can see, we have had to change some of the conditions because it was pointed out by persons with practical experience and knowledge that the conditions we prescribed were unworkable.  The very stiff conditions we are laying down would, I am afraid, make the relief unworkable in marginal cases.  Some particular company here may fail marginally to meet some of the requirements we are laying down.  In that situation, it seemed desirable to us, as the relief was new and experimental, that the Minister should have the discretion, where some particular organisation just fails to meet some of the conditions, to authorise the relief.  I do recognise that, as the Bill is drafted, this might raise a suspicion that the Minister for Finance might authorise the relief without anybody knowing anything about it.  My solution to the dilemma is in amendment No. 32 which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In page 19, subsection (3), line 21, to add to the subsection &ldquo;and notification of any authorisation under this subsection shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as soon as may be after it is given&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing that the matter be left as it is&mdash;that the Minister have this discretion and that, if he exercises it, <Col N="198" /> he must publish the fact in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> so that the whole world can see what has happened.  I think that might meet the difficulty which both Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Cosgrave foresee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is undoubtedly an improvement on the subsection as it was but the principle is still the same.  Quite frankly, I think it is undesirable, in a matter of this kind dealt with in the Finance Act &mdash; as it will be &mdash; relating to corporation profits tax, that statutory conditions, in effect, may be waived by the Minister himself.  Even accepting the Minister's amendment, even carrying an obligation that the Minister will publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> that he does so, it is not desirable, in matters of this kind, which may involve a very considerable amount of money, that that should be at the sole and unfettered discretion of the Minister which, in effect, means waiving statutory conditions.  I agree with the point the Minister makes that this is experimental. I can understand that and for that reason, I can conceive a situation in which the Revenue Commissioners are removed from the political arena and where they might be allowed, in the circumstances, to act within the policy set out in the section.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that his colleagues are very adamant from time to time that the Revenue Commissioners be given no discretion. That is a theme I have heard very often from Deputies on the benches opposite.  At least I am politically amenable.</P>
