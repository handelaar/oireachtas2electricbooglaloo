      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>In my meeting with Mr. Wilson we had a discussion on developments in relation to the European Economic Community since the Council meeting on the 18th and 19th December, including the various proposals which have been put forward with a view to bringing the applicant countries closer to the EEC and maintaining the momentum of the movement towards expansion of the Community.</P>
      <P>We also discussed British restraints on external investment and had a useful exchange of views on international affairs generally of interest to both our countries.</P>
      <P>The question of a general revision of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was not discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the position whereby, as he now states, we will not be in the EEC Community until, perhaps, the mid-seventies raises the question of the future of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement which, I understand, was drawn up on the basis that this country would be part of the EEC by 1970?  Does the Taoiseach accept that we will be in the position now that we will be subject to the full rigours of the British economy before we can have the protection of the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Free Trade Area Agreement between this country and the United Kingdom will not come into full effect before 1975.  I stated repeatedly, in the course of our negotiations for entry to the EEC, that we would try to import into any arrangement we made with the EEC the same interim period, that is, up to 1975, to coincide with the period provided for in the Free Trade Area Agreement. I do not think there is any thing inconsistent in my approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there any discussion on the proposed interim arrangement between the EEC and Ireland and the interim arrangement between Britain and the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we had a general discussion on the suggestions that have been made since, including the Benelux and German proposals. Since then, a meeting has taken place between the French President and the German Chancellor and certain proposals have emerged.  They are not very precise yet.  They have not been published.  I understand these proposals, and very likely the Benelux proposals, will be discussed by a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the EEC in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no question of coming to an agreement.  The purpose of my visit was to have an <Col N="1369" /> exchange of views with the British Prime Minister, to get his views so far as I could get them and give him my views so far as I could do so.  As a result of the discussion, we were able to form more firm impressions about the trend of events.  There was no question of coming to conclusions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe there is any proposed interim arrangement with an individual country.  Any interim arrangement that might be agreed upon will be with the four applicant countries and even that was widened in the recent Paris talks to include any other country which might want to become a member.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the practical result of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, especially with the prospect of our entry into the EEC far more remote, is that we have given away everything and received nothing in return, that we have exposed Irish industry and received nothing in exchange?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any decision has yet been taken in regard to seeking an interim trade agreement in the EEC pending further development of Ireland's application for full membership of that organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in the House on 31st January, the explorations we have made indicate that there would be difficulties in the way of an interim arrangement with the European Economic Community independently of other applicants for membership, and of Britain in particular.</P>
      <P>These difficulties include:</P>
      <P>(1) the question of the compatibility with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of an interim arrangement with the European Economic Community which would take account of our existing trading arrangements with Britain, and</P>
      <P>(2) the difficulty of securing worthwhile concessions in the agricultural field because of the operation of the Community's common agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that it has been reported that, as a result of the meeting in Paris last week between the French President and the German Chancellor, the Foreign Ministers of the Six are to meet on 29th of the present month to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the possibility of arrangements between the Community and the applicant countries designed to develop commercial exchanges between them. Further developments will depend on the outcome of this meeting and the attitude of the other applicants thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it from the Taoiseach's reply that there is to be no interim trade agreement <Col N="1371" /> or no attempt to get an interim trade agreement with the EEC unless it is in conjunction with the other applicant countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it is the impression now that such an interim arrangement would have to apply to the four applicant countries.  There is no certainty about that.  That is the impression we have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that it is possible, if the Irish Government so desire, to make an interim trade agreement with the EEC and would he not consider doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We could do that of course and shut ourselves out of the British market if we liked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss with the British Prime Minister the possibility of Britain accommodating such an arrangement, a separate agreement with the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we have discussed that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was agreed that there were certain difficulties in the way because of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and because of our membership of GATT as well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach raise with the British Premier the possibility of such adjustment of the Free Trade Area Agreement to accommodate a separate interim agreement with the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would take months of negotiation.  There would be no point in discussing it at a meeting lasting a couple of hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention to pursue this possibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the House this week and last week that, as far as I can understand, the possibility of an <Col N="1372" /> interim arrangement will have to provide for all four.  We cannot make an interim arrangement with the Community unless they wish to do so with us.  We understand it would not be possible for a single applicant country to make such an arrangement at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is what the Taoiseach has just said not tantamount to saying that we are tied hand and foot to the British economy and are not able to make an agreement at present without the consent of the British Prime Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit readily that we could throw overboard the British market for industrial goods and agriculture, if we liked, and then seek membership of the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether at his meeting with the British Premier he raised the issue of the release of all British State papers concerned with relations between the two countries, as a result of the changes announced recently by the British Government; and whether, in particular, he requested the release of all papers connected with courts martial of 1916 leaders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position that the Government welcome the recent British decision to release all the papers on the other side of the 30 years embargo?  Does the Government welcome the release of all the necessary papers in connection with the negotiations in the period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What the British have decided does not mean the release of all the Anglo-Irish papers.  First of all, the release of any papers more than the 30 years term will have to depend upon the Lord Chancellor.  In <Col N="1373" /> certain cases the term is altered up to 100 years in the area they call &ldquo;sensitive papers&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know for a fact that even in Britain itself papers dealing with court martial proceedings are not released unless after 100 years. I may also tell the House I am aware of representations made on behalf of relatives of one of the executed leaders of 1916 for the release of certain papers in connection with the court martial of the leader.  That application was refused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of an underground rail system in Dublin to relieve congestion on the roads would be a matter for consideration by the planning authority in the first instance. The provision of an underground railway has not been recommended either by Professor Myles Wright in his report on the planning and future development of the Dublin Region or by Professor Schaechterle in his Report on Dublin Traffic Planning.  So far as I am aware no detailed examination of the technical or economic implications of such a proposal has ever been made.</P>
      <P>Experience abroad suggests that the capital cost would be enormous and that such a system would incur heavy losses which would have to be met by subsidies.  Morever, it is likely that even if social as well as economic costs and benefits were taken into account, the provision of an underground rail system could be justified only in cities much larger than Dublin.</P>
      <P>Some experts have suggested that the prerequisite condition to justify an underground rail system would not exist in cities of less than one million inhabitants.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the implication that the independence of Radio Telefís Éireann is not adequately secured by existing legislation.

Therefore, I think it is advisable to continue the present situation in which there is an annual Estimate discussion, such as there was last year.  I made a speech at the conclusion, none of which was contested or disagreed with by any Member of the House, and this is the best way whereby Deputies can give their consensus of opinion on RTE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 13th May, 1966, Dublin Corporation refused to grant outline permission for the construction of five 14-storey and four 4-storey blocks of flats comprising approximately 600 dwelling units on the site in question, together with ancillary shopping development on the road frontage.  An appeal against the decision <Col N="1386" /> was made to the Minister for Local Government.  One local resident made representations to the Minister while the appeal was under consideration by him.  The Minister by order dated 22nd September, 1966, granted the outline permission sought subject to nine conditions designed to improve the appearance and layout of the proposed development and to protect the amenities of other property in the vicinity.  I have no power to reconsider or modify this decision.</P>
      <P>I have received appeals from local residents against the decision of the Corporation on 24th November, 1967, to grant full permission subject to conditions for flat development on the site in general accord with the outline permission referred to.  I have also received appeals from local residents against the Corporation's decision on 21st December, 1967, to grant approval subject to conditions for the commercial development proposed for the frontage of the site.  An oral hearing of the appeal has been sought and this will be arranged as soon as possible.</P>

Very often, as in this particular case, the local residents have no knowledge of the appeal.  Will the Minister set up some sort of procedure in the Department to enable a matter of that kind, where there is an appeal by the planners against the decision of the local authority, so that the local objectors will have notice of the planning appeal and may be able to attend if they wish?</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to a previous question on the subject, the extent to which existing legislation may be inadequate to enable the Dublin city section of the Grand Canal to be closed temporarily to permit Dublin Corporation to lay sewerage drains under the canal and to restore the canal over the drains is being examined.  The question of introducing legislation will be decided in the light of the outcome of this examination for the purposes of which the Corporation is consulting with CIE.</P>
      <P>The agreement to the temporary closure is in principle only until it is established that a scheme which will permit the restoration of the canal is feasible.  The planning of the scheme is proceeding on this basis.  I could not, at this stage of planning, give any indication as to the length of the probable period of closure.</P>

Projects involving an annual investment of less <Col N="1400" /> than $100,000 will not be affected and special consideration will be given to problems arising in relation to work already in progress and to commitments under binding contracts.

      <P>The pensions of gardaí who retired before or during 1960 have been increased on a number of occasions since then, with the result that, in the typical case of a garda who retired on full pension early in 1960, the total <Col N="1401" /> increase in pension has been 42 per cent, that is, from £263 to £374 a year.</P>
      <P>The pensions of Garda widows have been increased likewise and, in addition, the minimum widow's pension has been increased from £59 in 1960 to the current rate of £150 a year.</P>

      <P>The scheme of free electricity provides an allowance of 100 units of electricity free and relief from the fixed charge in each two-monthly period for any eligible registered consumer of electricity who is receiving old age or blind pension, or, being aged 70 or over, widow's contributory pension from my Department.  To qualify, the pensioner must reside alone or with the following classes of person only&mdash;a wife, an invalid husband or other invalid person who ordinarily resided with the pensioner, other old age or blind pensioners, a child or children under the age of 16 for whose maintenance the pensioner is ordinarily responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> In January last these classes were expanded so that, in future, an eligible pensioner who is an invalid or semi-invalid or is so infirm due to age as to require constant care and attention may qualify for the allowance where another person resides with him for the purpose of providing that care and attention, whether or not that person is a relative and paid for that purpose.  In addition, a child over the age of 16 years, if school going full-time, or a person receiving retirement pension from Britain or Northern Ireland if aged 70 or over, residing with an eligible pensioner, will not disqualify him for the allowance.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of the amendment of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pensions Scheme made under section 6A of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938 by:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the deletion of the existing sub-clause (4) of clause 5 of the Scheme with effect from 7 July, 1966, and</P>
      <P>(2)  the insertion of the following sub-clause in place of the deleted sub-clause (4) of clause 5:</P>
      <P>(4) (a) Where a member of the Oireachtas is eligible for a pension under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts, 1938 to 1960, only so much of the service necessary to qualify such member for the said pension under the said Acts shall be taken into account in the calculation of the amount of pension payable under this scheme or in the calculation of the period of ten years referred to in (1) (a) of this clause, as equals in length the period of the member's service from 1 December, 1960, to the day on which he ceases to be a member of either House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) This sub-clause shall be deemed to have applied to all <Col N="1407" /> pensions in course of payment on 7 July, 1966, with effect from that date as well as to all pensions becoming payable after that date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is difficult to explain this matter, but I think I can say it arises out of a problem of interpretation.  Under sub-clause (4) of clause 5 of the Scheme as approved by both Houses in December, 1960, no service in respect of which a Member received a pension as Minister or Parliamentary Secretary could reckon for Member's pension.  On 7th July, 1966, this provision was amended to allow the reckoning for Member's pension of any service as a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary during which the Member had paid contributions to the Fund.  It is now proposed to amend the provision further to allow the reckoning for Member's pension of so much service qualifying for a Minister's or Parliamentary Secretary's pension, regardless of when this service was given, as is equal to the period during which the Member paid contributions to the Fund, that is, as is equal to the length of service of a Member after 1st December, 1960. It is proposed to introduce this amendment with effect from 7th July, 1966, the date of the original amendment. Perhaps I could attempt to clarify that a little by pointing out that this refers to a Member who had service as a Minister both before and after December, 1960.  In so far as he had service after December, 1960, we propose to allow the equivalent amount of service as Minister before December, 1960, to count for his pension based on his Member's allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the original amendment was designed to ensure that a person who had been a Minister was not excluded from calculating that service for Dáil pension purposes; I do not think there are any Seanad cases.  When this amendment was made initially in 1966, that exclusion was brought in.  Now I understand from what the Minister says that there is another defect, that in certain cases, persons who were then serving as Ministers or after 1960 might be excluded.  In other words, this will cover all ex-Ministers who were excluded <Col N="1408" /> from participating to the extent to which they would normally be entitled to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very glad to hear it.  The Minister asked us to give him section 16 last Tuesday. I deliberately suggested not because I wanted to re-read what had been said.  Having read it again in company with others much more skilled than myself, I can say none of us was able to understand the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This may help.  I apologise to the House for reading it, but I think this puts it fairly clearly. Section 16, subsection (1) of the Bill speaks of the activities of &ldquo;a business&rdquo; of dealing in or developing land.  It has been suggested that the use of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; makes the incidence of the legislation unduly wide.  I want to emphasise at once that in the subsection the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; does not stand on its own.  It occurs only as a part of the phrase &ldquo;business of dealing in or developing land&rdquo;. Accordingly a business of, for example farming land or of holding land as an investment is excluded.  What the subsection contemplates is something which in the ordinary use of language would be described as a trade but does not fall to be regarded as a trade under the Income Tax Acts as they now stand.  We sought to find a more suitable word than &ldquo;business&rdquo; but we have not been able to find one.  It does not at all follow that anything which might be called a business of dealing in or developing land is caught by the subsection.  In order to understand this point the legislative background must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>A builder will normally take a plot of land, build houses on it and dispose of them to purchasers by way of lease or sub-lease.  The Courts have held in effect that, in such cases, the builder is not carrying on a trade and that he is simply acting as a landlord.  He is so regarded as being a landlord because he has not got rid of the whole of his interest in the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Swaine case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from this decision of the courts, everybody would recognise him as engaged in the trade of building.  There is another aspect because of which a tax assessment on him could fail.  He could defeat the assessment by pleading that he did not acquire his interest in the land in the course of his business.  He might say that originally he bought the land for his own occupation or as an investment. As Deputies know, section 6 of the Finance Act, 1935, was enacted to meet these arguments, but it has not proved successful in doing so.</P>
      <P>In section 16, subsection (1) of the Bill, whether &ldquo;business&rdquo; or some other word is used is not really important. The reason is that a business of dealing in or developing land does not, under the subsection, attract tax under Case I of Schedule D unless it is a particular type of such business.  It must be a business which is not regarded as the carrying on of a trade within Schedule D.  Furthermore, it must be a business which would be regarded as a trade within Schedule D if every disposal of an interest in land made by the person concerned was a disposal of his full interest and that interest had been acquired by him in the course of the business.  The matter may be expressed otherwise by saying that the business must be one which in the ordinary way would have fallen to be treated as a trade taxable under Case I of Schedule D but in respect of which it was not possible to sustain the charge, solely because either of the two arguments I referred to could have been advanced against it.  The two arguments, again, are that he did not dispose of his full interest or did not acquire it in the course of the business. It is only where the business would have fallen short of being a trade in this manner that section 16 (1) applies and makes it a trade.  I do not know if that helps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister for reading the note which he received.  I think the Minister will agree with me when I say that the phraseology of this part of the Bill is perhaps the most difficult to analyse that we have had to deal with for some time.  I accept the difficulty that arose earlier for which section 6 of the 1935 Act was enacted.  It was enacted after the Delaney case I think.  The difficulty that arose in respect of that Act subsequently was the impossibility of proving the intention.  Those things I can understand, but it seems to me that the whole phraseology of sections 16 and 17 is such as to create confusion rather than to catch the type of case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I do not think there is much difference between the Minister and myself about being caught.  What worries me is that there will be other cases which it is not the intention to bring within the ambit, but which will be taken within the ambit.  It seems to me that we are running into a danger here by bringing in the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; which we need not run into at all.  I did some chasing after a definition the other day but I failed to find it.  I know I have come across some judgment in which a judge said that &ldquo;business&rdquo; is when a man is busying himself.  You can busy yourself about anything.  If that definition is to be imported into this, even with the addition which the Minister has just indicated, as part of the construction of the sentence, I think we are going to have unnecessary trouble.  We must remember that in the ordinary way &ldquo;business&rdquo; is not imported into the Income Tax Acts.  If anyone were <Col N="1412" /> to say to an accountant or a solicitor that he was carrying on a trade as an accountant or solicitor, the professional man might be a little offended.  I think we are importing this whole conception quite unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>I want, if I may, to put this two other ways which seem to my simple mind to be much simpler ways and I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate whether he thinks his section achieves the same result.  It seems to me that section 16 could be covered exactly by a very simple one-sentence definition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the isolated one would not constitute a trade.  Let me put an analogy to the Minister: I understand that, if an issue of new stock comes on the stock exchange, and the Minister and I each buy in a bit of stock and then dispose of it, that is an isolated transaction. On the other hand, if we make a regular practice of doing this, we will undoubtedly be assessed as people who are dealing in stocks and shares.  It seems to me that same thing would arise here.  I am not the least bit happy about what will happen to the definition of a business. If a business is defined as a person being busy then this will catch the first transaction and it seems to me we will have two unnecessarily complicated sections because we bring in business whereas what we should do is deal with the word &ldquo;trade&rdquo; as it is known in the income tax code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not forget that the man we are talking about&mdash;the builder&mdash;is not carrying on a trade at all, by definition.  The income tax law has said he is not trading.  There is no trade in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister is now dealing with section 18 which is a different section altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's original amendment says that, if it is a trade, it shall not cease to be a trade simply because he did not dispose of the full interest.  As we stand at the moment, it is not a trade at all so that proposition does not really get off the ground.  What the Deputy is saying is, if it is a trade, it shall not cease to be a trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it a trade? The Minister is mixing up two entirely different things.  If, and this is most unlikely, a person goes out and buys a piece of land and resells that piece of land, at the time he bought it&mdash;there is a case in relation to this incidentally &mdash;he was not a builder and had nothing to do with the trade and, at the time he sells, he sells completely at arm's length to someone who is not an accepted company under section 18, then that is a single transaction and, as I understand the Minister, that transaction will not be caught because he is not carrying on a trade.  If a builder buys land and the single buying of that land is not a trade but, if he then sells or leases that land to a company with which he is concerned as a builder, then he will be caught, not under this but under section 18 and I accept that he should be so caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister argues that I am trying to eliminate section 18 but I accept at once the provisions of section 18 because they must be there to ensure that a builder pays tax on his building profits and does not transfer those profits by means of associated persons or, as a layman would say, associated companies, for the purpose of taking the profit out of his building into his company transactions.  I have no doubt whatever that the Minister is right in section 18 because, if that section were not there, there would be an easy loophole for evasion, and that is something none of us would be prepared to stand over.  What the Minister wants to catch is a trade.  What the Minister wants to ensure is that something that is a trade is not called by some other name and, therefore falls outside the ambit of the Bill.  What worries me is that in doing <Col N="1415" /> that he brings in the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; and I am afraid he is thereby opening, quite unwittingly, let me say frankly, a floodgate of trouble both for himself and for all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get too bogged down on this.  Deputy Sweetman's first leg seemed to be that, if a man is carrying on a trade, he shall not cease to be regarded as carrying on that trade simply because he did not dispose of his full interest.  As the law stands at the moment, that man is not considered to be trading at all and, therefore, Deputy Sweetman's first leg cannot come into operation.</P>

      <P>I do not agree, but I say, accepting the Minister's argument for the purposes of argument, it would be far preferable to define that a man buying land and building houses on it is a trader.  The Minister is saying he is carrying on a business, which is entirely different.  It would be much better the other way&mdash;to keep to the trade.  What worries me is that the Minister is creating a new concept in the tax Acts of a business of dealing instead of dealing with all or <Col N="1416" /> some of the activities of a trade of dealing in land.  I should be much less perturbed by it.  I admit freely I did not put as clearly as that the last day what I had in my mind&mdash;I was assisted in expanding my notes by what the Minister said at the beginning.  I cannot put it any more clearly.  Between now and next Tuesday, both the Minister and I had better look at the debate, analyse it and see if we can discover further holes in each other's arguments or in our own arguments even.</P>

    <P>(a) the vendor ceases to retain the leasehold interest acquired by him from the purchaser,</P>
    <P>(b) the vendor disposes, as regards the whole or any part of the land, of an interest derived from the said leasehold interest,</P>
    <P>(c) the vendor, being an individual, dies, or <Col N="1420" /> (d) the vendor, being a company, commences to be wound up,</P>
    <P>that said amount of income tax, or, as the case may be, so much of it as has not already become due and payable, shall become due and payable forthwith.</P>
    <P>(4) In relation to any assessment to sur-tax made on the vendor, subsections (2) and (3) shall apply to so much of the tax charged thereby as would not have been chargeable if no sum had fallen to be taken into account as mentioned in subsection (1) (d) as they apply to so much of the income tax charged by an assessment in respect of the profits or gains of the trade as would not have been chargeable in that circumstance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I understand that the purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the payment of a pension to a judge, who was appointed on a certain date, on his retirement and, as Deputy Donegan said, we on this side of the House are quite agreeable to the proposal.  In so far as that provision in the Bill is concerned, I have nothing further to say about it.</P>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity, and I am glad the Minister for Finance is in the House, to ask the Minister to deal with one or two other cases which are outstanding.  As I think the Minister is probably aware, two circuit court judges retired some time ago without having qualified for full pension.  One served for ten years and in the other case, I think, 13 years were served.  These judges, I would say, have gone out on a comparatively small pension.  They were obliged to retire on reaching the age limit.</P>
      <P>I understand that in Northern Ireland under the Bill dealing with county court judges, who are the equivalent of our circuit court judges, there is a provision which enables a judge, who, but for the provision, would have to retire at the age, I think of 70 years to serve on a further three years if he is not entitled to a full pension; to serve a further three years or to serve until the date on which he qualifies for a full pension whichever first happens.  There is that precedent there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister for Finance is aware of the cases I have in mind and I think probably they came under his notice when he was Minister for Justice.  If I were to put down an amendment to give effect to what I have in mind, I think it would be ruled out of order by the Chair as imposing a charge on the Exchequer, and I am, <Col N="1425" /> therefore, availing of the Second Reading of this Bill to ask the Minister for Justice, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, to put down such an amendment.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that I would be satisfied if the Minister put down an amendment increasing the pensions of the judges I have in mind as from the date of the passing of the Bill.  In other words, I am not seeking retrospective increase from the date of retirement.</P>
    <P>I could go on making a case at some considerable length but I do not think it is necessary.  The facts are that one of the judges served between ten and 11 years and the other has served something over 13 years.  In order to qualify for a full pension, they would, as the Minister knows, have to serve 15 years.  In the Bill which the Minister asks us to approve, we are making provision for the payment of a full pension on a service of ten or 11 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure of the exact period of years but it is short of 15.  It is a little less than 12 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is approximately the same length of service as I have in mind.  In one case, it is something shorter and in the other something longer.  I think the House would approve of such a proposal. I understand that a proposal was considered to grant a full pension in these cases of service of ten years, to give pensions all round in that category. At first sight, that might seem over-generous but some of these people when appointed are fairly advanced in years.  In their case that has its advantages because as a result they bring with them very considerable experience of the law and of people.  I do not think it necessary to put it any further than that.  I consider I am fortunate in that the Minister for Finance is handling the Bill today on behalf of the Minister for Justice and I am sure that if the Minister for Finance approves, there will be no difficulty about putting down the amendment which I suggest we put down on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of special provision for pensions is one <Col N="1426" /> which we find it easy enough to deal with in this House for individual cases, particularly if they are well enough paid, but nobody ever worries about the poor fellow who is a stamp short for his old age pension.  However, I am not opposing what the Minister proposes here but I am just drawing a comparison.  Particularly, I am not opposing it because I am aware that unemployed judges do not find it easy to get employment.  They are not the most popular people in the world, and unless they manage to get on to a board of some kind, there are not many openings for them.</P>
      <P>I am interested in what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, particularly in regard to one man whom I know personally. I think he was dealt with unfairly. I do not want to make any political charges but I think it is true that there does not seem to be any reason why he was forced to retire on a meagre allowance except that he was not appointed by the present Government. Representations were made by people on various sides of the House when the occasion arose.  This did not seem to do much good.  There are cases like this one: this man had an excellent record on the Bench.  He was not afraid to make a decision, something that I hold against some of our present-day law givers, those who interpret the law. Very often they seem to give peculiar decisions, but at the time of his retirement this man's record was such that not one peculiar decision could be attributed to him during his period on the Bench.  Despite that, he did not get a minute over the exact time and was allowed to retire on reaching the age limit.</P>

      <P>He knew the conditions of appointment then just as did the person I am talking about.  He accepted the position under the existing conditions and the man I am talking about did the same thing but he gave up a lucrative practice foolishly, possibly because he felt his standing would be greater as a judge.  He was badly treated.  I am not opposing what the Minister suggests but I feel it should be applied to other really hard cases equally affected.  I quite agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that this is the way it can be done now.  If it is not done and since we cannot do it on this side of the House, it will not be done later.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this matter.  Indeed, our view is that the Government are far too restrictive in their support for existing industry. One of the mistakes they have made in their efforts to bring about industrial development is to bend over backwards to give too much to some people from abroad with foreign-sounding names and too little support to existing industries.  For instance, the adaptation grant legislation gives only 25 per cent, and during the time of credit squeeze, that left 75 per cent to be met from profits or from any other source.  The &ldquo;any other source&rdquo; can be quite difficult.</P>
      <P>The extension of time is what is relevant here.  This means that all the prognostications of the Taoiseach, particularly in relation to our entry into the Common Market, have now been proved wrong.  It is only six months since this man, hailed by some as a man of great ability, said we would be in by 1970.  Other people in Europe and Britain had stopped saying that 18 months or two years previously. It is only a few weeks ago since his permanent representative at the Council of Europe and his Ambassador in Paris, when attending a meeting of the Council of Ministers, were left in the position of not being able to say whether or not we were for an interim arrangement of some nature rather than full membership because of a speech the Taoiseach made at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis when he intimated that perhaps this was a possibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related to the extension of time.  It relates to the fact that the Taoiseach does not know where we are going in Europe because his Minister for External Affairs is resident, as Maureen Potter says, not in the past, as some people think, but in New York.  The position is that they do not know where they are going.  The Ambassador in Paris and our permanent representative on the Council of Europe had to attend the meeting of Ministers and did not know what the <Col N="1431" /> position was.  Now we are faced with the fact that the Taoiseach has to admit again by the introduction of this legislation that his ideas about when we are going into Europe are quite wrong.  In fact, the extension of time here asked for is simply a headline and an explanation of how wrong he was. It is interesting to find that a few days ago he went to Downing Street and found there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that what everybody had been telling him for the past three to five years was true and that, as usual, he was at fault.  The great saviour who managed to become Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, not-withstanding the efforts of the Minister for Finance, who is now leaving the House, and all his colleagues, is just another Fianna Fáil failure.</P>
      <P>As far as we are concerned, the adaptation grants are inadequate.  The fact that the length of time to finish the work is being extended is something to which we do not object.  But we wish to avail of this opportunity of saying again that the encouragement and support for industry, very often more in defence of existing jobs than in the creation of new ones, is something that does not seem to attract the attention of Fianna Fáil.  Perhaps it is because it does not give as much political advantage as new industries do.  At the same time, it is almost certainly more important.  We have no objection to the measure.  It is merely a sign of what we knew for some years past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not object to the time being extended, but it does lend point to the argument we have been making that many firms do not seem to be aware that adaptation grants exist at all or, if they are aware, most certainly do not seem to have been very anxious to avail of them. The Minister is aware of this and his reply to a question a few weeks ago would suggest that he knew this was happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the luckiest thing in the world that we were not in Europe before now.  Most certainly we would not <Col N="1432" /> appear to be going in before 1970 or 1975.  It is all right for the Taoiseach at Question Time to say that the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain would only be in full operation by 1975.  He used this as an argument to bolster up his case that the Free Trade Area Agreement is a good one.  We were told that the Free Trade Area Agreement was for the purpose of getting us used to competition so that when&mdash;they did not say &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash;our entry into Europe came we would be ready for it.  Not alone the present Taoiseach but everybody, and particularly his predecessor who was very adamant about it, was saying we would be in not later than 1970.  When they made those statements, they seemed to think we would be able to meet the fierce competition Irish industry would have to face.</P>
    <P>I have heard so many comments, incorrect comments, from Government Ministers that I would like to hear the Minister in charge of the Department of Industry and Commerce make a categorical statement on this.  As things are going now, some of our industries have gone to the wall, even though the Free Trade Area Agreement will not be fully operative until 1970.  At present there is one struggling for existence in Clonmel and the Minister knows the one that went to the wall in Dundalk.  They are all around the place, without counting the failures in Dublin.  For that reason, surely some better effort must be made to counteract this situation?</P>
    <P>The argument has been made that despite the failure of some long-established firms, new ones are coming on which are taking up people who are being made unemployed as a result of the closures.  The unemployment figures prove that that is untrue and there is no use at all in anybody on the Government benches standing up here to say that the unemployment figures were worse, that there were 95,000 unemployed back in the 1954-57 period, or portion of it.  There were.  The number was as high as 97,000 unemployed during that period, but there were 132,000 unemployed during a period when Fianna Fáil were in power.  It does not do any good to recount those figures. <Col N="1433" /> The figures now are the figures which are really important and the figures now are getting out of hand.  If the extension of the period here enabled firms to adapt themselves so that they would be able to take back some of the workers who are being left unemployed, as well as those who are coming on the labour market for the first time, then we would all give the fullest support to the measure before the House.  We are certainly not opposing it but we feel that it has to be taken a lot more seriously, both by manufacturers and by the Government.</P>

      <P>A number of my good friends, manufacturers in County Dublin, have been applying for adaptation grants and I must take this opportunity of thanking the Minister for the intelligent way he approached the applications made by these people.  I shall not say any more except that I welcome the extension and I hope this extension will be responsible <Col N="1434" /> for giving an opportunity to our long-established manufacturers and to our new people also to compete in the international field.</P>
      <P>With reference to another point made by Deputy Tully, every civilised nation in the world has to make agreements with a neighbouring nation as far as trade is concerned.  That is as old as democratic government and anything we on this side of the House and the Government have done has been in the interests of the Irish nation. If, as a result of our experience, we find that this is responsible for unemployment among our friends, we are big enough to change our minds on greater enlightenment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad, and indeed not at all surprised, to find that this measure is being supported from all sides of the House.  This is something that really arises from the fact that due to the exhortation that was given to industrialists to apply for adaptation grants we had such results, and very welcome they were.  However, the fact was that we had a sudden rush of applications in the last few weeks before the closing date and ended up with about the same number of applications on hands as we had over the previous four year period.  Consequently it was not possible to process all of these within the statutory time limit.  Basically this is what is involved in the Bill, to give us an opportunity to extend the time limit to deal with these outstanding applications.</P>
      <P>I should like to comment on Deputy Tully's reference to previous statements about entry into the EEC by 1970.  That statement by him was not correct in so far as he said that it had been said positively that we would be members by 1970.  What was said was that we would be members eventually and I adhere to that&mdash;we will&mdash;but what was said was that 1970 was a realistic date to work to as the date by which we would be members for the purposes of our planning activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously any calculation of matters such as this is dependent on so many factors over which no one individual and no one Government has control that such an estimate can only be an estimate.  Indeed, to my mind, it makes sense that we should operate on that basis.  It would be perhaps stretching things a little to suggest that this Bill will have the effect of creating new employment.  It may well do so but certainly these grants that are being given under this Bill will have the effect of ensuring that existing jobs will continue which would not otherwise continue in free trade conditions if these grants were not applied for and used in the adaptation schemes of the various firms concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Deputy Tully has raised this point, I want to make it as clear as I can&mdash;and I have already tried to do this in this House before&mdash;that the difficulties which have arisen for some firms, particularly in the footwear industry to which Deputy Tully referred, have no connection whatsoever with the Free Trade Area Agreement and that in fact the protection which now exists for the footwear industry is the same protection as existed for it over the past four or five years.  This is correct. The amount of imports into this country in footwear are approximately three per cent of our requirements.  The other 97 per cent is produced at home and very heavily protected.  The difficulties which have arisen in that industry are fairly complex but they relate to the fact that there was a recession in Germany which affected the British manufacturers who were exporting to Germany.  Of course the situation in Britain has not been all that bright and our exporters who were exporting to Britain were forced back into this country and we have a greater capacity in the industry in the country than the home market can absorb.  There are other factors but this is the basic trouble.  Whatever the causes may be of difficulties in the footwear industry, they have nothing <Col N="1436" /> whatever to do with the Free Trade Area Agreement or the reduction of duties because duties have not been reduced in that industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>The question of the creation of new employment is not strictly relevant, but since it was mentioned, may I say that while none of us is satisfied with the creation of new jobs, nevertheless we must not forget that it has been established that in the five-year period 1961-1966 we created almost 12,000 new jobs each year which was a good deal better than interim figures seem to indicate?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to set up machinery to prevent the entry of goods into this country at dumped or subsidised prices.  It is not the object of the Bill to provide further protection for Irish producers, as the word protection is ordinarily used.  To counteract dumping is the more important object of the Bill, since the danger from subsidisation is more remote.</P>
      <P>Neither dumping nor subsidisation may be wrong in itself, but may justly be objected to when it injures a manufacturing or agricultural industry by infiltration into the home market.  The home market may also be threatened by fair competition or by imports from low cost countries.  From the point of view of the Irish producer it is all the same whether he loses his market because of fair competition, low cost imports, dumping or subsidisation, and for this reason producers are apt to complain of dumping when they find that imported goods of the kind they produce themselves are being offered at prices which are lower than their own. Most of the complaints of dumping which my Department has received in recent years have been of this kind, and investigation has shown that the charge of dumping could not be substantiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been little danger of dumping, so far, in this country, because of the high tariff protection.  The <Col N="1438" /> exporter of dumped goods has to lower his prices so as to absorb these tariffs and, for this reason, dumping in Ireland is not in general an attractive proposition.  If, however, prices of Irish goods are unnecessarily inflated to take advantage of the tariff protection, the producers concerned run the risk of losing the home market, either through fair competition or through dumping.  Apart from this, as our tariff protection is reduced because of international agreements, the danger of dumping will increase and so, in order to make provision for the years ahead, it is necessary now to introduce effective, flexible and acceptable anti-dumping legislation.  The powers which the Government already has under the Imposition of Duties Acts can be and have been used to counter dumping. These Acts, however, were designed to facilitate the imposition of protective tariffs and are not ideally suitable as anti-dumping measures.  Duties imposed under these Acts do not bear on their face any indication that they are anti-dumping duties.  The Acts, moreover, are not sufficiently flexible and were not designed to conform with the accepted methods of dealing with dumping or subsidisation.</P>
    <P>It is internationally agreed that countries are entitled to take action against dumping or subsidisation and there is also a fair measure of agreement about the kind of action which may be taken.  Of particular concern to this country are the principles contained in Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the GATT) and the Agreement circulated in June, 1967 on its implementation. Member-States may sign this Agreement if they wish to do so.  A number of them, including Britain, have already done so and it is probable that Ireland will also wish to sign it.  This anti-dumping code of the GATT is of importance to us, first of all, because we have now acceded to the GATT and, secondly, because it is provided in the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain that both countries will observe Article VI in their anti-dumping measures.</P>
    <P>Dumping may take place for different reasons.  A manufacturer may overproduce <Col N="1439" /> and find himself with large stocks.  He does not wish to tie up his capital in holding these and so he has to sell them, even at a loss.  He cannot afford to damage his home market by unloading the goods there and for this reason he dumps them in another country.  A manufacturer may also dump for the purpose of destroying an industry in another country, by taking away its market.  He calculates that he will then have the market to himself and can recoup himself by stepping up his prices.  Dumping may also be motivated by political purposes. A country may not be able to attack industry in another country by direct dumping, because the country is protected by anti-dumping legislation, but it may be able to attack that country's markets in third countries. The kind of dumping most difficult to counter is sporadic dumping, the sudden unforeseeable and massive importation of goods at dumped prices.  The peculiar difficulty of dealing with this kind of dumping is that the damage has been done before action can be taken.</P>
    <P>The fact of dumping is determined by setting the prices at which goods are offered for sale in the exporting country, at any point in the chain of distribution between factory and consumer, against the comparable prices at which these or similar goods are offered, at the same point, for importation into the importing country.  The prices at which local producers offer their goods for sale are not relevant to the question of dumping.  Accordingly, in the Bill two prices are defined, the fair market price (in section 3) which is, in effect, the home market price in the exporting country and the export price (in section 2) which is in effect the comparable price at which the goods are offered for export to this country.  If the fair market price is greater than the export price then there is dumping, and the difference between the two prices is the margin of dumping.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the setting up of a Commission whose members will be appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> This Commission will investigate all complaints of dumping and will make a report to the appropriate Minister. It will be the task of the Commission to establish whether or not there has been dumping and, if there has been, to ascertain the fair market price and export price and, then, the margin of dumping.  The Commission will also investigate whether any dumping which has taken place has caused material injury to an Irish industry and this aspect of the dumping will be considered at the same time as the dumping itself.  It is not enough that there should have been dumping.  It must also be established that this dumping was injurious.  This is a very important principle in the GATT code on anti-dumping legislation.</P>
    <P>What I have just said needs some modification with respect to third country dumping.  It is in accordance with the GATT code that anti-dumping measures may be applied if dumping attacks the market of another country in this country, even though it does not injure a domestic industry. Provision is made for this in section 14.</P>
    <P>It is only in the case of certain evidence to be provided by the Revenue Commissioners that the Commission will have power to require the production of evidence.  In general there is no compulsion on any person or firm to give evidence to the Commission or to appear before it.  This also is in accordance with the international code.  At the same time the decision as to the fair market price and the export price will be made by the Commission, though provision is made for an appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>A distinctive feature of the Commission is that it will have power to effect the refund of any duty which has been paid in excess of the margin of dumping. Governments and Ministers of State are liable to be suspected abroad of using anti-dumping legislation for the purposes of concealed protection. It is desirable, therefore, that the Government's intention, which is also a principle of the international code, that anti-dumping duties in any particular case should not exceed the margin of dumping, will be carried out by an independent body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> Power is also provided whereby the appropriate Minister may impose provisional duties on the recommendation of the Commission.  These duties are provisional in the sense that they have later to be confirmed by the Government. If they are not confirmed, any duties collected will have to be refunded.  The purpose of these provisional duties is to guard the market while the Commission is carrying out its investigation into a complaint of dumping, and such duties would not be recommended by the Commission nor imposed by the Minister unless this action was considered necessary.</P>
    <P>Power is also provided whereby the Government can impose anti-dumping duties, which will be effective from the date of their imposition, or can confirm provisional duties, so that such duties will, in effect, be retroactive to the date of the imposition of the provisional duties.</P>
    <P>All duties imposed under the Bill will be duties of customs and will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Another important feature of the Commission is that its deliberations will be carried out in private and that information given to it will be treated as confidential, if those who give the information so desire.  This provision, which is contrary to the practice in some countries, is designed to protect the interests of those who have to meet an allegation of dumping, and to encourage them to lay all the facts before the Commission.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that there is special provision in the Bill (section 17) to safeguard the glass bottle industry against dumping.  The reason for this is that this industry is peculiarly exposed to the danger of being very greatly injured or destroyed by sporadic dumping.  A single consignment of goods could cause the industry to close down its furnaces and this in turn might force the one firm engaged in the industry into liquidation.  It is not the intention that the safeguards provided in this section, for this one industry, will be extended to any other industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1442" /> The duties which are imposed for the purpose of counteracting the effects of subsidies given in other countries are known as countervailing duties, and these duties will be imposed by the Government.  It will not be part of the function of the Commission to make recommendations in respect of countervailing duties or to examine matters relating to subsidisation as these are more appropriate to the Government.  The Minister, however, will be able to consult the Commission. It should be noted that anti-dumping and countervailing duties are not additive, so that if an anti-dumping duty is imposed to counter dumping, the same element of dumping may not, at the same time, be countered by a countervailing duty, even though the dumping is the result of subsidisation. There are provisions, also, parallel to those for anti-dumping duties, for the refund of countervailing duties to the extent that these exceed the amount of the subsidy.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the imposition by the Government of a retroactive levy.  This levy, which is not a customs duty, may be imposed only on goods to which a provisional duty applies, but may be charged on any such goods which were imported during a period of 90 days before the date on which the provisional duty was imposed.  The purpose of this provision, which is in accordance with the international code which was circulated in June, 1967, is to deal with sporadic dumping, and certain conditions have to be fulfilled before the Government can impose such a levy.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for penalties for giving false information, for the making of regulations by the Minister and for the power of the Revenue Commissioners to require information. Those and other provisions of the Bill require no comment at this stage.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposals of this Bill will give us adequate powers to deal with dumping and subsidisation while at the same time observing the international code, of which I have already spoken.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House agree that this Bill is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1443" /> It is opportune to say that it is a sign of the times.  We have seen the problem in Dunlops of Cork, where many people were put out of employment and there did not seem to be anything that could be done for quite a while. One of the points of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was that there would have to be consultation on such matters with Great Britain which shows how government of this country is moving from Dublin to Westminister.  Nobody can live on an economic island in the sense that one can live on a geographical island.  As we tend to come closer to the greater States of Europe, we have no choice but to prepare ourselves for that eventuality.</P>
    <P>Certain dumping is quite impossible to control.  Dishonest and illegal dumping is impossible to control in the sense that those who send the goods here do not write down the correct amount on the invoices and the handbacks are impossible to control.  Such a procedure is unlikely in the case of exports of large companies but, in the case of exports of certain trading companies and their reception here, there is a very great danger that dishonesty and illegality may occur. If such occurs, it is difficult, except by evidence of the price charged to the consumer here, to find the real import price.  Very often, the extra profit can, in great part, be skimmed off by the operator.  The person here who buys the goods finds himself with a very slight advantage.  Therefore, the commission would have very little evidence on which to proceed with anti-dumping legislation while, at the same time, our industries would be hurt.  We have acceded to GATT and we have signed the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  That means that, as well as the benefits, we have accepted the responsibilities and are prepared to go with whatever their line of country may be.</P>
    <P>If one reads down through this Bill, one will find that many provisions are related to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and to GATT.  In other words, it is not a Bill &ldquo;off-the-hook&rdquo;. It is a tailor-made Bill.  It is a Bill made by a tailor who has had to cut his cloth according to the international <Col N="1444" /> agreements and who has had to fit the suit to the body before him.</P>
    <P>There are companies here which cannot exist under free trade, It is unwise, in a House such as this, to make even any suggestion of what or who they are but it is not irrelevant to remark that the result of a ten per cent reduction in duties has produced, for one company here with a product for which it has complete exclusivity&mdash;it is not the glass bottle industry&mdash;a reduction in its net profit of almost 50 per cent.  The implication I read between the lines in the annual report was that further reductions that must come under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement will spell if not the finish at least great difficulty for that industry.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity to adapt or to cover a complete line of goods.  The industry being a small unit, one can decide to produce just one unit of goods.  This is done.  It is done, perhaps, with the co-operation of the exporting company that might be putting the company in question to the wall.  For many of our companies here, however, that is the only hope.  The defensive measures I spoke about on preceding legislation are highly important. This Bill proves we are no longer expanding sales and establishing new industries.  It proves we are in the trough of the waves in defending existing industries and existing jobs.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem here which is not mentioned in the Minister's speech, the problem of the processing industries.  I refer to the industries here that process products&mdash;very often for re-export&mdash;produced within the country by another industry or imported.  This is a most complex situation.  If we do not allow goods in at a very low price to the first processor, who passes them on to the second, we may find the second processor in grave difficulty.</P>
    <P>I am aware of this problem.  I am being deliberately careful not to indicate the field of activity concerned because it would be wrong and improper if I were, in any way, to create difficulty for any industry within the country.  The whole spirit of this Bill is the imposition of duties to prevent dumping goods which are meant to be consumed here.  There is this question <Col N="1445" /> of re-export and it is one at which we have to look.  Without criticising, but just to get the facts straight, the necessity for the Commission is a direct result of the fact that we have signed the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and joined GATT.  It is necessary now that not only should justice be done by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but, because of our international relations and our future trading, that justice should be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>When the workers in Dunlops were in difficulty, the Minister will agree, he had the duty and responsibility of making this known to his counterpart in Britain so that under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, he could move and place for 18 months anti-dumping control on the importing of tyres.  This is just a fact of the case, but we have a Commission now, not because the Minister's Department could not make the decisions or because the Minister could not then implement them by making his Orders but because it is necessary that our partners in GATT and in Britain can see that this was not a Minister's decision&mdash;which he could be accused of making, as he said himself, for his own purposes&mdash;but that there was a decision made by a judicial commission and one that would not be affected by, shall we say, national patriotisms or by politicians who, in their desire to help an individual industry, might set up anti-dumping legislation to make sure the industry continues. The whole policy, as announced by the Taoiseach on so many occasions, and accepted by everybody in their hearts, is towards free trade with the greater States of Europe, and including our greatest customer, Britain.</P>
    <P>In relation to dumping, you have to think how difficult it is to define &ldquo;dumping&rdquo;.  Anybody who has been in a producing industry knows more and more that you get the situation whereby a fixed amount of goods carry your overheads and your unavoidable expenses and that the production of a further lot of goods then costs one-third or one-half what the first batch cost.  This is particularly true in all the high capital industries.  The glass bottle industry was mentioned and there is a <Col N="1446" /> section in the Bill, which I am very glad to see, to protect this company. It is true of many other things.  When the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement was being put through the House, there was a discussion on the fact that we had two units making electric light bulbs and employing 20 or 30 people on the production side.  If it was desired to spend capital and use a type of unit, as used elsewhere, it was said that four people could produce ten or 15 times as many electric light bulbs as the 30 people could in the two units.  Under free trade conditions, such a unit could not exist.  This is something to which we must face up and realise.  The Minister should tell us what the position is in relation to the glass bottle industry when we do meet up with free trade and how do we decide on what is the home price.  The Minister has defined fair price in section 3 as the price charged to the home consumer.</P>
    <P>Take an industry where you have a high capital input in relation to production and a low labour input and where most of the labour goes on the delivery and selling of the goods, on office staff and so on.  You now get to the stage of an exercise in a balance sheet and a profit and loss account. The accountant in the case is working back from his net profit, through his profit and loss account and his trading account, to the balance sheet, rather than in the opposite way.  You start off deciding what is the price of a glass bottle and in relation to a glass bottle, the price is related more to the export of glass bottles than price fixing.  The price is something that can be fixed, but in free trade conditions, that will no longer apply.</P>
    <P>In my view, this is necessary legislation but when we reach the ultimate stage of free trade within the States of Europe, those involved in these high capital industries with a low labour input, the position will be that talks, agreements, bonding together, rationalisation, take-overs and amalgamations will be the only answer for that sort of industry and you will find that the great moguls of industry in Europe will agree that the Irish unit will only supply Ireland, the Lancaster unit will supply England, the French unit will supply France and so on.  That is the <Col N="1447" /> only picture and any other picture is an artificial one.  One of the reasons for this Bill&mdash;and it is a bit late in arriving and perhaps I am guilty here&mdash;is in regard to the importation of fertilisers. We have a situation whereby fertilisers have been imported in the last few months for use in the spring season because they could be bought cheaper&mdash;and of the same quality&mdash; than those produced here.  Businessmen are businessmen, and if there is one in 20 who are competitors, who takes in a boatload of fertilisers at £2 a ton less, then every one of the 19 must have it because that man is going to pass it on to the consumer at less than the others can afford.  In such a situation, there is nothing that can be done.  Nobody is in business for the colour of anybody else's bright blue eyes.  A businessman has to pay his staff, pay his directors, set aside something for development and so on, and in such a situation dumping exists.  The Minister is late as far as the spring is concerned in introducing legislation to stop the dumping of fertilisers.  I am guilty myself of bringing in a boatload. I had to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have dealt with this question of the fair price and the fair market price.  I just want to sum up by saying that it is quite simple to take the price of a ton of wheaten meal and say what the fair market price is because the price of what goes into it is perhaps 85 per cent or 90 per cent of the price and there is added the labour in producing the goods, grading, cleaning, washing and all the rest, and the capital cost then of the product itself; but if you have this industry which takes in a very low raw material at one end and spews electric light bulbs or glass bottles out at the other end, the great cost is the capital cost of the machine that spews them out at the other end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that this definition in section 3 of home price is just a copybook exercise.  If there is a product <Col N="1448" /> competing against them, if instead of electric light bulbs you have fluorescent tubes, then if there is this alternative product, it is possible to have some control on the cost charged to the producer.  Largely with the high capital industry and low cost raw material industry, the position is that the price charged to the consumer at home is the price he will pay; that is what makes it extremely difficult to decide when a thing is dumped or when it is not dumped.  The Minister did not mention quotas, and of course quotas are part of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate what our present situation is on the reduction and elimination of quotas because, as in the footwear industry, quotas will give complete protection as long as they exist.</P>
    <P>This is necessary legislation: it is a sign of the times.  It is a defence of jobs.  It is something the Minister very properly had to do.  However, it does not mean that there is anything wonderful here for the Irish worker or the Irish industrialist.  It merely means that we are tidying up, trying to keep the job right, and that we are going to have a difficult time doing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But I am not as sure as Deputy Burke obviously is that it will be as effective as we would hope it would be.  The big difficulty is that dumping has to be proven before action can be taken.  This came up in the discussions under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, that no action can be taken unless it can be proven that dumping is taking place. This will be one of the biggest problems, even though the Minister spells out how it is proposed to apply the acid test to it. The price on the home market compared with the price here, that might seem to be a fairly good rule of thumb, but is it the proper way to do it?  For instance, certain factories in Britain at the present time are producing <Col N="1449" /> materials for sale on the home and export markets, and those factories are able to run only about nine months of the year; they have to keep staff and everything else, and overheads have to be carried.  If production continues, it will pay them to sell very much under the normal price, at cost, what they are producing during the off season.  In that case if you take the home market price and compare it with the price here, it is extremely difficult to prove that there is dumping.</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred to sporadic dumping.  This is one of the things that will cause a very big headache.  I am glad the Minister has made provision that even those who do seem to get through the screen can be caught under the 90 days clause, but it may not be possible at all to deal with those, if the dumping is only sporadic.  If somebody takes in a consignment of materials from abroad at dumped prices and unloads it on to the market, it will be very hard to deal with the situation. The Minister may say: &ldquo;That is OK, because there are only one or two consignments&rdquo;. But this can happen again and again all over the place.</P>
      <P>I have no objection at all to the measures which are proposed in this Bill.  The only thing is that the working of the regulations which are suggested will be very difficult.  With the dropping of the tariff barrier over the years, the Commission will be very busy, because, despite what the Minister may think, we know at the present time that dumping is taking place.  Dunlops of Cork have been instanced here, and Deputy Donegan mentioned fertilisers. The big trouble is that dumping is happening and, if it continues to expand following the further reductions in tariffs, the Commission which will be set up will have a very busy time attempting to produce the necessary evidence so that action can be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree&mdash;I would not say &ldquo;tailored&rdquo; is the correct word&mdash;that the Bill had to be confined within certain limitations both in relation to GATT and the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  We understand that, and the fact that there was in existence a <Col N="1450" /> set of regulations from which we could design this legislation was a help rather than anything else.  I would be very much afraid, however, that as the years go by, people will be complaining about the activities of the Commission or of the Government under this sort of Act, because they will feel that if a foreign article is being sent into this country at a lower price, they should be entitled to buy it.  Do not let anybody tell me they will not buy it, because we have evidence already that if there is good material in the article, the natural thing is to buy it before the home-manufactured article.</P>
    <P>I do not know how far it is intended to proceed with this, or if there are some lines of goods which might be excluded.  We had the story during the war of a certain firm in this city who got in a line of goods and sold it and there was a tariff put on which prevented anybody else from getting the same type of goods in.  This firm made a hefty profit out of this sort of thing. That could happen again, and I am quite sure the Minister would not desire that it should happen.  As I say, we have no objection to the passing of this Bill.  We feel it is necessary.  The only thing about it is that, if it had been introduced earlier, it might have saved the trouble which the Minister had to go to in the one or two cases which have already come to his notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The Minister has made an intelligent approach to a very serious problem, a serious problem for our country, for our workers and for our manufacturers. I attended a deputation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on this matter recently.  Other Deputies who have spoken have referred to the Bill as being tailormade.  Every piece of legislation passed in this House has some reason.  The reason for this legislation is the protection of the workers and our industrialists.  As far as I can see, the provisions in this Bill are made in conjunction with other member countries.  It is very hard sometimes to prove that there is dumping, but we are led to believe that this can be done by large foreign industries that are exporting goods to this country <Col N="1451" /> and have a huge output.  If they make a big profit on 90 per cent of a line and dump the remainder they can injure our small industries.  That is what we have to guard against.  This anti-dumping Bill is introduced in an intelligent way.  It will help our workers and it will help our industries.  I can see that it will be hard to prove that there has been dumping.  The day is not far distant when a number of our small industries will have to look at what they are doing, and will have to go in more for co-ordination amongst themselves in certain competing lines.  Now that they have the adaptation grants, they will be in a position to counteract much of this dumping that was going on, especially in large industries.  Could they not take a reasonable profit on 50, 60 or 70 per cent of the goods they sold?</P>

      <P>I have not much more to add to what I said on the last occasion.  As I said before, it is grossly ridiculous that at present we have too many of these outside commissions and bodies dealing with business that should in the ordinary way be dealt with by the Department to which they are attached.  I see no justification whatever for setting up a further commission with further bills for the tax-payer to pay.  I did not have the opportunity of looking up what these commissions are costing, or how many of these legal gentlemen sit around a table for half an hour in the month at a cost of £50 or £60 a man.  I do not believe they would walk very far for that at present.  I do know how far Deputy Fitzpatrick and his friend <Col N="1452" /> Deputy L'Estrange went when I was speaking here on the last occasion.  I will say one thing about their remarks. My father was the eldest of 16 in a family, son of an evicted tenant who had to find bread for the rest.  I knew who my father was.  I was not like Deputy L'Estrange and Deputy Fitzpatrick chasing around four or five counties looking to know whom they would blame for their own parentage. They can take that as they like.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words in support of this Bill.  As has been acknowledged by the Minister <Col N="1454" /> for Health, the case made for the Bill by Deputy Fitzpatrick is an extremely good one.  I believe it is an extremely strong case.  It is a case which any Minister for Local Government should appreciate.  I will not deal in detail with all the aspects of the Bill because this has been done very thoroughly by Deputy Fitzpatrick, but it seems to me that in dealing with any case requiring planning permission, and in dealing with those cases on appeal, there are a number of matters which must be taken into account.  There is the question of development, the question of planning, and the question of the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>Under the system we are operating at the moment, from the point of view of the appellant, the individual whose proposal is to be adjudicated on by the Minister, I think that both he and the Minister are put in an impossible position. Deputy Fitzpatrick has given statistics&mdash;they are on record and I shall refer to them in a moment&mdash;showing the number of appeals which the Minister is required to deal with nowadays under the Planning Acts.  It is, I think, fundamental that when a person goes to the trouble of appealing to the Minister he visualises the Minister dealing personally with his appeal.  It is, of course, quite impossible for any Minister for Local Government to give to any appeal the kind of personal attention and the kind of personal hearing which, by and large, appellants expect appeals to receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not faulting the Minister when I say that because it would be quite impossible for the Minister for Local Government, or for any other member of the Government for that matter, to give these matters personal attention. While it is open to the Minister to deal with matters personally, while it is open to him to carry out personal inspection on the site, nevertheless it is, I think, natural, it is normal and it is the practice for the Minister to depend virtually entirely on the views of his officials coming up to him in the form of reports.  I have no doubt that the officials, both those concerned with the hearing of appeals and those concerned with the implementation of the Planning Acts, <Col N="1455" /> all do their various tasks to the best of their ability and in a perfect bona fide manner, but the Minister, whose responsibility it is ultimately to come to a decision, must depend on these various reports and the various submissions made on the different sides. He has then, presumably again on the advice, which, I am sure, he values, of his officials to come down in favour of one side or the other.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is the kind of procedure which the ordinary person visualises when he decides that he is getting a raw deal, that his proposal is not properly understood and that the objections are not valid.  He feels that something has gone wrong, that his is a worthwhile, valid proposal which should be allowed, and he wants to ensure that the proposal which goes before the Minister on appeal will be considered carefully by the Minister and adjudicated upon by the Minister personally.  That, I believe, is a sheer impossibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick at column 92 of the Official Report of 31st January last referred to the fact that, in the year ended 30th September, 1965, 979 valid appeals were submitted to the Minister.  In the following year, 1,125 appeals were submitted to the Minister and, in the year to 30th September, 1967, there was a further increase; the number of appeals submitted in that year was 1,322.  During the year ended 30th September, 1965, out of a total of 979 appeals 437 were decided by the Minister; in the following year, out of 1,125 appeals submitted, 862 appeals were decided by the Minister and, in the year ending 30th September, 1967, out of 1,322 appeals submitted there were 991 appeals decided by the Minister.  In each of these three years the number of appeals submitted was by any standard pretty high.  The trend is all the time upwards, from 979 to 1,125 and then to 1,322.</P>
    <P>The Minister&mdash;and, of course, the Minister has to take responsibility for coming to the decision&mdash;in each of these three years decided a very considerable number of appeals but he has not apparently been able to get them up to date.  He has not been able to come to a decision in all of the appeals <Col N="1456" /> lodged in the particular years. Those of us who are by reason of our personal avocations concerned with appeals submitted are well aware of the time consuming nature of the procedure involved and the necessity&mdash;I am talking principally now about appeals where there is no oral hearing&mdash;on the part of the Minister's advisers to consider the various submissions made by either side and the necessity in the interests of fair play to ensure that when submissions are made on one side or the other the comments on those submissions will be obtained.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree, I think, that by the time this kind of fine-tooth combing finishes and all the various views and comments have been obtained, a very, very considerable amount of time elapses from the time the appeal is lodged until the time when the Minister gives his decision. Before ever the necessity for an oral hearing arises many months will have been consumed in relation to the particular planning proposal.  There is the question of newspaper advertising, architects' drawings, the preparation of plans, and then the consideration by the planning authority. From the time the proposal is mooted to the time the Minister gives his decision a very considerable period of time is consumed before finality is reached.  When one considers in this context individual applicants who look forward to personal attention from the Minister, it will, I think, be conceded that the present procedure requires to be changed.</P>
    <P>The intervention of the Minister for Health in this discussion and his views on the Bill and on the Planning Act struck me as being a very fairminded approach to the matter.  I understand that he also seemed satisfied with matters as they stand.  Again, I refer to the Official Report for 31st January of this year.  At column 109, the Minister for Health is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>The principal reason I wish to say a few words in this debate is that, knowing that Deputy Fitzpatrick is a good advocate, I expected he would be able to make a good case.  I was not disappointed. He made a very good case though, to <Col N="1457" /> my way of thinking, he missed out on one or two important aspects of planning, aspects which deserve to be mentioned.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister went on to mention some of the matters which he thought were worthy of consideration in connection with this Bill.  He referred to the figures which I have referred to, which were given by Deputy Fitzpatrick and he went on, as reported at column 110:</P>
    <P>The figures given by Deputy Fitzpatrick&mdash;I assume they are accurate&mdash;show the enormous weight of work cast on the Minister and his predecessor since the Act came into operation.  I am perfectly certain that, if the facts were known in regard to at least 50 per cent of applications, there would be no necessity for an appeal at all in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I regard this as being extremely important.  The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>Many of the applications were turned down on altogether frivolous grounds or on grounds which showed no real grasp of the purpose of the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>If that can happen, it seems to me there is definite reason for taking a look at the entire procedure.</P>
    <P>Concluding his remarks on the Bill, at column 112, the Minister is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say too much that would impinge on the province of the Minister for Local Government. Surely the fundamental purpose of planning is to preserve the natural and aesthetic beauty of our towns, cities and countryside?  Surely that is the object of all planning, all appeals and all decisions?  There is a lot of Ireland left to destroy.  A lot of it has already been destroyed. If I were satisfied that the machinery suggested in the Bill was the best machinery for the prevention of the further destruction of our country, for the preservation of what is beautiful and for the development of what is aesthetically and economically desirable, I would vote for it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> I think it is not quite the right method of attack but I also think that great credit is due to Deputy Fitzpatrick for the care with which he prepared his brief for his speech for which he deserves every credit personally and on which I would like to compliment him.</P>
    <P>That is a view in regard to this measure and the spirit in which it was introduced into the House by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Certainly, I hope consideration will be given to this Bill by the Minister for Local Government and by other Deputies in the same spirit as expressed here on 31st January last by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing in the Bill is that the Minister should be relieved entirely from the very onerous and near impossible task that has been imposed on him by the terms of the Planning Act up to now.  When he was introducing the Bill, Deputy Fitzpatrick set out the broadest categories in which an appeal at the present time lies to the Minister.  I will repeat them in a minute.  The object of this Bill is, as I have said, to relieve the Minister from his onerous obligation under the Act.  It is also designed to enable the administration of justice to play its part in relation to deciding these matters, because very often what is required in relation to planning appeals is the kind of judicial assessment which can be best given under the guidance of a person who is a judge of one of the courts, whether it be the Circuit, High or Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>In the Bill as proposed, it is suggested that an appeals board should be established under the chairmanship of a person with that kind of judicial mind who will be able to guide the board in their approach to the problem.  It is suggested that the judge may be from the Supreme, the High or the Circuit Court and that he will have the assistance of assessors who will be able to guide him in turn on technical matters which would be relevant to and should be taken into account in connection with appeals, whether they are technical matters dealing with planning or matters of the kind envisaged by the <Col N="1459" /> Minister for Health in his contribution to this debate; and that between them the judge on the one hand and the two assessors on the other can arrive at a decision which will satisfy the applicant and everyone involved that there has been what I spoke of earlier as the kind of personal hearing of and personal attention to cases which, by and large, appellants would like to see given to them.</P>
    <P>The various categories set out in relation to decisions which may be appealed to the Minister are as follows, as given by Deputy Fitzpatrick when he introduced the Bill:</P>
    <P>The decisions which may be appealed to the Minister fall into five broad categories (a) those relating to permission to develop property or to retain a structure in respect of which planning permission was not obtained, and in relation to the unauthorised use of property; (b) decisions by a planning authority taking the form of a notice served by authority on a property owner in relation to the preservation of amenities, be they trees, flora or fauna, or the creation of amenities, such as rights-of-way; (c) certain decisions relating to the payment of compensation by the planning authority; (d) the relaxation of building restrictions and (e) decisions of a procedural character, that is to say, dealing with services of notices of a property owner extending the time for bringing a claim for compensation.</P>
    <P>There is there a very wide variety of matters which may be appealed to the Minister.  In relation to a number of them there will not be any question of public policy, as such, involved. There will be a question of the policies of individual planning authorities and very often there will be a question involved in balancing the pros and cons and of seeing just where the justice of the matter lies as between an appellant, on the one hand, and a planning authority, on the other&mdash; whether there may possibly be a perfectly valid but too rigid emphasis on interpretation of the regulations.  There might be a question at times of, for example, the category dealing with the relaxation of building restrictions, as to <Col N="1460" /> whether the justice of the case would demand that restrictions should be relaxed.</P>
    <P>Some of the matters which may come up for decision from time to time, for example, as to whether a particular proposal involved new development or not, would seem to me to be decisions more of a legal character than of a general character, which it might be more easy for a person with legal knowledge and judicial acumen to determine than it would be for the Minister for Local Government to determine.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that it is not the purpose of this Bill to make work for the courts.  It is not the purpose of this Bill simply to siphon over directly to the courts the kind of work which the Minister is now obliged to do under the Planning Acts.  What we envisage here is an entirely new departure, a new board, a new tribunal, whose sole function will be to deal with these kinds of appeals and which, in dealing with these appeals, will be able to bring to bear on all the problems coming before them the kind of expert knowledge which any Minister, or few Ministers anyhow, would themselves be able to bring to bear on the problems.</P>
    <P>It may be that occasionally there will be in office as Minister for Local Government a Minister with the requisite expertise, arising out of his own training, to decide these things for himself.  Even if that were so, I do not think the Minister would like to pit his own professional knowledge against the advice given to him by the various advisers in his Department but, by and large, we do not expect that the Minister for Local Government, whoever he may be, will necessarily be a person who has the kind of expert knowledge which may be required, and which certainly would be an asset in deciding appeals of this sort.</P>
    <P>I am well aware when I say that, and indeed I have made this clear already, that I expect it is normal practice for the Minister to rely on the advice and the reports which he will get from his officials, all from the point of view of the appellants, although they would be far more satisfied to see <Col N="1461" /> that the ground of their appeal was heard by a tribunal which were going to give a personal decision on those applications, which were going to hear the evidence, hear the arguments and then give a decision and state the reasons for their decision.</P>
    <P>It is written into this Bill that one of the matters which the tribunal would be required to do is to keep a record of their decisions and to give reasons for their decisions.  Very often, and this possibly was the kind of thing which was in the mind of the Minister for Health when he spoke, people are dissatisfied on incorrect grounds.  They are dissatisfied because they do not know why their proposal has been turned down.  They do not appreciate very fully the reasons which may have motivated the Minister in rejecting their arguments and rejecting their appeal.  Even when they are given the opportunity of an oral hearing, and of course they are entitled to get that under the Planning Act, the oral hearing is not directly before the Minister. It is by an official of the Minister's Department who, in turn, will report on it.</P>
    <P>Even if he were to read out fully to the appellant the report he was about to make and the reasons for it, it is not the same thing.  It might in many ways be better if the inspector who conducted an inquiry, who heard an appeal, were himself entitled to give a decision on it.  Many of the appellants would then feel that at least the person who had heard everything, who had heard all the arguments and the statements, who had received all the evidence was himself giving a decision, instead of the position whereby that person is merely a kind of gathering ground, or collecting ground, of the material and passing it on elsewhere to someone else who will make a decision.</P>
    <P>I think this Bill has been introduced in a very thorough way by Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) and the Deputy and other speakers have covered the ground in relation to the Bill very fully.  I strongly urge on the Minister the desirability of accepting it.  I <Col N="1462" /> imagine there are many Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who are members of planning authorities who will recognise the merit and the value of the proposals contained in this Bill&mdash; I see two of them here now&mdash;and I would invite them to add their weight. I know that Deputy P.J. Burke could supply plenty of it in support of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene in the debate on this Bill in relation to a matter affecting the constituency I represent, Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown.  I wish to refer to the contribution of the respected Cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire Corporation, Deputy H.P. Dockrell, at column 1143 of volume 232, of the Official Report of Wednesday, 14th February, 1968.  He sets out reasons why the Borough Corporation, why the Fine Gael dominated Council of the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation turned down the planning permission for the hotel to be built there by Ostlanna Iompair Eireann.  Deputy Dockrell said there were ten reasons why this planning permission was turned down.  He just said ten reasons; he did not give them all.  He went on to develop and gave only two reasons; that the proposed site was a very bad one from the town planning point of view and from the scenic point of view.</P>
      <P>I want to give, if I may, and hope the House will listen to me, the ten reasons why the authority turned down the planning permission.  Perhaps I may give these ten reasons and deal with them separately.  I take this information from the minutes of the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire of 15th January, 1968.  They are very well prepared minutes and Dún Laoghaire Corporation officials are to be congratulated on the manner in which they have prepared them.  They set out an application for outline permission from Ostlanna Iompair Éireann received by the Council and the ten reasons for turning it down very briefly are as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first reason is that the development would create a traffic hazard.  I will not go into each item fully because I would take up too much of the time <Col N="1463" /> of the House.  The second one was that the proposal did not comply with the requirements which it is proposed to include in the Development Plan in relation to parking places.  The third was that &ldquo;The height of the proposed structure would be disproportionate with the height of structures generally in the area to such a degree as to injure the aesthetic value of the area&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The fourth one is the joke, I think; I cannot really believe it happened here: &ldquo;The height of the proposed structure would detract from existing notable structures&rdquo;.  The fifth one was: &ldquo;The use of the site of the railway station for this proposal is not the most appropriate use to be made of any space available in this vicinity&rdquo;. The sixth was: &ldquo;The proposal would inhibit the development of the railway station for commuter traffic between Dún Laoghaire and Dublin city&rdquo;.  This is another extraordinary reason why this outline permission was refused. The seventh was: &ldquo;The proposal would obstruct views and inhibit the development of the area on the opposite side of Crofton Road&rdquo;.  I see Deputy Dockrell here now: I am glad he is present.  The eighth reason was: &ldquo;The access to the seaward side of the building is not from a public road in charge of the local authority and this access may not be available&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>An interesting point has just struck me.  I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but is not an appeal pending in this case?  If so, is it not sub judice or is an appeal like this not regarded as an appeal and may we hash it about?</P>

      <P>May I point out that I do not want to influence the decision of the Chair as to whether this matter is sub judice or not but I think the same rules should apply to both sides of the House and the Opposition have dealt at length, both on this Bill and on the debate on my Estimate, with appeals which were pending.  The only difference, of course, is that they do <Col N="1464" /> not seem to know whether these are appeals or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly appreciate the ruling of the Chair because I knew this matter was already dealt with at length by Deputy Dockrell, Deputy Booth and other Deputies.  The ninth reason given was: &ldquo;Access from Crofton Road would not be possible as the section of the road fronting the proposed building is used as a bus terminus and this may require further extension&rdquo;.  The tenth reason was: &ldquo;The proposal would inhibit future road improvements in the vicinity&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Following this discussion the Committee recommended that the Borough Engineer's recommendation be adopted and that proposal was passed by six votes to four.  The people who were against this development were the Fine Gael members of the Borough Corporation. It is interesting as a piece of history to note that Fianna Fáil have only four out of 15 members on that corporation.  In fairness to the Labour Party, I may say they supported Fianna Fáil on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I shall deal with each item separately. In the first instance, it was only outline permission that was sought and this leaves flexibility to deal with any matters of difference of opinion that may arise between the local authority and the actual developer.  As far as the traffic hazard goes, Deputy Dockrell knows very well that only 100 yards up the road the car ferry discharges 220 cars in 20 minutes into the streets of Dún Laoghaire everytime it pulls into the harbour, apart from the fact that possibly the same number will be assembled to get on to the ferry to be taken back across the water and this, incidentally, on a wider road than the road running along the front of this proposed development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of parking was mentioned. I should like to make it clear that, whether it is Ostlanna Éireann or CIE or anybody else, I would be in <Col N="1465" /> favour of the development for the sake of the people of Dún Laoghaire.  It is so important that we cannot frighten these people away.  We must have this. The development company have agreed to give 60 per cent more parking than is envisaged by this development plan.</P>
    <P>The great joke, of course, was to say that the height of the proposed structure would detract from existing notable structures.  Knowing Dún Laoghaire, there are quite a few very pleasant yacht clubs down along the front but the only notable structure that might be interfered with is the Town Hall itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryPDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.P. Dockrell Mr. H.P. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think it was the station building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It said &ldquo;structures&rdquo;. I assume the planning people would think in terms of a number of buildings but if it was the Town Hall, Deputy Dockrell knows, and all the councillors and the administrators know that we need a new Town Hall very badly for the benefit of the people and for the sake of those who work inside this archaic building.  There can be no question of interfering with the Town Hall.  This structure is to be built on top of the existing railway station. Deputy Dockrell mentioned an alternative site, but, as we all know, land in Dún Laoghaire is at a premium. There is not enough land available and land such as the alternative site proposed by Deputy Dockrell should be used for some other development. Here is a company prepared to build on top of an existing building to save the land for other development.  The alternative site that has been mentioned is zoned under the development plan for buildings of a special nature, badly needed schools, a courthouse and a car park.  Deputy Dockrell knows that we need a courthouse and provision for district and circuit court sittings with full jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Added to that, in this proposed new hotel there will be available to the people of Dún Laoghaire a heated swimming pool all the year round. Dún Laoghaire Corporation never busied themselves with a heated swimming <Col N="1466" /> pool but here is somebody prepared to give it to the borough on a plate.  As regards scenic views, those who know the area, know that when you walk along Crofton Road the whole area is obscured.  The plan will go much further than that.  It will go above part of the railway station and on top of that the developing company will provide a platform from which the people of Dún Laoghaire may view the beautiful harbour approaches.</P>
    <P>This is the development which the Fine Gael Party on Dún Laoghaire Borough Council have turned down. Because of this type of medieval thinking they almost prevented the car ferry from coming into Dún Laoghaire.  Let Deputy Dockrell stop the Dark Ages thinking and put his back behind this development and I am sure the people of Dún Laoghaire will be grateful to him forever.  In fact, I know they will. The House has been very patient with me and I appreciate it.  During the building of this hotel, which will take three years, it will mean employment for the people of Dún Laoghaire and the use of local materials that go into this type of structure.  Very important &mdash;at least from the Fianna Fáil organisation's point of view out there&mdash;is that during the height of the tourist season, there will be 220-250 people employed and during the off-season there will be 100 people employed permanently. Also, of course, the extra spending generated by this hotel will be in the region of £200,000 in the first year of operation, 1970.  £200,000 coming to the Borough of Dún Laoghaire in the first year of this hotel's existence in 1970 by way of wages, staff accommodation, local purchases, guests using local taxis, the cinemas, publicans, shopkeepers.  The whole area benefits by this development.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from this large unit the whole idea identifies in the minds of international tourist organisations the slogan &ldquo;Come to Dún Laoghaire&rdquo;.  This hotel will publicise itself and, in so doing, will publicise Dún Laoghaire internationally.  This is very important from the point of view of this development company and also from the point of view of the other <Col N="1467" /> hotels in the area.  If this hotel is full, you can envisage the outfall going to the other hotels and guesthouses around, and we have good hotels and guesthouses at present.  This hotel will be in competition with but in addition to the existing hotels in the Dún Laoghaire area.  This has been recommended by the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation.  I would imagine it would be welcomed by our very progressive Dún Laoghaire Junior Chamber of Commerce.</P>
    <P>There you have it.  That is the situation. I am making an appeal to the Minister publicly to uphold this appeal &mdash;a right, by the way, which this Bill before the House would deprive me of. If this hotel does not come to Dún Laoghaire by reason of not getting the site, the only people who can look into their hearts and say: &ldquo;Well, we have frightened them away&rdquo; are the Fine Gael members of the Borough Corporation. When one talks about alternative sites, one should get one's facts right. This is important.  There is no alternative site.  That is the only available site.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the Bill proper, this, of course, is a Bill which erodes the authority of this House.  The Minister is dealing from day to day with the overall development plans of each local authority.  He must have the final say as to what goes into these plans.  I see here&mdash;Deputy Fitzpatrick might be able to help me&mdash;that the intention is to set up one board.  If this board is overworked, he intends to set up a second board.  Surely that is not in line with Fine Gael thinking&mdash;the burgeoning bureaucracy?  After the second board, will they set up a third one and so on? This is the sort of inconsistent thinking that must prevail on all right-thinking Deputies to vote against this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a question of appointing a full-time judge of the Supreme Court, High Court or Circuit Court.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, as a practising solicitor, knows that the court lists in Dublin are full and that the judges have enough work to do deciding the various issues which come before them every day of the week without having to intervene in the running of Government Departments.  It is well known that <Col N="1468" /> there are not sufficient circuit court judges in Dublin to handle the litigation which comes before them daily.  I am a practitioner on the Dublin circuit and if you send a civil bill into the central office, it may be two years before you will get the case on.  Let us be realistic about this.  I do not see why it is reasonable to ask judges to sit on this tribunal.  Deputy O'Higgins says this type of planning appeal is more of a legal character.  I do not see where law comes into it at all.  It is a question of fact.  Each case is judged on its own merits.  There is no question of law whatever.  We all know the old maxim: questions of law for the judge and questions of fact for the jury.  Questions of fact for the Minister for Local Government.  This matter should be left in the hands of the Minister for Local Government and his Parliamentary Secretary.  There is no question about it.  They have been doing a very good job to date.  They work hard, despite the sneers of the Deputy from the West.</P>

      <P>I would not like to disturb the halo around Deputy Burke's head.  I know he is a good, decent man who would not see anything wrong with anyone.  This is the straight vote mentality we have here&mdash;one way only.  I see nothing wrong in this informal committee being set up and presided over by a member <Col N="1469" /> of the judiciary.  It is right to take out of the hands of the Minister power that has been abused in such a way that Party hacks&mdash;I can prove it in my own area&mdash;and all the lickspittles they have can get through.  We are now in the position that the pawgreasers and the Taca men are running one section of our country.  Certain speculators can be seen buying out land although they are informed by the sellers beforehand that they will not get permission and that so-and-so was refused already. The famous case in Roundstone we heard so much about here recently is rather strange.  A certain gentleman, an Irishman, went in to purchase a particular site and was told by the man who owned it: &ldquo;I would not advise you to do so, because you will not get permission.&rdquo;  The would-be purchaser went to the county council and was told he would not get permission. Then there arrived on the scene a gentleman with a strange-sounding name.  He wanted to build a holiday house in this country.  He went in.  He was able to purchase the site and tell the man he was going to get permission. No Irish need apply.  It is about time this graft&mdash;I will not withdraw one word of it&mdash;was stopped.  This Bill will go a long way to drive out that sort of thing.</P>
      <P>Of course, the line-up is there because the Taca men with their £100 under their plates to get permission will take over. Quite recently I was invited to a meeting in Roundstone.  I arrived on time.  The hall was packed with members of the development committee and all interested.  We had some of the clergy there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the matters discussed was planning permission and also a water supply for the area, a dumping ground and the need to repair certain roads.  I listened to the views of the people in the hall and took notes of what they wanted, the usual procedure.  I came to listen and learn.  Half way through the meeting my colleague, the Fianna Fáil Deputy, Deputy Molloy arrived.  He did not know what had transpired and was not prepared to listen or learn.  I <Col N="1470" /> am afraid he will never learn.  He came in here to this House afterwards and attacked a man who had come down to report the proceedings that day.  It is the duty of those people to get around and get the news for the people and let us have truth in the news whether it be on the television or elsewhere. These men arrived with their cameras set up and proceeded to take a picture of what was going on there. I quote from the Official Report of the 7th February&mdash;vol. 232, column 645, in which Deputy Molloy stated:</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael bright boys at the Galway end of the stick thought this was a good thing to latch on to&mdash; anything to embarrass a Minister...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To embarrass a Minister&rdquo;.  Of course, the Minister had the little stalwart out there in the next parish to America defending him.  I am afraid he made a very bad job of it.  He came out with a few scratches.  He suggests here that this was organised by Fine Gael.  I can say in this House that there was a Fianna Fáil county councillor sitting beside me.  There was nothing attached to this organised by fine Gael.  An invitation was sent out to every Deputy and councillor in that particular area and it was their duty to come to listen to the problems of the people whether they agreed or did not agree.  Deputy Molloy went on to say:</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting in Roundstone Village last Sunday evening. It was a wet and windy day and a long way from my home.</P>
    <P>It was every bit as long from mine, something around the 47 mile mark.</P>

      <P>We will not say anything. It might be put on the record. Deputy Molloy went on: &ldquo;I decided I would get to the bottom of this.&rdquo;  He was going to get to the bottom of this <Col N="1471" /> to defend the Minister.  If there is a shuffle in the Cabinet, mark you, he is one man you cannot overlook and he is looking for that shuffle.  He continued:</P>
      <P>I arrived in a packed hall where there were a lot of people at the top of a table, a certain number of whom were prominent Fine Gael people.</P>
      <P>There was the Fine Gael county councillor, the Fianna Fáil county councillor and myself.  Thanks for the prominence he has given me.  He went on:</P>
      <P>They were stating that everybody in the area was completely opposed to this man getting planning permission.</P>
      <P>I repeat I did not open my mouth at that meeting until the meeting was finished.  All I did was take notes of the problems of the people and I told the people that I would do what I could if I could, nothing political about that.  However, I questioned the Fianna Fáil councillor, a decent man who was sitting beside me, who stated that the water supply would be attended to before the summer.  I said I had my doubts.  In fact, I went further and asked the local engineer what was happening.  He said: &ldquo;I made no promise.  All I promised to do was go out and have a look at it.&rdquo; That was what transpired at that meeting. Deputy Molloy continued:</P>
      <P>They were asking the local representatives there to seek to support all of their colleagues to oppose this outline permission which the Minister had granted.</P>
      <P>In other words, the people had no right to call a meeting to oppose what they thought was wrong in their area. He goes on to make a personal attack in this House on a man, a member of the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team.  I shall not name the gentleman but I will say that he has done a good job and possibly has embarrassed the Government with truths that he has put out there in front of the people in their kitchens or sittingrooms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Here was Deputy Molloy letting the cat out of the bag on what is happening behind the closed doors of the Fianna Fáil Party rooms. That is not the first time he put his <Col N="1473" /> foot in it, you know, I could quote him on a few other things.</P>
      <P>We in the different local authorities are told to prepare a plan.  We are told: &ldquo;This is your plan.&rdquo;  A strange thing about it is that even though it is our plan the Minister comes along and tries to dictate in a nice little way how we should do the plan.  When the Galway County Council, of which I am a member, were going through it we got &mdash;I would not call it a directive&mdash;but we got a nice little hint to take this line, knowing, as the Minister did, that he had a Fianna Fáil majority on the county council.  We had that majority in a cleft stick because they had to take a decision which they could not change after.  The Minister found himself embarrassed by this set-up, interfering with the rights of associates who are on the local councils.</P>
      <P>I see no wrong in this Bill.  It is about time the power was taken out of the pawgreasers of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Taca men.  We see them at election time in this country fighting in the backwoods.  We have all those Taca men tagged.  We know what their purpose is.  They go behind the scenes to get control for speculation purposes and for Fianna Fáil to cash in on the situation.  I stand in support of this Bill because I consider it is a good one and one which all right-thinking men should support.</P>

      <P>The one thing we have to ask ourselves is whether we are to do everything by commissions, whether we are to have Departments run by commissions.  If so, it is hardly worth our while trying to be elected here and coming into this House to help to run the affairs of this country. We have had many a debate in this House regarding semi-State bodies. Some people feel that they should be more under the control of the House. We have had that argument put up from various sides of the House.</P>

      <P>Here we have a Bill dealing with planning appeals to the Minister for Local Government. This is an institution which was set up to deal with planning appeals.  As some other Member of the House said rightly, no Minister could give personal attention to all the planning appeals but he has his advisory staff who will go down and examine every case on its merits.  He will come along then and if there is need for an inquiry, that will be held.  Then if the Minister, no matter who he is, the present Minister, his successor, or whoever will be Minister for Local Government, does anything wrong, he is answerable to this House.  If he goes off the straight line, he is under the control of this House. but if a commission makes a mistake, there is nothing that can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nobody who never made a mistake.  There is no judge or anybody else who did not make a mistake at some time.  We are all human beings and liable to make mistakes at some time or other. Deputy Fitzpatrick made a good job in putting up his case but I am entitled to differ from him because I do not <Col N="1475" /> like to see this being done.  If you have a commission to deal with appeals today, you will have a commission to deal with something else tomorrow and the day after until in the end this country will be all commissions.  I feel it is my bounden duty to defend democracy in this country.</P>
      <P>There are people outside this House, decent hard-working men who are Irish citizens and.  God bless them, with their intelligence they have come to the top.  We are all very proud of them.  They are supporters of all sides of this House and I do not think it right that anybody in this House should criticise those Irishmen who came up from the bottom and are now successful.  That applies to members of all Parties here.  We know that there are certain pressure groups outside who do not want anything to happen. In Dublin we are nearly pressurised to the last and, when we knock down a house, we cannot rebuild it up because of those pressure groups.  If some house, are falling down, we have to shore them up if they are a certain type of house because of those pressure groups which we have.  Those are people from whom one would expect a lot more reason.</P>
      <P>Nobody wants to knock down anything which is doing any good or which is functioning properly.  No Minister for Local Government would do anything like that but still you get people here who misrepresent the facts completely.  The Minister's predecessor, when this legislation was introduced here, as far as I understood him at that time, wanted to get rid of this.  I agree with the then Minister that too many appeals are going to the Department of Local Government today.  I want to say to my colleague that he should have a serious chat with his planning officer and give him a chance of either adjusting his plans, withdrawing them, re-entering them or doing something else about them because after a certain period of, say, two months, they are just struck off.  They are sent to the Department of Local Government and that is the end of it until the Minister's Department comes along and deals with those appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going into personal decisions <Col N="1476" /> one way or the other on this.  We heard here about Dún Laoghaire and about small urban bodies.  They might not like it that John Quinn's next door neighbour could come along and build another hotel next door.  They had enough power on the local council and got that turned down.  There might be a case of a county council or a borough where some pressure group might come along and do the same thing.  I feel that in a democratic state like ours, which I hope it will always be, no matter who is Minister, even if it is Deputy Corish.  The same thing could be said about any Minister for Local Government.  We had pressure groups outside who wanted to take over the Department of Agriculture some time ago.  If you had that, you could then have the case of teachers wanting to take over the Department of Education and of doctors wanting to take over the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House but I want to say that this is a very sacred trust which we have, that is, to protect the rights which we have.  It is not very fair for members of the Opposition to imply that John Jones has got more concessions than Paddy Murphy.  Those are human things which will happen in all walks of life.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is a very able man.  I am sure he has often been approached in relation to planning appeals, just as I have been approached in that regard since I became a Member of this House and since the first Planning Appeals Bill was enacted.</P>
    <P>The staff of the Department of Local Government are very efficient and very concientious.  I have always found them very courteous and helpful in my long experience of dealing with them.  Some have retired and some are now coming on for senior promotion.  I cannot speak too highly of them.  They are people of the very highest integrity.</P>
    <P>In relation to the principle enshrined in this Bill, I consider that this Parliament has already given away enough and that we should not think of giving anything more away.  If we do so, the business of this House will be negligible.  All semi-State bodies should be subject to this House in <Col N="1477" /> some democratic fashion.  The Ministers, under the aegis of whose Departments these semi-State bodies have been set up, may not have responsibility for the day-to-day workings of these bodies but, to preserve the authority of this House over them, it should be possible for a Minister to say to such a body: &ldquo;You have been set up by Act of this Oireachtas.  You should at least be amenable to it.  You should have respect for public representatives&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For public representatives to come into this House and to be willing to hand over their work to other people is not, I think, democracy.  I appeal to Deputy Fitzpatrick to reconsider this matter.  If the Fine Gael Party continue to push this point of view seriously, I consider that they will do themselves and their Party grave injury. If the principle is adopted, it will be only the thin end of the wedge.  It will be established as a precedent and we shall have commission after commission after commission.</P>
    <P>I deplore very strongly references to any of our citizens who are not Members of this House and who, therefore, are not in a position to defend themselves. All during my public life, I have refrained from making personal references because I have always wanted to raise the standard of debate in this House.  As far as it is humanly possible to do so, we should strive to deal with the merits of a measure without resorting to personal references.</P>
    <P>There is no Party in this House that is not dependent on the goodwill of supporters and financial aid.  Let nobody here say: &ldquo;I can wash my hands. I have never accepted one farthing from anybody.  I am a member of the Puritan Party.  Our Party have never done anything like that.  We always run elections on buttons.  We do not want any money from anybody.&rdquo;  We have heard people opposite talk about the various organisations attached to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

Some day, Deputy Fitzpatrick may be sitting on these Government benches&mdash;if he makes the grade, of course&mdash;and he may then have occasion to say to himself: &ldquo;Was I not a terrible man to introduce that Bill?  Just look at my position now?  I am a Minister without any power.&rdquo; From that aspect, I have no doubt that Deputy Fitzpatrick will change his mind.</P>

      <P>Member States may sign this Agreement if they wish to do so.  A number of them, including Britain, has already done so and it is probable that Ireland will also wish to sign it.  This anti-dumping code of the GATT is of importance to us, first of all, because we have now acceded to the GATT and, secondly because it is provided in the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain that both countries will observe Article VI in their anti-dumping measures.</P>

      <P>What the Bill sets out to achieve can only be brought about with the goodwill of the countries we are trading with and of those we will be trading with.  Only last week I was with the Minister in connection with a matter which will come under this Bill and he received the members of the firm concerned and myself very courteously and he gave us an assurance that he would do everything he could do.  He has brought in the Bill to deal with matters like that.  To bring proof to the Minister that any foreign manufacturer is selling under cost will require all the co-operation of the member countries.  As has been said before, there are very large manufacturing countries, with years of industrialisation behind them, who have large outputs and who may find that with a certain line of production they have a decent profit on 60 per cent or 70 per cent of their output.  They could then sell the remaining percentage at less than cost, if there were not a Bill such as this to deal with them.  If that were allowed happen, a number of our small industries would definitely be put out of business.  In our everyday lives, we see more and more how necessary this type of legislation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that manufacturers, especially those producing the same type of goods will get together and decide that they will have to deal with this matter and not be too avaricious but try to help one another so that they may obtain a living for themselves and for their workers.  What the association of distillers <Col N="1482" /> in Scotland have done for Scotland can be seen but I am not going to go into that.  I want to emphasise how essential it is for manufacturers, for their own safety and the safety of their workers, to do everything they can to bring down costs and compete internationally when we do go into the Common Market, and even to meet the challenge from Britain and some other countries at present.  I do not wish to delay the House because this is a Bill which can be more freely debated on Committee Stage than on the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill which is long overdue, although I appreciate that the complexity of the whole situation must have been a very daunting prospect of the Parliamentary Draftsman, the officials of the Department and the Minister.  It is a very difficult matter to deal with and the way in which it has been handled is excellent, particularly in so far as there is no necessity for a complainant to prove that dumping is taking place. Deputy Burke, with the best will in the world, misinterpreted that and was looking for co-operation by other countries in helping the Commission to establish the existence of dumping. As I see it, the procedure is much more simple and much more practical, and anyone who has reasonable grounds for believing that goods are being sold here at an uneconomic price has nothing to do but report the matter for investigation.</P>
      <P>Obviously it is a very difficult thing to establish the selling price or market price of an article in another country and therefore it was very wise that power should be given, in the absence of any proof, and where such is not forthcoming, for the Commission simply to establish on its own account what a proper price for that article should be on the Irish market. It is only a sanction such as that which can make this legislation work.  Faced with that power, any foreign company would probably be only too willing to disclose the actual facts in case the Commission might put a worse interpretation on their failure to do so and fix an even higher price than the manufacturers felt was justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> There is a great danger at the moment from dumping.  I am not one of those who fear the onset of free trade.  I think that industry is well able to meet the challenge of free trade as soon as it comes.  But dumping is not free trade and there are, to my own knowledge, cases of goods being sold here at entirely uneconomic prices.  I must say I shall have the greatest pleasure in reporting these cases to the Commission as soon as the Bill has been passed and enacted by the Oireachtas.  I think it is a workmanlike effort, but I hope we shall not spend too much time getting it through.  The longer we leave it the more warning we are giving to dumpers and, while there are not a great number of them, there are quite a few.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the House would be prepared to give all the stages now.  For my own reasons, I would hope the House would give all stages at this stage.  I do not think there is anything contentious in it. This is something that we must have, and in view of the fact that it does comply with the terms of the GATT and the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, I think any question of amendment does not arise.  If we could get the Bill through quickly so much the better.  I was afraid, when I heard the legislation was coming, that the machinery would be unduly cumbersome. As I see it in the Bill I feel it is the most practical solution to a very difficult problem and I would hope that the result of this legislation would be not so much the infliction of penal duties on imported material as the bringing to their senses of importers so that in future they will not carry on this practice, realising in advance that the game is not worth the candle.  If we can do it in that way so much the better.  The Bill has plenty of teeth in it, and very good ones, and I would hope that the House would give all Stages, if not tonight, certainly at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as a speedy passage for this Bill is concerned, we certainly do not intend to hinder its passing in any way.  Deputy <Col N="1484" /> Booth, who looks at most of these measures objectively, suggested that we might give the entire Bill to the Minister tonight.  On reflection, he did not think it was such a good idea; neither do I.  While we would not disagree with the bulk of the legislation, it would be necessary for everybody in the House and everybody in the country, particularly workers, manufacturers and importers, to know the full implications of the Bill and agree to every section.</P>
      <P>There is a contrast between this measure and the measure that was proposed by the Fine Gael Party during Private Members' Time.  Some of the Fine Gael Party members suggested that in respect of planning appeals there should be established an appeal board, and this is rejected entirely by the members of the Government Party as being slow, cumbersome and undemocratic. I am not going to make the same argument about this measure, but it does appear to me from the Minister's speech that the method of determining whether or not there is dumping under the legislation proposed will be slow and cumbersome.</P>
      <P>I had occasion to raise with the Minister some time ago an allegation of dumping fertilisers in this country. Under the machinery that the Minister has it appeared to me that it would take quite a while to discover whether or not fertilisers are being imported here at dumped prices.  He pointed out at the time that it would be very difficult to prove dumping.  As one who would not have the same information available to him as the Minister, I did not see why, because in this case it was abundantly clear that the price at which fertilisers were being offered to this country was well below the price charged to the British farmer by the same people who are dumping the fertilisers here.  These were fertilisers that were processed and manufactured in Great Britain.  I should like, as a matter of urgency in relation to this industry, to find out from the Minister what, if anything, has been done in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An allegation of dumping will be referred to the commission.  Will it be a full-time commission?  I have not examined the Bill as well as I should, <Col N="1485" /> but I should like to know if it will be a full-time commission.  If it is to be a part-time commission they will not be able to sit every day and there will be interminable delays in determining whether or not goods are being dumped in this country at a price injurious to the trade.  That is something that ought to be cleared up.  With a good Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;I do not suggest this Minister is not a good one&mdash;and with a good section in his Department, dumping might be detected and detected more quickly, if we have assurance that the commission will sit full-time and will give quick decisions.</P>
    <P>I think it was away back in December that I informed the Minister of the impending redundancy in the fertiliser industry.  He explained the difficulties in regard to proving dumping.  So far I have not heard anything in this regard. There was no obligation on the Minister to let me know, but has any decision been communicated to those who are engaged in the manufacture of fertilisers here?</P>
    <P>I was at one factory where it was reported to me that if this dumping was not stopped there would be 25 per cent redundancy.  Deputy Booth talks about the advent of free trade and our ability to meet what was described as a challenge. I am one of those who believe that Irish industry can progress and become more efficient but my criticism always has been that they did not seem to be doing this fast enough.  I fear that in the present circumstances and in the atmosphere of free trade.  We are going to have much more dumping than we had heretofore.  As far as Britain <i>vis-á-vis</i> this country is concerned we present to them an admirable place where they can dump their surpluses of manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say, therefore, whether or not the allegation in regard to the dumping of fertilisers has been fully examined and a decision given on it.  I should also like the Minister's assurance&mdash;and I shall particularly question this during the Committee Stage&mdash;that we are going to get quick decisions from this commission and that it will not be as slow and <Col N="1486" /> cumbersome as would appear to me from reading the Minister's speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, I think, important that we should realise in regard to this Bill that it is, as has been said by Deputy Donegan, tailormade, meaning that it conforms with the provisions of the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain and also with the GATT regulations on dumping.  I rather felt that Deputy Donegan referred to it in that way in a somewhat derisory manner.  I want to point out that the fact that there are international regulations in regard to dumping is of very great advantage to us.  Undoubtedly, if there were no such regulations, we could bring in machinery here which would enable us to deal very strictly and stringently with dumping.</P>
      <P>What people tend to forget, when talking about the subject of dumping, is that this is a two-edged weapon, that we have in this country many firms engaged in the export market&mdash;I hope that in the years to come we will have many more and that those at present engaged in the export market will be in it on an even bigger scale&mdash;and that being so, we have to remember that what we want to apply to goods coming in here can be applied to our goods going into other countries.  If this were a question of a free-for-all, with every country providing its own anti-dumping legislation, our exporters would probably find it impossible to get into many export markets because the anti-dumping legislation of those countries would, in fact, be used as protection.</P>
      <P>There seems to me to be a tendency on the part of some people in this country to think of our anti-dumping measures as measures which would enable us to keep on protection, even though we have agreed to get rid of it. That is not so.  If we want to see our exporters getting a fair deal in other countries, we have to conform with the international regulations in this regard, which means that there is some order in the anti-dumping legislation of the various countries with which we deal. As I said, this Bill conforms with those regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> Mention has been made of the fact that there has been delay in bringing in this Bill.  That is quite true, but, as I explained to the House on a previous occasion, the Bill was, in fact, drafted and ready to be brought before the House but new regulations were made by GATT, which were, I may say, very advantageous to us.  Amongst other things, they enabled us to introduce a provision here for retro-active duties which, to my mind is a vitally important part of any anti-dumping legislation.  However, because of this, the Bill had to be recast and redrafted, and for that reason there has been some delay in bringing it forward.  I think everyone would agree that the delay was worth while, in the sense that the Bill now provides much more effective machinery for dealing with dumping than we could otherwise have had.  I should also like to point out that the necessity for this Bill, as of now, is not perhaps terribly great because we still have a great deal of machinery available to us under which we can deal with dumping in respect of many commodities.  That machinery is being dismantled and, as I said in my opening statement, it is not terribly flexible.  It was designed to deal with a different situation.</P>
    <P>In general, I think the House is in favour of the Bill and would like to see it enacted.  On Committee Stage, we will be able to go into more detail with regard to some of the points which I think will be of concern to Deputies, but, at the same time, some points were raised in the debate to which I should refer now.  There was a suggestion that this Bill is evidence of the fact that we are now, for economic reasons, in a defensive situation and that what we are trying to do is to hold back the tide with regard to our industries.  That is not true in general, because I am glad to say many of our Irish industries are now adopting a most aggressive attitude in the export market, and being very successful. In particular, it is not true in regard to this Bill.  I want to emphasise again that this Bill is not a method of providing protection for industry.  It is a method of dealing with dumping, and dumping, as I have already explained <Col N="1488" /> in my introductory statement, is internationally defined and, provided it comes within that definition, we can deal with it.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the fact that imported goods are produced very efficiently and are thereby cheaper than those produced in Ireland is not of itself evidence of dumping and this Bill will have no effect in dealing with imports of that nature.  I would remind the House again that to constitute dumping, goods must be sold here at a price which is lower than the fair price of the same goods on the home market.  In addition, there must be evidence of damage to our industry or prospective industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked about a particular case he has taken up with me in regard to fertilisers.  The particular one to which he refers relates to imports from Britain.  This is being dealt with at the moment but the evidence of dumping in that case is not nearly so clear-cut as Deputy Corish seems to think.  Indeed, fairly strong arguments have been adduced to show that there was no dumping in that case. This illustrates one of the difficulties one comes up against in dealing with dumping and trying to determine whether or not there is dumping.</P>
    <P>I would point out that under the machinery provided in this Bill, the situation referred to by Deputy Corish could be dealt with more effectively, because if there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of dumping it is possible under the terms of this Bill to impose provisional duties and thereby protect the industry while the investigation goes on to establish whether there is more than <i>prima facie</i> evidence of dumping.</P>
    <P>A point was also raised about goods being imported for re-export, but I want to point out that, if they are being re-exported, they cannot injure home industry and, therefore, there cannot be any question of dumping in that case.  Reference was made to the situation in the Dunlop company in Cork. When I was speaking in the House before in this regard, I endeavoured to make clear what the position was, and I want to make it clear again. There was no question of dumping involved in the difficulties which arose <Col N="1489" /> some time ago in Dunlops.  In fact, some if not all of the imported tyres which were creating the difficulty were dearer than those sold by Dunlops.  It is obvious therefore that no question of dumping was involved.  I think we should endeavour to make this very clear and not confuse our people on what is involved in this instance in Dunlops, and in the other instances which were referred to earlier in regard to the footwear industry where difficulties arose.  There is no question of dumping and the situation arising there will not be dealt with under this Bill at all if a similar situation should arise when we have this machinery in being. Deputy Booth referred to the price at which goods are sold being uneconomic. That is not of itself evidence of dumping.  The situation is that the definition as set out in the Bill must be strictly adhered to in defining what dumping is.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Donegan about the inportation of fertiliser, I am not sure where the fertiliser is coming from, but we did impose duties which were, in effect, anti-dumping duties on fertilisers coming from West Germany.  Deputy Donegan said he had imported some in the course of his business; he must have got them from somewhere other than West Germany because these anti-dumping duties are in existence.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Tully, I should like to make it clear that, as far as we are concerned, we have no objection to dumped goods coming in here provided that those goods do not do any damage to an existing industry or to an industry which might be set up if such dumping did not exist.</P>
    <P>On the question raised by Deputy Corish, there is no analogy whatever between the commission proposed in this Bill and the commission referred to in the Private Members' Bill which was being discussed earlier.  I do not think I need elaborate on this.  A little thought will show that there is no analogy whatever between the two.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish also asked whether the commission would be part-time <Col N="1490" /> or full-time.  It is envisaged that the commission will be part-time.  If the level of work were, of course, such as to demand a full-time commission, then this would be provided; but it is not envisaged that this will happen in the early stages at any rate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish was concerned about the ability of the commission to act speedily.  This is, I think, of concern to most people in relation to anti-dumping legislation.  One must remember, however, that the commission must act on the basis of the evidence available.  It cannot just make quick decisions, risking the making of unfair decisions, merely to protect our industries.  This is where the retroactive duties and the provisional duties, and even the levies which may be imposed, dating back for 90 days, will show their real value.  These can be imposed to deal with goods in respect of which there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of dumping and the commission can then act quasi-judicially in investigating the evidence available.  If the commission were to act in any other way we would, I think, immediately run into very great difficulties internationally because it could be alleged that we were using this machinery merely for protection purposes and not against dumping.  We have a scheme which enables us, I believe, to protect industries which are in immediate danger from dumping and, at the same time, enables us to act quasi-judicially in investigating the evidence available in regard to dumping.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the difficulties which can arise in determining what is the fair price on the home market in respect of any particular goods.  With regard to some commodities there is a special difficulty.  Deputy Tully expressed a certain fear.  He instanced a case in which a firm has a large production and there is some slight recession in the market; in order to keep going and to keep employees employed the firm might sell goods even below cost.  This is, of course, the danger.  Deputy Tully envisaged this happening on the home market.  It seems to me that that danger is very remote.  It could happen, but it is very <Col N="1491" /> remote because any firm which would do this would, when the market picked up again, find it difficult to raise prices and would, therefore, be very foolish to sell on the home market at dumped prices.  They would put themselves out of business and experience of business shows that such an exercise is very unusual indeed.</P>
    <P>With regard to a statement by Deputy Booth, he may, I think, have given to the Bill greater credit than it merits.  He said he felt that the procedure involved was simple and that it was merely a question of making a complaint to the commission and the matter would be dealt with.  It is not quite that simple.  There must be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of dumping before we can impose temporarily provisional duties or levies but, subject to that, we can act expeditiously.</P>
    <P>There were some questions raised about quotas.  This Bill does not authorise the Minister to introduce quotas.  It provides for duties which may be imposed but which may not be greater than the margin dumping as defined.  There is provision in our Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain for the imposition of quotas in certain circumstances.  This was the provision we utilised to deal with the Dunlop case.  Apart from that, quotas have to go.  They are contrary to the provisions of GATT.  We are, however, retaining some of them.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the main points raised.  I repeat that, while this Bill is necessary now, it will be even more necessary in the future as the different types of machinery we have in regard to our protective system comes to be dismantled.  The Bill goes as far as it is possible to go in order to ensure that our industries are protected against dumping and, at the same time, ensure that our exporters get a fair deal on foreign markets.  While there are some provisions I should like to see in the Bill in order to make absolutely certain there would be no danger to our industries from dumping, nevertheless, realising the dangers of contraaction against our exports in foreign markets, I believe the Bill goes just as far as we can reasonably expect it to go.  One cannot say with certainty at <Col N="1492" /> this stage how the machinery will operate.  I believe it will operate effectively and efficiently.  It may be that in the course of its operation we will discover some loopholes.  If there are such we shall make every endeavour to block them.  The House will, I feel, be satisfied that, in enacting this measure, we are doing a worthwhile job, namely, standing by industry in general, both management and workers.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Limerick Unemployment.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my regret for having to deem it my duty to seek permission to raise on the Adjournment a matter which is of very urgent and vital concern to my constituency.  The fact that this is the first time since I became a Member of the House that I have sought to raise a matter on the Adjournment may be taken as an indication of the gravity of the situation.</P>
      <P>On 7th February last, I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as reported at column 577:</P>
      <P>if his attention has been drawn to the serious unemployment situation in Limerick as revealed by a recent survey conducted by the Limerick trades council; if so, whether he proposes to receive a deputation as requested by Limerick City Council to discuss the problem; and if he now considers it feasible to establish an industrial estate in Limerick.</P>
      <P>In the course of his reply, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>I am aware of the unemployment situation in Limerick.  The selection of development centres at which further industrial estates will be established is under consideration. A final decision in the matter must await the outcome of the series of regional planning studies at present in progress.</P>
      <P>Until these studies are completed, I am afraid that no useful purpose would be served by my seeing a deputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> Though the Minister stated in his reply that he was aware of an unemployment situation in Limerick, in his reply to a supplementary, he stated that while the situation did not give grounds for complacency, it was better than in the days when my Party were in office.  I had stated on that occasion that I was not prepared to play politics in this matter and I do not propose to do so tonight.  My purpose in raising the matter on the Adjournment is in the hope that I may be able to convince the Minister of how grave the situation is and secondly, to convince him that the only solution is to establish an industrial estate.  It is most essential also that the Minister should agree to receive a deputation to discuss the situation in Limerick which is far more serious than the Minister seems to realise.</P>
    <P>I have a report of a survey carried out in January by the Limerick Trades Council.  It deals with the unemployment situation in Limerick and quotes statistics from the Central Statistics Office showing that there are 2,062 men unemployed in the city, 49 boys unemployed, 377 women and 16 girls, making a total of 2,504 people unemployed in the city.  From inquiries made during the past few days, I am led to believe that the figures are higher now.  The point to be gathered from these figures is that 82 per cent of those unemployed in Limerick are male adults and it is reasonable to assume that most of them are married, or at least that they are breadwinners.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is such a high proportion of unemployed in that category makes the matter all the more serious.  Further figures ascertained by the Trades Council indicates that in relation to other centres&mdash;they examined the position in Dublin, Limerick, Waterford and Galway&mdash;the figures for Limerick are out of all proportion. In Dublin, the figure for unemployed is 21 per 1000; in Waterford, it is 34 per 1,000; in Galway, 25; and in Limerick city, 43 per 1,000.  During the time at my disposal tonight, I wish to deal with facts and figures.  Unfortunately, the unemployment situation in Limerick has been aggravated&mdash;<Col N="1494" /> that is the correct word&mdash;by reason of certain things which have happened in recent years.  Unfortunately, a number of old-established industries closed down.  Spillane's tobacco factory closed down, disemploying 100 people; Matterson's bacon factory closed down also disemploying 100 people, 90 of them male, many of whom had long service in the industry during the past 20 or 30 years.  Eight months ago, the City Tannery closed down and 40 people lost their jobs.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have had large scale redundancies in Limerick.  The Limerick Locomotive Works in the past couple of years rendered redundant many male employees who had long service, who had become highly skilled operators.  In fairness in that respect, the majority of CIE employees received redundancy compensation. There has been redundancy at the Shannon Veneer Mills and at a number of other industries and notice has been served on 26 employees of a meat factory in the past week.</P>
    <P>Faced with this situation of industries closing and of employees being made redundant, according to the report of the Trades Council, we have the further serious problem that, since the introduction of the First Programme for Economic Expansion, only three new industries are listed as having been established in Limerick city.  Only one of these may be termed as a reasonably large industry&mdash;that of Krups&mdash;and it has gone from success to success and I sincerely hope it will continue to do so.  It employs 320, of whom 75 per cent are female and only 25 per cent male.  The point I wish to make is that, by reason of redundancies and closures and no new industries having been established, there has been unemployment growing among male workers with the result that now more than 2,000 men are unemployed in the city.</P>
    <P>This is a serious situation which, during the past month, has been giving concern to many people. Limerick City Council have expressed concern; Limerick Trades Council have expressed concern; and during the past week the Bishop of Limerick has expressed publicly his concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1495" /> Public representatives of all Parties have likewise expressed concern.</P>
    <P>Going back again to the subject matter of my question, it is universally believed and accepted in Limerick that the only solution to this problem is the creation of an industrial estate in the city.  This was recommended in the Litchfield Report, an economic survey of the Limerick region.  We believe an industrial estate is essential in this modern age to the establishment of industry on a large scale.  This has been well and truly established by the fact that industrial estates have been established in Galway and Waterford and other centres.  Undoubtedly that is the modern trend.  However, by reason of our close proximity to the Shannon Industrial Estate, certain problems have been created for Limerick city and we therefore submit that the only real solution is the establishment of an industrial estate in the city which would offer the same facilities and the same inducement by way of grants as at present are in operation in the Shannon Industrial Estate.  We believe that it is a matter of opinion as to whether this should be independent or under the administration of the existing Shannon Development Company.  It has been clearly established that an industrial estate is necessary.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who believe that the establishment of industries in any centre is the responsibility, and the responsibility only, of the Government. I subscribe to the view, and I always have done so, that economic development is a two-way effort. There must be local initiative, local drive, local energy, local investment, and so on and on the other side it is right to expect the Government to ensure that facilities and inducements are offered to encourage the establishment of industries and that these be fairly distributed all round.</P>
    <P>We in Limerick have taken steps in recent months to do something about the unemployment situation in an effort to try and establish industries there.  The City Council at a meeting unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Minister to receive a deputation representative of the City <Col N="1496" /> Council and including representatives of the citizens of Limerick who would be directly or indirectly concerned with industry &mdash; which would be the City Council, the Trades Council representing the trade unions and the Chambers of Commerce, etc.  The Junior Chamber of Commerce subsequently called a meeting to which were invited representatives of all political Parties, the City Council, the Trades Council and representatives of all business and industry.  At this meeting, at the Intercontinental Hotel last December, which the Minister for Education attended as well as I, it was decided to establish the Limerick Development Association somewhat on the lines of the Cork Economic Council.  At a subsequent public meeting at the Savoy Cinema in Limerick, I publicly welcomed the establishment of this Limerick Development Association and pledged my fullest support to it.</P>
    <P>I want to be put on record as having said at the Savoy that this was a step in the right direction and I expressed my confidence that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would, in fact, be prepared to meet the deputation requested.  By so meeting them he would be able to guide, advise and direct the newly-formed Limerick Development Association on the lines they are now pursuing towards organising local effort and local enterprise with a view to the establishment of an industrial estate or industries in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister refused to receive this deputation and he refused on the grounds which I have already outlined by quoting his reply to my question; that he did not think it would serve any useful purpose.  I want to say that the Minister's refusal to meet this deputation was the last straw as far as the people of Limerick are concerned.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out with facts and figures, we have had closures and redundancies.  We have had proposals for industries which never materialised. We have suffered the frustration of seeing new industries and industrial estates going up in other centres while <Col N="1497" /> all the time our employment situation was growing worse and there was no breakthrough envisaged for the industrial standstill in our city.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as a result of all this the efforts the newly formed Limerick Economic Development Association have been making to inspire local effort and organise local community for the purpose of trying to establish industry in Limerick have been set back badly by the refusal of the Minister to co-operate and meet a deputation.  It has got to the stage where even our responsible citizens are contemplating drastic action.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister.  I believe he should have received this deputation because by doing so he would have given clear proof of his desire to help in the establishment of new industries in Limerick.  He would have given much-needed encouragement to the newly formed Economic Development Association and to all of us who are genuinely trying to do our best to lift our city out of the economic doldrums into which it has fallen.</P>
    <P>Such a meeting would have created a climate of mutual understanding and goodwill which is of necessity a prerequisite for industrial development. By meeting this deputation the Minister would have learned of our difficulties in Limerick and, we on the other hand, would become aware of the difficulties which confront the Minister and I an quite sure that nothing but good would emerge from such a meeting.</P>
    <P>Finally, by meeting this deputation the Minister would dispel the airs of despondency and gloom which have fallen over our city and would have given new hope to the 2,500 unemployed there.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I express the hope that the Minister in replying will hold out some message of hope for our city. I have tried to approach the subject calmly and objectively and have avoided using the political dynamite which can so easily get sparked off by a controversey of this kind.  May I assure the Minister that any step he will take will have my personal support and the support of all the people in <Col N="1498" /> Limerick who are earnestly striving for industrial development in our city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said before and repeat now that I am aware of the unemployment situation in Limerick and I do not feel that it presents any ground for complacency.  I understand that the percentage of unemployed in Limerick is 7.6 of insured persons as against 6.9 per cent for the State as a whole.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I think we have to bear certain things in mind when we are thinking of attracting industry to any location and particularly when we are thinking of Limerick.  Deputy T. O'Donnell, by implication, was saying that it is a disadvantage to Limerick to have Shannon so close because of the greater incentives at Shannon which are not available in Limerick. This may be true to some extent.  On the other hand, it must surely be of considerable benefit to Limerick to have an area attracting so much employment and so near to Limerick, obviously taking workers from Limerick to work at Shannon.</P>

      <P>I fully accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Limerick has not been neglected in that respect.  Development at Shannon has helped Limerick to that extent.  If we think of Limerick as based and apply the same criteria to it that we have to apply to other areas we must remember that, first of all, it is not possible for the Industrial Development Authority or the Minister for Industry and Commerce to force industries to go to particular locations. The final decision in the matter must be the decision of the promoters of the project and the people who will invest in the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us to the question of what induces people to set up industry in one location rather than another. Obviously there are many factors involved.  The type of industry in question has a bearing on the location, the kind of transport that is needed, whether there is water power available if that is needed for the particular industry.  All sorts of factors operate, <Col N="1499" /> apart from the actual inducements that are offered in the way of grants and tax incentives.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority has now had a good deal of experience of these various factors and last year they organised a seminar in Athlone to which they invited representatives of different associations throughout the country in order to acquaint them with what they had learned over the years regarding factors inducing industrialists to locate in certain areas.  They had discussions on this.  I opened the seminar and was very impressed by what I heard. I had to leave but I heard reports from different people in different parts of the country who had attended and they found this seminar extremely helpful. I cannot say positively whether there was anybody present from Limerick city on this occasion.  I do not wish to cast any aspersions on anybody but I think there is some significance in what Deputy O'Donnell said, that Limerick's Development Association is now working very hard on this project but that it was founded some months ago.  There is some significance in this, if one thinks of a centre of the size of Limerick and that this association was founded only some months ago when one can look around at other cities and towns&mdash;and quite small towns&mdash;and see the tremendous amount of effort that has been put in by local people into development associations, into the publication of brochures giving in very easily read form the relevant details about their areas which can be given to an industrialist coming here and to potential promoters of industry.</P>
    <P>I do not say this produces an industry automatically but the local climate is extremely important in attracting industry.  If somebody is coming from abroad, particularly, to set up an industry and is satisfied that in a particular area all the community is anxious to have an industry, to welcome it and assist it in every way possible, this can be a potent factor in attracting an industry.  I do not say this would not have been so in Limerick in the past but I do say this has not been as clearly demonstrated in Limerick as in other areas.  To that <Col N="1500" /> extent it has not helped very much to attract industry to Limerick.  But I am very pleased to hear that the association has been formed and is active.</P>
    <P>I referred to the seminar but the IDA is willing at all times to assist in the planning of a development association and give some guidance from their experience as to how this business should be undertaken.  If the Limerick Development Association wish to avail of that expertise.  I should be very pleased to make it available to them.  I also want to say that my refusal to meet the deputation which I was asked to meet was on the grounds that I did not think any useful purpose would be served at this stage.  I am very anxious, in the case of Limerick or any other area, not to create false hopes.  I do not want people thinking that because they come on a deputation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and put forward a very strong case for the attraction of industry, thereby they will get an industry.  This is not the case and I do not want anybody to think it is.  As I have mentioned before to Deputy O'Donnell in reply to questions, we are at present engaged on a full-scale review of our industrialisation programme. I find it difficult to put a time limit on this but I think that in the fairly near future I shall be announcing proposals in this regard which will certainly include proposals for the development of machinery for the attraction of industry to the Limerick, Ennis and surrounding regions.</P>
    <P>I find myself in the position that, if I were to receive the deputation which I was requested to receive, I would not be able to give details of what is coming because it is not finally decided and I do not think it would really have helped the deputation.  I want to make it quite clear, however, that just as soon as those proposals are announced, if the deputation wants to see me and think it can be of advantage, I shall be very pleased to meet them.</P>
