    <Title>Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) (Amendment) Bill, 1967; Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pensions Scheme to be amended to provide pensions for the widows and children of deceased members and to enable the Minister for Finance to make such grants as he thinks proper to the Fund set up under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Once the power to pay pensions to the widows and children of deceased members exists, it is intended to introduce a motion in both Houses, spelling out the conditions on which such pensions may be granted and the amounts which will be payable.  In addition it is intended to provide in the motion for an improvement in the pensions payable to members of the scheme themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will also give power to the Minister for Finance to make grants to the Fund out of voted moneys.  It is intended that these grants should cover <Col N="606" /> the costs of the scheme, following the proposed amendments, over and above those which can be met by members' contributions but I would like to take this opportunity to stress that this power will not necessarily be used to subsidise any further changes that may be made from time to time in the scheme.  Any further amendments which the Oireachtas may see fit to make will have to be examined separately and the fact that financial assistance will be given to cover the changes now proposed is not a guarantee that State grants will be available to cover future changes.  No exact figure can be given of the amount of subsidy that will be required until the costs of the improvements have been actuarially investigated.  It is intended to have such an investigation carried out in the near future, but in the meantime it is proposed that the amount of the Exchequer subsidy will be £12,000 per annum.  This should suffice to ensure the viability of the Fund until the actuary's report has been received.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention that it is hoped to pay widows' and orphans' pensions under the scheme and the improved pensions for members with effect from 1 April next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes, as the Minister said, to give power to amend the scheme so as to provide pensions for widows and children of deceased Deputies and Senators.  Up to now this scheme has been entirely financed from contributions from Deputies and Senators and up to the present has been solvent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally recognised that an extension of the scheme to provide pensions for widows of deceased Deputies or Senators is necessary.  A great many of us are familiar with the cases of hardship which have arisen because of the inability of deceased Deputies and, possibly, Senators to make adequate provision during their lifetime for their widows and children. Whatever views may be expressed from time to time about the work which Deputies and public representatives do, it is the fairly general experience of a number of people who <Col N="607" /> have been concerned with this matter over the years that the amount of time involved in serving as a Deputy and attending to the business of the Dáil or to constituents' duties, in a number of cases, seriously impairs the capacity and reduces the time of a Deputy to carry on any other occupation.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, a number of exceptions.  Certain activities can be carried on successfully and without undue strain on the individual concerned, but, on the other hand, certain occupations involve the fulltime attention of the individual concerned and depend entirely on their personal commitment to the activity, whether it is a profession, a business or employment.  That has meant that if the Deputy is satisfactorily to discharge his duties as a Deputy, it imposes an impossible responsibility on the person concerned to run his business or occupation to the extent necessary to leave sufficient for his widow and children.</P>
    <P>This scheme was initially undertaken as a result of a voluntary committee established by all Parties and the recommendations made by that Committee resulted in the present pensions scheme being operated.  The proposed change now will ensure that cases of hardship similar to those which have arisen on occasion, and for which exceptional efforts were made to provide something to relieve acute distress, will now be dealt with. To that extent we believe the Bill will find general acceptance and a ready recognition by people outside the House as well as in it that there is a justification for the changes in order to ensure that the dependants of a person who has rendered service for a number of years will not suffer the distress which certain individual cases have suffered up to the present.  We support the proposal and regard it not only as desirable but necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary to make a long dissertation on the proposal before the House.  It did occur to me when listening to Deputy Cosgrave, that we could find a difference of views, perhaps, within the House <Col N="608" /> as to what constitutes the duties of a Deputy.  My own view is that any person who can find time to occupy himself outside this House at any other kind of activity is hardly discharging his duties as a Deputy.  It is a fulltime professional occupation, and, as we have learned to our utter grief in the last week, a killer occupation.  It does not need any justification, this proposal&mdash;its merits are evident&mdash;but I want to congratulate the Minister for bringing it before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much more for me to say except to repeat that as soon as I get the statutory authority provided by this measure, we will introduce a motion immediately which will spell out in detail the conditions under which the pensions will be paid, the amounts and so on.  The cost to the Exchequer is not significant and I agree with the two Members on the opposite side who have spoken that this is something which is not only desirable but necessary.</P>

      <P>I should like to make one short comment on this. There is one matter which perhaps the Minister might clarify.  I found that for some extraordinary reason, there are two members of the Stationery Office employed here who are not allowed overtime.  That has been the regulation for a considerable period but other people from other Departments are taken in to do overtime for their sections.  These are people who have given quite a long service, particularly one of them.  If there is a regulation which precludes the payment of overtime and it is being rigidly adhered to, it is time it was done away with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment last night, I had just concluded giving particulars of the number of votes received by each of the majority Parties in Dáil Éireann from 1923 onwards and also the percentage of seats won by them.  I did this because I wanted to show the House that from 1923 up to 1938, on no occasion did a single Party have a majority in this House.  Despite that, we had a Dáil of which the life was three years and eight months, another, four years and three months and another, four years and four months.  In 1933, in fact, the majority Party had exactly half the number of seats and remained in office for four years and four months.  A real majority occurred again in 1938 and the Dáil had a life <Col N="611" /> of five years.  We come along then to 1944; again, with a majority, the Dáil had a life of three years and seven months.  In the next Dáil, 1948, there was not a majority and the life of the Dáil was three years and three months. In the next Dáil, there was no majority and the life of the Dáil was two years and ten months.  In the next Dáil, there was not a majority and the life of the Dáil was two years and eight months.  In the next Dáil, 1957, there was a majority and the life of the Dáil was four years and six months.  In 1961, when there was not a majority, the life of the Dáil was three years and five months, and the present Dáil started off with exactly half the seats; the Government now have a majority and God alone knows what the life of this Dáil will be.</P>
      <P>I make this argument because some of the Government speakers have been attempting to prove that, if there is not a strong Party, a Party with an overall majority, there is likely to be chaos in the country.  I want to show that this did not happen before and there is no evidence that it is likely to happen in the future.  I want to make it very clear that the fact that a Party did not have an overall majority did not affect the life of the Dáil.  What did affect it was the whim of the Party leader and the Government in power.  We had that on two or three occasions, occasions on which the Dáil could have continued but did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most peculiar statements have been made here.  I referred to one statement last night when I mentioned the fact that the Taoiseach was apparently under the impression that in a general election the votes are counted in the same manner and according to the same system as that which operates in a Seanad election.  He referred to the possibility of the wrong parcel of votes being counted, which would have an effect on the transfers.  Since that a Fianna Fáil Deputy approached me and said: &ldquo;You are wrong.  The parcels are used.&rdquo; If he likes to count the number of parcels put together when they are carried from the pigeon-holes to where they are counted as parcels, that is his privilege but, on <Col N="612" /> every transfer, every vote must be counted and, for that reason, in a general election as in a local authority election, the votes are counted right through.</P>
    <P>The complaint has been made that counting the votes takes a great deal of time but, since the Dáil will not meet for a considerable period after a general election, surely time is not that important?  What is important is ensuring that people are represented properly.  The Minister for Local Government built up to his own satisfaction last night an argument about people being doubly represented and about irresponsible people who, according to him, voted up to 19 or 20.  I do not know where they could get ballot papers with that number of candidates, but the Minister referred to their irresponsibility and said it was those irresponsibles who were deciding elections.  That is a lot of nonsense because we work the proportional representation system and we expect to vote one, two, three, four, five, six or seven, if there are six or seven candidates.</P>

      <P>This is one of those cases in which people do not look into their own backyards before they start criticising their neighbours. We have two by-elections today.  These are being fought on a system, which is not really perhaps proportional representation but which may be called proportional representation.  The main point is that the people are entitled to vote No. 1 for a candidate and, if that candidate is not elected, they are entitled, if they so desire, to vote No. 2 and they are entitled to have a say in the person who is elected.  That is important, in my opinion, and I hope the people of Clare and Wicklow realise that this may be the last opportunity anyone will get in this country of a choice such as we have now because, if the Government get their way, that choice will no longer exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee on the Constitution was referred to last night by the Minister for Local Government.  As I said before, like some of his Party speakers outside, he has tried in a somewhat peculiar way to give the impression that the Committee on the Constitution are responsible for the introduction of this proposal.  It cannot be repeated often enough that there was no suggestion of any kind by the Committee on the Constitution&mdash;good, bad or indifferent&mdash;that the so-called straight vote should be introduced. They reported that, because they were advised by the senior members of the Committee that it would not be possible to have this type of thing put before the Dáil and the country, if they were interested in a change, then the change would have to be the single seat with the transferable vote. It is interesting to note that the case built up by the Fianna Fáil members of that Committee, was in favour, though not all were in favour of a change, of the single seat with the transferable vote and the other members were in favour of the retention of the present system.  It is ludicrous for the Minister for Local Government &mdash;I am sure he has access to the documents which were available to the Committee&mdash;to come in here now and <Col N="614" /> try to argue that this proposal was brought; about because the Committee felt a change should take place.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to unused votes and to the fact that, under the present system, there are people who do not get a say in the election of somebody.  The average over the number of elections held is, I think, 15 per cent. In other words, only 15 per cent are affected because a candidate remains in the field until the last moment and is then eliminated.  The Taoiseach took a constituency of 12,000 voters.  I do not know if he was a bit mixed up between the number of people represented and the number of voters, but he came down eventually on a figure of 12,000 voters.  In such a constituency, one candidate, under the proposed change, could get 4,001 votes, a second, 4,000 votes and the third, 3,999.  That would not be the 15 per cent unrepresented about whom the Minister was complaining last night; it would be 66 per cent exactly of the people who voted in that constituency unrepresented, and the person who got the bare 33? would be elected.  I do not think any of us want to see a situation where so many people would be disfranchised.  If we go ahead with this, we will be ensuring in most constituencies that the majority of the people will not have representation, that a minority of the people will be represented by the Member.</P>
    <P>This system has been referred to as the British system and Britain has been using it for many years.  Perhaps it might be better if we referred to it as the Northern Ireland system where something like 27 constituencies are never contested because the Orange Tories in the North have got a majority there and nobody dare challenge them. The result is that the minorities are never represented.  The Green Tories in the South apparently are anxious to create the same position here, so that they will be able to hold on to the seats and do what they like.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point to which the Taoiseach referred.  He said the single-seater would produce a better type of Member, and referred to the many calls that are made on <Col N="615" /> Members to get things for people&mdash; things to which they are entitled, let me add.  It shows how much the Taoiseach is out of touch with the ordinary people.  If we are to take the Taoiseach seriously, he was saying to this House and to the country, and perhaps more important still, to his own Party: &ldquo;We are no longer going to have a situation where the constituencies will select their representatives, because we do not think they are selecting the right people.  We will get the intelligentsia to do it&rdquo;&mdash;people who are attached to Fianna Fáil under various guises, the up and going young men, people with money who are anxious to get places and who do not want to work too hard for it, who have become attached to Fianna Fáil because they happen to be the Party in power and would be quite happy to be attached to any other Party if they were in power.  We have seen many of this type at the by-elections in Wicklow and Clare.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was suggesting that these would be the people who would be selected to represent constituencies, and he warned the constituencies that they should not expect these supermen to go and find out what happened that Mrs. So-and-So did not get her widow's pension to which she is entitled but which she cannot get unless somebody who knows how to go about it makes the necessary representations; or why somebody who is due a grant from the Department of Local Government or the Department of Agriculture, or whatever type of grant it might be, did not get it.  These representatives will have no time for that.  These are intelligent people who are not to be bothered with these things; it will be their job to carry out the law-making of the country.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the message has got through to the Fianna Fáil people, particularly the backbenchers, that this is what is going to happen, that if the straight vote goes through as in Britain or particularly as in Northern Ireland, the fellow who does not even know where the constituency is will be wished on them.  I do not know whether or not the Taoiseach meant <Col N="616" /> this when he made the statement, but listening to it and afterwards reading it, I got the impression that he was very definitely giving this warning that the choosing of potential representatives for Dáil Éireann would be more select and that the only way to achieve this would be to take it out of the hands of the constituency organisation. Do not say Fianna Fáil would not do this, because we know they have already done it on a number of occasions.  They have rejected people selected at constituency level and picked other people, and they could do it again.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce made a number of interesting statements the other night.  One of them, perhaps, was not quite understood by those in his own Party who listened to him, but I am sure when they read it afterwards, they began to wonder whose side he was on.  He said that politics was a young man's game.  I do not know whether or not he was looking at the Minister for External Affairs who happened to be present&mdash;it was rather embarrassing for him&mdash;but he seemed to imply that only young fellows like himself were entitled to be elected to Dáil Éireann and that when they got a little older, they should get out.  Since they could not be removed under the proportional representation system, because the unreasonable constituency organisations considered they were entitled to select these people and let the electorate decide whether or not to return them, the system would have to be changed in order to get rid of them.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister was really serious or whether he felt it was a popular thing to say.  There are people who insist on remaining in politics until they have far outlived their usefulness.  It seems to me a little ridiculous that, if a public official must retire at a certain age on the ground that he is not fit to continue to do his job properly, politicians should be allowed to continue until they are in their eighties or nineties. However, the suggestion by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that politics was simply a young man's game and that the early fifties was a <Col N="617" /> time at which people should get out of politics to make room for young fellows like him, is one that many people in his own Party will have something to say about before this measure goes through the House.  I have the feeling that at the back of his mind was the idea that certain older members of his own Party were ruling the roost and that he should publicly give warning that they were not going to be allowed to do this any longer.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce were speaking as individuals or were putting the Party line across, but it seemed to me extraordinary that this line should have been taken by them.  As far as the constituencies are concerned, they have the right so far to select their own candidates.  When a number of people are selected, the voters decide which of them they want to remain and which of them they want removed.  As a person who was elected to Dáil Éireann and who subsequently lost my seat under PR, and then regained it, I feel it is the right system. The public should be entitled to remove a Member of this House if they find he is not doing his duty or if they think he is not doing his duty.  Obviously, what the Government want to do is to tie down the representation to such a state that they will be able to confine the selection to whoever they want and, following that, that these people will be able to remain here for a very long time.</P>
    <P>The other matter referred to in the Bills is this question of tolerance.  If I were to find a word to describe it, I do not think it would be &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo;. If there is anything more intolerant of the rights of the individual than this suggestion, I would like to know of it. The Taoiseach referred to the fact that some people were saying there should be a tolerance of 10,000 people and added: &ldquo;Of course, we are not suggesting anything like that.  The suggestion we are making is entirely different.&rdquo; Then he went on to talk about the 12,000 vote.  According to the reckoning I and others have made, it does appear that on a 12,000 vote, there could be a 40 per cent change. <Col N="618" /> It would appear on that basis that it would be impossible, as the Taoiseach said, to have a difference of 10,000; but I think you will find the percentage difference is very much greater than the 10,000 on the present 20,000 to 30,000.  In fact, it looks as if the Government are prepared to allow&mdash;if I may be permitted to use the word again&mdash;a tolerance of about 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>This again is something which has been very ill advised.  We hear people on the Government Benches talking about one man, one vote.  The issue is one man, one vote of equal value. The Minister for Lands is reported as having said in Wicklow that the Government were going to reverse the trend of the rush from the West by putting a number of civil servants&mdash;very much against their wills&mdash;down in Castlebar. If the single-seat constituency is introduced, we can see how useful 2,500 people would be in a place like Castlebar.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Corry was speaking from experience or just giving us what somebody else told him when he talked about the difficulty of contacting his various supporters throughout his constituency. He seemed to be overjoyed at the fact that he at least would be able to save himself&mdash;I think he said a night or two in a hotel&mdash;by having a small compact constituency which he could view from some height from his home. Having had the experience of listening to him in this House telling how he surveyed farms of land at night by shining the lights of his car on them and in Paul Goldin style, having an inspector down to divide the lands the next day, I would not be surprised at anything the Deputy might do.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister for Defence at present sitting in the Government Front Bench, I have the honour to represent Meath.  It is a big constituency.  I live at the extreme eastern end.  Somebody has said that my supporters can come from only three sides.  They cannot come from the fourth because it is the sea.  I think the Minister for Defence will agree with me that anybody who suggests in the year 1968 that it is not possible to contact people over a wide <Col N="619" /> area like this, if those people want to see us and&mdash;more important&mdash;if we want to see them, is talking through his hat.  Most of my work is done by letter and some of it by telephone. On occasions I travel, as the Minister does, from one end of the constituency to the other so that I can talk to people who may not be able to get to where I live or who would prefer to speak about a matter rather than write about it.</P>
    <P>I know there are more widely spaced areas in constituencies in the country than in the one I represent, but to suggest that, because somebody feels he is being overworked by having to represent an area a bit far away from him, the whole electoral system should be changed is a lot of cod.  Deputy Corry, or anybody else who feels like he does that the effort to try to represent those people and to travel around to where they can be met is too much, all have a very simple way of getting out of this.  They do not have to go forward at the next election.  Judging by the number of candidates who go into the ring whenever there is a general election, I am sure that under the present system there would be little difficulty in getting people to go forward and seek election to represent those whom some members of the Fianna Fáil Party feel it is too much of an effort to represent.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made by the Taoiseach, by the Minister for Justice earlier, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and particularly by the Minister for Local Government that areas where there is very little population at all are entitled to representation in this House will not hold water.  All of us who come here know we are representing people.  If by any chance under the system suggested here almost the entire population of a particular area moved out, if we were to follow the logic of the arguments being made by the Government we would have to change the Constitution again to ensure that those areas would be represented here, even though there was nothing in them except rabbits, hares and birds.</P>
    <P>What I cannot understand is the sheer audacity of the Government in <Col N="620" /> trying to put this over and to make a virtue out of something they know quite well is intended to be a blister. I was highly amused at some of the suggestions made, that the only reason the Government were introducing it was that they felt the Opposition should be given an opportunity to govern.  I do not think anybody could accuse the Fianna Fáil Party of ever being anxious to hand over the reins of Government if they thought there was a possibility of holding on to them. When they tell us that they feel an opportunity should be given to the Opposition to govern, it is hard to know the reason why they are doing these things.  However, I would suggest one thing.</P>
    <P>What the Fianna Fáil Party have at the back of their mind in introducing this Bill is that they have realised there are a number of things which they just cannot do and which they would like to do.  One of them is the very controversial Trade Union Bill.  I would suggest that the reason that Bill was introduced nearly two years ago and has been shelved for a considerable time is that the Government feel they can at this stage attempt to get a strong enough majority in this House to enable them to bludgeon the workers of this country, because they know that the majority of the workers have turned against the Fianna Fáil Government.  If they were honest about this, they would say that is one reason why they would like to pass this legislation.</P>
    <P>The second reason is that I believe the Government feel they should be in a position to take stronger measures against certain sections of the farming community.  I believe that what the farmers did last year so irritated the Government that the only thing they regretted was that they had not got a whopping big majority which would allow them to grind the farmers in the organisation concerned in the dust.  I may be wronging the Government, but it appears to me that that is one reason they are trying to do this.  I believe from the rumblings we have heard from certain people and comments behind closed doors which resulted in press releases <Col N="621" /> and little things which would affect the result&mdash;and they are contradicted sometimes by the Deputy who is supposed to have made the comments&mdash; that down in the grass roots of the Fianna Fáil organisation, there is a feeling that they are losing their grip on the country, and particularly on the workers and farmers who are realising for the first time that they are getting a raw deal.  In an attempt to grind them down, the Government want to get an overwhelming majority which they claim they could get with this change, and which would allow them to introduce legislation under which they could do what they liked.</P>
    <P>It may be said that if they do this the people will, of course, turn on them at the first available opportunity.  I want to pose this question.  Supposing Fianna Fáil succeeded in getting 93 votes in this House out of a possible 144, and supposing they got five years in office with those 93 votes to back everything they did, I should like to know what chance people would have at the end of five years of raising their heads or attempting to fight back in those circumstances?  Let no one tell me that the Fianna Fáil Government are not ruthless enough to do this.  We have the evidence of it all over the place.  There are some decent people in the Fianna Fáil Party as well as in the other Parties.  My colleague, the Minister for Defence, is a person for whom I have the highest respect.  He is a decent and honourable man.  I would not like to say the same of all his Cabinet colleagues; I would not like to say the same of many of his colleagues in Meath.  He knows as well as I do, that if they got the opportunity, some of them would grind not only my face but his also in the dust.</P>
    <P>He knows quite well, and I know it, that if the Government succeeded in getting the control they hope to get under this Bill, they would make it impossible for any Opposition to go out openly and fight them at a general election.  Those people who say that cannot happen should remember that we have been fighting elections for a long period and we know that you can go into the house of a poor old man <Col N="622" /> or woman drawing the old age pension and find them extremely reticent about discussing anything with you, even though you know their sympathies are with your Party, and finally discover that they have been warned by supporters of the Government that if they do not vote for the Government, their pensions will either be reduced or taken from them altogether.  If someone feels that this is not being done, the evidence is available to prove that it has been done.  Further, if you find that these people have been told that the Party will know how they voted, that makes it look a little bit odd.</P>
    <P>I had a conversation at a function last Sunday at which the Minister attended with a number of other people and I was horrified to find that at an election held a few years ago, there was a row about the transfer of a vote. One person present was able to tell me not only the way the person voted No. 1 but also how the transfer went to the person who made the complaint.  There was also the fact that the person had got a medical card a few weeks earlier and following the disclosure of how he voted, the medical card was taken from him.  For goodness sake, let no one say that in circumstances like that it would not be possible for a Party with 90 odd seats in the House to bulldoze their way through the country and prevent any opposition being raised at the end of five years.  The Government say that if they do wrong, they will be swept out of power at the next election.  I am giving the answer to that.  They will successfully crush any opposition which might arise.</P>
    <P>In his Second Reading speech, the Taoiseach made a number of points and, as I pointed out last night and today, I consider his arguments extremely weak.  If there were good points to be made for this legislation, the Taoiseach should have set them down and we would know what they were. Having listened to his speech, I am perfectly satisfied that there is no argument in favour of the straight vote, if you like to call it the straight vote. In addition, I am satisfied that the Taoiseach was not too happy about the whole situation.  We know there was quite a to-do at the Fianna Fáil <Col N="623" /> Ard-Fheis about the question of what change should take place.  Walls have ears and we know also that there was quite a to-do at the Fianna Fáil Party meeting when a final recommendation had to be made.</P>
    <P>The case being made that PR does not give stable government is all cod because we have had longer breaks between elections here than they had across the water, and we have had one election less here than they had in Britain over the same period.  We have had minority governments elected and governing for periods of four or five years.  I am well aware that the Government feel that at the next election they are likely to lose quite a number of seats and that some bright boy&mdash;the Minister for Local Government is the person who is being blamed for it and I am inclined to agree that that is probably right&mdash;got the idea that if they could push through this change in the Constitution to the straight vote, to the Northern Ireland system of election, they would be able to hold on for ever.  I want to make it very clear that I believe from a number of people I met throughout the country that the Government are in for a rude shock.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter not only with supporters of my own Party and people in favour of retaining PR but also with quite a number of well-known Fianna Fáil supporters.  I have yet to meet one of them outside this House who has said to me: &ldquo;I am in favour of a change.&rdquo; Again and again the same phrase has been used: &ldquo;We voted for the change in 1949; we shall not vote for it now.&rdquo; These are people who I am quite sure will vote Fianna Fáil in the next election but they feel, as we do, that the Government are attempting to take absolute power into their hands, attempting to take over the country.  They feel they now own the country and can do anything they like with it.  I described this before as similar to the child's game where the youngsters are playing football and when the boy who owns the ball is on the losing side, there is nothing to do but change the rules so that he will win.  This <Col N="624" /> country is like a football and Fianna Fáil think they own it, and as they do not appear to be going to win, the only thing to do is to change the rules and see if they can win under the new rules which they devise.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice said there was only a small number of countries using PR.  He seemed to suggest that the more intelligent countries were moving on to the straight vote system &mdash;somebody referred to it recently as the illiterate vote: you vote X.  The Minister was not quite on the mark because from information I have got, it appears that a big number of countries use PR.  Not all of them use the same system as we use but most of them use a system of transferable vote.  As the House knows, the PR system falls into two categories, the single transferable vote and the list system.  We use the single transferable vote and any candidate who is found on the first count to have received a quota of first preference votes gets his seat.  But if he has obtained more first preference votes than the quota, then his surplus is distributed among the other candidates in proportion to the respective second preferences shown on all of his ballot papers.  The votes so distributed then count as first preferences for the candidates benefiting from the transfer of the surplus.  This may bring the total of votes cast for one or more of the other candidates above the quota. If so, then each such candidate gets a seat on this second count.  The Taoiseach seemed to think that, as in the Seanad vote, you simply put the votes into parcels of 50 and that the returning officer at random picks out one of those parcels and then the transfer goes on according to the preferences.</P>
    <P>Apparently, from a discussion I had with a Fianna Fáil Deputy before the proceedings opened here today, a number of members of the Fianna Fáil Party do not understand how our system of PR does, in fact, work.  The next highest number of surplus papers is distributed according to the next preferences shown on the papers last transferred to him.  Should no candidate's total have exceeded the quota, then the candidate with the lowest <Col N="625" /> number of votes is eliminated and each of the papers then credited to that candidate is transferred to the candidate marked by the voter as his next preference among the candidates still remaining in the running.  After each such distribution, the voters for each candidate are totalled and any candidate who attains the quota gets his seat.  The process continues until all seats are filled.</P>
    <P>The objection that has been made by some people to that type of election is that some votes can elect more than one candidate, but if it is remembered that only a quota of votes is required to elect a candidate, the statement that one vote carries more strength than others is not true.  In fact, if what the Taoiseach said was correct, that it was part of the parcel, it would be a haphazard system of election.  It is not so.  Each vote is counted and the number of votes over the quota is what is counted in proportion to the number of No. 2 preferences given to other candidates.  This is so simple that I cannot understand why people should make a mistake about it.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made by the Taoiseach that the quality of members would be improved.  W. J. M. MacKenzie in his book on &ldquo;Free Elections&rdquo; has adopted certain criteria for existing PR systems.  He had eight main criteria&mdash;the quality of members, the member and his constituency, a collectively effective assembly, reflection of opinion, attitude of electors in voting, public confidence, by-elections and political possibility.  He has given a statement on each of those and the arguments he makes in support of his theories, I think it will be agreed, are pretty sensible.  I do not propose to go through them all but in regard to the quality of members, it is rather interesting to note that he says: &ldquo;The tendency of the system is to give more opportunity to the voter to express an opinion about the merits of individual candidates.  In a constituency in which a number of Party candidates stand for election, it can be made plain who the voters think would be best of the Party candidates and an `independent' party candidate rejected by the Party machine might stand without splitting <Col N="626" /> the Party vote.  The electorate gains freedom in the choice of members at the expense of the parties.  Whether this means better members depends on the quality of the electorate....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole point is that we believe the electorate should be entitled to select from a number of candidates and vote for them according to their merits. Apparently the Government have decided this should not be allowed and that the way to do it is to put one man forward and say: &ldquo;He is our man; you must vote for him.&rdquo; I heard somebody say the other day that if somebody who does not know anything about the constituency is put forward, he will not get the votes of the Party. Even under the present system, I am afraid we have evidence that he will get the votes of the Party.  I am sure the Minister for External Affairs will not think it amiss if I point out that despite the fact that he has been out of the country much longer than he has been in it, over the years he is elected in a fairly high place in County Louth, even though there is a second choice there.  For this reason, I feel that if a Party say, in areas where they are strong, that they are putting up Mr. X, Mr. X will get the vote and it will be considered as untrue to the Party if they do not vote for him.</P>
    <P>God forgive me, but I should hate to see some of the people I see knocking about at present hanging on to the coat-tails of Ministers and other highly placed people in the Fianna Fáil organisation, sent down to represent the constituency which I and the Minister for Defence represent at present.  But knowing these people and knowing that they have sufficiently hard neck to push their case to have this done, I feel sure that if this passes in the House and in the country there is a dire danger that we will finish up with some leath-scéal representing the constituency we represent at the present time.</P>
    <P>Another thing mentioned in Mr. Mackenzie's book is the reflection of opinion.  It says:</P>
    <P>The system undoubtedly reflects individual opinions as well as any system can, within the administrative limits set by modern electorates.  A counter-argument can only be constructed <Col N="627" /> on this point by insisting that in politics what counts is organised opinion, not the sort of opinion which expresses itself in answer to the questionnaires of the &ldquo;gallup poll&rdquo;, but opinion shaped by party organisation into an effective political instrument associating known leaders, an alert body of party followers, coherent principles and an agreed programme of action.  This is a crucial point in debate about mass democracy.  The case for political parties is strong, but it is also possible to reverse the argument and to suggest that since party organisation is hostile to free speech within the party, it is as likely to block public opinion as to canalise it.</P>
    <P>The argument is there, for what it is worth, and I suggest that what the Parties want is to try to have a select body who will do whatever the leader says and that constituency interests should not arise at all.  All of us being Party men know, and I particularly as a Party Whip know, the responsibility to take a line when the Party decides to take a line.  I know the responsibility and the necessity to do it but I also know, being intimately connected with my constituency and with my constituents, that I can make my case within the Party and this is something which cannot happen or will not happen if&mdash; and I am insisting that this is the whole idea&mdash;we have this set of safe people in safe seats which is apparently the idea the Government have at the present time.  The intellectuals&mdash;a friend of mine recently referred to them as Woodhouse intellectuals&mdash;are likely to be hanging around and likely to find themselves representing respectable constituencies in this country if the Government have their way.  I hope that sort of thing will never happen.</P>
    <P>There are dozens of things which can be said here and I do not want to attempt to repeat the cases made by other members of my Party but I would like to try to cover as many as possible of the points which were raised by Government speakers in their arguments so far.  However, I feel that in making arguments in this House, it <Col N="628" /> is necessary to stress, and it cannot be stressed too often, that we in the Labour Party are fighting this on the principle that there should be only a system of election to Dáil Éireann which will (a) give the right of the electorate to choose between different candidates, even of the same Party, if they so desire, and (b) that they should be entitled to have the majority of the electors in a constituency represented by a Member.  The system suggested by the Government is that we should have a minority of people elected as can happen simply because they have got one vote more than the next person on the list and despite the fact that there may be 10,000 or 12,000 votes against them and only 4,000 votes in their favour.  I do not think that we can be expected to accept or that the Irish people will accept this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>When proportional representation was introduced here in 1923, I understand there was a similar system over the Border.  Areas which have not been represented in Parliament since by a Nationalist or an Anti-Tory or Anti-Unionist member at that time had such representatives in Parliament.  When they changed over to the straight vote system, it resulted in 40 years of Tory rule, particularly in places like Derry where with a little bit of gerrymandering&mdash;God knows the last occasion the present Government did a bit of shuffling around, they showed what they could do with regard to gerrymandering&mdash;those people were deprived of representation in Parliament.  The Taoiseach was very eloquent when speaking here about the necessity to retain county boundaries.  He knows just as well as I do that when the last changes were being made, county boundaries did not come into it at all.  The only thing that did come in was how many extra voters would it be necessary to take from one area and put into another to ensure that there would be an extra safe seat for Fianna Fáil.  We got it, indeed, where a portion was taken off and added to Kildare in order to do that and we had a repeat of this all over the country.  As to preserving county boundaries and insisting that there would be only <Col N="629" /> counties represented by a Deputy the fact that the Taoiseach proposes breaking up each county into at least three shows that what he says is not what he believes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power was also very eloquent here about the necessity to have the areas properly represented.  Monaghan is another area where we had a portion of County Louth dumped into it in order to ensure that the Government would hold on to their two seats there. The Minister for Transport and Power, a man for whom I have high regard, is the last person in the world who should talk on this because when it suited the Government he was put into Longford-Westmeath and dumped in there, and when it looked as if he was going to lose his seat there, he was picked out and dumped into Monaghan.  For goodness sake, if these people start talking about the necessity to have single seats and the straight vote and talking about representation for ordinary people we all may give up.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, when speaking here the other day, seemed to think that he could refer to the fact that there were what he called two Coalition Governments. I would call them inter-Party but when we come to coalition, I would remind the House that we have had numerous coalitions.  I have proved here that practically every Government in this country over a long number of years was a coalition of Independents and Fianna Fáil.  He seemed to think that the biggest argument he could make was what happened with the two Coalitions.  Now, it is true that the Coalitions did not run their full course but it is also true that the Coalition or inter-Party Governments while in office, did things which Fianna Fáil had not the guts to do.  The two breaks here, with alternative Governments, proved to Fianna Fáil that they would have to be on their toes.  I believe the reason the Government now want to change is that they want to prevent any group from forming a coalition, an inter-Party Government or what have you.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of Coalition or <Col N="630" /> inter-Party Government but I believe that the Government want to prevent such a danger and in order to do so, they would go to any extreme.  The figures produced by experts of what will be the result in a general election if the straight vote comes in are interesting.  While the Government talk about the necessity to ensure that we have a stable Government and that there should be a two Party system for their ideal, providing that they are the bigger one, and while the experts gave the Government 93 votes, something like 20 for Fine Gael and eight, I think, for Labour they also included 12 Independents.  I am sure that gave solace to the Fianna Fáil Party because they were always particularly fond of Independents.</P>
    <P>Queen Victoria is reputed to have asked on one occasion a Prime Minister what way her Parliament was made up.  She was told it was made up of Whigs, Tories and Independents. She then said: &ldquo;I know what Whigs and Tories are but what are Independents?&rdquo;  The answer given is as true now as it was then.  It was: &ldquo;Madam, an Independent is a gentleman whom nobody can trust&rdquo;.  We have those people going around and some years ago they were very useful to Fianna Fáil.  Now, apparently the only use Fianna Fáil have for them is kite flying.  Deputy Lenihan flew a kite but apparently it dropped on him because he did not get the wind necessary to fly it for him.  It appears that somebody else has got it now.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are opposed to any change from proportional representation to a single seat with a straight vote, a single seat with a transferable vote, a single seat with a non-transferable vote or what have you.  We believe this country is satisfied with the present system.  We believe that when the referendum takes place the people will vote not 30,000 against it, as they did the last time, but at least ten times that number against it to prove that they are not going to have any more of this meddling with the Constitution.  I believe that the result will teach Fianna Fáil that what they want in this country is not what the country wants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> I hope that when the result is available they will accept this because Deputy Lemass said&mdash;I referred to this last night&mdash;at the Constitution Committee that the Government accepted the last one and that they could not have the hard neck&mdash;that is not what he said but that is what he meant&mdash; to get the country to vote on an issue which had been voted on nine years ago.  The only way the Government can be prevented from trying this again and again is by a massive vote against the change and I feel confident that that massive vote against it will be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I look at this Bill and see the title &ldquo;The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968&rdquo; and read through the Bill and discover that its purpose is to refer to the people a proposed amendment to the Constitution, I wonder, because no indication is given in the Bill itself, what exactly will be the words on the ballot paper.  Are the electors to be asked: &ldquo;Do you agree with an amendment of Article 16 of the Constitution?&rdquo; or are they to be asked the simple question: &ldquo;Are you in favour of the abolition of proportional representation?  If that is so, say `Yes' and, if not, say `No'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a very simple question which should be put to the people but we have no indication, as yet, what the question on the ballot paper will be. Again, if we refer to the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, that is even more complex and no indication is given in that Bill what exactly are the terms or words which will be used on the ballot paper and on which the electors will be asked for a verdict.  The Taoiseach, if not in the Bill at least in his opening statement, should have informed us what the intention of the Government was or the Minister promoting the Bill should have been able to tell us what is to be the net question which will be put to the electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in this House have been discussing hypothetical questions.  I can see an issue being put to the people which would be so confusing that it would <Col N="632" /> be impossible for them to answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; and not being satisfied in their minds as to what they are doing.  It may be that they will depend on the political Parties to advise them as to whether they will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; but will the illiterate or uneducated voter be satisfied with what he is doing when it comes to voting on the particular Bill?  I sometimes dread parliamentary draftsmen because they do not make clear in a Bill what may be the intention of the Legislature.</P>
    <P>To the proposition that the net question will be: &ldquo;Are you in favour of the abolition or retention of proportional representation&rdquo;, I hope to address my remarks.  Deputy Tully pointed out that under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, proportional representation was first introduced to this country.  It was on that occasion, I think, that the late King George, who then opened the Northern Parliament, threw out the first feelers towards the settlement of the dispute between this country and Great Britain.  It must be borne in mind that the great majority of the people in this country at that time belonged to one political Party, namely, Sinn Féin.  I think it is but right to say that approximately 90 per cent of the people were behind the Sinn Féin movement.</P>
    <P>When we came to enact the first Constitution here in 1922, the then Government went out of their way to ensure that there would be a fair representation in this Parliament for whatever minorities might exist in the State at the time.  One should bear in mind the position of minorities.  At that time there was only one real minority and that minority was composed of those who were opposed to the breaking of the link with Britain.  They might be described for want of a better word as Unionists.  In the Twenty-Six Counties the Free State Government or Provisional Government leaned over backwards to ensure that those Unionists and other minorities would be fairly represented in the Parliament of this State.  Those people took advantage of that and actually elected their own representatives to the Parliament here <Col N="633" /> for very many years.  In my own constituency of County Donegal, they elected Major Myles, who represented what might be described, for want of a better word, the Unionists or exUnionists of the day.  Cavan did likewise, and Dublin, and other constituencies throughout the State.</P>
    <P>These minorities knew they were going in on what was described as &ldquo;cothrom na Féinne&rdquo;, fair play for all, by permitting their representatives to come here and represent them in Dáil Éireann.  We had proportional representation under the first Constitution and then Fianna Fáil came into power and the second Constitution was introduced by the then President. President de Valera introduced it and speaking on the Constitution, he made particular reference to proportional representation.  If I may quote, Sir, from Volume 68 of 1st June, 1937, he said:</P>
    <P>I think where there is a question of the foundation of the whole system of Parliamentary representation we have got to be a little bit careful....</P>
    <P>The system we have we know; the people know it.  On the whole it has worked out pretty well.  I think that we have a good deal to be thankful for in this country: we have to be very grateful that we have had the system of proportional representation here.  It gives a certain amount of stability, and on the system of the single transferable vote you have fair representation of Parties.</P>
    <P>That was the opinion of Mr. de Valera after 15 years experience of proportional representation.  &ldquo;Fair representation of Parties&rdquo;, and I presume, fair representation of both majorities and minorities.  When Mr. de Valera, our President, was Taoiseach, there was never any mention whatsoever of the abolition of proportional representation and it was only in or about the year 1958-59 when the then Taoiseach decided to move on and seek the Presidency of this country that we first heard of the abolition of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> There is no doubt that it was in the mind of Deputy Lemass, the successor to Mr. de Valera, that it was first thought of as a method of perpetuating government by Fianna Fáil here.  It was only when Mr. de Valera decided to become a candidate for the Presidency that Mr. Lemass first flew a kite for the abolition of proportional representation and when the then Taoiseach became adamant that he was going to be a candidate for the Presidency.  I suggest that it was part of the bargain of Fianna Fáil rolling in behind him that he would permit a referendum on the abolition of proportional representation and that he reluctantly agreed, bearing in mind what he said on 1st June, 1937, that proportional representation had given fair representation to all Parties and minorities.</P>
    <P>I respectfully say that our President of today had no option but to agree to that proposal of Deputy Lemass, his successor and then heir apparent, because we all know when Mr. de Valera succeeded to the Presidency, that Mr. Lemass's brainchild was killed off.  The abolition of proportional representation was defeated in the referendum and that is less than nine years ago.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Lemass became Taoiseach, he then again saw the danger of the power of government slipping from Fianna Fáil and to try to retain the Government of this State for Fianna Fáil, he resigned as Taoiseach.  He gave very lame excuses for resigning.  He said he was getting too old, despite the fact that it was only a short 12 months before that he and Fianna Fáil asked the country to let the Government lead on&mdash;&ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;&mdash;and then he tells us he is getting too old.  Too old for what?  He immediately accepted and, rightly so, a number of directorships. Not only has he done that but the first thing he does when he becomes a backbencher is to get on to the Committee studying the Constitution, and having got there, he gets back to his original brainchild and reintroduces this question of the abolition of proportional representation.  I say respectfully and confidently that of the entire Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Lemass is <Col N="635" /> the only one genuinely seeking the abolition of proportional representation for one purpose and one purpose only, that is, the retention of a Fianna Fáil Government in this country in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The Constitution guarantees us, in my opinion, three main important things.  It guarantees that all men are equal, that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty, and that we have proportional representation to give fair representation to minorities in Dáil Éireann.  Under recent legislation in this State, the fact that a man is innocent until proved guilty has gone. Under the Road Traffic Act we now try to make a man prove himself innocent, instead of the State trying to prove him guilty.  Under the Fisheries Act if a man is caught in possession of a salmon, there is a duty on him to prove himself innocent of having illegally caught a fish.</P>
    <P>In the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, we are trying to abolish the rule, one man one vote, by giving to a lesser number of people the right to elect an equal number of Deputies with a greater number of people in another part of the country.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments used for its abolition is that it tends towards the creation of a multiplicity of small Parties.  Whatever may be said about that argument, it cannot be used today because in the Dáil today we have only three major Parties.  There was a time when we had a larger number. We had Labour, Fianna Fáil, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta and at least one other Party, Sinn Féin, although they did not actually take their seats in the House.  Whatever arguments may be used about a multiplicity of Parties, that particular argument is not valid.</P>
    <P>Another argument used is, of course, the complexity of the counting system, the length of time it takes to count the number of votes cast under PR.  We had a county registrar in my county for more than 20 years.  There were three seats in the constituency Prior to that, we had eight seats in the constituency.  We had the result of the <Col N="636" /> elections within 24 hours of the closing of the polls on each occasion.  I often wondered why.  It was because we had an efficient county registrar and staff who were willing to work into the night to ensure that the voters would become aware of the result of their judgment, passed the previous day, at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>If we could do a little more prodding&mdash;I use the word for want of a better one&mdash;of some of our returning officers, particularly their staffs, all this question and argument of delays in counting the votes would not hold water for any time.  I do not think that people who are prepared to spend hours in listening to the various arguments put forward by various political Parties, take a day off to attend at polling stations to work for Parties, or the electorate generally, who take the trouble of going to the booths, would object to waiting another 24 or 36 hours for the results of the deliberations of the returning officers and their staffs.</P>
    <P>However, if we have a multiplicity of elections, apathy will set in.  We had the last general election in 1965. We had an election in 1966.  We had local elections in 1967 and we are to have a referendum in 1968.  There have been approximately seven by-elections in between.  In 1966 we suggested that the local elections and the Presidential election should be held on the one day.  The Government did not agree to that and put the State to the expense of more than £100,000 by holding two separate elections.  Since 1965 we have referred to the electorate, at least once a year, some important or minor issue and there is the danger from all that that apathy may set in.  If apathy sets in, that, in my opinion, would be one of the greatest tragedies that ever has struck this State.  We are well aware of what happens in England, particularly when it comes to the election of executives of various unions.  Apathy among union members has permitted undesirables to secure office and cause considerable unrest and trouble.  I shall not go into that on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I believe that the electorate of this country will begin to show their disgust <Col N="637" /> at the continuous reference to them of various matters of minor issues.  It is less than nine years since this issue was referred to them.  They clearly, unequivocably, gave their decision; yet now the matter is being referred to them again.  I have suggested that Deputy Seán Lemass is the only Member of the House&mdash;the only member of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; who thought out this method of perpetuating the rule of Fianna Fáil.  I should like to know who wants the change, the abolition of PR.</P>
    <P>I am proud of the fact that had we not had PR when I was first elected to this House almost 19 years ago I would not have entered the House at all and possibly would never have sought entry into it afterwards.  The Party who nominated me, and the then Clann na Poblachta Party, procured the majority of the votes in that by-election.  Though Fianna Fáil topped the poll, they procured the minority, and by a simple transfer of the Clann na Poblachta votes to me, I was enabled to come here under PR and the electorate have seen fit to return me here since.</P>
    <P>PR in some form or other is the method of election throughout Europe. I shall not go into the details&mdash;they have been given&mdash;of the various other countries throughout Europe which have adopted the system of PR, all except Great Britain and the Six Countries, and let us not forget that the Six Counties had PR in 1920.  They abolished PR in the Six Counties for the first past the post system and as a result a Prime Minister of the North was able to boast proudly that they had a Protestant Government for a Protestant people.  Let it never be said down here that we have a Fianna Fáil Government for a Fianna Fáil people and a Fianna Fáil people only.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that Hitler had a one-Party Government.  We know what happened to it.  Italy had the same.  We know what happened to it and we know what happens where you have a one-Party Government.  It breeds dictatorship and nothing else and that is one of the greatest dangers I see in the proposal to abolish PR here.  In <Col N="638" /> Britain they have the two-Party system &mdash;Labour and Conservative.  Prior to that, there were Liberal and Conservative, but as a result of what happened in the first world war and of labour unrest, the Liberal Party permitted themselves to become defunct, in my opinion, by reason of the National Government of 1915 to 1919.</P>
    <P>Recently, a friend of mine had the opportunity of discussing with Jeremy Thorpe, the Leader of the Liberal Party there, the question of PR.  We can now count on the fingers of two hands the number of Liberals in the House of Commons.  Under PR, Mr. Thorpe informed my friend, they would be entitled to 87 seats in the House of Commons and one can imagine the balance of power the Liberals would hold had they 87 seats. There would not be any of this nationalisation when Labour are in Office and denationalisation when there is a change of Government in Britain if they had a strong centre Party such as the Liberals.  In such circumstances, there would be less danger of moving to the right when one Party are in office and to the left immediately another Party assume office.  There would be a steady centreline Government.</P>
    <P>As Deputy James Tully pointed out, constituencies in the Six Counties have been without change of representation during the past 40 years.</P>

      <P>What would happen here if the Government were to procure 100 seats in the election following the abolition of PR?  Who is to organise a constituency for an election which will take place five years from the date on which the next general election will be held?  In the meantime the local Deputy would have become an absolute dictator in his constituency.  No matter what one sought, one would have to go to the local Member to procure it&mdash;and remember, the local Member, thinking of the future election, would let the person <Col N="639" /> who sought his assistance know that his attitude to him would depend entirely on the promise he received of support or otherwise in the next general election.  I believe we would have 100 minor dictators throughout the State.</P>
      <P>I think of one constituency where Fine Gael are not represented&mdash;North Kerry.  We have not been represented there for years.  Fianna Fáil and other Parties have representation in the constituency.  We find great difficulty in procuring efficient organisation there because we have no sitting Deputy or sitting Senator there.  One can imagine what it would be like throughout the State were there no Opposition Deputies or Senators in it.  It would be absolutely impossible&mdash;impossible&mdash;to organise any constituency in an efficient and sufficient way to enable a change of representation to take place there in the next general election.</P>
      <P>If we abolish proportional representation for election to Dáil Éireann, that is the first step.  We shall next abolish it for local elections.  Not only shall we have 100 minor Fianna Fáil dictators but every Fianna Fáil county councillor will be a bigger dictator than the Member in that particular constituency.</P>
      <P>A Senator in my county boasted that, for the appointment of a rate collector, he would support, and support only, the candidate who would do most for the Fianna Fáil Party.  We also heard a Minister of this House say there was nothing wrong with a Fianna Fáil Government giving patronage to supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party: he added &ldquo;... of course, all other things being equal.&rdquo; We know what that means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can imagine local authorities controlled by Fianna Fáil; one can imagine the national Government, the Dáil, the Seanad, controlled by Fianna Fáil.  Every road ganger, every postman, every postmaster, appointed throughout the State&mdash;particularly where Fianna Fáil had a majority in any constituency&mdash;would be appointed on political patronage and there would <Col N="640" /> be no hope whatsoever of equality or fair play for any person who was not a supporter of or at least a subscriber to the Fianna Fáil Party.  We would have nothing but jobbery.  God knows, we hear enough about it at the moment.  We hear enough about the influence of members of Taca and of other such organisations.  We hear enough about what they do and can do to procure patronage from the Government.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into the question raised here yesterday by Deputy L'Estrange, and of which the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, said he was aware of the facts, where a man is alleged to have received cheques for alleging that he could procure some sort of patronage from the Government for doing some work for them.  I shall not go into that.  I am very glad, indeed, that the Minister for Local Government has said the matter is being referred to the Attorney General.  Knowing the Attorney General as I do, I feel satisfied he will investigate the matter fully and that justice will be done. Supposing, for a second, there is not one title of evidence that this gentleman approached the Government in this connection, the very fact that he can persuade a member of the public that he can use such influence, and extract money from a member of the public, is sufficient reason for the distrust the people have in public Departments and in public officials.  Statements by the Minister for Industry and Commerce about corruption in high places do not help to allay these suspicions.</P>
    <P>One of the other arguments used for the abolition of proportional representation is that, under proportional representation of the people, representatives are elected to the Government who are not the type of people who could form a Government.  I think Deputy Tully has dealt fairly fully with that.  He has dealt with the various Coalition Governments.  He dealt with the Coalition Government of the Fianna Fáil Party when they first got into office with the support of the Labour Party, away back in 1932. He dealt with the Fianna Fáil Party while they were in office in later years <Col N="641" /> and depended on five gentlemen for their support.  Those were Coalition Governments as distinct from inter-Party Governments when various Parties came together and agreed to pool their interests for the common good of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>In 1948, various Parties&mdash;Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta, the two Labour Parties and Fine Gael&mdash;came together.  They did not discuss what they disagreed on : they discussed what they agreed on.  They decided to implement, to the best of their ability, the points on which they agreed.  It was for that reason that the first inter-Party Government came into office.  A high priority on their programme was the attack on tuberculosis which they made at that time.  For that reason, there was success in this country in the eradication of tuberculosis.  Remember that the Fianna Fáil Party had been in office from 1933 to 1948 and that when the inter-Party Government first came into office, there was a dearth of sanatoria and tuberculosis was rampant.  The position was that bad but yet Fianna Fáil were complacent about the whole matter.</P>
    <P>A number of Parties came together, some of them with completely new ideas, and were able to implement and put into effect the policies on which they agreed.  They must have made a success of it because the inter-Party Government were re-elected in 1954.  I do not think there is anything wrong with a number of different political Parties coming together and deciding to work for the benefit of the country generally.  I do not think there is anything wrong with the people&mdash;the electorate generally&mdash;electing whom they wish to elect.  I notice that the Whip has just arrived.  He will have no difficulty in counting them&mdash;none whatever.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>For the life of me, I cannot see that any argument has been put forward, <Col N="642" /> with any conviction, that would justify the abolition of proportional representation.  It has been said that the constituencies would become more compact.  I live in possibly one of the largest constituencies in the State.  Not only is it almost 75 miles in length but it is approximately 40 miles in width and, off it, are a number of islands.  I am the only Fine Gael representative in the constituency.  I must say I have had no great difficulty in getting from one end of it to another.  I do not think I have failed to attend any meeting I was asked to attend throughout the constituency.  Take the other half of the county&mdash;East Donegal.  My colleague, Deputy Harte, has been able to get around the entire constituency whenever called upon.  I cannot see why Fianna Fáil should object to getting around their constituency.  In the county they have two Ministers, two Senators and, were it not for the fact that the Ceann Comhairle is completely neutral and has no politics, they would have another politician there.  I do not see, therefore, why they should object to getting around the county of Donegal.  I should not think it would be difficult.</P>
    <P>I could suggest a method whereby public representatives of Dáil Éireann would have much more time to give to their constituents and to the important function of legislating, that is, by making it unlawful for a Member of the Oireachtas to be a member of a local authority.  Far too much of the time of Deputies and Senators is taken up by their membership of local authorities.  I am a member of a local authority.  I reside approximately 60 miles from the seat of local government.  By the end of this month, I will have attended ten meetings of the local authority since the middle of January. I will have spent ten days attending meetings of the local authority.  If we want to give more time to Deputies and Senators for the work of legislating, this is one method whereby it can be done.  I know of no member, with the exception of one or two in Belfast, of the Six County Government who is a member of a local authority.  At least 99 per cent of the Members of the House of Commons and of the House <Col N="643" /> of Lords are not members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>If this is the principal argument for the abolition of proportional representation, that members of the Oireachats have not got sufficient time to give to their work as legislators, then make it unlawful for them to become members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I remember, when I was Minister for Local Government, going around interviewing the local authorities of this State when I was drafting the County Management Act of 1955.  I suggested to certain local authorities that perhaps Members of the Oireachtas might find difficulty in attending to their duties as Members of the Oireachtas while remaining members of local authorities.  I sought their views and, privately, I got the view that if they were not permitted to become members of local authorities, they would not be in the Dáil very long, that ambitious candidates of local authorities would soon succeed them.  That may be so.  I am not saying this of the Fianna Fáil Party; I am saying it of all political Parties.  In talking to them privately, they all expressed that view. I could not get one local authority throughout the State to agree that Members of the Oireachtas should be prohibited from becoming members of local authorities.  It may be that they would very soon be succeeded in the Dáil by members of local authorities but, if that were so, these people would in turn be succeeded by somebody else and it might be no harm. After a few years, the matter would even itself out and we would have no difficulty in procuring members of local authorities who had no ambition to become Members of the Oireachtas, and <i>vice versa,</i> Members of the Oireachtas who would have no ambition to remain or to become members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I had been in this House for ten years before becoming a member of a local authority.  I do not think my constituency suffered in any way by my not being a member of a local authority.  If we take a broad look at the whole thing and if the Minister <Col N="644" /> considered that that was one of the principal reasons why proportional representation should be abolished, then he could give Deputies more time for their constituents and for legislating by making it unlawful for them to remain members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, in speaking on this proposal, mentioned the fact that in the county Donegal, if proportional representation is retained, it may be necessary to go beyond the county boundaries in order to get constituencies which could comply with the Constitution or, rather, with the judgment as laid down by Mr. Justice Budd, and he suggested that it might be necessary to make the county of Donegal one constituency. If the Minister is complaining that the two constituencies are too large, I cannot see how he can possibly suggest that the two constituencies should be amalgamated for the purpose of forming one constituency and not do more damage by such enlargement than he has done at present.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the Fourth Amendment Bill, I am in a somewhat difficult position.  Personally, I have a great deal of sympathy with this amendment for this reason, that I do not believe that the census as procured on the last occasion is a true return of the population.  West of the Shannon, south-west of Ireland and north-west of Ireland there are counties which are being denuded of population more by migration than by emigration and when the census was taken, a considerable number of my constituents and of the constituents of other western counties were absent in England and Scotland, were not at home on the vital date on which the census was taken but they would return to the constituency and do return to the constituency and are entitled to remain as electors in the constituency.  It is for that reason that I have considerable sympathy with the Bill, because the census does not give a true return of the population.</P>
    <P>When the census was being taken, there should have been a special column in which to enter the number of residents of the household who would return to the household and <Col N="645" /> were merely temporarily absent, as is the annual custom in these constituencies.  If we had that true return, then, in my opinion, there would be no necessity for the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  Neither would there be any necessity to interfere with the electoral boundaries as fixed by previous rearrangement.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason, as I have said, that I have considerable sympathy with the Bill, but I dread to think what would happen if the Fourth Amendment were accepted by the people and the Third Amendment were rejected.  If the Fourth Amendment were accepted, we would have no Commission presided over by a High Court Judge to determine boundaries.  I should like to know who is going to do it.  It would be left, as it was before, to the Minister for Local Government to determine the boundaries of the constituencies and we know what happened before when it was left to the said Minister.  The matter ended in the Supreme Court. We cannot help but fear political jugglery in the rearrangement and it is for that reason alone that I oppose the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  The Constitution as it stands says &ldquo;One man, one vote.&rdquo; Here we are to have the position, if this Bill is accepted, that one neighbourhood with a population of 16,000 may elect a Deputy, but in a neighbouring constituency, it may require 23,000 people to elect a Deputy.  That would be most unfair and at the same time, it would be in breach of the Constitution where it provides for one man, one vote, and all men being equal.</P>
    <P>It has been said that a rural Deputy has much more work to do than a Deputy representing an urban or city area.  That may be, but I do know for a fact that, while I may not know every one of my constituents, I certainly know the head of the house in every house in my constituency.  I know at least one representative of the household.  That cannot be said about a city Deputy because he may not know the constituents residing around the corner.  He may find more difficulty keeping in contact with his constituents <Col N="646" /> than a rural Deputy who moves around in the places in which he will meet his constituents, not only once a year but on many occasions.  We may have more letters to write and receive more personal calls from our constituents, but on the whole I do not think that our duties are any more onerous than those of city or urban Deputies.</P>
    <P>I do not think the people of rural Ireland want more Deputies; they are satisfied with the number of Deputies they have.  Indeed, from the criticism I hear from them, they feel there are far too many Deputies and there is far too much deadwood.  That is one of the things that may cause a considerable amount of apathy.  Let me return again to the question of proportional representation.  It has been argued that we will get a better type of Deputy if we abolish PR, that a smaller constituency will come together and will select a better type of candidate.  One would infer from that that we have not been selecting the right type of candidate up to the present.  The method of Party conventions where supporters of the various Parties come together to propose and second the candidates they consider would be their best representatives in Dáil Éireann is a very democratic and proper system.  However, I can imagine what would happen if there were a one-seat constituency involved.  I can imagine the directive coming down from Party headquarters as to who the candidate should be.  We all know what happens in Britain.  We all know that there is a constituency in North Scotland represented by an Irishman who resides in London and visits the constituency five, six or seven times a year.  We know the number of public representatives there are in the House of Commons who reside practically permanently in the city of London.  The same thing applies in the North where a considerable number of representatives reside for the greater portion of the year in Belfast.</P>
    <P>Even here we have a number of rural Deputies who reside permanently in Dublin and have been doing so for a number of years.  They have no great difficulty in contacting their <Col N="647" /> constituents simply because they know that if they do not, they will be pushed out in the next election, if not by the Opposition, then by their colleagues in their own Party.  It keeps them on their toes and makes them visit their constituencies.  Suppose, however, that they had no opposition and they were merely the sole representatives in their constituencies, and suppose that they had in such a constituency a strong working organisation with keymen placed throughout the constituency to keep them in touch with the wants of their constituents, then I would say they would visit the constituency less frequently.  What is more important is that these keymen would be placed in their jobs; jobbery would arise so far as they were concerned and they would hold their jobs simply while they were henchmen of the Deputy and nothing else.  For that reason I would suggest that a great number of Deputies who now represent rural constituencies and reside in Dublin would pay less frequent visits to their constituencies than they do at the moment.</P>
    <P>I wonder what is to happen to new Parties which wish to present themselves in the State.  Fianna Fáil told us that one of the reasons for wishing to abolish proportional representation is their love for Fine Gael.  They say they are anxious to build Fine Gael up to a political Party which will eventually succeed them as the Government of this State.</P>

      <P>One of the arguments advanced by Fianna Fáil is that they are anxious to build up Fine Gael into a Party which will become the alternative Government to them on some future occasion.  They have such love for Fine Gael that they are willing to abolish Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta and even Labour in order to build up one Party as the Opposition to them.  Does anybody really believe that?  All one has to do is look across to the opposite benches and see the sarcastic smiles on the faces of the Deputies.  Do they really believe that?  Is proportional representation not being abolished for one purpose and one purpose only?  To perpetuate government by Fianna Fáil, to do exactly what Brookeborough <Col N="649" /> boasted he did, namely, have a Protestant Government for a Protestant people: Fianna Fáil want to perpetuate a Fianna Fáil Government for a Fianna Fáil people.  Is that not the ambition?</P>

      <P>I am very glad Deputy de Valera has interrupted because I want to quote for him now the words of his learned and wise father. Speaking in this House on 1st June, 1937, volume 68, he had this to say:</P>
      <P>The system we have we know; the people know it.  On the whole it has worked out pretty well.  I think that we have a good deal to be thankful for in this country: we have to be very grateful that we have had the system of proportional representation here.  It gives a certain amount of stability, and on the system of the single transferable vote you have fair representation of Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the President of Ireland had to say about proportional representation. The President of Ireland has no say today in the retention, or otherwise, of proportional representation, but, having taken him out of the political arena, the first opportunity is grabbed to reverse the decision he took in 1937.  That was the time we were all shouting &ldquo;Up Dev&rdquo;, but, as soon as we got rid of him, to hell with his opinion.  It is ludicrous for Fianna Fáil to give as one of the reasons for abolishing proportional representation their anxiety to build up Fine Gael. The President said in 1937 that it was <Col N="650" /> the best system for the country and that is the real reason Fianna Fáil now seek to abolish it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that the Fine Gael Party were opposed to &ldquo;any attempt to alter the Constitution in such manner as would in any sense affect the principle of one man one vote and that, coupled with that principle, is the fact that each vote must be of equal value.'' Deputy Cosgrave also alleged that the tolerance Bill proposed to &ldquo;alter the democratic principle that one man's vote is as good as another's.&rdquo; I propose now to examine what the situation is with regard to equality of votes where population is to be the sole factor in deciding the number of seats per county.  If Deputies took a note of this, they could examine the matter over the weekend and see if they find anything wrong in my figures.  Are the wrong conclusions drawn from them?</P>
      <P>There are 144 seats in the Dáil. According to the last census, we have a population of 2,884,002 and, according to the register of voters, there are 1,713,466 electors.  That means that the national average number of persons per seat is 20,028 and the national average of voters per seat is 11,889. Deputies will notice that there is a very big difference between the number of persons per seat and voters per seat-over 8,000.</P>
      <P>In Dublin city and county there is a population of 795,047.  In Dublin city and county there are 446,781 voters. On the basis of population, Dublin would have 28.37 seats but if seats were distributed according to the national average of the number of voters per seat, it would have only 26.7 seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come to a rural constituency. I am taking one at random; Deputies can, for their own satisfaction, look into the figures themselves and see what would happen in other rural constituencies.  I take County Cork.  In that county, excluding the city, there are 214,557 persons and there are 133,655 voters.  If Cork county got <Col N="651" /> seats according to the national average number of persons per seat, one for every 20,038, it would have 10.7 seats. If the seats were distributed according to the national average of voters per seat, it would have 11.11 seats, that is, seven per cent fewer seats on the basis of the national average of population per seat than it would have on the basis of the national average of voters per seat.</P>
    <P>That was one of the reasons why this Dáil passed the 1961 redistribution Bill with a fair margin of tolerance as between rural parts of Ireland and cities like Dublin and Cork, knowing the situation existed which I have just described in exact figures.  And if anybody can question those facts and figures, I should like to hear what he has to say.  I got these figures from the Department of Local Government, the population in these counties and cities and the numbers of voters on the register.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to remember that the revision Bill that was turned down by the High Court was passed unanimously by this Dáil and that there was no vote cast against it because it took account of the fact that there are more persons per 100 voters in the city and county of Dublin than there are in other parts of the country.  The Dáil indicated in passing the Bill that it was their opinion that it should require fewer people in the rural constituencies to obtain a seat than in the city and county of Dublin and similar areas.</P>
    <P>If we are going to make the stand which Deputy Cosgrave advocated and of which I am altogether in favour, that there should be one man one vote and equality of voting rights, on the principle that one man's vote is as good as another's, we should enable the Commission when revising seats to give greater weight to one man's vote say, in Donegal or Cork, thus bringing it nearer to the value of a Dublin vote than would be the case if the Dáil, following the Commission's report, was compelled to take account only of the number of persons per seat and not of the number of voters per seat.  It is not treating voters equally or giving <Col N="652" /> equality of voting rights if, because the Commission was restricted to taking a mathematical average number of persons per seat, Dublin was given 1.6 seats more than it would get if one man's vote in Dublin was only equal to the vote of people in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows what the reason is for this discrepancy.  When the census is taken of the number of persons residing in areas throughout the country the people resident on the night in question are counted as members of the population.  You get a situation as between Dublin and Donegal or as between Dublin and Cork rural wherein every person in a hospital, every person in an hotel, every person in an institution, even every baby that has been born the night before, is enumerated and taken into account when deciding the number of seats the city and county of Dublin shall have. Ordinary residents are not distinguished.  It would be very difficult for the people in charge of the census to take a householder's word, as Deputy P. O'Donnell suggested, that, although there were only three people in the house, on another occasion there might be ten.  This might be ideal but it is impracticable from the point of view of enumerating a few million people.</P>
    <P>According to the judgment of the High Court this Dáil was in danger of being compelled to count not one voter in Dublin as equal to one voter in Cork or Donegal but that one baby in arms in Dublin should have the same weight, the same influence, in deciding the number of seats to be apportioned as between Dublin and Cork and Donegal.  If Deputy Cosgrave is really in earnest about the principle of equality of votes, one man's vote being as good as another's, he must support the Government in giving the Commission reasonable latitude in taking into account factors that are not apparent to those who are not familiar with or have not made a study of the difficulties of applying that principle.</P>
    <P>If this country is becoming more urban, like many other countries, it <Col N="653" /> would be foolish to try to keep up artificially the value of a vote in the rural community.  If the people want to live in cities their voting rights should follow them to the cities.  But there should not be given to those in the cities a vote of greater value simply because they are living in an area in which there are thousands of people in hospitals, hotels, nursing homes, institutions of all kinds who are temporarily resident there.  This is one of the reasons why we are suggesting that the Dáil should give itself the power ultimately to decide to have a little elasticity, to have a tolerance, in regard to the number of people required for the delimitation of a seat being fewer in a rural area which has no such hoard of temporary residents as this city and county of Dublin would have on the night the census was being taken.  It is only fair. It would give the Commission the right to report to the Dáil that in certain cases there should be a difference in the number of voters or the persons required for a seat.</P>
    <P>I do not know why Fine Gael are so afraid of losing proportional representation as they appear to be.  When Fine Gael were known as Cumann na nGaedheal they realised the dangers of proportional representation.  I think they showed themselves to be good prophets in one of the advertisements they issued in 1927, in which they stated:</P>
    <P>1.  A Coalition Government means barganing for place and power between irresponsible minority groups.</P>
    <P>2.  A weak Government with no stated policy.</P>
    <P>3.  Frequent changes of Government.</P>
    <P>4.  Consequent depression in trade and industry.</P>
    <P>5.  No progress but stability, security, credit in constant danger.</P>
    <P>A weak Government with no stated policy.  The coalition that came to power in 1948 put no stated policy before the people.  The only very definite policy put forward by the Labour <Col N="654" /> Party in 1948 was that they would never join a coalition.  The only policy about which the Clann na Poblachta Party and the Clann na Talmhan Party were definite was that they would not join a coalition.  Yet when the Parties came together after the election, they formed a coalition.  Again in 1951, the Parties who had formed the coalition with Fine Gael in 1948 went around the country protesting that never again would they have anything to do with a coalition.  I remember members of the Labour Party in this House denouncing the idea of a coalition and saying how they had been let down by their coalition partners.</P>
    <P>In 1948, Mr. Heron, the organiser for Labour, said that &ldquo;Fianna Fáil would not get an overall majority and in this eventuality the Labour Party would not go into a Coalition&rdquo;.  The National Labour Party, one of the two parts into which the Labour Party was divided at that time, said that &ldquo;they had not sought to make any pre-election pacts with any other political Party, and that they were not committed by open or secret agreement to a post-election plan for retaining or securing power&rdquo;.  When they got elected on this basis they came into this House and they did coalesce, and they took part in the Government.</P>
    <P>In the same year, 1948, the Secretary of the National Labour Party said that &ldquo;if they could not accept each other's policies before an election how could they enter into a blind bargain to act together afterwards, and that the Labour Party would remain independent after the election&rdquo;.  That is not how it turned out.  They tied themselves into a Coalition although they told the people they would not and got elected on the policy of not joining a Coalition.</P>
    <P>Mr. Blowick of Clann na Talmhan in 1947, before the elections, said they had &ldquo;no mandate from the electorate to throw their lot in with Fine Gael and one of the main planks in their platform was that they would not follow the lead of other Farmers' Parties and that they would maintain a strict independence&rdquo;.  Dr. McCartan of Clann na Poblachta said that &ldquo;so far as Coalition Government was concerned <Col N="655" /> the question did not arise for Clann na Poblachta&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I see no objection to a Coalition formed by Parties that have agreed before the elections that they will coalesce, and announced that to the electors, and given the electors a chance to vote for a Coalition with stated policies against a single Party like Fianna Fáil pledged not to coalesce, but it is completely undemocratic, and it is a deception of the voters, for a number of small groups to approach the people on very widely divergent policies, as they did in 1948, one for the immediate declaration of the name of the Republic, the description of the State, and the other completely against it, and then coalesce.  Before the elections in 1948 the Fine Gael Party had nailed their flag to the Commonwealth mast and Clann na Poblachta were pledged to tear it down, yet those two completely divergent parties came together, after getting votes on the basis of their stated policies, and formed a Government.  Certainly the two policies stated and put before the people were incompatible, and what happened afterwards was a matter of chance, a matter of intrigue.  As Deputy Larkin put it, all matters of policy were matters of intrigue during the Coalition period.</P>
    <P>Those small Parties, or individuals in the small Parties, could sometimes threaten to break the bargain.  The only firm bargain made by the Coalition groups that formed the Government was that under no circumstances would they break up before three years.  I remember there was a rebel in the Labour Party who threatened to break it&mdash;Deputy Dunne in late 1949 or early 1950.  We in Fianna Fáil had promised that the local authorities would get a few millions a year out of the Road Fund for the development of the roads.  Fine Gael went back on the word that had been given by the previous Fianna Fáil Government. They cut it down and Deputy Dunne revolted.  To read his speeches on the occasion would be quite interesting.</P>
    <P>What happened was very interesting indeed.  Deputy Dunne's threat caused <Col N="656" /> a lot of flutter in the dovecotes.  Members of the Fine Gael Party were put up here to speak and see how they could manage the situation caused by Deputy Dunne and a couple of others of his Party or perhaps a couple of Independants.  The three years bargain could not be kept.  The Government were going to collapse and, in the middle of all the fuss, Deputy Dillon came into the Dáil and with a flourish of trumpets, announced that he was going to spend £40 million on draining land, and that Deputy Dunne need not worry about men not being employed on the roads as promised by Fianna Fáil, that they would all be employed in draining the four million acres of land that needed to be drained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that we have no objection to a Coalition Government if it has got a proper mandate from the people, if the Parties comprising it have warned the people that they are going to coalesce in the struggle as between Fianna Fáil and a number of small groups, that they want to coalesce in order to prevent a Fianna Fáil Government coming into operation if they get a combined majority over Fianna Fáil, but we have every objection from a democratic point of view to the Parties going around as I have described denouncing the idea of coalition, swearing by bell, book and candle that never again would they join together to form a coalition and giving as proof of their intention their denunciation of the duplicity, the intrigue, and the treachery that occurred between the Parties in the first Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not democracy; that is the worst form of skulduggery.  If Fine Gael or the Labour Party are inclined to this sort of work it is proof that neither are fit to be a Government on their own and no system of election would get them elected in sufficient numbers to form a Government.  The simple fact is that the people do not trust either of the Parties that were the principal elements in the previous <Col N="657" /> two Coalitions.  If they want to become a Government in their own right under this Bill we are giving them the chance to evolve a policy, to get some spirit and conviction into them and through the necessity of getting a majority of the people to vote for them, going out and working to get a better policy implemented and accepted by the people.  But the Irish people are a little too wise to take on trust another Coalition and they can see&mdash;a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse&mdash; that one Fine Gael speech after another praising past Coalitions and denouncing Fianna Fáil for their alleged Opposition to all Coalitions is a clear enough indication to the ordinary Irish voter of what Fine Gael are up to.  They do not trust Labour that they would not coalesce with Fine Gael if they got the chance as they did on two previous occasions after having sworn that they would not.  We are giving these Parties a chance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if they have the will and the spirit to take advantage of it and let the best horse jump the ditch. It is not for Fianna Fáil to determine what Opposition will take over Government under a straight vote system or any other system but what we want to ensure is that whatever Government there is, whatever colour it has in its buttonhole, it will have got the clear approval of the people for its policy and that it can be held responsible as a Government for its action or inaction.  We do not want the situation created that existed between 1948 and 1951 and between 1954 and 1957 that of the three Parties in office nobody could hold any single group in the Coalition responsible for the mess they left behind on these two occasions.  One was blaming the other.  The Labour members were going around saying that only for Fine Gael they would have done this, that or the other while Fine Gael were going around excusing themselves for what they had done saying that they had to do it in order to please Labour or Clann na Poblachta or Clann na Talmhan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No wonder the first Coalition left a <Col N="658" /> big deficit.  No wonder they left, in 1954, a legacy of 100,000 on the unemployed register, of 63,000 having emigrated a year before, of 25,000 thrown out of regular industrial employment in factories that had been promoted by Fianna Fáil, of 600 corporation houses idle in the city of Dublin and nobody able to pay rent for them.  This is the situation that we are trying, as far as we can, to prevent in the future.  We are trying to ensure that when a Party go to the people, they will say what they are going to do, and if they are going to coalesce, with what Party they are prepared to coalesce and the policies which they will have and not get into this mess. It is not good for Fine Gael, it is not good for Labour, it is disastrous for Ireland that small Parties should be able to intrigue in this way behind the backs of the people, after having put a policy before them which they completely reversed when they got an opportunity of forming a Coalition.</P>
    <P>While Fine Gael and Labour have this sort of intriguing way of trying to get into Government, no system of election that anyone could suggest would inspire them to go out and do something better, do something that each of them could be proud of in their own way, put a clear-cut policy that would attract voters and attract men to spend sufficient money and energy and brains and study into putting it into effect.  These Parties need not blame the system of election.  They need not think that PR is going to help them to get into office, either of them on their own merits, to carry out their own policy which they believe in and which they have asked the people to support. They will have to make up their minds, each of them, to have a policy and if they want to form a Coalition, out with them before the people and say ahead of time that they are going to form it.</P>
    <P>They have had all the opportunity in the world under the proportional system over the past 36 years of ousting Fianna Fáil on at least ten or 11 of the 12 occasions on which there were elections.  However, we won ten out of the 12 elections simply because the Opposition Parties depended on intrigue <Col N="659" /> to get into Government rather than on the value of a policy they wished to put forward.</P>
    <P>They say that we are going to get 95 seats if the straight vote system comes into operation.  Some druids made that calculation on the basis of results of by-elections.</P>

      <P>Ninety-five seats.  That is a very good percentage.  Under the proportional system, if it prevented a Party becoming a Government unless it had a good majority, why did Fine Gael and Labour, or either of them, not prevent us becoming a Government with very much less than 50 per cent of the votes in each of the general elections I have alluded to?  In 1932 we only got 44 per cent of the valid poll.  In 1933 we got 49 per cent.  In 1937 we got 45 per cent.  In 1938 we got the biggest percentage&mdash;we got 51.8 per cent.  In 1943 we only got 41.8 per cent but we got the required majority.  In 1944 we got 49 per cent again.  In 1948 we got 41 per cent and the Coalition got in.  In 1951 we got 46 per cent and we were elected.  In 1957 we got 48 per cent.  In 1961 we got 43.6 per cent and still we were returned as a Government and again in 1965 we got 47.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the last referendum, both Fine Gael and Labour ranted round the country that the reason we were looking for the straight vote was that we feared that by a continuation of PR, we would be defeated and disappear.  Since that, we have been in office continuously for <Col N="660" /> ten years after they said we wanted to change from PR in order to escape annihilation and to get a vast majority under the straight vote.  We have remained in office.  What Party that is anything like as clever as Fine Gael and Labour say we are could expect to remain in office for more than, say, 30 out of 36 years.  We know that during the same time there was stability of Government under Fianna Fáil&mdash;stagnation was the word Deputy Cosgrave used.  It was stagnation.  And we would have been a much better Government, good and all as we were, if we had been under a greater threat by a better informed, better behaved and harder working opposition.  We cannot get the people to vote for Fine Gael or for Labour.  They have to do that themselves and since 1932 neither of them have come within a beagle's howl of getting the majority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that they would want on their own.  It does not look from their actions as if they will ever have the courage to put down a policy and put sufficient hard work and thought into it to get a majority under proportional representation.  But during the time that Fianna Fáil sustained only two changes of Government, there were many changes of Government in our neighbouring country.  The British Labour Party, that was pretty low down, came up under the straight vote system and the Liberal Party, that was very high, went down.  If we have the straight vote system and the Labour Party or Fine Gael Party have a policy that they think is right for the country, and has a better appeal to the average voters, there is nothing to stop either of them getting into power either now or at some time in the future.  They will have some pride in their achievements and their activity and it will enable them to do better work for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Party could have any pride, no small member of a Coalition could have any pride in their work, when the chief and only thing they agree on is that they will not break up, no matter <Col N="661" /> what comes or goes, for three years. That is stagnation and Deputy Cosgrave properly described it as such. That was in fact a result of the proportional representation system.</P>
    <P>The Parties opposite are not really in favour of proportional representation.  If they want it&mdash;with all their chat about tiny minorities&mdash;and they wanted to get them elected, why not have one constituency with 144 seats and then any one who has 144th of the votes gets a seat?  But they are not prepared to go that far.  They want to pretend, and they want to create an atmosphere for the next general election that under the straight vote system Fianna Fáil will sweep the decks, that there will be nothing left of either Fine Gael or Labour, that we will have it all.</P>
    <P>Why should we get all the seats under the straight vote system when it has not obtained elsewhere?  Why should we remain continuously in office for the next 20 or 30 years under a straight vote system?  It has not happened in other countries where the straight vote system operates.  This country under proportional representation has maintained Fianna Fáil in office for 30 out of 36 years and there is no other Government, either under proportional representation or under the straight vote system, which has obtained such a high percentage of years in office.  We did it because we were the best Party.  We had the best record behind us.  We offered the best and most sensible policy to the people and the people supported us under all sorts of threats and allegations.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the potential Coalition groups are starting off on the allegations of corruption again, as they did in 1948, when they murdered Bill Quirke with their lies, is that they have no policy and simply want to throw mud, right, left and centre.  Let me say this to Fine Gael and Labour. I will give them a tip for nothing.</P>

      <P>If they want to become a Coalition and to win, they have a very simple method of procedure. <Col N="662" /> They can have an inter-Party conference and they can allot the seats between them.  Let us take Louth, where there will, say, be only one Labour candidate for one of the three seats and two Fine Gael candidates for the other two seats.  They will get their supporters to vote for either the Labour candidate they want in Coalition or for the Fine Gael candidate they want in Coalition.  In Louth, Fianna Fáil have never reached anything like a majority in the constituency.  We always thought we were doing very well indeed when we got 45 per cent.  Fine Gael and Labour combined could have 55 per cent. When the seats are decided, they can agree on them and they should in each of the seats, if they combine their votes, pick up 55 per cent to 45 per cent for us.</P>
      <P>That is the mathematics of it but the mathematics of this gentleman who said we were going to get 95 seats are based on the results of the local elections.  It does not make political sense because the two Coalition Parties will have to declare themselves ahead of time.  They would have to avoid contesting the single seat against each other.  If they were in earnest about forming a Coalition, if they were not ashamed about it, if they had a policy all over the country instead of Fianna Fáil getting 95 seats out of 144, if they made proper arrangements they would get between them more than 100 seats.  I give them that tip for nothing because I know they will not take it.</P>
      <P>They have not got the will, either of them, to go for a majority Party, because they are afraid of it.  When they get into Government, they want somebody to lay the blame on.  They are not prepared to stand up as an individual Party and say: &ldquo;We had to do this.  If anybody blames us, those are the reasons we did it and if you are not satisfied, you can vote against us in the next general election&rdquo;.  Fine Gael and Labour have got into such a state of dithers that they only want to form a Government when it is a Coalition and each side can blame the other for the mistakes or lack of success of the Coalition, as they did during the previous two Coalitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> Now, about the funniest argument we have heard about the referendum is that Fianna Fáil want to adopt the straight vote because the British system of elections is the straight vote.  I happen to be old enough to remember when the British imposed the proportional system on us.  In 1918 in the &ldquo;Hang the Kaiser&rdquo; election Lloyd George swept Britain, but Sinn Féil swept Ireland under the straight vote system, and they put on their thinking cap to see how they were going to break up or destroy the national unity, putting us at sixes and sevens so that we could not unite to throw them out. They remembered the report of the Commission of 1911 which was set up to go into the desirability of applying what was then a very newfangled notion adopted on the Continent, proportional representation.  In 1911 the British Commission reported against it. It is a document well worth reading by those who are interested in the effects of proportional representation and the advantages of the straight vote system for uniting a people and giving them a government prepared to stand up and take responsibility for their every act and their every neglect.</P>
    <P>That Commission foretold what would happen in Europe within the next generation or two, and what did in fact happen in Germany and in Italy.  France was unable to pull herself together to defend herself.  In 1918 the British Government had turned down the idea of proportional representation but they decided to apply it to Ireland, not for our good but in the interests of Britain, in the interests of disrupting our people, of breaking us into small groups, fighting each other like Kilkenny cats, not able to support each other in our policy or putting our backs into supporting it.</P>
    <P>That is the system of election we want to get rid of, the proportional system of election that was imposed on us by the British Government in order to prevent our people uniting to fight for their independence.  In my belief, the people will support us on this <Col N="664" /> occasion because they have more experience than they had in 1959. They can see that if there is any Party in this country the narrow selfish interests of which are best served by the proportional representation system it is the Fianna Fáil Party.  All the Fianna Fáil Party will have to do for the next 100 years, or 200 years, is to remain firm against having a coalition, and if the Party fell down on the basis of proportional representation as we have it and failed to get a sufficient number of Deputies elected to nominate and elect their Taoiseach and the Government all they have to do is to stand aside, as we did in 1948 and 1951, and let the Coalition government form, let it break up as break up it would, and then the Party would have for the next ten or 15 years, or whatever we have, a long reign.  While that would be in the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party, again I want to say it would be disastrous for the country.</P>
    <P>We have great problems to solve like every other country in the world and the clearer we are with the people, the more clearly they know where each Party stands on particular issues, the better political education it will be for our people and the better political discipline it will be for the various Parties.</P>
    <P>If we are to go forward from success to success, that is the sort of people we want to have and those are the sort of politicians we want to see in the Dáil, people who are educated politically, economically and in all other ways, Deputies who have disciplined themselves to take either defeat or success when they have a policy they believe in and which they are prepared to promote.</P>
    <P>I do not have to go into the results of what happened in other countries under a proportional representation system, where no Party was prepared to stand aside outside a coalition and all wanted to have a finger in the pie. If Fianna Fáil had wished to form a coalition in 1948 or 1951 in order to keep the Labour, Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta coalition out of office, it would have been easy for us to do so.  But if we had done it we, in our turn, would have broken up into a couple of Parties and <Col N="665" /> by now there would be no major Party and instead of two reasonably strong Parties, there would have been seven, eight, nine or ten groups perhaps all of near equal size and all busily engaged for the most of their period of Parliamentary session in trying to sustain a coalition in office or in trying to break it down.</P>
    <P>We as a small country that got a very bad start in the race of economic development could not afford to take three or four months not knowing what sort of coalition would be formed.  They can do that in certain countries in Europe.  They have to do it because they are broken up into a number of Parties.  The French had to do that for many years, and could not even unite for their defence.  They had several changes of governments.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to do it as a small country.  As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, we will give the people a chance of preventing that happening in Ireland again.  We hope the electorate throughout the country will realise that it would be a very simple matter for Fianna Fáil to carry on being in Government during 30 out of the next 36 years just as we accomplished during the past 36 years when we were 30 years in power.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Fine Gael and Labour, for the sake of whatever they believe in, to throw aside this dithering they are going on with&mdash;each saying now that they want to form a Government on their own, knowing very well that they will, if they get the chance, form another Coalition as in 1948 and 1954.  That is not good for this country and even though the alternative to the system we are operating, which the British imposed on us, is the system the British now have, I am all in favour of our people adopting, implementing and making constitutional the electoral system the British now operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a debate which most intelligent people expected the House would have to face twice in nine years.  Nine years ago the then Government Party&mdash;the same Party in power today&mdash;went to the <Col N="666" /> country and were beaten decisively on the question of PR.  Now we are being asked to do exactly the same thing in spite of the fact that many of the Party concerned&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; have expressed in private the view that they do not wish for any alteration of the system.  A number of their leaders also have spoken in favour of PR from time to time.</P>
      <P>We the members of the Opposition Parties are trying to point out to the country, to set before the country, the arguments in favour of PR.  They are many, in spite of what the Minister for External Affairs has said about this strange system.  I do not agree with the arguments I heard him put forward during the past few minutes.  One would think that it is in spite of PR the country has succeeded in getting where it has got, and that the system is entirely British.  Of the two, the straight vote is the more British system, PR, in so far as it has any geographical location, being a European system, one of the most civilised methods of voting known to mankind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall start off by trying to trace some of the benefits we have derived from this system in Ireland.  Incidentally, the system was not imposed on this country, as the Minister for External Affairs said.  It was intended primarily not in any way to disunite the Irish forces which had succeeded in their fight for freedom but to give the minorities, in this part of the country especially, a voice in running the Government.  As Deputy P. O'Donnell has said&mdash;he was the first I heard referring to it&mdash;the first Government fell over backwards in endeavouring to be just to the minorities here.  I speak as one who comes from a family which belongs to the political minority and to one of the religious minorities.  I should like to add that not only did the Cumann na nGaedheal Government fall over backwards in being fair to the minorities but the Fianna Fáil Government fall over backwards in being fair to minorities, and I will not use the argument, because it would be quite wrong to do so, that PR is in any way necessary to protect the minorities of this country.  I shall not allow anybody to say that, and nobody has said <Col N="667" /> it, but I am surprised that this Government, who pay such attention to minorities, have not realised that aspect.  No minority needs a PR system but PR does enable a minority, a very tiny minority, maybe, to voice its opinion, if it so wishes.</P>

      <P>I tried to make it clear but the Minister did not gather the trend of my remarks which were clear to everybody else in the House.  The records of the House will show that what I was trying to say was that it makes it easier for any minorities to form political Parties under PR.  I went on to say that both the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, the original one, and Fianna Fáil Governments have been so fair to religious minorities that there is no necessity for those minorities to be protected in any way by this.  Therefore, <Col N="668" /> that is outside the argument.  But there are many other types of minorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Fianna Fáil Party are not out to protect political minorities.  Mind you, I remember the time when a whole lot of Independents were in this House, and, one by one, they have disappeared.  Whether or not they disappeared under the wing of Fianna Fáil, which Deputy Dillon so eloquently and so accurately described, they have departed from this House, at any rate, by the actions of that Party, mainly.  We have very few Independent Deputies in this House now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would not know where to begin to describe the strange business that surrounds proportional representation. One would think, according to the speakers on the Government side of the House, that proportional representation <Col N="670" /> was an evil, something that had been foisted on us, a British system.  In fact, as I was starting to say, it is one of the most civilised methods of voting that the mind of man can design.  Authorities have said that there is no system that, if you want to get rid of it, you cannot find defects in&mdash; and there are slight defects in proportional representation.</P>

      <P>Consider the number of three-member constituencies we have in this country.  Three-member constituencies are not typical of proportional representation.  In fact, they tend to defeat the aims of proportional representation.  Another point along the same lines is that the constituencies should be divided up into five, seven, eight, nine, 11 or even 13 large numbers.  You then get proportional representation working in its purest form.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving (a) the national average retail prices of certain items of food at mid-February, 1957 and mid-February, 1968 (the dates nearest those specified for which particulars are available) and (b) the percentage change over the period in the prices of all the items entering into the Consumer Price Index numbers.  In the case of items, other than certain food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful. The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive inquiries.  Price quotations in respect of some items of food are not available from all centres at each inquiry and the figures for the percentage changes in these prices, computed in such a way as to eliminate the effect of differences in coverage, may differ slightly from the percentage calculated from the actual changes.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">(a) National Average Retail Prices of Food items at mid-February, 1957 and mid-February, 1968.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he is aware of the structural weaknesses recently manifested in oiltankers of 100,000 tons deadweight and upwards which require their reconstruction; and whether he will require certificates from owners of such tankers that appropriate precautions have been taken to ensure structural stability if navigation within Irish territorial waters is contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that structural weaknesses have been reported in some very large tankers.  I understand these weaknesses were revealed either at the trial stages or during the very early stages of commercial operation in heavy weather.  No casualties have been attributed to these causes and the vessels concerned have been modified.  I understand that in the light of these experiences the classification societies are raising the relevant standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standards of structural strength of cargo ships, including tankers, are governed by the International Load Line Convention, 1930, which has been adopted by Ireland and practically every other maritime country.  All cargo ships, Irish or foreign, using Irish ports must conform to the prescribed <Col N="680" /> international standards of structural strength and must carry an International Certificate to that effect. Any ship which is unable to produce such a certificate would be refused clearance from any port in any Convention country.  The 1930 Convention has been modified and extended, in particular, to cover vessels of the larger sizes now being built, by the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, which is due to come into operation next July for ratifying countries.  I propose to introduce legislation within the next few months to enable this country to implement this Convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the facts provided recently in the London <i>Times</i> relating to this matter?  Secondly, has his attention been drawn to the catastrophe off Puerto Rico recently reminiscent of the disaster which overtook the oiltanker off the south-west coast of England last year and the emergency procedures that have had to be instituted by the United States Government to avoid virtual destruction of the Puerto Rican tourist traffic? Thirdly, is the Minister aware that his reference to the Convention on Load Lines has nothing whatever to do with the problem which I seek to draw to his attention, that is, the danger of tankers of 200,000 and 300,000 tons deadweight breaking up in our territorial waters, with catastrophic consequences not only for the fish life but for the tourist amenities of the whole south-west of Ireland if such ships are habitually to use Bantry Bay?</P>

Secondly, I can inform the Deputy that the representatives of the Gulf Oil Corporation have informed us that their tankers are being built according to the very strict specifications of the Lloyds Classification Society and that they are also insisting that the tankers which take the off-load from the tanks in Whiddy Island will also conform to the highest level of classification standards.  I do not think the Deputy need have any fear in regard to that. Thirdly, the Puerto Rican vessel broke <Col N="681" /> in half through striking a reef and not necessarily because of any inherent defect in its structure.  The channel through which the boat passes is an extremely dangerous one in certain types of weather.  The tanker broke through striking a reef.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke, for the purpose of reassuring the House, of his intention to introduce legislation consequent upon the Convention to cover load lines.  Would he consider representing on behalf of the Irish Government that that Convention should not confine itself to load lines but also should provide for minimal structural specifications for these vast new tankers in respect of which we have no practical experience but, as the Minister says, in respect of which experimental experience has revealed the grave danger of structural collapse owing to their vast size and and the vast vacant space within the hull?</P>

      <P>I understand that although the name of the Convention is the Convention on Load Lines, when the Classification Societies examine the design of a ship before it is built and determine upon the load line, they determine also the structure of the ship and the strength of the ship in order that the ship may be able to operate with safety to a particular load line. So that it does cover structural strength in addition to the mere declaration of what the load line of the vessel is.</P>

      <P>Before Questions, I was endeavouring to point out the strange kind of atmosphere that surrounds this whole matter of proportional <Col N="690" /> representation.  The system has repeatedly been blamed by the Government for defects, sometimes perhaps by way of misstatement but, even if there were some vestige of accuracy in these statements, the system is blamed for weaknesses or defects which arise not from the fact that we are dealing with proportional representation but from the fact that we are not dealing with proportional representation working in the way and manner in which it should work.  It is like blaming the single seat constituencies in Britain, if they were about five or six times their present size, and saying that they do not work because the Member has to look after too many constituents.  That is the type of argument used here by the Government for the purpose of denigrating proportional representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glancing at some figures here and I find that originally, away back in 1923, we had one nine-member constituency, three eight-member constituencies and a whole host of five- and seven-member constituencies.  When I first came into public life in 1943, the constituency I represented then&mdash;I still represent it today; it is Dublin South City Central&mdash;was a seven-member constituency.  It was later reduced to five and the reason given for the reduction was that the population had declined and Kilmainham and Inchicore were taken away.  The reduction was not made on the basis of tolerance really or anything like that.  It was made because it was expedient from the point of view of the Fianna Fáil Party to have Kilmainham and Inchicore in neighbouring constituencies. That situation lasted for a number of years.  Then the constituency suffered a drop in population as a result of the very proper rehousing of so many people by Dublin Corporation.  The central city constituencies suffered quite big drops in population.  The result is that Dublin South City Central now includes once again both Kilmainham and Inchicore, to the great bewilderment, I might say, of the people in these areas who do not know exactly where they are.  The constituency, even with this increase, is not now a seven-member constituency. <Col N="691" />  It is still a five-member constituency.</P>
    <P>Proportional representation works at its best when one has a large number of Deputies sitting for one area.  It works in its truest and most natural form in five, seven and nine member constituencies.  The Government Party have introduced any number of three-member constituencies.  In the 1961 election, there were 17 three-seat constituencies.  There were only eight in 1923.  These three-seat constituencies defeat the real purpose of proportional representation because a very slight increase in the vote will, in certain circumstances, permit a minority to gain two out of the three seats, giving that minority representation altogether out of proportion to the number of votes cast.</P>
    <P>Mark you, that is exactly why blame is attached to proportional representation.  It is blamed for faults it does not possess.  It is blamed for faults which have, in fact, resulted from actions taken by the present Government.  I mention this because I read somewhere recently a mild criticism of the speeches made here; it was said we were talking too much from an academic point of view and not sufficiently from the point of view of the effects on our own constituencies.  It is a very difficult thing to assess the effects even in one's own constituency because one does not know how the constituency may be divided up, but one can, at least, get some pointer to the general manner in which constituencies will be dealt with by looking at some of the actions taken in the past.</P>
    <P>I remember that changes that took place in Dublin South City Central. The changes which took place were not due originally to a drop in population; they were a taking away from that constituency of parts of it and giving them to surrounding constituencies, doubtless to their benefit from a political point of view.</P>
    <P>I remember the days when Pembroke and Rathmines used to be called townships, and they are now Dublin South East.  It was felt that there was too strong a preponderance of votes for <Col N="692" /> the then Cumann na nGaedheal Party, and Ringsend and Irishtown were pushed into that area because they were then felt to be overwhelmingly Fianna Fáil.  As a result of that, another seat was gained in that area. This type of manipulation has gone, in the English language, under the name of gerrymandering.  We hear a good deal about gerrymandering in the North but we do not hear so much about the gerrymandering which took place here on our own doorstep.</P>
    <P>Another constituency change that took place was that out of County Dublin was carved Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown, and that was made a constituency.  That is not a bad thing&mdash; I am not saying that&mdash;but it certainly resulted in at least one extra seat for the Fianna Fáil Party.  Then County Dublin was split up.  Originally the county was a unit, and then it was split into north and south.  Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown was taken out of it, and certain areas of the south county and the north county went into the Walkinstown and Crumlin areas. They are so changed about that you would want to have a map in front of you to see exactly where the changes have taken place.  In many cases these changes did not take place for any valid change-of-population reason but for political reasons.  Nowadays, I do not think it is so easy to divide the constituencies on purely political bases.  Perhaps it could be done, but it would take a very skilful person to know exactly how the votes went into the ballot boxes in various suburban and city areas.</P>

      <P>One hears these stories, and this is not against the tenor of my speech.  The tenor of this <Col N="693" /> part of my speech is that the changes which will take place will be, as far as possible, to the advantage of the Government Party, and that is why we are dealing with this proposed amendment.</P>
      <P>The changes will not be due merely to population, although that will be the fundamental reason for the changes, but inside the framework of that the lines of the constituencies will be drawn in ways that will be to the advantage of the Fianna Fáil Party. That is why it is being done.</P>
      <P>The various universities here, TCD and, I think, National, have carried out surveys which show that the Fianna Fáil Party at the last election, with 47.7 per cent of the votes, secured 50 per cent of the seats.  In fact, and I daresay this has been pointed out by the other speakers, since the 1920s the Fianna Fáil Party have secured, with a minority of votes, a larger proportion of the seats than those votes warranted. However, not content with this consistent bonus they now want to obtain a share of the seats up to three-fifths greater than their share of the votes, that is, 60 per cent as against 40 per cent.  I personally am not afraid of the future from a Party point of view but I am afraid of the future from a longterm point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was speaking before Questions, I pointed out that our people had used this very civilised method of voting with great skill, and it is obvious that they understand it perfectly well; it is not just a case of luck. First of all, the percentage of spoiled votes is minimal.  Taken over the whole country, it is not even one per cent.  I would say this from my own personal experience of watching the counts and going through the spoiled votes, that the great majority of the spoiled vote papers, small as they are in number, that have to be dealt with are spoiled because the presiding officer did not stamp the paper correctly.  That is one of the commonest causes.  Maybe the stamp which was used had become worn and did not make its mark on the paper and perhaps some of the papers got into the box before the presiding officer realised that the stamp was not making a proper mark.  There will be <Col N="694" /> reasons like that, and a large proportion of spoiled votes are not necessarily spoiled by the action of the voter at all.  I would say that they are no higher than the spoiled votes under the straight vote system.  Our people understand thoroughly the system they are working, and it is not a valid argument to say that this is too complicated a system for either rural or urban populations.  That is just not a fact.</P>
    <P>One of the great advantages of this system is that it enables the voters to express shades of opinion.  It also enables Parliament to be a microcosm, a small copy, of the country in general reflecting in some smaller way the various shades of opinion in the country, with even perhaps a place for some crackpot person.  People have been elected to Parliament on what could be called crank views, but they seldom lasted very long.  There is no harm in an odd one slipping through. They are no more likely to slip through under PR than they are under any other system.  Certainly, with a system of PR, one gets a Parliament which expresses the various shades of opinion. It is not just a case of one side winning overwhelmingly and the other side being overwhelmingly defeated.  The legislative assembly resulting from it, like this horseshoe we have in the Chamber, represents gradations of change and not just a harsh line of one side always speaking for a motion and the other always against it.</P>
    <P>It is truly remarkable how we in Ireland over the past few years have overcome the difficulties and&mdash;I will use the terms&mdash;the dislikes and the hatreds resulting from a civil war. That has gone out of Irish public life like snow off a ditch and it has long disappeared out of this Chamber.  I believe we owe a great deal of that softening, a great deal of that reasoning, to the fact that we have operated this system of proportional representation, which has room for shades of opinion inside a Party as well as outside it.  I firmly believe it has helped to bring about this happy position in Ireland today where that unhappy period is now forgotten from a political point of view and is rapidly passing <Col N="695" /> into the realm of history as far as the participants are concerned&mdash; and there are plenty of people left who took part in that struggle.  Our system has helped us to close that chapter.</P>
    <P>Another advantage of proportional representation, which only comes out in the working of it, is that a voter may have a choice inside the Party of his choice.  If under the single member constituency system, Mr. X represents Fianna Fáil, take the case of a voter who for some reason or other does not like Mr. X.  If he does not vote for Mr. X, he is put on the horns of a dilemma.  He would like to see that Party successful&mdash;we will imagine he was so misguided&mdash;but he would have to balance up whether he liked his Party better or disliked Mr. X the more.  There have been many examples of that in England recently. I can think of the case&mdash;I will not mention any names&mdash;of one very prominent man who occupied a very high position in his Party, was a member of the Cabinet, I think, and lost his seat. There was an awful commotion about it.  One read that a number of his supporters had come to dislike him so much that they changed against their Party and either abstained from voting or voted for the member of another Party.  A voter is not faced with that harsh choice under proportional representation.  He can vote for another member of the Party of his choice. Therefore, again you can get gradations, such as I have referred to.  That is one of the reasons why these grades come in the Parties.</P>
    <P>Each of the three big Parties in this House has what you could call a right, a centre and a left.  That has come about through this choice&mdash;this deliberate choice, make no mistake&mdash;of the voter.  Therefore, you get a very subtle type of voting going on.  At the end of it, you have a Parliament as near as you can get to one which represents, faithfully and minutely, the people who sent the Deputies there.  That is one of the reasons why the proportional representation machine is a great steadier in a country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs <Col N="696" /> talked about the weakness of France before 1939.  In my opinion, the weakness of France did not come from her electoral system.  The Minister said that France did not arm herself&mdash;of course, she did not arm herself properly&mdash;and he said that was due to proportional representation.  That is nonsense.  It was due to the fall of successive French Governments.  It is now a matter of history and has nothing to do with the France of today.  It was due to the parliamentary system by which the fall of a ministry was not followed by a general election, and so a number of people in that Parliament had a great deal of power without the responsibility of facing the electorate every time they had a reshuffle and formed a new Government.</P>
    <P>It is easy and simple to stand up and say that France's weakness was caused by PR but, in fact, there is no word of truth in it.  England was just as weak&mdash; weaker in fact.  She was less well prepared than France and, being an island she could afford that luxury.  It had nothing to do with her electoral system. There was a most powerful government, an overwhelming Government, in power in Britain during the 1930s.  The Party which would have been the traditional party of rearmament even with a huge majority in the House of Commons were not strong enough in their minds to carry it out.  They had a very small Opposition against them.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another point in this argument for the type of electoral system we have giving us the Government we get at the end of it.  Very often good government is, in fact, vigilant Opposition&mdash;not always, but very often.  Certainly if a country gets an overwhelmingly powerful Party, that Party will sow the seeds of its own decay within itself unless it is watched by a very vigilant Opposition.  I should like people who read the Dáil Reports, and so on, to realise that if you have an Opposition too small in numbers, they will not be able to fulfil the duties of an Opposition. They will simply be swamped with work, especially if you have three Parties as we have in this country, and I think it is a good thing.</P>
    <P>If you have too many people on <Col N="697" /> the Government side and not enough over here, whether the Opposition be Labour or Fine Gael or farmers, or anything you like, you will not have sufficient people to man your Opposition front benches, or they will be so overworked that they will not be able to do it, and they will not be able to maintain the background organisation which an Opposition find it necessary to have, so that people who are speaking on various subjects are well supplied with data concerning their speeches.  Very few people can or will stand up to speak on a subject without having some information, and without having certain people to dig out certain facts for them.</P>
    <P>All those things come into the picture of strong government.  Strong government is all right.  It may be good and it may equally be bad.  Strong government in itself does not mean a thing.  It may mean strong Opposition. Certainly strong government is dangerous.  It is dangerous because there is always the fear that a Party strong in numbers will often be highly sensitive to any form of opposition, just as an elephant which is a very strong animal can be driven mad with fear by a mouse.  Strong governments have been known to attack ideas and people as fiercely as an elephant would attack a mouse if it got into the house with it.</P>
    <P>So the arguments that we must have strong government are not at all as valid as they appear to be.  They may do all right for crossroads speeches, but they should not be exhibited here as if the be-all and the end-all of parliamentary life were strong government.  In fact, the strength of a Government is their sensitivity to public opinion, and their selectiveness of such opinion, rumours and so on.  That is where a Government really show their skill.  Obviously a Government must not yield to every form of agitation. They must be strong enough to stand up to that.  A Government must also be pliant enough to take up ideas themselves and make beneficial legislation out of them.  A Government cannot always be at the beck and call of the public, nor can they be too adamant against the voice of the people.  There must be a balance between <Col N="698" /> the just claims and the unjust ones which are made on every Government.</P>
    <P>That brings me back again to the shades of opinion which are possible under PR, and which are not possible under the so-called straight vote system, which, in fact, is not a straight vote at all.  Government really means doing what is necessary and what ought to be done for the people.  There are other things, too, but that is a great deal of the duty of a Government, and when the Government are composed of people who form themselves under one of the big Parties, then you can get that, but you do not get it so much where you have one man in a seat.  He is there in the seat and he is the sole interpreter to his own Party of his constituency.  No one else can say: &ldquo;Oh, but Deputy So-and-so, you know, is talking nonsense about the south city.&rdquo; No one else would know unless he was a Member, so you get this sensitivity and a great deal of subtlety in this method of PR. We can be very proud of the Irish people who have handled this system, which its enemies say is so complicated, as skilfully as a horse-trainer handles a young horse he is breaking in.  That is to our good.  For a people like us who can feel very passionately, and rightly so, on many subjects, it is very good to have a leavener under PR to ensure that no overnight change can be brought about.  So much for the need for a strong Government.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the Governments we have had in the past. We began in 1923 with the Cumann na nGaedheal Government who had only 39 per cent of the total votes cast in the 1923 election.  There were two elections in 1927 and in the June general election, they got 27 per cent. In 1932, Fianna Fáil came in with 44 per cent.  In 1933, they had 49.9 per cent; in 1937, they had 45 per cent; in 1938, they had a slight majority with 52 per cent; in 1943, Fianna Fáil had 41.9 per cent; in 1944, 48.9 per cent; in 1948, 41.9 per cent; in 1951, 46.3; in 1954, 43.4; in 1957, 48.3; in 1961, 43.8 and in the last general election, 47.7 per cent.  You see that only once, in 1938, did Fianna Fáil have 52 per <Col N="699" /> cent of the total votes cast.  Neither they nor any other Party ever got that percentage of votes before or since in our history, and yet the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, in power from 1923 to 1932, governed strongly.  From 1932, except for the six years of inter-Party Government from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957, I do not suppose Fianna Fáil in their first 15 years of office and in their final 11 years would like to describe themselves as having been a weak Government.</P>
    <P>They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot blame the PR system and say it makes for weak Government and at the same time, take pride in the fact that they have been in office for 30 out of the past 36 years without accusing themselves of being a weak Government.  In other words, PR does not make a weak Government.  It can make a strong Government or a weak one. The people who make strong and weak Governments are those who sit in the Government Benches and in the Opposition; the system does not make them. It is the actions of the Government in power and the action of Deputies opposite whether Labour, Fine Gael or Independents that make a Government strong or weak, that strange interaction, listening to arguments put forward, hints and various things coming across the floor of the House, sometimes coming in the form of questions, sometimes in the form of debate, even the people who sometimes very wrongly and wickedly try to bend Standing Orders to their own benefit and perhaps fall foul of the Ceann Comhairle in doing so, show a Government which is alert to public opinion, that there must be more in this matter than meets the eye if the particular Deputy risks being hurled out of the House because of it and that perhaps it is something to which more attention should be paid.  It may indicate that there are points of view that should be heard and studied to see if they are worth turning into legislation.</P>
    <P>That procedure comes more easily with the system of proportional representation. I and other people believe that, quite apart from the effect that this may have&mdash;I do not believe it will <Col N="700" /> happen&mdash;on the possible abolition of PR, we are moulding the PR system to ourselves and, in its strange way, it is moulding us.  We are different in outlook from people elected in one-member constituencies who, as I said earlier, tend to see things in black and white while we tend to see them in gradations, shades.  Most of us here are adult enough to know that things are rarely black and white but mostly grey in colour.  That is not cynical&mdash;far from it.  It is simply the truth.</P>
    <P>There are always factors which modify and factors which change and we also know, as the ancients said, &ldquo;Truth lives at the bottom of a well&rdquo;. It is very difficult to get at the truth. Mind you, we have a lot to be proud of in the Government we have had here since the formation of the State. It is a Government&mdash;I am not talking now of the Government Party; I am talking of all Governments here&mdash;that is humane.  We have not got any savage penal code.  Nobody wants that.  We have abolished the death sentence.  I am not sure whether we have actually taken it out or whether we just do not do it any longer, but at any rate we do not do it any longer.  Our legislation shows that the Government are very humane in their approach to things. We have an army and we have the police force and we have discipline and so on, but we do not get cases of very severe discipline coming before us as Deputies.  That type of thing does not happen very much in Ireland.  We have not got any forms of repressive legislation.  The women have had votes for a very long time here&mdash;before the State was founded, I think.  We do try to treat widows, orphans and such people as humanely and as well as we can.  I am not trying to say that everything is perfect&mdash;far from it&mdash;but all that sort of thing is listened to sympathetically here and a great deal of that comes from this system.  We are hardly aware of the effect the system has on our attitude to a whole lot of things.</P>
    <P>You will remember the outery there was about the export of horses from this country.  People felt very deeply about that, people from all walks of life, people who never handled a horse <Col N="701" /> in their lives or never sat on a horse's back&mdash;in other words, not just people who were interested in horses as hunters or anything like that but just human beings who hated to see cruelty to animals.  Eventually this country, I am glad to say, brought in legislation preventing that.  It hit the pockets of some of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that owing to this method of election, people are elected, or even nearly elected, who are in constant touch with groups of citizens outside who are putting forward views which can be easily raised in this House owing to the multiplicity of interests and of contacts that all Deputies have owing to proportional representation. However, I shall drop that particular argument.  I think I have made the point I was trying to make in favour of PR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We move now to the second question, the question of tolerance.  Of course this is a mathematical expression and once you get into the realms of mathematics, it is not easy to explain in words things that are in figures.  It is not always possible to translate figures into words, because if we could do that, we would not need figures.  Briefly, the proposal is to build into the Constitution a tolerance of one-sixth.  Twenty thousand is the number of population deemed necessary to make up a seat for one Deputy, but owing to unnatural boundaries and some natural boundaries and shifts of population, it is not always possible in a compact area to get 20,000 people.  You may get over 20,000 or under 20,000.  This proposed change says that it will take 23,000 people-odd in one constituency to elect a Deputy and in another constituency it will be less, about 16,667.  Therefore as between a minimum constituency of 16,667 and a maximum of 23,600, you get something like 6,600.  You can have that enormous swing and that is a difference, or as it is called, a tolerance, of as high as 40 per cent. <Col N="702" /> Therefore it has been mooted that owing to the drop in population in the West, it would take in the West 16,000 people to elect a Deputy and maybe in the city of Dublin it would take 23,000 people to elect a Deputy.  You would get your swing of 6,600.  Therefore, you would give one man one and a half votes as against another man, probably a Dubliner, who would only get one vote, because that is where it would be necessary to do that from the population point of view.  You would have this enormous swing and you would have more Deputies elected from certain areas than you would have from others.  Apart from population or anything like that, you could have, say in the West, more Deputies outvoting Deputies from other parts of the country.  At any rate, you would be getting away from the strict rule and the fair rule of one man one vote.</P>
    <P>Nobody has more than one vote and if a person attempts to do anything along those lines, the State, if it catches him, will fine such a person or put that person in prison for voting more than once.  Yet, according to the law under this Bill, it is proposed to give some men almost one and a half votes.  That is very unfair to the rest of the country.  It is very unfair to the areas where there is a higher percentage of the population.  The national average would work out the same but certain areas like Dublin would get a smaller percentage of the national average of Deputies.  If you think of a Deputy being a sort of a prize, although God help us some of us Deputies would make very poor prizes, certain areas would get more Deputies per head of the population than other areas.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out the overall injustice of this new system in the thickly populated parts, such as Dublin, as I said earlier, but now we come to the real grass root of this.  Would it not be very nice if it took only 16,000 people to vote for the Government Party to elect a Deputy but that it took 23,333 in an area where the Government were not likely to win a seat and knowing the skill of some of our political opponents I do not think we can be accused of having suspicious <Col N="703" /> minds if we suspect that this might be, indeed, a very shrewd and subtle way of gerrymandering and that even if this present Government did not do that, others might do so.  I believe I am correct in saying that this redrawing up of constituencies can only come once in 12 years.</P>

      <P>They might not have an opportunity to do it until the gong had sounded or was about to sound for the twelfth year.  Therefore, I do not think we are being unduly suspicious if we think it is a dangerous weapon to put in the hands of any political party in power, namely, that they can exercise this tolerance.  It is not right and it is not fair.  I think earlier I mentioned Ringsend, Irishtown, Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown, and so on.  Those are areas I know something about.  Out of the jumble and the changes which took place some years ago the Government Party emerged with several seats to the good by this mixing of the seats and the general drawing of the borders here which meant, at that particular time when people often voted in geographical pockets, that those people voted in many cases for the Government of the day, the Fianna Fáil Party.  That made a difference of two to three seats in the city of Dublin alone.  I cannot speak with any knowledge of other parts of the country but I have no reason to doubt but that here and there a few more seats were not picked up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would make a difference between putting in the Government or not putting in a Government with a very uneasy majority and putting in a Government with a workable majority. This particular Government at the moment started off with a very uneasy majority and by a strange combination of circumstances the majority is now not only workable but an easy majority. So, we are very suspicious that what has been called the hard-faced men who exist in Parties, the managers, the men who will say: &ldquo;Now look here, Mr. Minister, you may be a bit squeamish about this, but I want to <Col N="704" /> see you back again with a majority&rdquo; will not have things in such a way that this tolerance would be very liable to be misused.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear an earlier speaker&mdash;I think it must have been the Minister for External Affairs&mdash;talking about apathy.  Again, believe it or not, proportional representation was blamed for apathy: I do not know why.  I do not think the method of voting on a certain paper is going to make people apathetic.  I do not think it would.  Apathy in politics springs really from a sense of hopelessness and I do not think there is the least bit of danger of that under proportional representation.  In fact, it is, in my opinion, the exact opposite because you could certainly have, say, in a five-member constituency probably not less than ten people standing, or you could have up to 15&mdash;or any number you like&mdash;standing, but on the ballot paper you will see&mdash;in my constituency, say, ten to 12 or more people standing.  I have seen considerably more but that was in the days when we had a seven-member constituency.  I think it would not be wrong to say that the number of candidates presenting themselves for selection before an enraptured audience would be ten, certainly not less than 12.  Amongst those 12 you would find somebody who, by virtue of his charm or his or her looks, or for any of the reasons that bring constituents to the polls and make them vote for such persons, would be the political ideal, among 12 rather than if there were only one.</P>
    <P>I see the Minister smiling.  I imagine if I were the only Fine Gael person presenting myself, they would not come to me and I wonder would they come to the Minister if we were standing alone.</P>

      <P>At any rate, they are much more likely to be struck with apathy when coming along and running the risk of one person.  There is one of the grand old men of the Fianna Fáil Party and they even dared to turn against him on occasions. Imagine Deputy Corry from East Cork presenting himself from a single constituency.  Would they be more likely to rush and vote for a man of his undoubtedly wide experience than they would for one of some of the younger people of the Labour Party or Fine Gael who would be standing against him?</P>

      <P>The idea that suddenly the electorate will rush madly to vote for people in single member constituencies when they did not in fact exercise the graded choices they have in their own Party is ridiculous, even taking into account the other Parties when they had 12 to 15 to vote for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some figures <i>a propos</i> apathy which are very interesting and which I should like to give to the House.  This is right from the beginning of the State.  The first date I gave is the general election date and then the figure of the percentage who voted.  They are as follows: in 1922, 62 per cent; in 1923, 61 per cent; in 1927, two elections and the percentage was 68 and 69 respectively; in 1932, 77 per cent; in 1933, 81 per cent; in 1937, 76 per cent; in 1938, 79 per cent; in 1943, 74 per cent; and in 1944, a drop, when 68 per cent voted.  That was an election <Col N="706" /> which took place in January or February and there was snow.  In 1948, 74 per cent voted; in 1951, 75.3 per cent; in 1954, 76 per cent; in 1957, 71 per cent; in 1961, 70 per cent; in 1965, 75 per cent.  Except for 1933, the year in which 81 per cent voted, the year 1965 represented one of the highest percentages.</P>
    <P>From those figures of the various general elections, you can see that the charge of apathy does not stand.  There is no evidence that there is apathy. Seventy-five per cent of the people turned out almost three years ago and voted and they expressed their opinion in a very exceptional way, as they always do.  In fact, as the Minister present knows, and as all Deputies know, the days of the plumpers are long gone.  Practically nobody votes No. 1 now and then walks out.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the charge made by the Minister for External Affairs that apathy is something which happens only under the PR system.  I think I have shown there was no apathy in any election since the State was founded&mdash;not any single case of apathy, even in the election with the 62 per cent poll.  Therefore, the idea <Col N="707" /> that apathy would be swept away by the straight vote system is like the mystery of the empty house: there is nothing in it and thus there is no apathy to be swept away.  Of course, you can get somebody writing to the newspapers about it but you cannot substantiate it, with 75 per cent of the electorate voting.  Another charge is that deadwood would be got rid of in the various Parties.</P>

      <P>One associates that with a certain muscular rigidity which is more prevalent in the more advanced age groups.  Well, that idea that deadwood would be different, under straight voting, is not correct. Whether deadwood comes from age or from rigidity of outlook, and so on, it is not borne out by the figures.  It was said also that there would be a better type of candidate.  To say that is hardly a compliment to the Members of the present Dáil or to any Dáil.  We can all think of persons&mdash;but they are very few.  Quite seriously, often, when I meet somebody whom I considered perhaps as belonging to, shall we say, the deadwood type, I find that that person is anything but deadwood&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I find I took a very short and superficial view by judging them in the light way we all do, without knowing them.  I think this Dáil, and other Dála, has been extremely <Col N="711" /> well served by the Deputies who compose it.  Men and women have given of their time and their health and made all sort of sacrifices we know nothing of.  Their families have made sacrifices.  We know perfectly well that there is no financial future in being a Deputy.  Therefore, I would not accept that you can get a better type.  It probably was not meant in that way but it does carry the implication that, to get a better candidate, you ought to have a better type now.</P>
      <P>I have spoken at some length on this matter.  To sum up, I would say that no argument had seriously been put forward to show that proportional representation has in any way served us badly.  No figures have been given to show that, in fact, it has produced weak governments.  There have been very strong governments right from the beginning of this State.  Except once, when Fianna Fáil had 52 per cent, they were always minority governments.  That kept them on their toes. It introduced a degree of&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;civility in their relations.  Governments did not suffer from pride in office.  They were backed by no overwhelming majority of the electorate.  They had a minority and they knew that if they did not behave themselves they would not be elected again &mdash;and that went for the Opposition, too.</P>
      <P>No argument has been made or was dared to be put forward that this country has suffered from bad legislation, from a paucity of legislation or from indifference to legislative matters by virtue of proportional representation.  That argument has never been put forward and could not be put forward. We have had our laugh here about &ldquo;deadwood&rdquo;, &ldquo;apathy&rdquo;, and such words, but it was not seriously substantiated in any one way that this country has been anything but superbly served by its method of election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I paid tribute to successive Governments in that the minorities in this country, be they political or religious, were not in any way made to feel they were minorities and that they do not have to, and never did have to, express <Col N="712" /> themselves through Parliament&mdash;political minorities yes, might.  Certainly, I do not believe at all that this is necessary&mdash;strangely enough, for one of the reasons that it was put in for.  It shows me that people are often much bigger than the things they handle.  The Irish people have used proportional representation so fairly, so carefully, that, if ever this country is foolish enough to go off it, then this period&mdash;starting at 1922 and through which we are still living&mdash;will be pointed to as one of the glorious ages of Irish representation. I mean that, seriously.</P>
    <P>There is a wonderful history in this country but we are too close to it.  I happen to have a somewhat historical mind and therefore these things interest me.  I know that, when the history of this period is written&mdash;when the dust settles; when we are far enough away from it to see what happened&mdash;we shall see that Ireland had many great men in her Parliament in the first, call it 50 years, of her existence as a separate State.  Those great men, some of whom happily are still living, served their country and their Parliament superbly well in the legislation they introduced and the way in which the affairs of the Dáil were conducted.  Never mind the one or two minutes of outraged temper that break out now and again.  As somebody once said, the mistakes of a great man are like the momentary eclipses in the life of a star.  Flashes of temper happen in parliaments all over the world and they do not happen once a year in this Parliament.</P>
    <P>This Parliament has a very high prestige internationally and all of that prestige is due to the men who came here.  They probably came thanks to the PR system and we have been the gainers by that.  So I exhort the people who will be reading these things not to give up this very fine method of voting which we have.</P>

Let us be quite clear to start with that both the straight vote system and the PR system of election are British systems and are neither better nor worse for that.  Some Deputies speaking here try to make some play upon this.  One would think from the arguments they put up that the nationality of the system had some bearing on the virtues or otherwise of it.</P>
      <P>Opposition Deputies have asked why this issue of a referendum on PR should be raised only ten years since we last voted on it.  The answer to that, I suppose, is threefold: (1) because it is even more urgent and important now that we have a new and better system of election; (2) because it was so narrowly defeated on the last occasion that it is correct and proper that people who, perhaps, voted to retain the PR system the last time and who since have had an opportunity to think about it, should now be given another opportunity to consider the position.  I am convinced that many of those people who did vote to retain PR the last time will not be prepared to vote to retain it on this occasion.  The third reason, I would suggest, is that since that last occasion tens of thousands of young people have reached voting age and it is correct and fair that these young people who now constitute a substantial proportion of our electorate should be given the opportunity to express an opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should bear in our minds that the primary purpose of elections is to produce a government that can govern, and the secondary purpose is to produce an effective opposition which can provide an alternative government should the people in their wisdom so wish.  I believe that we have come to the end of an era in Irish politics.  It is now over 50 years since we had the 1916 Rebellion and the State was founded.  The strong leaders and forceful personalities and the nationally known names which have come down to us from that period have now largely left the stage of public life.  They have been replaced by new men, men who are in many ways more suitable to <Col N="714" /> deal with and to solve the different type of complex problems that we have in these days, men who are first class administrators but who can never hope to become the household names and the national heroes of the Rebellion period and Civil War years.  That period of our history is over.  It was a sad and unhappy period.  I, for one, do not regret the passing.  In any event, it has gone.</P>
    <P>The system of election used in those early days was the PR system.  In the Civil War years and in the years immediately following it, this was the most suitable system of election.  It provided that in a nation that was torn with dissensions, disorder, civil strife, minority groups would be adequately represented in parliament.  At a time when distrust was prevalent, it ensured that every section of the community had a voice in the nation's affairs. Because of the Civil War split between the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Parties and the polarisation this gave to public opinion, these two Parties largely dominated our Parliament and our public life.  That era is ending.  We are now faced with the prospect that no Party will receive an overall majority and that we will have a minority government and at the very time that we are faced with the new major problems which will arise inevitability because of our joining the EEC, when we are as never before in need of a strong government which can negotiate on our part from a position of security in office, we are faced with the awful possibility of having weak minority governments.  Anybody who has any regard for the future wellbeing of the nation could not stand by idly and allow this situation to arise.  Certainly, I do not intend to do so.</P>
    <P>The method proposed in the Bill before us is the straight vote and the single-seat system.  Personally, I am 100 per cent behind the single-seat constituency.  As the Minister for Local Government said yesterday, I am less concerned with the exact method of voting.  I would prefer the straight vote, if there were a choice, but whether it is the straight vote or the alternative vote is something which I <Col N="715" /> would not at this stage be prepared to divide the country on.  I would be quite prepared to accept one method or the other.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies have raised several arguments for keeping PR. None of them, to my way of thinking, was terribly convincing.  They have argued that PR gave us stability in the past and therefore should be retained. We are not here to legislate for the past.  We are here to legislate for the future.  It is the future stability which causes me concern.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe in a two-Party system of government.  Then you have Government and an alternative Government.  If the day should come when the people, for any reason, decide that the Government they have are not suitable, the Government are relatively easily put out of office.  At the moment, under the PR system this is not so.  We have two weak Opposition Parties.  I do not mean weak in any derogatory sense but weak in numbers as compared with the Government.  They refuse to coalesce and, quite obviously, each is incapable of forming a Government and taking office on their own.</P>
    <P>If we look back, we find that Fine Gael have not won an election since 1927.  They were dropping in numbers and only for the shot in the arm which the Coalition period gave them, they would probably now be the smallest Party in the House.  The Labour Party, although they have much promise before them, quite obviously hope and expect to take over office in a few years, but they have yet to win an election.  Despite this, we have had Opposition speakers talking about political stagnation, and this, from a Party who have not won an election for 41 years&mdash;since before I was born &mdash;and a Party who have yet to win an election, has overtones of heavy humour about it.</P>
    <P>In the last election, Fianna Fáil obtained about 48 per cent of the votes, which means that the Opposition Parties must have obtained 52 per cent.  Under a two-Party system, Fianna Fáil would have been out of office and a new Government would <Col N="716" /> have been formed, and this is as it should be.  What has happened is that Fianna Fáil were again returned to office and we have a rigged system which keeps the Opposition Parties in comfortable Opposition, safe in the knowledge that they can promise anything they like to the electorate and will never be in office in the foreseeable future.  We have a rigged system which threatens to keep the Government in office <i>ad infinitum,</i> a rigged system which allows the people no choice, but this is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I have listened to Opposition Deputies talking sanctimoniously about their principles, their principles and their principles.  What motivated a great number of the Opposition Deputies is not so much their principles as the comfortable position an Opposition Deputy in Dáil Éireann occupies.  They have their Dáil salaries and their comfortable status symbols and this quite obviously has motivated a number of Deputies in this debate.  I would think that they are far less concerned with the efficiency and method of government than with their own personal positions.  It is not unfair to say the plain fact is that when we have a choice of more than two Parties we have no choice at all.  The system of Government in office, and an Opposition, only works when you have the two-Party system.  Anyone who says otherwise is either fooling himself or trying to fool the people.  The fact that Fianna Fáil have been in office for so long is adequate proof of that.</P>
    <P>Under the PR system, there is no real hope of changing the Government. We may weaken them, we may necessitate frequent elections, but the odds are in favour of the big battalions and the strong men, and whether they are in the minority or whether they are out of office for a short period, the odds are that they are going to get back. We had this demonstrated during the 1930s and the early 1940s and I do not think this is particularly good for the State.  In business, there is a maxim that competition is the life of trade, and this should also apply to politics. No Government, and I am not particularly condemning the present Government, should feel that they cannot <Col N="717" /> be removed from office.  No Opposition Party should be so long in opposition that they grow lazy and lose the will to rule.  This is what happened here and this is what I suggest we should change by changing the system of election.  By doing so, we would remove the apathy which I believe exists in public life by giving the Opposition Party the hope that if they produce some constructive policy or reasonable alternative, and if the Government are as bad as they make them out to be, and the people decide there is an alternative, they can elect them.</P>
    <P>At the moment I know, and other Deputies know, as well as everybody in the country, that there is no alternative to Fianna Fáil.  While we have two-Party Opposition, this is the way it will continue.  Under the two-Party system, one or other of the present Opposition Parties would become the Opposition Party.  Whether it would be the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party, I do not pretend to be able to forecast, and I do not particularly care.  It may well be that the two Parties will undergo some form of amalgamation and obviously this will not be palatable to all Members and some may tend to drift in another direction.  This would seem to be the logical thing, to have Government and Opposition, and this must ultimately come about.  This is what I should like to see happening now.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that I am supporting the single-seat constituency. The Government have been accused of being power mad in introducing this Bill.  I do not accept this view.  As an Independent Deputy, I cannot be accused of being power mad, or of trying to coerce the public; I am trying to use what little influence I have to bring about this change.  It is not unnatural that Deputies should be influenced by their own positions but recently I put myself in the position in which my political life span may not be long.</P>
    <P>However, I did something with my eyes open and I do not regret it and now I do not intend to do anything less.  The PR system would probably suit me much better than the single seat method but at this stage of my career, <Col N="718" /> I feel that either I am in public life or I am not.  I would certainly like to remain in public life but not at any price.  It must be on terms which I find acceptable.  I would like to stay on if I had anything to contribute to the running of the country and the making of laws, but if I am not returned to office at a future election, there are bigger things in life to be considered and I do not intend that any petty personal problems shall influence me one way or another.</P>
    <P>There were several arguments made here by Deputies on which I should like to comment.  Deputy Dillon suggested that anyone who supported Fianna Fáil was &ldquo;selling his soul for penny rolls and lumps of hairy bacon.&rdquo; This is one of Deputy Dillon's better phrases.  Whenever I think of Deputy Dillon, the penny rolls and lumps of hairy bacon come to mind, but he himself supported Fianna Fáil in 1932 when he helped my late father to put them in office.  Today Deputy Dillon's soul seems intact, and I am sure my late father's was.  There were many issues on which my late father supported the Fianna Fáil Party, if he was convinced it was in the interests of the people he represented, the plain people of Ireland, to do so.  In this I intend to follow his example.  If I am convinced, as on this occasion, that the correct thing to do for the people is to support the more efficient system of election, then I will do so.  I certainly do not feel that because, like Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Flanagan and other prominent members of Fine Gael, I am convinced of the superiority of the single-seat method, my soul is in any danger, nor do I particularly feel like a South American dictator either.  Neither do I accept the suggestion that the present Bill is designed to wipe out the Labour Party.  I do not believe that will happen.  I do not want it to happen and I do not think the Labour Party think it will happen. These statements were made obviously to frighten the Labour Party into coalition with the Fine Gael Party, and have overtones of more penny rolls and more lumps of hairy bacon, but I do not think the Labour Party are likely to be frightened by these things. <Col N="719" /> The Labour Party have had their political ups and downs.  They have had their bright spots and they have had their dull days.  They have survived.  They have a place in the political life of this country.  They represent a section of political thought that should be represented, but I do not think they have any divine right to be automatically returned to office.  I do not think they have any more reason to be represented here than the farmers have, for example.  If they have support in the country they will get votes and, if they get the votes, they will win the seats.  That is as it should be.  That is how it will be.  Nobody will be happier than I to see the Labour Deputies returned here, but I do not think there is any automatic right on the part of any section of the community to be represented here.</P>
    <P>Because of the, perhaps, slightly abrasive things I said about Deputy Dillon, I want to assure the House that I personally have a very high regard, and even affection, for Deputy Dillon. His presence in this House is like the bubble in champagne.  If he were gone from the House, a great deal of the sparkle would go with him.  To listen to him speak is an experience, particularly for younger Deputies like myself.  His eloquence is, as we all know, renowned.  I always feel it is a privilege to listen to him.  He is a man whom I have always admired.  Perhaps I have been influenced to some extent by the complimentary things my father used to say about Deputy Dillon in the Coalition days, but I have a high regard for him.  I cherish some grievances against him, but that does not detract from my affection and admiration for him.  His eloquence is like the bouquet of some exotic perfume, to be inhaled and enjoyed, but not necessarily swallowed.</P>
    <P>Another argument put forward against the proposed referendum is that we should not hold a referendum at this particular time because it will cost an immense amount of money.  If we were to accept this line of argument, we would never hold a referendum because there will never come a time in our lives in which there will not be <Col N="720" /> something on which one could more usefully spend the money for some section of the community in need of money.  We will always be in the position in which we could more usefully spend such money on something other than a referendum.  But that is hardly a valid argument for not consulting the people.  Deputies have said that we should have a system like that in Switzerland where the people are consulted more frequently.  But it has become fashionable now to condemn the proposed referendum because it will cost money.  Deputies are being either unrealistic or slightly evasive, shall I say, in not making up their minds.  One either believes in a referendum or one does not and, if one does not, then the referendum article should be deleted from the Constitution. While it is there, one must use it.  If Deputies do not want to use it, then they should say so.  One is either for or against.  I am for.  The people have a right to be consulted.  Cost regrettably is one of the factors in public life.  One cannot run a country on a shoestring. One must spend money when that expenditure is necessary.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies &mdash; Deputy Corish, Deputy S. Dunne and Deputy Treacy &mdash;spoke about the necessity of offering the people a choice of candidates in the same Party.  A great deal of argument was evolved about the two candidates one of whom might be less desirable than the other, and the people should have the right to choose between the two.  It is an interesting fact that, in the last general election, of the 38 constituencies, in only six did the Labour Party offer a choice of candidates.  In the other 32, there was no choice.  In four, there was no Labour man at all.  In 28, there was one Labour candidate and no choice. In that situation, I scarcely think that the argument advanced now is very convincing.  I do not like to use the word &rdquo;sincere&rdquo; because Deputy Dunne is listening to me, but the argument is certainly not convincing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some rather far-fetched situations adumbrated, in which one could have three candidates and one would get 35 per cent of the votes, another 34 per cent and another 31 per cent, and a Government could be returned everywhere in the country by 35 per cent of the electorate.  Where you have five or six candidates, as we have at the moment in Wicklow, that situation would be still further aggravated.  This argument could be advanced to absurdity, to the point at which, if you had 98 candidates and 97 each received one per cent, the Government would win with three per cent.  But these are childish and impracticable arguments. I do not believe they will carry weight with the people.  In a two-Party system, that situation would not arise. It would be Government and Opposition and there would be no question of the Government winning with a minority.  They would have to have more than half the voting strength.</P>
      <P>There were other interesting debating points made.  I have not time to go into them all, but some Opposition Deputy suggested there was no popular demand for the referendum and it should not, therefore, be held.  Does anybody seriously think that is a valid reason for not holding a referendum? Let us face it.  When Moses got the Ten Commandments, he did not get them as a result of popular agitation. Quite the contrary.</P>

      <P>Quite so.  Deputy Dockrell is rebuked.  But had Moses to win a referendum to get the Ten Commandments, he would not have got them and I do not think anyone will seriously suggest they were not necessary.  Reform is usually brought about by a small number who see the ill and want to cure it.  Reform seldom, if ever, comes as a result of popular agitation.</P>
      <P>Deputy M. J. O'Higgins suggested it would be difficult for a constituent to approach a Deputy if that Deputy were not of the Party the constituent supported.  I do not accept that, because Opposition Deputies&mdash;I have had experience of this&mdash;have no difficulty in approaching Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries about problems affecting their constituents.  I have always been received by Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries with courtesy and they have done what they could for me and my constituents.</P>
